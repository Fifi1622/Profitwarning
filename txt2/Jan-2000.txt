 State targets drug costs

 Tired of waiting on Congress, Florida and other states are trying to help seniors cope with rising prescription prices.   Margaret Hiller figured she would do a little comparison shopping last October while visiting Buenos Aires. The target of her quest? A prescription drug called Amiodarone that controls her heart's arrhythmia.   When she buys the drug stateside, Hiller usually pays $2.18 for each tablet. But she found the same drug from the same manufacturer for 27 cents per tablet in Argentina. She loaded up with a 10-month supply and saved almost $600 - more than the cost of her plane ticket. Hiller, a 69-year-old Spring Hill retiree, is not lacking for creature comforts. But she worries about senior citizens who can't afford the drugs that keep them healthy. As a nurse in western New York a few years ago, she had patients who cut their pills in half because Medicare wouldn't pay for drugs. 

    "I feel so sorry for senior citizens who are dependent on Social Security, like my mother, or people on extremely limited income," she said. "In a country like ours, it's disgraceful that we can't find the money."   Experiences like these, repeated thousands of times around the country, are fueling a growing political consensus that something must be done about seniors and drugs. Even "Flo," the silver-haired dynamo of pharmaceutical industry television commercials, has stopped warning about government intrusion into our medicine cabinets. Instead, she sweetly touts universal coverage.   Now Florida legislators have taken up the drumbeat.   A bill filed in the House this month would: Spend up to $40-million to help low-income seniors pay for their drugs.     Lump the Medicaid program, prisons, state employee insurance fund and other agencies into a wholesale buying consortium, which would negotiate deep discounts from manufacturers. A study commission would then look for ways to let seniors buy into this consortium.     Require that pharmacies selling at a discount to Florida's 1.5-million Medicaid recipients offer that same discount to everyone on Medicare. State officials estimate savings of up to 15 percent.   The elderly "are a huge segment of our population. We can't turn our backs on them," says co-sponsor Rep. Johnnie B. Byrd, a Plant City Republican who is majority whip and in line to be speaker of the House in two years. "Choosing between prescriptions and eating is just not the way it ought to be in 20th century Florida."   Until recently, drug coverage for seniors has largely been viewed as a federal issue. When Medicare was designed in the 1960s to provide health care for the elderly and disabled, it focused on hospitalization and doctor visits. Many of the wonder drugs that now extend people's lives were not yet invented. So Medicare left people to pay for their own drugs.   Now, with drug costs rising rapidly, seniors are spending an average of 20 percent of their income on health care, according to an AARP survey. That's more than they paid before Medicare got started.   With Congress resisting attempts to revamp Medicare, some state governments are seeking remedies of their own.   Seventeen states now provide some kind of drug subsidy to low-income seniors, often using lottery or tobacco settlement money.   Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts are discussing a bulk-buying coalition. There was even talk of state- run bus expeditions across the Canadian border so New Englanders could fill up on cheaper prescriptions. But FDA rules against importing foreign drugs squelched that idea.   California came up with the Medicaid-Medicare connection that Florida and several other states are now exploring.   Medicaid, a federal-state health insurance program for the poorest of the poor, has always paid for drugs. Like HMOs and other big insurance plans, states typically demand discounts before they will reimburse pharmacies for Medicaid patients.   This week, California begins a new program. Pharmacies that sell to Medi-Cal (California's version of Medicaid) must offer the same discount to anyone with a Medicare card.   "The beauty of the law is that we didn't create a bureaucracy, and it comes at virtually no cost to the state," said Sen. Jackie Speier, the law's creator.   Elderly volunteers who lobbied for the law compared their retail drug prices with the Medi-Cal price and came up with savings ranging from 10 percent to 40 percent, Speier said.   During debate on the law, she said, the pharmacy industry stayed on the sidelines. Already losing business to the Internet or from people going to Mexico, the industry figured that the discount might bring in business from seniors who will buy toothpaste or toilet paper along the way.   The California model is spreading to other states. Besides Florida, Wisconsin and Minnesota have introduced similar legislation. Lawmakers from at least six other states have made inquiries, Speier said.   Rep. Nancy Argenziano, a Dunnellon Republican who is chairwoman of Florida's House Elder Affairs Committee, is co- sponsoring the drug bill with Byrd. She said House leadership has given her positive signals that some kind of drug reform will pass this year.   The economy is strong. The state is running a surplus. And Medicare HMOs, which once provided a haven for seniors with heavy drug needs, are either pulling out of Florida or cutting way back on drug coverage.   "It's pretty hard to eat your lunch every day knowing there are people out there who can't afford their medications," Argenziano said.   Florida Medicaid pays pharmacies a little bit more than what drug manufacturers charge wholesalers. For many drugs, this Medicaid reimbursement rate is very close to what pharmacies have to pay the wholesaler.   At the request of Argenziano's committee, the state Medicaid office tried to estimate the savings that Florida's 2.8-million Medicare beneficiaries could expect under the Medicaid-Medicare tie-in. Though many have some drug coverage through retirement plans, private insurance or Medicare HMOs, those benefits are usually limited.   Staff members called four drugstore chains in 15 cities and collected prices for 20 prescriptions commonly used by elderly. The combined retail cost for these drugs was $838.03, more than $109 over the Medicaid rate. Although those figures represent a collective savings of 15 percent, Jerry Wells, Medicaid's pharmacy program director, cautioned that the price differences varied widely depending on the drug and where someone buys it.   For example, stores often sell the heart medicine Lanoxin below cost to attract customers. The average retail price in the survey was actually $1.47 less than the $9.09 that Medicaid ordinarily would pay according to its formula. (If the retail rate is lower than the Medicaid rate, Medicaid pays the retail rate.) Prilosec, a common ulcer drug, retailed at $115, only $3.89 more than the Medicaid rate.   At the other end of spectrum, generic Zantac, another ulcer drug, went for $46 retail - $25 higher than the Medicaid rate.   Foreseeing opposition from the pharmacy lobby, the Elder Affairs committee already is marshalling numbers for fallback positions. Wells also was asked to estimate savings if the bill required the pharmacists to sell at the Medicaid rate plus 2 1/2 percent or the Medicaid rate plus 5 percent.   Pharmacists, who are just learning details of the bill, are concerned.   "Our profit margins are very small. This would just decrease them more. We only make 3 cents on every sale dollar," said Michael Polzin, spokesman for Walgreen Company. "The retailer shouldn't be absorbing all the costs of reducing health care costs."   Studies show that pharmaceutical manufacturers, not the retailer, are the cause of high drug prices, Eckerd Corp. said in a prepared statement. Eckerd runs a pharmacy profit margin of about 2 percent on sales, compared to 29.7 percent for the pharmaceutical industry, the statement said.   "The federal government should solve this problem because it can examine all aspects of what is contributing to rapidly escalating prescription drug costs and create a fair system that doesn't harm local community pharmacy businesses."   Wells said he heard another concern while talking to pharmacists: They often sell common drugs at cost or below-cost because they make a killing on some of the less common drugs. If they have to charge the Medicaid rate for all drugs, such pricing may have to go.- Researcher Kitty Bennett contributed to this report, which also includes information from the New York Times.

 THE BIGGEST BOOM Series: THE BIGGEST BOOM

 The U.S. economy roars into its 107th month of continuous growth Tuesday, breaking the 106-month milestone set from February 1961 until December 1969.   Barring calamity, the record expansion should continue for months, possibly even years, experts say. They credit a remarkable mix of economic fuels at work: rapid technology innovation and rising worker productivity. Low interest rates and low inflation. An unprecedented pace of investment and participation in the stock markets. Record consumer confidence. A rising global embrace of capitalism.   "Consumers have every reason to be optimistic," says economist Mark Zandi at Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "There is just nothing going wrong."    If all this euphoria makes Pollyanna sound cynical, consider this. Since the current U.S. expansion started in March 1991, it has been one rich ride. More wealth was created in this country in the 1990s than in any other decade. 

  More jobs (20-million) were created than in any similar period. And more people indulged in larger homes, bigger SUVs and more conspicuous consumption than ever before in U.S. history. After so many heady years, don't forget that the world in 1991 was very different. The country was struggling out of a recession marked by bank failures and collapsed real estate markets. The country, led by someone named Bush, was in the process of winning the one-sided Persian Gulf War. Dances with Wolves won the Academy Award for best picture. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers went 3-13.   Since then, more has changed than the Bucs: 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1999 at 11,497.12. That's 3.6 times higher than the Dow's 1991 closing of 3,168.83. 

 In 1999, Bill Gates was the world's wealthiest person with a net worth of more than $85-billion. In 1991, Gates did not even qualify as America's wealthiest. (John Werner Kluge of Metromedia Co. did, with a mere $5.9-billion.) 

 In 1999, the word "Internet" appeared in 3,299 St. Petersburg Times stories, an average of nine a day. In 1991, Internet did not appear in a single story.   At least one thing stayed the same: the urge to be rich. In 1991, Wheel of Fortune was the most popular game show on television. Now that spot is held by Who Wants to be a Millionaire?   Still, amid today's bounty, all is not perfect.   Some companies whose futures seemed limitless in the 1990s have recently stumbled, and this hypercharged market reacts fiercely against those that do.   In Tampa, tech support company Sykes Enterprises last week saw its market value drop in half, by $1-billion, in a single day after it failed to meet earnings expectations. Other blue-chip companies like Xerox Corp. are struggling to adjust to fast-changing markets and suffering the blows of competition. Xerox shares traded in the $60s last summer. Now they trade in the $20s.   Coca-Cola's decision last Wednesday to cut 6,000 jobs, one-fifth of its work force, so stunned its business-worshiping hometown of Atlanta that the city's newspaper ran a cartoon of Coke's trademark polar bear in a bar irately demanding a "rum and Pepsi."   Accustomed to traditional boom-bust cycles, investors still seem bewildered by their collective handiwork, awarding extraordinary market values to thousands of young Internet companies born in the 1990s. Most "dot- coms" have yet to post a profit.   How can upstart America Online manage to buy giant, diversified Time Warner Inc. for $145-billion? Why is profitless Amazon.com worth $21-billion in the stock market, more than the combined value of seven of Tampa Bay's established and profitable corporate heavyweights - Jabil Circuit, Florida Progress, TECO Energy, Tech Data, Outback Steakhouse, Raymond James Financial and Lincare Holdings?   One of the leaders most responsible for the record expansion, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, worries constantly that the U.S. economy is running too hot. On Friday, the government reported the economy grew at a surprisingly strong 5.8 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter of 1999. To brake - but not stall - the economic engine, the Fed is expected to raise interest rates this week by as much as half a percentage point.   A constant concern is inflation, characterized by fast-rising prices that erode buying power. The Fed and some economists say renewed pressures on prices - especially higher wages paid by companies competing for new workers - could reignite inflation.   Oil prices also are rising. A past harbinger of economic trouble, oil was as low as $11 a barrel at the end of 1998. It is now $28. To consumers, that means the price for gasoline is the highest since the Energy Department began tracking weekly motor fuel prices in 1991, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.   While the economic boom enriched investors in the stock market, it did not reach everyone. The poor and portions of the middle class got poorer while the very rich got a whole lot richer. From 1995 to 1998, the average net worth of families with incomes of at least $100,000 jumped to $1.7-million from $1.3-million, thanks largely to the stock market's surge, says the Federal Reserve. But the net worth of families with incomes less than $10,000 shrank from 1991 to 1998.   In the grand economic scene, few of these concerns deter the optimism of analysts. Most see no serious near-term threat to this extraordinary nine-year boom. Tampa's Gordon Tunstall helped find financing for start-up companies long before the current expansion began. He says the economy's 107- month run began with the explosive growth of mutual funds.   Falling interest rates in the early 1990s prompted consumers to pull their money out of certificates of deposit and seek higher returns in mutual funds. The rising popularity of 401(k) savings plans also fed the mutual fund fever. As billions poured into mutual funds, the funds in turn invested in corporations, smaller companies and initial public offerings.   The wealth boom of the 1990s hooked consumers on higher returns and made many far less sensitive to market risks. "The average consumer is now a mutual fund junkie," Tunstall says. Other market watchers speak increasingly about an economy transformed by technology, especially the Internet, which has enabled new businesses to proliferate and made existing businesses more efficient.   "We are watching the evolution of the old economy into the new economy," says Geoffrey A. Simon, senior vice president of investments at the Robert W. Baird & Co. investment firm in Tampa. Globally, the expansion coincided with the decline of communism and growing acceptance of capitalism. That fundamental shift is creating new competition but also new markets for U.S. goods and services, says Simon.   Even the federal government has managed to contribute to the economic boom. The large surplus in the federal budget promises to lower taxes and diminish the national debt - two actions that will help foster lower interest rates and inflation.   Can this expansion go on forever?   No one is willing just yet to suggest the U.S. economy has eliminated the cycle of recession, when the economy stops growing or even shrinks. Simon says recessions are the economy's way to clear excesses built up during the good times.   But Bank of America economist Lynn Reaser says none of the warning signs - a serious threat of higher inflation or a rapid rise in interest rates - are here.   Besides, Reaser adds, the economy has only begun to tap the opportunities of the Internet, new telecommunications services and other advances no one has yet to grasp.   "At this point," Reaser says, "we are only in the early stages of a major boom in technology."A longer boom than you thinkA lot has changed since economic expansion started in 1991. For instance, in '91 the term "Internet" wasn't mentioned in this newspaper. In 1999, it appeared in 3,299 stories. Here are some more examples:America's wealthiest person:1991: John Werner Kluge, founder of Metromedia Co., $5.9- billion1999: Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft Corp., $85- billionWhere the Dow stood at year's end:1991: 3,168.83 - up 20.3 percent1999: 11,497.12 - up 25.2 percentHow the Tampa Bay Buccaneers fared:1991: 3-13.1999: 11-5.Number of Times stories that referred to "recession":1991: 1,9011999: 200Top TV show:1991: Cheers1999: ERAcademy award winner for best picture:1991: Dances With Wolves1999: Shakespeare in LoveCost of a 30-second ad during Super Bowl:1991: $801,2502000: $2.2-millionNumber Times stories that used the term "sport utility vehicle":1991: 21999: 164

 Nasdaq, DJIA close slightly lower after volatile trade

 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (AFP) - The Nasdaq closed lower Thursday, down 30.35 points, or 0.75 percent, at 4,039.56, while the DJIA ended 4.97 points, or 0.05 percent, lower at 11,028.02 after volatile trade. 

 The Standard and Poor's 500 ended down 5.53 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,398.56 points. 

 On the bond market, average yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond eased to 6.525 percent, down from 6.568 percent Wednesday. Dealers said a 0.25 percentage point rate hike at the next Federal Reserve meeting on February 1 and 2 had already been largely priced in. 

 Sentiment on the hi-tech heavy Nasdaq exchange was dampened by a profit-warning from PC manufacturer Dell, which said its fourth- quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street estimates. There were also disappointing fourth-quarter results from on-line toy seller eToys. 

 Dell ended 2-13/16 lower at 37-9/16 dollars, and eToys tumbled more than 20 percent to end 4-3/8 down at 16-7/8. 

 Trade was volatile in the second part of the session, and a sharp sell-off began in the last hour of trade, only to be reversed as share prices, especially among DJIA components, staged a minor rally shortly before the close. 

 Some dealers pinned the volatility on 'day traders,' operating within the time horizon of a single session. 

 Volume of trade was heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, where some 1.2 billion shares changed hands, while on Nasdaq almost 1.8 billion shares were traded, with Dell alone accounting for more than 127 million shares traded. 

 GTE and Kellogg announced fourth quarter figures largely in line with analysts' expectations. GTE added 5/8 to 68-5/8 dollars, while Kellogg ended the day 5/16 lower at 24-1/2. 

 Eli Lilly gained 1-1/2 to 64-1/4 dollars on the back of its results announcement, while Dow Chemical ended 2-3/16 lower at 119-1/ 16 dollars, its strong results announcement having been widely expected, dealers said.

Another consumer giant, however, fared less well. Profits at Gillette fell 20 percent as problems overseas nicked the largest maker of razor blades. Online car company  Autobytel.com reported a smaller loss than expected for its quarter.   

And just a day after  Coca-Cola announced a large scale layoff,  Lockheed Martin says it is cutting 2,800 jobs. It's part of an effort to cut costs and streamline operations.   

Speaking of costs, business travelers increasingly pay up. A new study finds in major cities, such as Boston and New York, costs more than doubled for food and lodging since 1986.

 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared their gains by midday Thursday in choppy trading marked by a struggle between strong earnings and continued chatter about interest rates. 

 "The market clearly has been momentum-driven," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. "But I'm not certain that we can really point to one event or a sequence of events creating this volatility. 

 "Today there are good feelings in the air. Earnings have been better than expected and all of this I think helps, but next week the market will take a quick dose of reality when the Fed meets," he said. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40 points, or 0.36 percent, to 11,073, boosted by top technology names and interest-rate-sensitive financials. 

 Tech leaders also helped buoy the Nasdaq composite index, up 20 points, or 0.50 percent, to 4,090 after climbing more than 1.5 percent earlier in the session. 

 Technology bellwethers led the Dow higher and helped Nasdaq, with Hewlett-Packard Co. up 2-9/16 at 111-5/16, Intel Corp. up 2-5/8 at 99-1/8 and Microsoft Corp. up 1/4 at 99-5/8. 

 Computing giant H-P said late Wednesday that its first-quarter and full-year earnings and revenue growth was on track as sales of home computers and laptops remained robust. 

 That helped offset investors' Dell-induced fears, sparked after the personal computer maker issued a profit warning for the second quarter in a row. Dell Computer Corp. was the most actively traded stock on Nasdaq, off 1-1/8 at 39-1/4 after falling below 37 in pre-market trading. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 3.81 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,407.89. 

 Market watchers said stocks got an initial jolt when Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. market strategist, pegged the widely watched S&P 500 as gaining 8 percent to 10 percent this year. 

 Breadth was positive as advancing stocks edged out declines by 1,521 to 1,260 with more than 546 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. On Nasdaq, 2,005 stocks headed higher, compared with 1,765 that were beat back on volume of 892.5 million. 

 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond, closely in focus in light of expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, was up 3/32 to yield 6.56 percent after closing on Wednesday with a yield of 6.57 percent. 

 "There is starting to be a little sense or belief that maybe interest rates are close to peaking," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc., noting interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks have pushed higher on those hopes. 

 Financial stocks gained by midday and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's bank index rose 1.02 percent, or 7.70 points to 761.66. American-Express Co. jumped 3-3/16 to 162-11/16, J.P. Morgan & Co. rose 1-1/8 to 124-1/2 and Citigroup rose 3/8 to 58-5/16. 

 Knight/Trimark Group Inc., which buys and sells shares of 7,400 companies as a market maker, regained 1 to trade at 31-3/4 after slipping during the previous two trading sessions. 

 John Hancock Financial Services Inc. was the most active stock on the Big Board, gaining 1 to 18 on its first day of trade. The life insurer held the largest IPO so far this year, raising $1.7 billion by offering 102 million shares at $17 a share. 

 Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. dropped 2-1/4 to 59-11/16 as analysts estimated that the world's largest retailer was gaining ground in its push into Germany, but at high cost. Analysts estimated Wal-Mart's 1999 losses in Germany at $30 million to $75 million. 

 Among companies reporting earnings on Thursday, The St. Paul Companies, the nation's 10th largest property-casualty insurer, fell 1-5/16 to 31-1/16 after posting a 21 percent increase in fourth-quarter profits that still missed Wall Street's targets. 

 St. Paul's chief executive also said he expected any operating earnings growth in 2000 to be modest. 

 Home appliances maker Maytag Corp. rose 1-13/16 to 41-14/16 after topping analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates with a 4 percent rise in profits. 

 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Co., the nation's second-largest cigarette maker, said quarterly profits dropped 50 percent, in line with estimates. RJR shares eased 3/8 to 18-1/8. 

 In economic news, December durable goods orders surged 4.1 percent, far stronger than the 0.8 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists, bringing the advance for all of 1999 to 7.1 percent, compared with 3.6 percent in 1998. 

 New jobless claims for the week ended Jan. 21 rose slightly from a 26-year low set the previous week. The Labour Department said a scant 266,000 Americans filed first-time claims for state jobless benefits.

 U.S. stocks end down - Dell warning hurts techs.

 NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished slightly lower on Thursday as Dell Computer Corp. became the latest technology star to warn about its future, raising doubts about valuations amid anxiety about how high interest rates could go. 

 Wall Street was also bracing for Friday's release of the fourth-quarter Employment Cost Index, a key measure of wage inflation, for further clues about how much the Federal Reserve could hike borrowing costs when it meets next week. On Friday, the government also will release data on fourth-quarter U.S. Gross Domestic Product. 

 "I just think the markets are really uneasy ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan," said Peggy Farley, president and chief executive officer of Ascent/Meredith Asset Management Inc. "Dell is the No. 1 concern in terms of profit warnings. Dell is sort of a bellwether and if they are warning, so may everyone else, is the concern.' 

 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.97 points, or 0.05 percent, to 11,028.02, dragged down by computer maker International Business Machines Corp., off 3-5/16 at 113-9/16. 

 The 30-stock index was also hurt by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which dropped 2-9/16 to 59-3/8, as analysts estimated that the world's largest retailer was gaining ground in its push into Germany, but at high cost. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 5.53 points, or 0.39 percent at 1,398.56. 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index eased 30.35 points, or 0.75 percent, to 4,039.56, marking its second day of losses. 

 The Nasdaq's fall came after Dell, the No. 1 U.S. personal computer maker, for the second quarter in a row warned about profits and revenues, sending its shares down 2-13/16 to 37-9/16. It was the top mover on the Nasdaq. 

 There was confusion on Wall Street, however, over what to make of the Dell warning, with a number of analysts issuing reports that remained bullish on the stock. 

 "I think the Dell news was a disappointment," said Rick Meckler, senior managing director at Liberty View in Jersey City, N.J. "People once again are wondering whether the price-to-earnings ratio for technology stocks is too high for that sector." 

 Some of the downturn in the Nasdaq was countered by Conexant Systems Inc., which climbed 13-4/16 to 87-9/16 after the maker of chips used for highs-speed communications said it would join the Standard and Poor's 500 index. 

 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond was up 20/32, with the yield falling to 6.52 percent from Wednesday's close of 6.57 percent, as the bond market awaited the release Friday of the employment cost index. 

 A consensus on Wall Street has emerged that the Fed will raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points when its rate-setting committee meets on Tuesday and Wednesday. But some are still fearful the central bank could hike rates by a more aggressive 50 basis points to stave off inflation. 

 In the broader market, declines edged out advances 15 to 14 with about 1.12 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 41 stocks at new highs while 122 made new lows. 

 Thursday was largely the triumph of "old school" stocks over new technology ones with car makers, building materials, oil companies and gold stocks up, while computer hardware firms, Internet stocks, transportation companies and biotech issues fell. 

 But banking stocks managed to move ahead as the long bond strengthened, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's bank index up 1.63 percent. 

 Among the Dow components, American Express Co. rose 3-7/16 to 162-15/16, J.P. Morgan & Co. increased 2-1/4 to 125-5/8 and Citigroup advanced 1-1/16 to 59. 

 John Hancock Financial Services Inc. was the most active stock on the Big Board, gaining 5/8 to 17-5/8 in its first day of trade. The life insurer held the largest IPO so far this year, raising $1.7 billion by offering 102 million shares at $17 a share. 

 Nasdaq darling Qualcomm Inc., a mobile phone technology company, slid 6-1/8 to 120 after a warning about slackening shipments. However, Credit Suisse First Boston said it was maintaining its "buy" rating on the stock. 

 TheStreet.com's Internet index was off 0.43 percent. 

 Among stocks in the news, Lockheed Martin Corp. slipped 5/8 to 19-7/16 after the aerospace and defence company said it would cut 2,800 jobs. 

 General Motors Corp., the world's No. 1 automaker and a Dow component, advanced 4-3/16 to 82-3/4 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the stock. 

 Home appliances maker Maytag Corp. rose 1-3/16 to 41-3/16 after topping analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates with a 4 percent rise in profits. 

 Shares of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Co., parent of the nation's second-largest cigarette maker, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., rose 1/16 to 18-9/16 after reporting profits dropped almost 50 percent, in line with estimates. 

 In economic news, December durable goods orders surged 4.1 percent, far stronger than the rise of 0.8 percent that was forecast by Wall Street economists, bringing the advance for all of 1999 to 7.1 percent, compared with 3.6 percent in 1998. 

 Although analysts said the news did not rattle the markets, it did suggest the economy shows no signs of cooling off.

 CHICAGO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures slipped after setting a session high at the opening Thursday but regained ground to set new daily highs a half hour into the session, traders said. 

 Selling by two large U.S. dealers prompted follow-through local selling that quickly brought March S&P 500 futures off the initial session high of 1425.50. Contracts then regained ground. 

 "We took out Tuesday's high (of 1425.00) by 50 cents. That's key," said one S&P 500 trader on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 

 "Technically, in the big picture the trend is still slightly down unless we break 1426," the trader said. 

 March S&Ps broke above the 1426 level, but little follow-through buying emerged initially. 

 Some said the nearby S&P 500s could remain within a range after the relatively quiet session Wednesday, staying between support at roughly 1411 to 1412 and resistance near near the 1426 area. 

 Further resistance is evident at the 50-day moving average at 1444.50 in the March S&P contract. 

 If support is broken, the nearby S&P contract could move down to 1380 to 1375, although it is likely to encounter some support near the 1405 to 1403.70 area, traders said. 

 Nasdaq 100 stock index also surged briefly at the opening in a consolidation after declines Wednesday. Traders noted that concerns had faded about a profit-warning from No. 2 computer maker Dell Computer Corp. 

 The theoretical fair value premium of March S&P 500s is at about 9.50 points, with arbitrage buy programmes likely triggered at a premium above 11.40 points of the spot index and sell programme likely at a premium under 7.20 points. The fair value premium of the March Dow futures contract is at about 59 points. 

 At 9:01 a.m. CST (1501 GMT), March S&Ps were up 7.10 points at 1,422.50, Dow futures were up 41 at 11,155, Nikkeis gained 55 to 19,209, Nasdaq 100s were up 45.50 at 3,700.00, Russell 2000s gained 4.75 to 528.50 and Midcaps were up 5.80 at 450.00.

Qualcomm shares drop with sales forecast TECHNOLOGY: The company cites lower demand for its chips and cell phones.

Shares of Qualcomm Inc., developer of the world's fastest-growing cellular phone standard, fell 14 percent after the company warned that demand for its chips and cell phones may drop this quarter. 

Qualcomm dropped $24.38, to $124.63, in trading of more than 68 million shares, making it the most active U.S. stock Wednesday. The stock surged 27-fold last year on optimism for the company's code- division multiple-access technology. 

The warning late Tuesday about the fiscal second quarter surprised investors used to Qualcomm's forecasts of rising shipments of chips and phones based on its standard. The company still expects at least 70 million phones using the code-division technology to be sold this year by all manufacturers, up from about 40 million in 1999. 

"People were looking for numbers to go up, not down," said Banc of America Securities LLC analyst Mark McKechnie. 

San Diego-based Qualcomm said Tuesday that phone and chip shipments might fall from first-quarter levels because of slowdown after the holiday shopping season. 

In addition, the company said, phone makers can't get enough other parts, leading them to postpone buying chips from Qualcomm. 

It also cited a transition to newer versions of its chips. 

Qualcomm's warning came as it released fiscal first-quarter results. Profit from operations rose to $192 million in the quarter ended Dec. 26. That's up from $48.5 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 19 percent to $1.12 billion. 

Separately on Wednesday, the company agreed to acquire closely held SnapTrack Inc. for $1 billion in stock to add features such as 911 service to its wireless technology. 

Qualcomm said the acquisition will allow it to develop new technologies that take advantage of the 50 patents that San Jose- based SnapTrack owns in wireless Global Positioning Systems.

 SUSIE GHARIB: The proposed merger of BP Amoco (BPA) and ARCO (ARC) could be facing a gusher of trouble. The beginning of the end of the deal could be just days away. Good evening, everyone. I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. 

 JEFF YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine in Miami. Paul Kangas is off tonight. The word on the Street today: volatility! At the close, though, the Dow had lost just about 5 points; the NASDAQ fell 30. Then, we`ll tell you why these kids at a boys and girls club are on the cutting edge of a Clinton administration policy. 

 YASTINE: Good evening, everyone. It looks like that $27 billion proposed merger between BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield is on a slippery slope. Late today, the Federal Trade Commission postponed a meeting tomorrow, where NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT had learned it would almost certainly have rejected that deal. It`s believed both sides are now in last-ditch negotiations. Dennis Moore reports. 

 DENNIS MOORE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: What the companies and the FTC are fighting about, mostly, is the relationship between West Coast-particularly California-gasoline prices and Alaskan oil production. Together, BP and ARCO control about 80 percent of the north slope production. And the question is whether the combined companies would have the market power to demand higher prices. The companies, and many in the industry, say no. 

 ROBIN WEST, CHAIRMAN, PETROLEUM FINANCE COMPANY: If there`s any lesson of the last 25 years, is that the international oil markets are a world market, that oil is a fungible commodity. It can be moved around, and it`s a very transparent, very efficient market. 

 MOORE: The FTC wants ARCO to sell off all of its Alaskan operations. But the companies contend that much of the cost savings in their merger would come from combining north slope production, and that could actually help keep West Coast gasoline prices lower. But whatever the case, the BP-ARCO merger talks have what could be called a timing problem. 

 WEST: Unlike the Exxon Mobil (XOM) merger, this is a merger which is now in the full glare of FTC approval when oil prices, and as a result gasoline prices, are quite high. 

 MOORE: Not the case for the companies` stock prices-both fell today. It`s not clear what would happen if the merger falls apart. 

 JORDAN HOROSCHAK, OIL ANALYST, STANDARD & POORS: ARCO would probably drift back a little bit in stock price. BP Amoco, on the other hand, might actually increase in value. And that`s because all the concerns and uncertainties surrounding the merger will dissipate, and investors will feel more confident in BP Amoco`s future. 

 MOORE: Neither company would comment officially today, except to say they are still in discussions with the FTC, no deal and the FTC goes to court for a restraining order to stop the merger. Still, nobody`s saying this deal has completely blown apart yet. Both antitrust lawyers and analysts say BP and ARCO have a got a stronger legal case then the government does. Dennis Moore, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 GHARIB: Over on Wall Street, what a rocky day of trading! At the opening bell, it was blast off! The Dow shot up almost 100 points, and the NASDAQ bounced back with a gain of 50. Investors shrugged off that earnings warning late yesterday from Dell. Throughout the morning investors were in the buying mood and stocks trekked higher. By noon, the Dow and NASDAQ backed off a little bit from their highs. But the positive tone continued. But things changed after the lunch hour. The Dow and NASDAQ slipped into negative territory. The selling started after comments from Abby Joseph Cohen, the respected stock market strategist from Goldman Sachs (GS). She predicted that the Fed would raise interest rates next week, and that the Fed Funds Rate would increase by 50 to 75 basis points this year. By late afternoon, the Dow drifted between negative and positive territory, but the NASDAQ stayed negative. In the final hour of trading, even the blue chips Dow gave into the selling. By the closing bell, the Dow managed to stage a little bit of a comeback, down only 5 points to 11028. In today`s 249-point range, the Dow closed down 136 points below the best level. As for the NASDAQ: down 30 points to 4039. In its 166 point range, the Composite Index settled 100 points below its best level of the day. 

 Big board volume today more than a billion shares. That is 223 million shares less than yesterday. Transports fell almost 50. 

 Utilities gained a 1/2 point. 

 And the Closing Tick a bullish +174. 

 Over in the broader markets, the Standard & Poor`s 500, the 100, and the MidCap 400 each fell about a 1/2 percent. 

 But the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index edged up a 1/2 point. 

 The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped about 1 3/4. 

 A similar drop in the Value Line. 

 The Russell2000 Small Cap fell 4. 

 And the Wilshire 5000 was off 56 points. 

 After the close, the Federal Reserve reported in the week ending January 17th, that the M-2 money supply fell $3.8 billion. 

 In the bond market, the 30-year T-bond gained strength, but shorter-term issues weakened, continuing a pattern that we have been seeing for several weeks now. The reason: some traders say a hedge fund or a bank might be unwinding a large money-losing position. Others say that traders are selling technology positions and buying bonds. Regardless, there was more evidence of a further inversion of the yield curve. 

 The 30-year long bond now yields a lower interest rate than both the 10 and 5-year notes. 

 And looking at those notes. 

 The 5-year note fell 11/32. 

 The 10-year note dropped 7/32. 

 And the 30-year bond rose 29/32. And the 30-year bond rose 29/32. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long-Bond Index gained 9 points. 

 And in a few minutes, we`ll take a look at some stocks that made news today. Jeff. 

 YASTINE: Well, Susie, the New York Stock Exchange had its first IPO of the year today. John Hancock (SPQBX), the 138-year-old life insurance giant went public, opening at $17 a share and closing up 5/8. The company is a major player in life insurance and other financial products. But financial services companies are now expanding into each other`s businesses. That`s why Hancock`s CEO says it`s the right time for the offering. 

 STEPHEN BROWN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, JOHN HANCOCK FINANCIAL SERVICES: The financial services sector is just changing so rapidly that we think we have to have the maximum flexibility in organizational structure and maximum access to capital. And becoming a stock company is really the only way to do that. 

 YASTINE: Meanwhile, competitors Met Life and Prudential are also set to go public later this year. 

 GHARIB: President Clinton gives his final State of the Union speech tonight. He`s expected to propose a $350 billion tax cut and also new retirement savings accounts. As Stephanie Woods reports, the president will also address what`s called the digital divide, the growing technology gap between rich and poor Americans. 

 STEPHANIE WOODS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: These children have found a bridge across the digital divide. The computers at this Boys and Girls Club in Washington, D.C. were donated by Microsoft. The Internet connection is a gift from AT&T. The kids say the computers help them with their schoolwork. 

 MICHELLE ADAMS, AGE 6: It teach you how to read and do math and subtract. 

 WOODS: A recent Commerce Department report titled Falling Through the Net shows 40 percent of U.S. families have computers. But of families that earn less than $10,000 a year only 8 percent have computers. The president is expected to highlight the so-called digital divide in his speech tonight. In 1996, the president pushed a program to wire schools and libraries. Now he`s expected to back a plan to help poor families connect to the Internet. The proposal will give low income families federal subsidies to help pay for computers and Internet access. It`s modeled after a pilot program called Click Start. People PC is one of the participating companies. 

 NICK GROUF, CEO, PEOPLEPC: What the Internet does is create job opportunities, create additional training and information and have the sort of impact on families to open an entire world to them that wouldn`t be available if they didn`t have access to a PC and to the Internet. 

 WOODS: The president may ask for as much as $100 million in his budget to help nine million families get online. But the plan`s fate on Capitol Hill is uncertain. An idea to give laptops to poor children was criticized, even laughed at, when proposed by then House Speaker Newt Gingrich. 

 REPRESENTATIVE CHRISTOPHER COX, CALIFORNIA-R: And it was criticized at the time by many Democrats as well as Republicans for one simple reason and that is that it`s a very expensive way to try to help poor people. There are much cheaper ways to do it. 

 WOODS: Of course, in Washington, no program exists in a vacuum. Just how important Congress decides closing the digital divide is will be measured against competing priorities, like adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and cutting taxes. Stephanie Woods, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. GHARIB: Blue chips saw mostly red today in a very volatile day of trading. On the big board, the Dow lost 5 points to 11,028. Decliners beat out advancing issues and there were 41 new highs versus 122 new lows.

 So, Jeff, that`s a look at some of the stocks that made news today. 

 YASTINE: Well, Susie, I`ll tell you about an Internet-based financial services firm called My CFO and it`s backed by some of the biggest names in new technology. Its President and CEO, Art Shaw, came to the startup from Charles Schwab (SCH). Now, My CFO targets high net worth individuals, offering what it calls a personal chief financial officer to manage their money. Since its startup last May, the privately held company has built a board of directors, including Netscape`s former CEO Jim Barksdale and Cisco Systems` (CSCO) John Chambers. It has about 100 clients with a total of $15 billion in assets. In tonight`s prime movers segment, Donald van de Mark of Myprimetime.com asks Shaw why wealthy people with financial advisors would give their money management to My CFO. 

 ART SHAW, PRESIDENT & CEO, MYCFO: It`s precisely because they have so many different advisers in their life that My CFO becomes valuable to our clients. Indeed, they continue the relationships with all those advisers. But for someone with a lot of wealth it`s very difficult and extremely time consuming for them to make that all come together in a single unified picture and to get the best tax and accounting advice possible. So what we do is simply help a client manage all the different activities in their lives, help them put all these different relationships into one view where they can see it on the Internet and they can also talk to someone. They have a single point of contact to help them with their financial activities. 

 DONALD VAN DE MARK, MY PRIMETIME.COM: Is it because the web and software have become so much more sophisticated or is it because there are so many more millionaires out there? 

 SHAW: Oh, a little bit of both. The Web allows for the pulling together of an enormous amount of data in a single engine and what that does is it gives someone a very simple way to manage their activities. It also removes a lot of the paper so now a client can actually see everything come together and have all this paper that they used to, these shoe boxes and envelopes and receipts just disappear because the Internet allows you to have it real time come together in one single place. 

 VAN DE MARK: How many clients do you have or how many assets do you have under management? 

 SHAW: We have about a hundred clients and we have about $15 billion in assets represented. And what I mean by that is that is assets that our clients have in many institutions, because again our clients continue to use many incredible financial institutions, when they come to My CFO. And what we do is allow them to have a single point of view from which to look at all of that. 

 VAN DE MARK: You were at Charles Schwab for many years and you saw how quickly a Schwab could challenge a Merrill Lynch, for instance. How quickly can My CFO challenge major money management firms or trust departments or banks? 

 SHAW: You know, in many ways we work complementary to money management firms. What we`re doing is filling a need that hasn`t existed before because right now our clients have to work with each of these institutions separately and pull it together to create their taxes in one picture. It`s very hard for them to know all the different people spending their money. So what we can do is work with those institutions and very quickly pull it together to give them one picture. 

 VAN DE MARK: So are you partnering with some of these firms? 

 SHAW: We will work with any institutions that our clients already work with. So what we do is provide an integration source for them so they have a single way to understand how all their money is being spent and all their money is being managed. 

 VAN DE MARK: Something of a professional but also a personal question. On your board are some of titans of the new economy including John Chambers of Cisco as well as Jim Clark, the founder of your company, but also the founder of Netscape, among other companies. How is it answering to such a powerful group of people? 

 SHAW: Well, that group is an incredible source of support and an incredible source of focus and guidance going forward. For me it`s a question of making sure I can harness all that talent and pull it together for the best of our clients. 

 VAN DE MARK: Thank you very much for joining us. 

 GHARIB: Tomorrow, our Friday market monitor guest is Derwood Chase, President and Chief Investment Officer of the Chase Investment Counsel Corporation. 

 GHARIB: Carnival (CCL) is again bidding to buy Norwegian Cruise Lines, hoping for smoother sailing at a higher price. Today Carnival sweetened its offer to about $4.91 a share, up from its December bid of $3.69. The deal is now worth more than $2 billion. Carnival shares fell on the news, down 1 3/16 to 42 3/4. But Norwegian`s parent, NCL Holding (NRW), added 7/8 to 19. 

 YASTINE: Defense contractor Lockheed Martin (LMT) is slashing 2,800 jobs to streamline its aeronautical and space businesses. The company says cutting 2 percent of its workforce will save nearly $200 million a year. Most of the layoffs will come at facilities in Georgia, California and Texas. Lockheed Martin`s stock closed down 5/8 to 19 7/16. 

 GHARIB: As experts debate how much inflation is creeping into the economy, here`s a statistic to consider. Commodity prices as measured by the CRB Index rose 7 percent last year and that is the first year to year gain since 1995. Today I talked about this with Bob Hafer, managing director of the Bridge/CRB Index, and asked him if we can expect commodities to continue to rise. 

 BOB HAFER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BRIDGE CRB: We think so. Susie, if you look around the world, every major economy is on the rise now. You would be hard pressed to find a country that`s contracting. That, in turn, is going to increase the demand for commodities. We think the period of high supplies is behind us. So everything points towards higher prices. 

 GHARIB: All right, as the demand increases which commodities do you think, Bob, are going to have the most significant increases? 

 HAFER: Well, we`ve seen the energy markets post gains in excess of a hundred percent over the last year. We would be looking next at the livestock markets to improve. The sector that will probably be last would be the grains. They are still burdened with high supplies. But when the grain starts to move up, that should signal that all the markets are in tandem. 

 GHARIB: All right, so the Federal Reserve is meeting next week to discuss interest rate policy and as we know, they`re very focused on inflation. How is this commodity information going to factor in to interest rate policy, do you think? 

 HAFER: Well, so far the rises in the CRB Index and commodity prices in general have been fairly small except for energy. As long as it continues at a slow pace I don`t think the Federal Reserve will show much concern. 

 GHARIB: All right. Now, you make a very interesting correlation between the rise in the CRB Index and the improvement in the relationship between the yen and the dollar, the Japanese yen and U.S. dollar. Tell us what your thinking is on that. 

 HAFER: We look at the Japanese yen as being a good surrogate for economic strength in the Pacific Rim. Since the yen has regained everything it lost from the Asian currency crisis, we look for commodity prices to regain the levels that they were at prior to the crisis, approximately 240 to 250 on the CRB Index. 

 GHARIB: And when might that happen? 

 HAFER: It could easily happen this year. That wouldn`t be surprising at all. 

 GHARIB: OK, very interesting. Thanks for the insight. We`ve been speaking with Bob Hafer, Managing Director of the Bridge CRB Index. 

 YASTINE: Well, as has been mentioned quite often recently, Wall Street will be watching the Federal Reserve when it meets on interest rates next week. Tonight`s commentator says there`s one thing the Fed should not be concerned about. Here`s Alice Rivlin, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Federal Reserve Bank co-chair. 

 ALICE RIVLIN, COMMENTARY: Should the Fed worry about whether the stock market is overvalued? Well, why not, you may ask. Everyone else does. Certainly everyone who watches this program. Actually, I think the answer is no. Worrying about market valuation is your job if you are an equity investor not the central bank`s. Equity investors face a quandary right now. By historical measures such as price earnings ratios, stocks are mighty pricey these days, especially the high tech high flyers and the dot.com companies that haven`t made a profit yet. But historical standards may be changing. More and more people own stock and believe that equity investment is a smart deal for the long haul. They may require a lower premium over bond yields than equity holders used to. Moreover technology is transforming the world economy and the Internet may produce a great leap in productivity, choice and convenience. Some of those dot.coms may make a lot of money. Your job is to figure out which ones. The Fed`s job is to keep its focus on the whole economy to help it grow at a sustainable rate to avoid overheating and inflation. Stock market values are relevant only as one factor adding to total spending pressures when people with unrealized gains buy more because they feel wealthier. It`s the total spending the Fed should judge, not the market values. I`m Alice Rivlin. 

 GHARIB: Recapping today`s market action, the Dow fell almost 5 points and the NASDAQ lost 30. And please join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword: NBR. 

 YASTINE: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for this Thursday, January 27th. I`m Jeff Yastine. Good night, everyone. And good night to you, Susie. 

 GHARIB: Good night, Jeff. I`m Susie Gharib and we`ll see all of you again tomorrow night.

 Dell Volume Ranks Third-Heaviest In Nasdaq History

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Spurred by the company's fourth-quarter profitwarning, traders dealt shares of Dell Computer Corp. (DELL) with abandon Thursday, ranking the session as the third-heaviest volume day ever for a Nasdaq-traded issue. 

 The stock ended Thursday down 2 13/16, or 7%, at 37 9/16, with the selloff accelerating toward the end of the session. Volume reached 127.3 million, more than quadruple its average daily turnover of about 30 million. Dell's float stands at about 2 billion shares. 

 The Round Rock, Texas, personal-computer maker also holds the sixth spot on a list of history's most furiously traded days, with 112.2 million shares changing hands on Feb. 17, 1999, after the company reported disappointing results for last year's fourth quarter. 

 The record on Nasdaq is 171.8 million shares, set Dec. 9, 1997, by Oracle Corp. (ORCL) after it, too, warned of an earnings shortfall. Pre-announcements of worse-than-expected results are, not surprisingly, the most common catalysts for large-volume days. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, the single-session volume record was set earlier this month by Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU). On Jan. 7, 136 million Lucent shares changed hands in Big Board trading after the telephone equipment maker said it would post earnings far worse than expected. 

 Of Nasdaq stocks, Comparator Systems Corp., which later settled fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, traded 152.1 million shares on May 6, 1996, the second-heaviest session ever. The company, which developed and marketed high-tech fingerprint-reading devices, rocketed to public attention that day, its stock rising in price from pennies a share to a high of nearly $2. Regulators halted trading in the stock, which was delisted from Nasdaq in June 1996, and sued the company for allegedly defrauding investors. 

 The fourth-ranked session on Nasdaq belongs to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Nearly 120 million of the company's shares traded on Monday, Nov. 8, the first session after federal judge Thomas Penfield Jackson released his seminal findings of fact in the antitrust case against the software company.

 WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 26, 2000-- 

 SmartPortfolio.Com Announces Investment Opinion: Nasdaq Hit, Dow 

 Helped by Strong Earnings 

 The following is market news from SmartPortfolio.Com, Inc., located on the web at the newly redesigned site: http://www.smartportfolio.com. 

 Stock prices are reflective of January 26, 2000 at 4:30 PM, EST. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 3.10 (+0.03%) to 11032.99, the S&P 500 closed down 5.94 (-0.42%) to 1404.09, and the Nasdaq closed down 97.50 (-2.34%) to 4069.91. 

 An afternoon sell off ensued on Wall Street today and wiped out earlier gains on the Dow, while a steep drop in the share price of Qualcomm (Nasdaq:QCOM), a favorite of tech investors, triggered a slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq. 

 The high-flying stock of Qualcomm descended back to earth today after the wireless phone technology company reported somewhat disappointing earnings and issued a warning on future sales late yesterday. Although Qualcomm's fiscal first quarter profits of 25 cents per share beat analyst estimates of 24 cents, they fell short of the analyst "whisper" numbers of 27 to 28 cents. 

 In addition, the stock was hurt after the company warned that shipments of its products, which are expected to be the backbone of future wireless networks, could fall in the second quarter. Also adding downward pressure was a downgrade and some lukewarm comments from Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Ching. In the end, Qualcomm shares fell 16.36% (down 24 3/8) to 124 5/8. 

 After the markets closed today, tech bellwether Dell Computer (Nasdaq:DELL) issued a profit warning, saying its fourth quarter earnings will come in lower than expected at 15 cents per share, which is 6 cents below current Wall Street estimates of 21 cents. 

 The company cited a decline in corporate sales due to Year 2000 concerns and inconsistent chip component flow as chief factors for its earnings and revenue shortfall. Dell closed the day at 40 3/8 but was lower in after-hours trading. 

 In other after-the-bell news, Allaire Corp. (Nasdaq:ALLR) reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings of 3 cents per share and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Allaire closed up 11 9/16 (up 7.21%) to 171 7/8. Readers of the Smart!Splits Report were told of this possible stock split in previous issues.

 In earnings news: 

 EMC Corp. (NYSE:EMC) posted a 38% increase in fourth quarter profits to 34 cents per share, which exceeded First Call consensus estimates of 31 cents. Despite the positive results, shares of the maker of corporate data storage systems fell 8 3/4 (-7.29%) to 111 1/4. 

 BMC Software (Nasdaq:BMCS) reported third quarter profits of 41 cents per share, which was in line with previously lowered analyst expectations. Shares of the business software maker dropped 4 5/16 (-9.87%) to 39 3/8 after analysts cut their earnings estimates on the company for the next two quarters. 

 Merck (NYSE:MRK) said its fourth quarter profits rose 12% from the year ago period to 66 cents per share, which matched Wall Street forecasts. Shares of the leading U.S. drug company gained 1 15/16 (+2.73%) to 72 13/16. 

 In other news, eBay (Nasdaq:EBAY) shares bolted 11.68% (up 16 1/16) to 153 9/16 after the leading online auction company announced late yesterday better than expected earnings of 4 cents per share, which beat Wall Street estimates of 2 cents per share. Investors were pleased with eBay's strong growth in registered users. 

 eBay also hosted 41 million auctions in the most recent quarter, compared to 13.6 million during the year ago period.

 The Linux sector was back in the news today after Red Hat (Nasdaq:RHAT) and Computer Associates Intl. (NYSE:CA) announced a broad distribution, marketing and support agreement. The deal is expected to help Linux gain acceptance beyond the technical user and into the mainstream business community. 

 Red Hat shares were off 27/32 (-0.74%) to 113 3/8 and Computer Associates shares edged down by 1/8 (-0.17%) to 74 9/16.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks were mostly higher today as investors brushed off a profit warning from Dell Computer and bought a wide range of technology names, helping the Nasdaq composite to rebound from Wednesday's slump. 

 In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 57.39 at 11,090.38. 

 Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 4.05 at 1,408.14, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 18.06 at 4,087.97, bouncing back from Wednesday's 97-point decline. All three major market indexes fell back from sharper early gains. 

 Stocks advanced despite a profit warning from one of the technology sector's most reliable performers. 

 Dell slipped 7/8 to 39 1/2. Late Wednesday, the company said it will miss analysts' profit and sales estimates this quarter due to parts shortages and slower customer demand. Dell cited Year 2000 computer concerns for the shortfall. 

 Today, however, Wall Street brokerages including Merrill Lynch and Chase Hambrecht & Quist stepped in to defend the company, raising their recommendations on the stock. 

 "That's a sign of a real bull market," said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "Dell released a very disappointing announcement, yet investors are able to look beyond the valleys to the good news ahead." 

 Other technology companies posted sharp gains. Hewlett-Packard rose 3 5/8 to 112 3/8, leading the Dow's advance. 

 Conexant, which will be added to the S&P 500 after the close of trading Friday, rose 11 15/16 to 86 1/4. Companies often get at least a short-term boost when they are added to an index, as mutual fund managers who try to mirror an index's performance buy shares of the newly added company. 

 Kellogg rose 7/16 to 25 1/4 after saying fourth-quarter profits rose 47 percent from last year as the company cut down on inefficient promotional efforts. Some investors were troubled, however, by a decline in cereal sales. 

 Coca-Cola shares tumbled for a second session, losing 3 13/16 to trade at 59 1/4. The company Wednesday announced plans to cut 6,000 jobs, about one-fifth of its work force. 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-6 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 504.64 million shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.89 to 522.93.

 The consumer confidence index soared from 141.7 in December to 144.7 in January, the highest level recorded since the index was created in the 1960s, the Conference Board reported. Both components of the monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. households improved-- consumers' assessment of current business conditions as well as their expectations for the future. 

 Sales of existing homes soared 4.6 percent in 1999 to a record 5.197 million as Americans snapped up homes despite rising mortgage rates. Sales surpassed the previous record of 4.97 million set in 1998, the National Association of Realtors said. In December, however, sales fell 1.4 percent from the month before to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.06 million units. Economists read the December decline as a sign that rising mortgage rates have begun to dampen demand. 

 Microsoft must ship products featuring the Java programming language that conform to standards set by the language's owner, Sun Microsystems, a federal judge has ruled. However, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Whyte amended an earlier ruling that said Microsoft could be in violation of Sun's copyright of the Java language as well as in violation of its contract with Sun. At the urging of an appeals court, Whyte dropped the copyright claim. Microsoft is accused of trying to extend the Java language for special use with its Windows operating system, which Sun contends is a violation of both the contract and its copyright. 

 Webvan Group, which sells groceries online in San Francisco, said it formed alliances with Kellogg, Quaker Oats, Nestle and Pillsbury to help attract shoppers as it expands to serve more cities.

 EARNINGS 

 American Home Products said fourth-quarter profit rose less than 1 percent, to $593 million, as increased costs ate into revenue from higher drug sales. Procter & Gamble said Monday that it ended talks to acquire American Home and its intended merger partner, Warner-Lambert. American Home and Warner-Lambert had agreed to a $53 billion merger in November. 

 AT&T's earnings declined as expected in the fourth quarter despite rising revenue, as the company continued to invest heavily in its strategy to use cable TV lines for telephone and Web service. Excluding one-time factors, the company earned $1.84 billion, down from $1.99 billion a year earlier. For all of 1999, AT&T's profit fell to $5.45 billion, from $6.40 billion. 

 Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the second-largest U.S. railroad, said fourth-quarter earnings rose 6.4 percent, to $315 million, as it carried more imports, grain and automobiles. 

 Compaq Computer, the largest maker of personal computers, said fourth-quarter profit fell 56 percent, to $332 million, as its commercial PC business kept losing money, and the company predicted that sales growth this year will slow from its 1999 pace. Sales fell 3.5 percent, to $10.5 billion. 

 Chevron, the third-largest U.S. oil company, posted a 63 percent increase in earnings in the fourth quarter as oil prices reached an eight-year high. Profit from operations rose to $819 million.

 Exxon Mobil, in its first earnings report since it was formed by the biggest oil industry merger ever, said fourth-quarter profit rose 34 percent. The average price of oil was almost twice that of the year-earlier period, and earnings from oil sales more than doubled. Exxon Mobil said oil exploration profit climbed to $2.3 billion while Chevron's rose to $840 million. But profit margins on gasoline and other fuels plummeted. Its refining business lost $19 million in the quarter, compared with a profitof $945 million a year earlier. 

 Immunex, one of the world's biggest biotechnology companies, said fourth-quarter profit rose 10 percent, to $16.2 million, buoyed by sales of the arthritis drug Enbrel. 

 Johnson & Johnson said its fourth-quarter profit from operations rose 12 percent, to $796 million, on increased sales of surgical equipment and drugs. 

 McGraw-Hill said its fourth-quarter profit from operations rose 30 percent, to $96.6 million, driven by its textbook business and its Standard & Poor's unit. 

 Merrill Lynch said fourth-quarter profit more than doubled, to $764 million, driven by resurgent brokerage sales and higher fees from mergers and stock underwriting. 

 Occidental Petroleum said it had fourth-quarter profit from operations of $192 million, compared with a loss of $35 million in the year-earlier period, because of higher oil and natural gas prices and cost cutting. 

 Procter & Gamble said its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 11 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, to $1.26 billion, as overseas economies rebounded and P&G introduced a flurry of new products such as Swiffer mops and the Dryel home-dry-cleaning kit. 

 Qualcomm, the best-performing stock on the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year, said it may ship fewer chips and cellular phones in its fiscal second quarter than the first quarter, sending its shares down. The warning came as Qualcomm said profit from operations rose to $192 million in the quarter ended Dec. 26, up from $48.5 million. Qualcomm rose $8.93 3/4 to $149 on the Nasdaq in regular trading and dropped $14 to $135 on electronic networks in after-hours trading. 

 Raytheon, the world's third-largest defense and aerospace company, said fourth-quarter profit fell 79 percent, to $72 million, because of fewer missile shipments, accounting adjustments, and project delays in its aircraft and construction divisions. 

 SBC Communications, the nation's largest regional telephone company, said fourth-quarter profit from operations rose 8.2 percent, to $1.85 billion, as sales of data and Internet services surged and it drew more customers to its wireless business. 

 Xerox said it will take a new round of cost-cutting steps and roll out new products to improve its bottom line after reporting that fourth-quarter profits fell 52 percent. Net income in the fourth quarter was $294 million, compared with $615 million a year earlier.

 Confident consumers boost index to a record Consumer confidence, a key indicator measuring the force behind the economy's long expansion, soared in January to the highest level ever reached in the 32 years the data has been compiled, the Conference Board reported yesterday. 

 ''People looking for confirmation that the consumer confidence bubble will soon burst have a further wait in store," said Lynn Franco, research director for the Conference Board. "An expanding global economy and a robust job market suggest that consumer optimism and consumer spending could rise even further in coming months." 

 The consumer confidence index rose to 144.7 in January, up from 141.7 in December. It was the highest level measured in the 32 years that the business-financed research group has been keeping records on the data and a stronger-than-expected performance. 

 In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes soared 4.6 percent last year, reaching a record 5.197 million. Rising mortgage rates, however, led to a 1.4 percent decline in December. USA Networks to buy Styleclick.com stake USA Networks Inc., owner of the Home Shopping Network cable-television channel, said it agreed to buy a majority stake in online retailer Styleclick.com Inc. for $379.2 million to bolster its Internet shopping business. 

 USA Networks will combine its Internet Shopping Network with Styleclick.com to form a new company called Styleclick Inc. It will receive about 23.1 million shares, or 75 percent of Styleclick, and contribute about $40 million in cash and $10 million in advertising. It will lend the venture about $10 million. 

 Styleclick.com sells clothes, shoes and fragrances from its Web site. The Culver City, Calif.-based company lost $4.67 million on revenue of $786,546 in the third quarter. Its shares fell 31/4 to 141/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Qualcomm warning sends shares down Qualcomm Inc., the best-performing stock on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index last year, yesterday said it may ship fewer chips and cell phones in the fiscal second quarter than the first quarter, sending its shares down. 

 The warning came as Qualcomm said profit from operations rose to $192 million, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 26. That's up from $48.5 million, or 8 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 19 percent to $1.12 billion. 

 Qualcomm made its announcement after the 4 p.m. close of the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares rose 8-15/16 to 149 on the Nasdaq in regular trading and dropped 14 to 135 on electronic networks after the 4 p.m. New York close. Retailer Venator slashing jobs, store locales The belt got even tighter at Venator Group Inc. yesterday as the retailer formerly known as Woolworth took another stab at restructuring its troubled business by slashing about 3,700 jobs and closing 358 underperforming stores. 

 In recent years, the company has shuttered thousands of stores and sold many of its noncore divisions as its shifted its focus primarily to sporting goods. 

 ''It is taking a while but they are doing what they need to do to get this business in shape," said Lee Backus, senior vice president at Buckingham Research Group in New York. "I believe in the end they could emerge the winners in the sporting goods market." 

 The retailer will cut about 30 percent of its sales and corporate staff in the United States and Canada. That includes about 600 corporate staffers and 3,100 people who work in its stores. 

 Venator also will close 123 Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker stores, 27 Champs stores and 208 Northern Group clothing stores. 

 Hot sales propel P&G's earnings Procter & Gamble Co., which on Monday ended talks to buy two big drug makers, said yesterday that fiscal second-quarter profit increased 11 percent and warned that spending on new products will hurt profit this quarter. 

 Profit from operations rose to $1.26 billion, or 88 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $1.14 billion, or 78 cents, a year earlier. P&G is the biggest U.S. maker of household goods, such as Tide detergent, Bounty towels and Pampers diapers. 

 Sales rose 6.6 percent to $10.59 billion from $9.93 billion - the fastest pace in four years - as demand rebounded in Japan and South Korea and P&G introduced a flurry of new products such as Swiffer mops and the Dryel dry-cleaning kit. Spending to bring out new goods globally will reduce third-quarter profit. P&G shares fell 5-11/16 to 97-7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Rising oil prices a boom for Exxon Mobil Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, said its fourth-quarter profit rose 34 percent as oil prices climbed to an eight-year high. 

 Exxon Corp. completed its $85.2 billion buyout of Mobil Corp., the largest industrial merger ever, Nov. 30. The combined company's profit from operations rose to $2.71 billion, or 77 cents a share, from $2.03 billion, or 58 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 30 percent to $56 billion from $43 billion. 

 Merger-related charges of $425 million in the quarter brought net income to $2.28 billion, or 65 cents a share. Some of the charges were for the expense of eliminating 1,750 jobs in the quarter, 1,400 of them in the United States. 

 Shares of Exxon Mobil, based in the Dallas suburb of Irving, Texas, rose 1/16 to 84-5/16 in late trading. Compiled from reports by

 SUSIE GHARIB: The chips were down for Dell. The computer maker issues a profit warning blaming it on an inconsistent supply of semiconductor chips. Its stock falls in after hours trading. Good evening, everyone. I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. 

 JEFF YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine in Miami. Paul Kangas is off tonight. Big changes for the world`s biggest soft drink maker, but not much change on Wall Street. The Dow gains 3 and the NASDAQ loses 97. Then, when you buy a share of stock, what exactly are you buying? The answer may surprise you. 

 GHARIB: A shocker from Dell Computer late today. In a stunning warning just after the market closed, the PC maker said their fourth quarter profits will come in at 16 cents a share, that is a nickel below what Wall Street expected. Dell blames the shortfall on an uneven supply of semiconductor components and lower than expected corporate PC sales following the Y2K rollover. Those two factors cost Dell $800 million in lost revenue during the quarter. And the company says the problems might extend beyond the fourth quarter. 

 VOICE OF TOM MEREDITH, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER: In fact, we might not a sequential rise in EPS from the fourth quarter to the first giving the effort we will be making to re-stimulate post-Y2K momentum in the corporate sector and the investments we`ll be making in our own Internet infrastructure. 

 GHARIB: And a rough day for Dell stock. It lost almost 2 points in the regular NASDAQ session, and then fell another 4 points in after hours to around 36. 

 YASTINE: The world`s largest soft drink company is downsizing. Coca-Cola announced massive layoffs today for the first time in a decade. Erika Miller reports. 

 ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Coca Cola is hoping a major restructuring will help it refresh profits. The company plans to lay off 6,000 workers, about a fifth of its staff. That`s much more than the 2,000 Wall Street expected. 

 JACK STAHL, PRESIDENT & COO DESIGNATE, COCA COLA: It started as a bottoms up approach to what people, what marketing people do we need in place? What people do we need to call effectively on retailers and our other customers? And that`s what drove the size of the necessary organization that we have in place. 

 MILLER: Coke`s organizational structure will also change. Power will shift from its Atlanta headquarters to regional markets. The move is designed to boost local marketing. It may also help Coke better react to crises like last year`s product recall in Europe. Today`s announcement overshadowed Coke`s fourth quarter profit report. It earned $0.31 a share, beating estimates. But Coke shares fell nearly three points today. The stock is now trading about where it was this time last year. For much of 1999, disappointing earnings pressured the share price. Wall Street analysts are divided on the outlook for the company. Some say Coke has a good handle on its problems and see the shares as undervalued. 

 JENNIFER SOLOMON, BEVERAGE ANALYST, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: Right now we have an "outperform" on Coke. It`s not our strongest rating. We have a $70 price target, so the stock here at about $64. We think you can nibble away here. 

 MILLER: But others say the massive overseas growth that Coke enjoyed from the mid 1980s to mid 1990s is over. Roy Burry is not recommending the stock. 

 ROY BURRY, BEVERAGE ANALYST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: We continue to believe the stock is overvalued given the high price to earnings ratio, the very low dividend yield and the failure of certain analysts and investors to realize that the growth rate here is vastly less than it once was in terms of both volume and earnings per share. 

 MILLER: While analysts support today`s cost cutting measures, many think it`s not enough. They say the key for Coke will be boosting revenues by selling more soda. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 GHARIB: It was an edgy day on Wall Street today. Investors were cautious most of the day, waiting to hear comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the Senate confirmation hearings. And once they did, it was a let down. And we will have more on that story in just in a moment. Stocks were mixed right from the opening bell. The Dow rose a bit, but the NASDAQ slipped into the minus column. By the first hour of trading, the Dow was up more than 40, but the NASDAQ was off more than 50. Generally positive news on earnings, and higher bond prices helped stocks, but profit-taking in tech stocks-especially some of the sector`s high-flyers like QUALCOMM were a drag on the NASDAQ throughout the morning. By the noon hour, not a great deal of change. Traders didn`t show much conviction to buy up tech stocks. Investors still watching the clock waiting for Greenspan`s appearance on the Hill at 2:00 o`clock Eastern Time, and they were reluctant to move forcefully in one direction or another until then. In the late afternoon, there was a slight up tick in the NASDAQ once investors realized that Greenspan didn`t have anything new to say about interest rate changes. But that changed in the final hour of trading. The NASDAQ got hammered and came close to a triple-digit loss. And the blue chips trimmed their gains just barely staying in the plus column. By the closing bell, the Dow tacked only 3 points to 11032. In today`s 128-point range, the Dow closed down about 100 points from the best level. And there`s the final number on the NASDAQ: down 97 points to 4069. In its 105-point range, the Index settled at its worst level of the day. Big board volume today: more than a billion shares. That`s up sharply from yesterday. 

 Transports rose 10 points. 

 Utilities picked up 4 1/2. 

 And the Closing Tick up 217, which is a mildly bullish sign. 

 Moving along to the broader market, the Standard & Poor`s 500 lost about 6. 

 The S&P 100 fell 4 1/2. 

 And fractional losses in the MidCap 400 and the CRB Index. 

 The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose more than 3 1/2. 

 The Value Line advanced a fraction. 

 The Russell2000 Small Cap lost a 1/2. 

 And the Wilshire 5000 fell more than 55. 

 Over in the bond market, traders were also on Greenspan watch, and bond prices were mixed today. Now the focus is on Friday`s release of the latest Employment Cost Index for a read on any signs of wage inflation. Corporate and tax free issues were mostly flat today, but Treasuries were mostly higher. 

 The 5-year notes was unchanged. 

 The 10-year gaining 7/32. 

 The 30-year bond rose 4/32, bringing the yield to 6.66. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index added about 4 3/4 points. 

 And we`ll take a closer look at some of the stocks making news in just a few minutes. Jeff. 

 YASTINE: Fed Chairman Greenspan went before the Senate Banking Committee today in what was officially the confirmation hearing for another term in office. But since there isn`t any serious opposition to that, the senators talked about the budget battle ahead. Dennis Moore reports. 

 DENNIS MOORE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The Senate Banking Committee is more or less a chapter of the Alan Greenspan fan club and he thanked them for their support. 

 ALAN GREENSPAN, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD: And I would be honored if the Senate saw fit to enable me to continue this association. 

 MOORE: Well, that could happen by the time the Fed meets next week, Phil Gramm, the Banking chairman said. And then he got down to the real business at the top of Washington`s agenda these days, what to do with the burgeoning budget surpluses. 

 SENATOR PHIL GRAMM, CHAIRMAN, SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE: And I know you get asked this question all the time and everybody`s trying to use you and your credibility to promote their goals. 

 MOORE: But the master of Fed speak or Green speak long ago learned how handle that question and stuck to the line he`s used since the surpluses first appeared-pay down the debt. 

 GREENSPAN: That would be, from an economic point of view, and I recognize there are other priorities, obviously, but from an economic point of view, that would be by far the best means of employing it. MOORE: If it`s politically feasible, Greenspan said, and feasibility is what has Wall Street worried about the surplus. 

 JASON TENNERT, ECONOMIST, ISI GROUP: It`s like putting a pint of ice cream in front of a four-year-old. You have a lot of, you have a big surplus and it`s an election year and it`s going to be very difficult for the bureaucrats not to spend it. 

 MOORE: Tennert thinks the Fed may already be behind the curve in raising rates to slow an accelerating economy. 

 TENNERT: This is a new economy. It`s very difficult for market participants and Fed watchers and members of the FOMC themselves to figure out what`s going on. 

 MOORE: It`s the same problem for the Fed as for the president and Congress -- what to do about economic and fiscal situations that they never expected and never saw before. Dennis Moore, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 GHARIB: Earlier today I talked with the man who will be Coke`s next president and I asked him if today`s news is only the beginning of more restructuring. 

 JACK STAHL, PRESIDENT & COO DESIGNATE, COCA COLA: Well, I think the way to think about this is that it does reflect a very thorough look at our business. Coca Cola, we believe, has tremendous growth opportunities around the world. And we have done a very thorough assessment of our resources and realize that we needed to place those resources closer to local communities and within the countries in which we operate around the world. But I think what you`ve heard today is a rather complete assessment. Most of these moves will take place early in the year 2000 and then will be completed as the year moves on. 

 GHARIB: All right, Mr. Stahl, one of the things that the Wall Street community takes away from your announcement today is that the year 2000 is pretty much going to be a year of a big write-off and they`re not expecting much more than that. Is that an accurate assessment, do you think? 

 STAHL: No, I don`t think so. I think 2000 and the move we`ve made has, I think, very much positioned our company for strong future growth. Around the world, we believe that a number of economic trends and underlying trends are beginning to improve. So we think the underlying operating trends of our business are going to get stronger. We saw some evidence of that in the fourth quarter. And we would very much expect those operating trends to continue to improve as the year moves on. 

 GHARIB: All right, so we could expect some kind of resurgence maybe by the latter half of the year? 

 STAHL: Well, as we move through the year, we expect growth in the range of 5 percent to 6 percent in terms of underlying volume growth. We expect that to translate through in terms of healthy growth in earnings per share before consideration of the charges that we outlined today. 

 GHARIB: I understand that you`re going to be meeting with analysts here in New York on Friday. What is the strategy that you`re going to be outlining to them on your plans to boost growth? 

 STAHL: I think the key thing we`re going to communicate on Friday is we are aligning the company, we think, effectively with the needs of people around the world that drink our products, making sure that our marketing resources are linked to local communities, that we`re in a great position to meet the needs of retailers and customers and that essentially we become a much more marketing centered company. And that`s going to best position us to create and capture long-term growth, which clearly is out there. 

 GHARIB: All right, now I understand that some of the cost savings you`re getting from today`s news on the restructuring and the layoffs is going to go into marketing. What is your marketing plan? What are you going to be doing differently? 

 STAHL: Well, we`re starting right now. We have a great new marketing plan for Coca Cola Classic that`s in place for the year 2000. It is centered in new advertising, but it`s more complete than that. All of our promotions, all of our packaging has been revised in many markets around the world. But importantly, we`re going to begin much more aggressively to build marketing plans from the local market up, from the local community up. 

 GHARIB: Do you think you`re moving fast enough? 

 STAHL: We think we`re moving at the right speed. The world is changing fast and we think we need to move fast to adjust to that. There`s no question about it. 

 GHARIB: It still seems, though, that from what you`re saying that it`s going to take a long time to really fix the problems that you`re trying to fix here, so it`s a long-term play. From the point of view of your stock, are you looking then for shareholders who are going to be very long-term oriented and very patient? 

 STAHL: Well, I think, Susie, it would be a mistake to assume that we have years and years and years of patience. We think the opportunity is actually right in front of us. And that`s what we`re going to create in the year 2000. We see growth beginning to return to our business. We saw stronger growth in the fourth quarter than we have seen all the way through the year 1999. So we see this current year, 2000, as a year of recovery at the same time that we take the moves that will position our business for the long-term. 

 GHARIB: All right, well, we thank you very much for talking to us this evening. 

 STAHL: Thank you, Susie. 

 GHARIB: Blue chips was able to hang on thanks to support in J.P. Morgan, 3M and Procter & Gamble (PG). On the big board the Dow edging up only three points to 11,032.

 SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Sun gets most of its revenue from sales of hardware, but the company that says it puts the dot in dot.com is also a market leader when it comes to software, the programs that make the machines work. In announcing the latest version of its Solaris operating system, Sun is moving aggressively to protect its market. One threat comes from Windows 2000, Microsoft`s next generation network operating system scheduled to be available next month. Another comes from Linux, which is available for free. To counter Linux, Sun is also making Solaris available free of charge. Sun will make money selling support services and hardware. It is also releasing the source code, just like Linux. To counter Microsoft, Sun argues technical superiority for Solaris. 

 ED ZANDER, PRESIDENT & COO, SUN MICROSYSTEMS: Windows 2000 is nothing more than a UNIX kernel that came from Dec. The designer is, it is UNIX. It`s a multi-threaded kernel but it`s 1995, 1995, 1996 features and technology in terms of scalability, robustness, availability. So we really feel we`re several years ahead of anything else in the marketplace because we`ve stayed committed to this particular product and platform. 

 GURVEY: Eight of the largest electronic commerce operations have agreed, selecting Sun to run their sites. A recent survey by industry newspaper "Computer World" puts Sun at the top of the reliability list, Microsoft at the bottom. With the new system, Solaris is able to handle 128 processors, Windows only 16. Solaris also has the sophisticated network and site management software major Internet businesses are demanding. Windows management tools are seen as primitive in comparison. 

 ART RUSSELL, COMPUTER ANALYST, EDWARD JONES: Sun is one of a handful of companies which include Oracle, EMC, and Cisco Systems that are providing the Internet infrastructure to build out this new economy. So I think you have to own these stocks. 

 GURVEY: It is no coincidence that Sun makes this announcement just as Microsoft is about to kick off a massive advertising campaign for Windows 2000. But most industry watchers believe the Solaris system`s scalability, that is, its ability to grow, will enable Sun to maintain its lead in Internet server software.

 GHARIB: Tomorrow, the prime mover behind a Web site that offers financial assistance for the wealthy. A new stock will trade on the big board tomorrow, John Hancock Financial (JHF). It was priced late today at $17 a share. The nation`s 13th largest life insurer will go public, offering 102 million shares. This is the final stage of John Hancock`s conversion from a policy holder mutual company to a stock company. And it`s renaming itself John Hancock Financial Services. It`s ticker symbol on the NYSE, JHF. 

 YASTINE: The chairman of DaimlerChrysler is driving off into the sunset on March 31st. Robert Eaton took the wheel at Chrysler as Chairman and CEO seven years ago. He presided over a successful stretch in the company`s history, including its merger with German car maker DaimlerBenz in November of 1998. Eaton says now is the right time to go, since the merger is complete. 

 GHARIB: What exactly do you buy when you buy a share of stock? The answer might surprise you. With tonight`s money file, here`s Eric Schurenberg, assistant managing editor of "Fortune" magazine. 

 ERIC SCHURENBERG, ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR, FORTUNE MAGAZINE: The science of security analysis has one fundamental law, it is that a stock has an intrinsic value independent of its market price. Because it entitles you to a share in the profits of a going concern, the stock is not like a baseball card which is worth just what someone would pay for it, instead it`s worth the total cash the business will throw off in the future adjusted for how long you have to wait to get the money. The market won`t vary from that intrinsic value indefinitely. Or, that`s the theory, anyway. Frankly, it hasn`t been much help for tech stocks in this market. How do you figure out the future profits of companies that barely have sales? And trying to fix a fair price for a company that everyone believes has unlimited potential isn`t just irrelevant, it`s rude. Even so, we asked the research firm of Stearns Stewart to take the current prices of certain Internet age stocks and figure out the profits the companies would have to earn to justify their prices using classic valuation models. What did we learn? Well, Microsoft would need to grow its profits 42 percent a year for the next 10 years, Cisco, 54 percent a year, Yahoo! 95 percent. Put another way, Microsoft`s current price implies that the company will earn $76 billion in profits a year forever. $76 billion is more than the 10 most profitable companies now make combined. Now, true believes say that could happen. In the Internet age, the old limits on growth don`t apply and it`s the believers, not the scientists, who are making money. So I won`t be foolish enough to say these stocks will never grow into their valuations. I`ll just say it`d be a miracle if they do. I`m Eric Schurenberg. 

 YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, the Dow gains 3 points, but the NASDAQ loses 97. And please join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword: NBR. 

 GHARIB: And finally tonight, it`s a classic clich. "You`re having a bad hair day." But researchers at Yale University now say there`s more to it than just a trite expression. A new study shows people`s self-esteem falls when their hair is messed up. They feel less smart, less capable, and less sociable. The effects also seem to be more pronounced in teenagers. But here`s the part that`s really interesting Jeff, the research shows men are more likely to be affected by a bad hair day than women. 

 YASTINE: So that`s why you use hairspray. That`s why you carry a can of hairspray around when you`re on t-v you have to feel good. 

 GHARIB: You`ve got a lot of hair and it always looks so.. I guess you don`t have bad hair days. 

 YASTINE: It won`t always be this way. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, January 26th. I`m Jeff Yastine. Goodnight, everyone. And good night to you, Susie. 

 GHARIB: Goodnight, Jeff. I`m Susie Gharib. We`ll see all of you again tomorrow night.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enough blue-chip names gained ground on upbeat profit performances to offset sharp declines in technology issues, as Wall Street unspooled another one of its quirky, dichotomous equity trading sessions. 

 Shares of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing increased 4 15/16 to 96 5/16, after the company came through with better fourth-quarter profit totals than Wall Street anticipated, and drew upbeat responses from analysts at Merrill Lynch and at Prudential Securities. 

 Kimberly-Clark also rose, gaining 2 11/16 to 64 15/16, after its first-quarter profit total outstripped forecasts, thanks to strong gains in sales across several of its product categories. 

 To be sure, share prices of some companies releasing earnings softened Wednesday, such as McDonald's, which missed Wall Street's consensus estimates by a penny a share. The stock finished 4 points lower at 35 13/16. 

 However, market averages got a big push from financial stocks, as analysts tried to lure investors to what has been a lagging sector of the market. Shares of Merrill Lynch, for example, increased 6 to climb to a closing price of 87, thanks in part to upbeat comments about the stock from analysts at Schroder and at Sanford C. Bernstein. 

 Traders also said that some of the trading volume typically attracted by technology stocks instead poured into financials, as some of the long-standing chatter about merger prospects, all of which has gone unrealized, emerged once again. Chase Manhattan increased 3 11/16 to 78 5/16, while J.P. Morgan rose 7 3/16 to 123 3/8. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished little changed in a choppy session, closing 3.10 points higher, a matter of just 0.03%, to 11032.99. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 11032.99, up 3.10. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,705 issues advancing, 1,344 declining and 461 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,110,783,420 shares, compared with 1,057,897,330 Tuesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 628.43, up 3.60. The average price per share rose 24 cents. 

 Financial stocks didn't come unhinged, as often has been the case recently, by the propspect of higher interest rates, but analysts said they saw evidence of the impact a fascination with interest rates can have in the way the market performed Wednesday. 

 "If you look at the performance of the market, year-to-date, the best performing sector has been utilities, followed by health care, energy and consumer staples - classic defensive sectors," Jeffrey Applegate, chief market strategist at Lehman Brothers, said Wednesday. "The market is in the process of discounting higher interest rates." 

 In fact, the Dow Jones Utility Average increased 4.46 points, a rise of 1.46%, to close at 310.33; for the year, the utility average has gained more than 8%. 

 The real standout in Wednesday's trading session proved to be the dramatic losses by high technology names, as investors reacted pessimistically to profit results and forecasts. 

 Shares of Qualcomm, the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shed 24 1/8 to 124 7/8. The wireless communications equipment maker posted fiscal first-quarter earnings late Tuesday that beat Wall Street's projections, but accompanied the profit statement with a warning of a slump in chip set sales, a key profit line. Wall Street served up a mixed reaction to the outlook; Lehman Brothers, for example, reiterated its buy rating on the stock, while Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney each cut ratings. 

 Other stocks, including some recent high-fliers, faltered badly. USinternetworking finished 6 1/4 lower at 52 3/4 on Nasdaq, despite a profit showing, issued late Tuesday, that topped what analysts had anticipated. 

 Electronic Arts also beat Wall Street's profit targets, but its shares closed 2 7/8 lower at 73 1/16, also on Nasdaq. 

 Retek, a company that develops software for some Internet applications, dropped 8 to 61 1/4 on Nasdaq, even though analysts said they liked what they saw in the company's fourth-quarter results. 

 BMC Software, an application software developer that previously warned Wall Street about soft profits, came in with fiscal first-quarter results that nevertheless fell short even of those lower targets. The profit statement came out late Tuesday. Shares of BMC lost 4 5/16 to 39 3/8 on Nasdaq. 

 To be sure, some high-technology issues won raves for their profit performance. RealNetworks beat profit targets with its fourth-quarter results, and said it planned to split its stock. Lehman Brothers, reiterating its buy rating on the stock, increased its revenue expectations by what the firm called a significant margin. RealNetworks finished 12 points higher at 169 7/8. 

 EBay also won over some buyers, gaining 16 1/16 to 153 9/16 on Nasdaq, after the online auction services concern beat analysts' fourth-quarter earnings projections, and offered an upbeat outlook. 

 Scientific-Atlanta ended 7 5/8 higher at 80 1/8, reaching another 52-week high. The Atlanta communications equipment concern posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings, and Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock. 

 However, for many stocks, the release of quarterly profits provided an opportunity to raise profits. Shares of Art Technology finished 3 points lower at 150 on Nasdaq, despite some intraday weakness, as investors reacted to the Internet products and services concern's fourth-quarter results, posted late Tuesday, in which it showed a narrower loss than analysts anticipated. Credit Suisse First Boston, citing the company's stronger-than-anticipated revenue growth, reiterated its buy rating on the stock. 

 EMC fell 9 3/8 to 110 5/8. The Hopkington, Mass., provider of computer storage products and services, reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat forecasts, though revenue from some segments came in at the low end of analysts' estimates. 

 Shares of Medtronic gained 1 9/16 to 46 1/8, while Healtheon/WebMD retreated 2 3/16 to 66 5/16 on Nasdaq, one day after the two companies announced a four-year partnership under which Medtronic, the Minneapolis medical-technology concern, will pay Healtheon/WebMD $50 million, and invest another $50 million in an international joint venture. PaineWebber also made some upbeat comments about Healtheon/WebMD, saying the company could turn profitable more quickly than it previously anticipated. 

 Amgen lost 5 1/4 to 64 1/8 on Nasdaq. The Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology concern reported fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday that beat Wall Street's forecasts by a penny a share, but analysts at PaineWebber reduced its 2000 earnings forecast, citing expected increases in operating expenses; nevertheless, the analysts called the increased spending a necessary investment. 

 Waste Management added 1/2 to 16 9/16. Company officials, meeting Wednesday with Wall Street analysts, shared some of its plans, such as a sale of its international divisions, aimed at turning around the troubled Houston waste-management concern. CS First Boston took an upbeat approach ahead of the meeting, saying that it believes the company's problems can be resolved. 

 Shares of Coca-Cola fell 2 13/16 to 63 1/16. The Atlanta beverage giant released fourth-quarter results that beat forecasts. However, Merrill Lynch lowered its earnings forecast on the company for this year, while Salomon Smith Barney said that it thinks Coca-Cola management will officially lower its volume and earnings growth expectations. 

 Ingersoll Rand gained 3 5/16 to 49 1/4. The Woodcliff Lake, N.J., makers of industrial equipment reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. 

 Texaco fell 2 7/16 to 54 1/4, after the energy giant posted fourth-quarter results that fell a little short of Wall Street's forecasts. 

 Robert Half International rose 10 1/16 to 38 1/16. Credit Suisse First Boston boosted its rating on the Menlo Park, Calif., provider of staffing services, after the company came through with fourth-quarter earnings that showed improvement over year-earlier totals. 

 Salton gained 5 to 44 3/4. The Mount Prospect, Ill., maker of home appliances and other consumer products, is slated to report earnings next Tuesday. Doug Raborn, a money manager in Del Ray Beach, Fla., said he expects the company to post stronger results than the company has said it would. Raborn said he believed some of Wednesday's sharp gains owed to a squeeze on short positions, as the stock continues to trade at a 52-week high. 

 Ford Motor fell 2 1/8 to 48, even though its fourth-quarter profits came in above Wall Street's projections. Analysts said that investors had interpreted some of the comments the company made to analysts as a warning that profits won't be as strong as analysts anticipated, and company officials later in the session said those comments weren't meant as a warning. 

 AK Steel dropped 3 13/16 to 12 3/8. The Middletown, Ohio, steel maker posted fourth-quarter results late Tuesday that matched Wall Street's forecasts. Credit Suisse First Boston cut its rating on the stock to a buy from a strong buy in the wake of the profit statement.

 Sector Spotlight Mixed Signals for Telecom Firms Wall St.: Tellabs is the latest to see slowing earnings and a falling stock price, but some analysts still see bright spots.

 The sizzling rally last year in telecommunications stocks is, within only a couple of weeks, rapidly fading from memory. 

 On Tuesday Tellabs Inc., a leading provider of gear for managing traffic on telephone networks, joined a growing list of telecom companies that are stumbling out of the gate in 2000 with disappointing financial results and plummeting stock prices. 

 The pullback hasn't been limited to companies that build the infrastructure "guts" that transmit voice, data and other signals. It's spread among several sectors of the telecom arena, as Wall Street and Main Street investors alike are growing increasingly skittish about the slowdown in the companies' red-hot growth. 

 Tellabs' warning not only followed a downbeat outlook from Lucent Technologies Inc. earlier this month, but it also came on the same day that AT&T Corp. posted lower fourth-quarter earnings, and the stock of SBC Communications Inc.--the holding company for Pacific Bell--fell to a 52-week low even though SBC posted a moderate rise in fourth-quarter profit. 

 Analysts cautioned that investors should be wary about throwing in the towel on these stocks, saying there are vast differences among these companies' problems and that it's by no means an industrywide slowdown in demand for telecom services and equipment. 

 Tellabs, based in Lisle, Ill., and some other telecom equipment giants are undergoing big and expensive shifts in product development and manufacturing to introduce new technologies that are, for now, slowing their growth, analysts said. 

 Estimating how long that transition will take is tricky, of course. But "you have an industry that continues to experience very healthy demand" for its products, said analyst Paul Silverstein of investment firm Robertson Stephens in New York. "The big trends are very much intact." 

 Long-distance carriers such as AT&T, MCI WorldCom Inc. and wireless phone companies also "are facing a more competitive environment, and that's good for the equipment companies because they [the carriers] will have to spend more" on new gear to keep pace with their rivals, said Steven Levy, an analyst with Lehman Bros. in New York. 

 All of which is why investors seemed clearly divided Tuesday about whether the telecom downturn is a bump in the road or a prolonged slump. 

 Tellabs' stock, which for several years has outperformed the general market by a wide margin, plunged $9.56 a share to close at $59.50 on Nasdaq, after the company warned that its first-quarter 2000 earnings will lag analysts' expectations. 

 AT&T's stock was down much of the session, but finished up 81 cents, to close at $51.31, and SBC dropped $2 a share, to close at $40, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Ciena Corp., another network-gear maker, fell $2.88 to close at $74 on Nasdaq. 

 But investors bid up some other telecom shares that have taken a drubbing so far in January. They included Lucent, which gained $2.13 a share to $55.69 on the NYSE, and MCI WorldCom, which had dropped 19% so far in January, regained $2.38 a share to $43.19 on Nasdaq. 

 Nortel Networks Corp., another major provider of telecom networking equipment and a Tellabs rival, gained $8.88 to $108.88 a share on the NYSE. Then, after the markets closed, the company posted a fourth-quarter profit, versus a year-earlier loss, and announced a 2-for-1 stock split. 

 Qualcomm Inc., a leader in wireless phone technology whose stock has tumbled 20% in January, illustrated the market's confusion Tuesday. 

 Qualcomm's stock rebounded during market hours with a gain of nearly $9 a share, to $149 on Nasdaq. But after the market closed, the San Diego-based company reported sharply higher fiscal first-quarter earnings but warned that it might ship fewer wireless-related chips and phones in its second quarter ending March 31 because of parts shortages and other factors. So, in after-hours trading, Qualcomm's stock plunged $12 to $137 a share. Three weeks ago, the stock stood at $200 a share. 

 In the equipment sector, analysts said there were clear differences between the announcements made by Tellabs and Lucent, even though both sent their stocks plummeting. 

 Tellabs' fourth-quarter results exceeded expectations, but its executives warned that the company's first-quarter earnings would come under pressure from a higher tax rate and added costs for rolling out enhanced versions of its equipment, including its flagship Titan brand. 

 That's actually a bullish sign, said analyst Levy, because the company "is spending some extra bucks to make sure the transition goes as smoothly as possible." 

 Also, Tellabs not only "has a long history of exceeding expectations, it also has a long history of guiding [analysts' forecasts] up" for future quarters, and that didn't happen Tuesday, said Silverstein. 

 But "it's not a warning flag," he said. "Most of it is due to [Tellabs'] investment in its business." 

 Lucent, on the other hand, warned earlier this month that it would miss Wall Street's forecasts for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31 for several reasons, including that it wouldn't be able to fulfill orders for some of its newest gear, including fiber-optic networks that expand customers' transmission capacity.

 Tampa, Fla.-Based Call Center Operator's Market Value Dives $1 Billion

 TAMPA, Fla.--Sykes Enterprises Inc. was the biggest loser of any company in the U.S. stock markets Tuesday, plunging a staggering $1-billion in value after saying it will fall well short of fourth-quarter earnings projections. 

 The share price of Sykes, which operates call centers that provide technical support, lost more than half its value, closing at $23, down $24.25. In one day, Sykes saw its market capitalization (stock price times shares outstanding) reduced by more than half to $980-million. 

 "This is quite a blow," said Stephen Shook, an analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte. In today's fast-moving markets, he said, "when you do have a slip, you pay an extra price." 

 The Tampa company warned that it expects fourth-quarter net income of 20 cents to 22 cents a share, much less than the 37-cent average forecast of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Sykes blamed the shortfall on the failure to close three contracts, an underperforming health-care unit and losses from weaker foreign currencies. 

 John Sykes, founder, chairman and chief executive, summed up his feelings in one word when the markets closed: "Terrible." 

 Sykes, the largest stockholder in the company with more than 18-million shares, suffered a paper loss of $436-million. 

 He said he was disappointed that the earnings warning interrupted Sykes' flawless record of meeting or exceeding Wall Street's earnings expectations every quarter since going public in April 1996. Yet, he was stunned by the market's severe reaction. 

 The punishment doled out on Sykes is part of a familiar trend of investors bailing out at the first sign of trouble. Money managers attribute the behavior to the "cockroach theory": If there is one, there are bound to be more. 

 Other Tampa Bay area companies have felt investors' wrath. Two years ago, Danka Business Systems PLC blindsided shareholders with an earnings warning and lost more than half its market value in one day. More recently, shares of IMR-global Corp. fell more than 30 percent in one day after the company lowered quarterly profit expectations. 

 Sykes' loss erased three months of market momentum that saw its share price run up to an all-time trading high of $52.25 two weeks ago. Investors were impressed with Sykes expanding array of services, including technical support for companies involved in electronic commerce. The new Internet clients added to Sykes' already impressive fleet of customers in the technology industry, such as Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp. 

 Sykes tried to dispel the notion that the warning is a sign of deeper troubles. "It was just one of those timing situations that caused this dilemma," he said. 

 The company said it could not close contracts with three unnamed customers in the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31 after Sykes had spent money preparing for the work. The delays cost the company about $10-million in revenues. 

 Sykes' health-care subsidiary, SHPS Inc., came up about $4-million short of revenue forecasts. The unit, which runs call centers for health-care providers, has not met expectations before. 

 The company is considering options for SHPS, which includes possibly shedding the unit, Sykes said. 

 Finally, the euro's fall against the dollar last year made currency conversion more expensive and reduced revenues by another $4-million. 

 Sykes expects fourth-quarter revenues of $160-million to $162-million, up from $142-million in the year-earlier period. The company earned 28 cents a share before onetime charges in the fourth quarter of 1998. 

 Sykes said the company expects to finalize the three contracts in the current quarter. As a result, the company expects to earn 40 cents a share in the first quarter, 10 cents more than analysts' estimates. For 2000, Sykes expects to earn as much as $1.59 a share, or 8 cents more than the average forecast. 

 There is added pressure to meet the increased expectations now that Sykes has damaged some credibility with investors. Even if the company hits the numbers, "it may take a while to get the premium back" in the stock market, Shook said.

 SMARTMONEY.COM: Earnings Season: Stop The Madness!

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It's earnings season, that lovely time when we are subjected to a dizzying array of numbers, facts and figures. Every January, April, July and October comes a surreal two-week period when the newswires are overflowing with earnings report after earnings report after earnings report. 

 But in the last couple of years, earnings season has become a confusing cacophony of jibba jabba (as the Mohawk-wearing 1980s pop-culture icon Mr. T might say). What should you focus on? 

 There are consensus earnings estimates, of course. But which consensus is the consensus? First Call numbers get the most press. But what about estimates compiled by Zacks, Nelson's or I/B/E/S? 

 Then there are the whisper numbers, the unofficial estimates that circulate around trading desks and often (especially in the case of high-tech companies) wind up being more important targets for companies to beat than the analysts' estimates. And for all those profit-deprived Internet companies out there, there are revenue estimates to consider. 

 I don't understand the whisper-number phenomenon and why it's more important for someone to beat an unofficial estimate. I mean, what are Wall Street analysts compiling estimates for? If companies are reporting earnings that are more in line with the whisper numbers (numbers which are typically higher than the consensus earnings estimates) why don't analysts start raising their numbers to match the whisper figures? 

 Furthermore, the overload of estimates, guesstimates and whisper numbers seems to be creating a very confused market, one where a company can beat expectations but see its stock fall because of extraneous concerns, while other companies do a little better than diminished expectations and are rewarded. 

 Just look at what happened last Thursday following the earnings reports of General Electric (GE) and General Motors (GM). 

 General Electric reported its best year ever and record earnings for the fourth quarter. The company even brought good things to life by beating the consensus estimate by a penny. But the stock slipped as much as 4% following the earnings report. Why? It appears that a statement in its earnings release about a gain from its NBC Internet (NBCI) media division confused some investors. Coincidentally, the Wall Street Journal had a report on its front page that day about companies that were using one-time investment gains in Internet companies to boost earnings. Never mind that the NBCi gain didn't contribute to GE's operating income. The stock wound up falling 1.9% for the day. 

 GM, on the other hand, reported a 34% drop in net income, attributed in part to lower production of its highly profitable sports utility vehicles and intense price competition in Europe. But the company beat estimates handily, and as a result its stock finished 1.6% higher for the day - after being up as much as 3% at one point. I'm not trying to suggest that GM should have gone down dramatically, but there's no reason for a company like GE to fall when announcing record earnings while GM is embraced for having a less disappointing quarter than expected. 

 Today's earnings landscape is even more puzzling. AT&T (T) reported an expected drop in net income, as General Motors did last week. It beat Wall Street estimates, as General Motors did. But unlike GM, it was down most of the day following the earnings news before finally rallying in the last hour (it finished up 1.2%). Meanwhile, Xerox (XRX) reported a 52% drop and beat diminished expectations by a penny (Xerox announced a warning in December) and its stock was in the green almost all day (it wound up a scant .9%). As Alice would say, curiouser and curiouser. 

 Then there's Raytheon (RTN.B). The troubled aerospace and defense contractor reported a stomach-churning 78.9% drop in fourth-quarter earnings and an 8% decline in revenue. It even missed expectations by a penny. Got pounded, right? Wrong. The stock enjoyed a 9% gain today. Granted, Raytheon has been dumped recently, falling about 22% since it announced a profit warning for the fourth quarter and all of this year a week ago. But given today's unimpressive results, why should the stock bounce back at all? 

 What does this all mean? I really think it's best for a long-term investor to avoid getting caught up in the quarterly earnings mish-mash. Of course, if you're someone who is actively trading stocks or have an investment horizon of only a few months, then you'll need to pay more attention to the quarterly earnings game. But for anyone who has a time frame that exceeds the lifespan of a fruit fly, your best bet is to look for companies that have consistently demonstrated solid earnings growth, regardless of whether or not they match whatever the consensus estimates are. 

 Really, what's better - a company that grows at 5% a year but beats First Call estimates, or one that grows 25% a year but has an occasional quarterly blip? Of course, you don't want a company that habitually disappoints Wall Street. But even the most solid of companies may occasionally run into a short-term problem that will prevent it from meeting or beating analysts' estimates. It is easy to get all bent out of shape about a less-than-spectacular quarter. But in general I'd take a company that does a good job managing its business over one that does a good job managing expectations any day.

 Special Report 
 DC GAMBLE: Bet pays off for high-tech :  The performance of their company stock made Lucent and Sprint high rollers; but other plans, like J.C. Penney, were not so lucky

 Participants in several high-tech companies with big defined contribution commitments to company stock gambled and won last year. Lucent Technologies, Sprint and Texas Instruments were among the companies whose defined contribution assets pushed them higher on or onto Pensions & Investments' list of the 200 largest U.S. pension funds last year. 

 Participants in Rockwell International's defined contribution plan also fared well, thanks to company stock prices. But employees of J.C. Penney weren't so lucky, as the share prices of their companies dragged down the value of their defined contribution plans. 

 As of Sept. 30, 36% of the assets in the defined contribution plans of the top 200 pension funds were invested in company stock, down from 41% in 1998 and 1997, according Pensions & Investments' survey of the 200 largest U.S. retirement funds. 

 Taking the most number of slots in the top 20 companies with the largest percentage of assets invested in the company stock options were utilities, energy-related companies and drug companies. The top three are Procter & Gamble with 96% of the $18.5 billion defined contribution plan invested in company stock, Pfizer with 88% of its $4.2 billion defined contribution plan in company stock and Abbott Laboratories with 87% of its $4.5 billion defined contribution plan invested in company stock. 

 But because technology-related stocks had a stellar year, those companies' defined contribution plans were some of the biggest gainers. As of Sept. 30, 62% of Sprint employees' defined contribution assets were in company stock and 79% of Texas Instruments employees' DC assets were there. Lucent Technologies had 35% of its assets in company stock the year before, according to Pensions & Investments' 1998 survey. 

 (Lucent declined to give the percentage of defined contribution assets invested in company stock in its 1999 survey response.) 

 The Nasdaq, which has a strong representation of technology stock issues, was up 86% in 1999, its highest yearly return ever, said Megan Graham-Hackett, director of technology research for Standard & Poor's. 

 The performance of technology stocks caused technology sector funds to top the charts with a triple-digit annual return of 122.93% for calendar 1999, according to figures released by Wiesenberger, a Thomson Financial Corp. company, New York. 

 However, it was harder for large-cap technology companies to double their stock prices than it is for startup counterparts, said Megan Graham-Hackett, director of technology research for Standard & Poor's. 

 A 210% jump in Texas Instruments Inc.'s stock price helped boost its 401(k) plan assets 129% -- to $4.8 billion from $2.1 billion -- between Sept. 30, 1998, and Sept. 30, 1999. At the same time, the portion of defined contribution plan assets invested in company stock increased to 79% from 63%. Company executives could not be reached for comment. 

 Meanwhile, Texas Instruments completed its acquisition of Unitrode Corp., an analog chip company on Oct. 15. 

 Sprint Corp.'s defined contribution plan was up almost 70% -- to close to $5 billion in 1999 from about $3 billion the year before -- in part because of a 51% increase in share price. At the same time the percentage of DC assets in company stock leaped to 62% from 40%. 

 In late 1998, Sprint assumed ownership and management control of Sprint PCS, which was formerly owned by Tele-Communications Inc., Cox Communications and Comcast Corp. In November 1998, the company recapitalized its common stock into tracking stocks that mirror its wireless PCS group and its wireline phone group, Sprint Phone Group. By the end of the year, Sprint terminated the PCS 401(k) plan and merged it with the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan, according to documents the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 The company did not return calls for comment by press time. 

 In October, Sprint Corp. agreed to be acquired by MCI WorldCom Inc. in a $130 billion transaction that is expected to close by the end of this year. Under the merger agreement, each Sprint Phone Group share would be exchanged for $76 of MCI WorldCom stock; and each PCS share would be exchanged for one new WorldCom PCS tracking share and 0.1547 of an MCI WorldCom share. 

 Analysts at Standard & Poor's say that if the MCI WorldCom merger goes through the stock should do even better. 

 "PCS's strong brand name, combined with the backing of its well-known parent company, make the shares very attractive," according to a stock report by Standard & Poor's. "These positive factors should only be enhanced by the backing of future parent company WorldCom, which offers one of the most impressive growth stories in the investment community." 

 Lucent surge 

 Although Lucent Technologies Inc.'s 87% surge in stock price between Sept. 30, 1998, and Sept. 30, 1999, helped its defined contribution assets rise 55% to $21.2 billion, so far in 2000 Lucent's stock has had a rockier time. On Jan. 7, the stock price tumbled 23% after the company announced that its first-quarter profit will fall. However, analysts at Standard & Poor's said that the factors leading to the drop in stock price is temporary and predict that the stock will have "a strong second half." This was the first such earnings warning since Lucent spun off from AT&T Corp. in 1996. 

 As of Sept. 30, 1998, 35% of Lucent's defined contribution assets were in company stock, according to Money Market Directory. 

 This month, a class-action suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of people who purchased Lucent's common stock between Oct. 27 and Jan. 6. The complaint alleges that company directors and executive officers issued false information about Lucent's "deteriorating financial condition" and the effects they would ultimately have on the company's stock price. As a result, the Lucent stock price was artificially inflated for three months, the suit claims. When the truth was disclosed, Lucent stock dropped more than $20 per share, the complaint alleges. 

 Lucent, through a spokesman, declined to comment. 

 Rockwell International Corp.'s defined contribution assets skyrocketed 104% to $5.5 billion between Sept. 30, 1998, and Sept. 30, 1999, in part because of its own stock and that of related companies, according to P&I data. About 30% of plan assets in 1999 were in company stock, down from 45% in 1998. During the past year, the fund spun off the pension assets of employees of its aerospace and defense business, which in 1996 was sold to Boeing Co., Seattle. 

 Rockwell also spun off its semiconductor business to shareholders. The shares of the new business, Conexant Systems Inc., began trading Dec. 31, 1998, and in 1999 increased in value 600%, according to company stock history. The increase of Conexant stock --comprising 16 percentage points of the 30% of total assets in company stock -- which remains in Rockwell's defined contribution plan, and the increase of Rockwell stock by 45% between Sept. 30, 1998, and Sept. 30, 1999, caused the increase, said a source knowledgeable about the company. 

 The downside 

 J.C. Penney Co. Inc. illustrates the downside of heavy company stock allocations in defined contribution plans. Its stock dropped 23% between Sept. 30, 1998, and Sept. 30, 1999. At the same time, with 42% of plan assets invested in company stock, the 401(k) plan's total assets dropped 7% to $3.6 billion. 

 Company executives could not be reached for comment. 

 "Participants see owning company stock as a patriotic duty and they are going a little bit overboard," said David Blitzer, chief investment strategist for the research group Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill Cos., New York. 

 Standard & Poor's recommends to plan sponsors that participants should invest no more than 15% of their 401(k) assets in company stock and that company stock investment be available only to participants who are growth and aggressive growth investors, Mr. Blitzer said. Moreover, if Standard & Poor's equity analysts have a "sell" recommendation on a stock, the firm will not include the company stock in any asset allocation suggestions to plan participants, he added. 

 "Any single stock is more risky than a diversified mutual fund," said Mr. Blitzer. "We remind people that some of them may have a big stake in the company stock outside their 401(k) plan and they should think about that." 

 Plan sponsors may not have a legal duty to protect participants from overinvesting in company stock, he said, "but one could argue they have a moral duty." 

 Company executives do not want to be told that the good news is that 90% of employees have money invested in company stock but the bad news is that the stock went down 10%, Mr. Blitzer said. The question consultants and companies debate is what the fix should be or whether one is needed. 

 "The worst way to deal with company stock is to give people rules of thumb," on how much defined contribution assets should be invested in company stock, said William J. Arnone, partner at consulting firm Ernst & Young LLP, New York. "It's an irresponsible approach." 

 If employees want to purchase more company stock because they know the business well, they know the stock well, understand the risks and still want to invest in it, the plan sponsor's education has worked, Mr. Arnone said. "The danger is when participants are highly invested in company stock and do not know how they got there and do not know that they are in it," he said. "That's where the education has failed." 

 And many employees view company stock as a way of "getting in the game," said Tom Rossi, consultant at Watson Wyatt & Co. If their company grows, they can share in that growth, he said. 

 `A fixed income' 

 For their part, plan sponsors look at company stock in different ways, Mr. Rossi said. 

 "Some employers look at it like a fixed income," he said. 

 This is especially the case in the utility or electric industries where stock prices have been stable and companies view their stock as a "safety net," Mr. Rossi said. 

 Other employers encourage employee investment in company stock so that it can be held in so-called "friendly hands," he said. 

 "From an investment perspective that could be a concern that participants are not diversifying," Mr. Rossi said. 

 Still, employers who also offer defined benefit plans may be less concerned because the pension plan could offset the added risk taken in the company's 401(k) plan, he explained. 

 Even companies whose stock has performed well may be concerned. A person set to retire at age 65 may be tempted to retire at 55 if the stock price has doubled, said Gregory D. Metzger, consultant and national practice leader at Watson Wyatt.

A simmering transatlantic trade dispute over tougher aircraft noise rules in Europe could boil over again following a U.S. request to international regulators to reject a European Union law that would bar many older U.S. planes from using European airports. 

A European Commission spokesman said last week that the U.S. move "complicated" efforts to resolve the dispute, which came to a head last year only to be deferred by calls for fresh negotiations. 

He was commenting after the U.S. government asked the Montreal- based International Civil Aviation Organization to oppose a new European regulation which would limit the use of aging aircraft fitted with noise-reducing mufflers or "hushkits." 

Washington wants the Montreal group to force Brussels to scrap the law, due to come into force in May, which is aimed at reducing noise around congested European airports. U.S. officials have warned the European Union that it could face sanctions if it refused to abolish the law. 

Aga Khan's Meridiana line is looking for purchaser 

Italy's largest private airline, Meridiana, has put itself up for sale. 

The airline announced Friday that it is seeking a buyer for the 79 percent stake owned by the airline's founder, the Aga Khan. The airline said it is especially interested in a European partner. 

Aerospatiale Matra SA says it will post a good profit 

Aerospatiale Matra SA, Europe's second-biggest aerospace and defense company, said it will post a better-than-forecast 1999 operating profit, indicating that it has made good progress in trimming costs as it knits together the former rivals Aerospatiale and Matra. 

The French company, formed through the merger of state-owned Aerospatiale SA and Lagardere SCA's Matra defense arm last June, said it will post a 5 percent sales increase for 1999, benefiting from record deliveries at planemaker Airbus Industrie. New orders fell 15 percent, though, tracking a decline in demand at Airbus. 

Airbus picks Mitsui &Co. to market planes in Japan 

Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European planemaker, said it has chosen Mitsui &Co., Japan's largest trading company, to market its planes in Japan. The group said it estimates that Japanese demand for 660 new aircraft will be worth $90 billion in the next 20 years. 

Raytheon Co. says delays will hurt profit forecast 

Raytheon Co., the third-biggest U.S. defense contractor, warned for a third time since September that it expects quarterly and 2000 profit to be less than forecast because of production delays on 19 aircraft and higher interest and banking fees. 

Raytheon's Oct. 12 warning that sales and profit will be less than forecast triggered a 44 percent stock drop, its biggest tumble in at least two decades. 

The company also will restate its earnings for the last three years. 

Rising fuel costs take toll on profits for U.S. airlines 

Last week, US Airways Group Inc., the No. 6 U.S. airline, said it lost a greater-than-expected $47 million, excluding unusual items in the fourth quarter, heightened by a 60 percent rise in fuel costs. 

US Airways Group also said it expects a first-quarter loss due to capacity issues, passenger concerns over past operational problems and contract uncertainties with its flight attendants. 

Meanwhile, AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, announced last week fourth-quarter profits before one-time items fell 37 percent, as skyrocketing fuel costs and a New Year's traffic lull sparked mainly by Y2K fears dampened results. 

Operating earnings, at 69 cents a diluted share, nevertheless beat the consensus view of analysts, who had on average forecast earnings of 61 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

UAL Corp. said Wednesday that net income before special items rose 22 percent in the fourth quarter on a fully distributed basis, despite rising fuel costs and depressed traffic at the end of the year. And Continental Airlines reported stronger-than-expected results for the final quarter of 1999, but warned that higher fuel prices could put it in the red in the first quarter of this year.

 MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- First fiscal quarterly profits for Lucent Technologies profit sank 23 percent, coming in shy of Wall Street forecasts that were already slashed after a warning two weeks ago by the world's top manufacturer of communications equipment. 

 Operating income for the former division of AT&T, employer of 4,500 in Oklahoma City, totaled $1.18 billion, or 36 cents per share, during the three months ended Dec. 31. Those figures don't reflect certain one-time gains and expenses unrelated to Lucent's core business that gave the company a net profit of $1.2 billion, or 38 cents a share, for the quarter. 

 In the same period in 1998, Lucent earned $1.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, also excluding one-time events. 

 Revenues for the quarter edged higher to $9.9 billion from $9.8 billion a year earlier. 

 The operating profit was at the lower end of the range suggested in Lucent's warning on Jan. 6. Analysts, most of whom were caught off guard by that announcement, had reduced their forecasts to about 37 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Lucent pinned the results on weak software revenues, customer delays in deploying network equipment, and Lucent's inability to keep up with demand for its fast new fiber-optic gear. 

 "Lucent left the front door open for their competitors to walk right through, and Nortel and Ciena took advantage," said David Powers, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, referring to two of Lucent's top rivals in developing fiber-optic gear to speed up the flow of voice and data traffic on the Internet and other networks. 

 Powers said the earnings report was mostly in line with Lucent's Jan. 6 forecast, although the company's gross profit margin came in slightly lower than he expected -- down 11 percent to $4.65 million.

For-profit schools meet success, problems; 3 firms seeking foothold in the Capital Region

When Aaron Dare first started talking about opening a charter school in Albany's Arbor Hill neighborhood, he thought it would take well over a year before the first children entered its doors.

But after the local Urban League president talked to officials from Advantage Schools, a school management company based in Boston, he grew confident the school could open faster. In September - nine months after the state Legislature approved a law allowing charter schools in New York - New Covenant Charter School opened its doors.

Now, dissatisfied with Advantage's response to parents' complaints about discipline and overcrowding, Dare and the rest of the school's board are wondering whether they made the right choice.

And the difficult start-up at New Covenant highlights one of the most controversial issues involving charter schools - the role of the for-profit companies that run many of them.

Charter schools are publicly funded, but they're free from most of the regulations that other public schools have to follow. Designed to encourage innovation, they've spread rapidly since the first charter schools opened in Minnesota and California in the early 1990s.

groups started many of the early charter schools, but for-profit companies quickly carved out a healthy share of the charter school market. Of the nearly 1,700 charter schools now open in the United States, an estimated 10 per

cent are run by for-profit companies.

Three of those companies now have a presence in the Capital Region, or are trying to establish one.

Sabis Educational Systems, the U.S. division of an international company, is working with area residents to open a charter school in Schenectady.

Edison Schools, based in New York City, is in talks with the Schenectady public schools about running one or more of the district's schools, or teaming up with the district to open a charter school.

Success and problems

These companies - along with other prominent players in the school management field - can point to successes at some schools they've run. But they've run into problems in some of their schools, too.

And one case involving Sabis shows it's not easy or painless to sever a contract with a school management firm if things don't work out.

After a series of administrative and communication problems, Sabis lost its contract to run two charter schools in Chicago just over a year ago. It's now suing the schools' founders for breach of contract.

Sabis has the longest track record of any of the school management companies. It's run by a family in Lebanon, where its first school was founded in 1886. Sabis now runs 22 schools worldwide, including a private school it founded 15 years ago in Minnesota, and bases its U.S. operations in Eden Prairie, Minn.

The company manages three charter schools in Massachusetts and one in Michigan, and plans to open four more charter schools this fall, if it wins approval for the Schenectady school.

State University of New York trustees are scheduled to vote Tuesday on Sabis' application for the International Charter School of Schenectady, along with 16 other charter school proposals.

Sabis officials maintain the company lost its contract in Chicago, where it was hired by a non-profit foundation in 1997, because of disagreements with the schools' founders over Sabis' approach. And they say the charter schools the company runs elsewhere are doing well.

They note that in Massachusetts, the state Board of Education last year renewed the charter of the Sabis International Charter School in Springfield.

Sabis' Springfield school opened five years ago, when the company turned an existing public school into a charter school. The school it took over wasn't a particularly problematic one - on most measures, its performance fell in the middle of the Springfield schools, although its fourth-grade test scores were second-lowest among the district's 31 elementary schools in its last year as a traditional public school.

School turns around

The school, which now runs from kindergarten through 11th grade, currently posts test scores on par with the top fourth of the city's public schools, said John Howell, director of research for the Springfield Public Schools.

All Sabis schools put a strong emphasis on English and math, and teach foreign language starting in kindergarten. Students have to show they've mastered a topic before they can move on to the next one, an approach Sabis officials say prevents them from falling behind.

Although charter schools are billed as a way to encourage innovation, many of Sabis' methods seem downright traditional.

The students usually sit in straight rows, with all eyes expected to be on the teacher.

But students are given outlets for their creativity. Some of the Springfield students have designed their own school activities as part of Sabis' "student life" program. Springfield eleventh-grader Roxanna Myhrum developed a course to teach fellow students to build puppets and perform with them.

"It's a lot more student responsibility," Myhrum said of her school. "Even though I'm tagged for being in the hall without a pass, I don't get, 'What are you doing, why aren't you in your room?' "

A teacher at the Springfield elementary school said she found the Sabis approach isn't as regimented as she'd feared.

"I thought it would be very stressful for me as a beginning teacher. When I came here, it was such a relaxed environment. I saw the teachers weren't just like robots. They were sitting with students, helping students where they needed it," Deb Thibodeau said.

Some wariness

Despite the apparent success Sabis has had in Springfield, its experience in Chicago makes some wary of how well the company would run the proposed charter school in Schenectady and another, already approved charter school in Flushing scheduled to open this fall.

"I'm not real sanguine about Sabis' track record. It's checkered at best," said state Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan, who chairs the Assembly's Education Committee.

The sponsors of the proposed charter school in Schenectady are looking over the court records to find out more about what happened in Chicago, said Michael Van Patten of Schenectady, chairman of the school's eight-member board.

But he said they're confident they won't run into the same kinds of issues here because many of the board members have business expertise themselves.

Van Patten, commanding general of the New York State National Guard, is also an accountant and accounting professor at Siena College. Another board member of the proposed Schenectady school is Lewis Golub, chairman and CEO of the company that runs Price Chopper supermarkets.

"I think because of the makeup and strength of the board, those things won't happen. We're dealing with Sabis as a business partner, but at arm's length," he said.

Yet it was Sabis officials who recruited Van Patten to the board of the Schenectady charter school, and who came up with the idea of opening one here in the first place.

Ruth Kellogg - a city resident and former Capital Region BOCES superintendent - and her husband Allen Anderson returned from working at Sabis schools in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to help Sabis branch out into charter schools.

Schenectady school officials oppose the charter school proposal, largely because the state's charter school law requires the district to provide the money for the school's operating expenses. That could cost the cash-strapped Schenectady district $5.9 million in the first year, including the transportation and special education services it must provide.

Edison invited

In an ironic turn of events, the district's response has been to turn to another for-profit school management company, Edison Schools.

School districts elsewhere have agreed to have Edison manage one or two schools with low test scores, to see if the company's design can turn those schools around while keeping them within the public school system.

In other cases, districts have joined with Edison to start new charter schools.

Schenectady schools Superintendent Raymond Colucciello and several other school officials visited Edison's headquarters in New York City last November. Next month, they're planning to visit one of its charter schools in Worcester, Mass.

Colucciello said Edison could help offset the "devastating" effect a charter school would have on the district's finances and programs. The company provides staff training for the schools it runs and provides a home computer to every child in third grade and above.

Edison Schools, founded in 1991 by media entrepreneur Christopher Whittle as the Edison Project, runs 26 charter schools and 53 traditional public schools. Together, the schools enroll some 38,000 students.

Packaged curriculum

All Edison schools use a packaged curriculum that includes Success for All, a 90-minute per day, highly scripted reading program, and Everyday Mathematics, developed at the University of Chicago.

Edison has approached at least one other area school district -Albany, which is already feeling the financial strain of a charter school. But school officials there don't see the company as the solution to their problems.

Superintendent Lonnie Palmer said hiring Edison wouldn't work in the Albany schools, where parents and teachers expect to have a strong influence over how schools run.

"The [school] board is sensing pretty clearly the community wants a say in its own destiny," he said. If parents and school staff said they "think Edison makes sense, that would be different," Palmer said.

Dare, the founder of New Covenant, at first didn't like the idea of hiring a school management company. But Advantage impressed him when it took him to see its school in Jersey City, N.J. There, the students seemed disciplined and engaged in learning, he said.

But he said New Covenant is having trouble responding to the needs of its students.

Board members are "seeking a change in the relationship with Advantage," and considering whether to try to run the school without a management company at all, he said. He noted that the school's trustees include former school administrators.

"We have the experience, if the board decided, to run the school ourselves," he said.

The school's trustees, who last December said they would give Advantage two months to address problems there, are meeting Thursday to discuss what to do next.

Steven Wilson, Advantage Schools' chief executive officer, said the company is addressing the problems at New Covenant.

"Many of the problems stem from a five-week period where there wasn't a school director on site, after the acting director left and Gly Johnson [the new director] came on board," he said. Johnson began running the school at the beginning of this month.

Johnson has begun hiring more instructional assistants to help with discipline, and has found new modular classrooms to ease overcrowding, Wilson said.

Unlike Edison and Sabis, Advantage has focused solely on charter schools since it got started in 1997.

Direct Instruction

The company's "Advantage Design," which it now uses at 16 schools throughout the country, includes required school uniforms and a longer school day and school year, as well as a tightly scripted method of teaching reading, writing and math called Direct Instruction.

The company hasn't made a profit yet, but hopes to do so by 2001, when it expects to run 25 to 30 schools, Wilson said.

Yet with 79 schools, Edison Schools still isn't making a profit, as many observers note. Edison is the biggest and perhaps the most closely watched player in the school management field, especially since it went public last fall. It hopes to raise as much as $172 million through its stock offering to finance its growth.

Edison officials have said they hope to turn a profit as they add schools and start to realize economies of scale. Yet in the company's stock prospectus, it cautions: "We have not yet demonstrated that public schools can be profitably managed by private companies, and we are not certain when we will become profitable, if at all."

In fact, the whole idea that managing public schools can be a profit-making enterprise is subject to question, said Henry Levin, a researcher at Teachers College of Columbia University.

"If Edison is going to survive, it's got to cut costs. They have 79 [schools] now and they're still running a huge deficit. Basically, we don't have proof profits can be made while providing a strong education," said Levin, who runs the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Teachers College.

More oversight

Sanders said he's generally uncomfortable "with the notion that public schools should be run on a profit margin" because he think companies might cut corners to make money.

But the companies and their supporters say that isn't likely to happen, because then the schools' quality would suffer and they would lose students, and ultimately their contracts.

Whether companies ultimately succeed at making a profit off charter schools, some political leaders want more oversight of just how they do it.

"One of the things that can and should be done is auditing [charter schools], especially for-profit schools, so we can better understand what we're spending," Assemblyman Sanders said.

James Murphy, president of the non-profit foundation in Chicago that fired Sabis as manager of its two charter schools, gives other charter school founders this warning about school management firms: Be careful.

He said charter school founders should carefully investigate the company they hire, keep control of the funding and set specific goals.

"Ultimately, the not-for-profit [sponsor] is responsible," Murphy said.

That's the same advice offered by Greg Richmond, who oversees charter schools for the Chicago Public Schools.

Sabis has a good track record elsewhere, he said, but their experience in Chicago shows charter school organizers have to stay in charge of their schools.

"Anybody that hires a company to run a school should have concerns, and realize they can't leave the company totally alone and turn their back and do something else," Richmond said.

 WARNER-LAMBERT CO. asked Procter & Gamble Co., the biggest U.S. maker of household goods, to consider a combination, a person familiar with the situation said. The move could put pressure on Pfizer Inc. to boost its unsolicited $78 billion bid for the drugmaker. Warner Lambert shares rose $47/8 to $947/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, higher than the current value of Pfizer's bid. The exploratory talks included Warner-Lambert's would-be merger partner, American Home Products Corp., the person said. The three-way combination would vault Procter & Gamble to the top ranks of the world's pharmaceutical companies.

 General Electric Co.'s fourth-quarter profit rose 16 percent, driven by sales of higher-margin service contracts at industrial businesses and advertising at the NBC television network. Net income climbed to $3.09 billion, or 93 cents a share, from $2.67 billion, or 80 cents, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 15 percent to $32.9 billion from $28.6 billion, more than the 10 percent to 12 percent analysts expected, as GE increased market share at existing businesses and through acquisitions. GE is boosting margins by doing business over the Internet and selling more service contracts, which have higher margins than selling industrial products alone.

 MORE DIVERGENCE: DOW STRUGGLES, NASDAQ ROLLS 

 Blue-chip stocks fell steeply yesterday amid worries that rising interest rates will ultimately cut into corporate earnings, while signs of strong growth from leading technology companies boosted the Nasdaq further into record territory. 

 Stocks rose at the opening bell after IBM easily beat Wall Street's profit forecasts. 

 "Investors seem to feel that as long as the technology companies are projected to grow 40 or 50 percent per year, who cares about interest rates?" said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. "More mature companies can't possibly grow at that rate." SHERRER REPLACES MILTON ON PORT BOARD 

 Gov. Jeb Bush has appointed Linda Sherrer, the president of a local real estate company, to serve on the board of the Jacksonville Port Authority. 

 Sherrer replaces Citibank executive Teala Milton, who left the seven-member board to spend more time at her job. Sherrer's four-year term has already begun, although the appointment still needs to be officially confirmed by the state Senate. 

 Sherrer is the president of Prudential Network Realty of Northeast Florida, a real estate firm serving the Jacksonville area. In addition to the port, Sherrer also serves on boards with the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce, the Jacksonville Woman's Network and the Museum of Science and History.

 ABC, New York Times announce news alliance 

 NEW YORK - ABC News and the New York Times are the latest media heavyweights to announce a news alliance, saying Thursday they will collaborate on a daily political Webcast and share other resources. 

 Journalists from the Times will appear on ABC News broadcasts and help the network produce technology and health stories for "20/20" and "Good Morning America." 

 The agreement follows by two months a similar deal announced by NBC and the Washington Post. ABC, CBS and Fox last month also said they were sharing video footage of domestic news stories. 

 First-quarter profit falls 23 percent at Lucent 

 MURRAY HILL, N.J. - Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's No. 1 phone-equipment maker, said fiscal first-quarter profit dropped 23 percent as sales stalled on lower demand for some products and delayed shipments of others. 

Profit from operations for the quarter ended Dec. 31 dropped to $1.18 billion, or 36 cents a share, from $1.52 billion, or 48 cents, in the year-ago period. Lucent said in a warning two weeks ago that profit was 36 cents to 39 cents a share. Sales were little changed at $9.91 billion, compared with $9.84 billion in the same period last year. 

 Sears earnings rise, sales up slightly 

 CHICAGO - Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s fourth-quarter profits rose 38 percent from a year ago, benefiting from healthy sales gains at its department stores despite spending less on holiday promotions. 

 Sears, the nation's second biggest retailer behind Wal-Mart, cited especially strong sales in appliances and electronics and significant growth at Sears Canada stores. Men's and women's apparel sales, meanwhile, slumped. 

 The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company reported Thursday that net income for the quarter ended Jan. 1 was $740 million, or $1.98 a share, compared with $535 million, or $1.39 a share, for the same period a year earlier. 

 Delta, Northwest join in ticket price boost 

 CHICAGO - Delta Air Lines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corp. joined in adding $10 each way to ticket prices to ease the impact of rising jet-fuel costs Thursday, as the increase spread to all of the five largest U.S. carriers. 

 Continental Airlines Inc. on Tuesday initiated the increase on U.S. flights starting Feb. 1. UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines raised fares Wednesday. 

 New catalyst may mean better, different plastics 

 WASHINGTON - A team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology has developed improved catalysts that could lead to new and better plastics. 

 The new, nickel-based, catalysts are less sensitive to impurities than those currently used in plastic-making, meaning they should be easier to use and would allow for the formation of new types of plastic, said Todd Younkin, a member of the team whose work is reported in Thursday's issue of the journal Science. 

 Mannesmann spurns Vodafone offer 

 LONDON - The hint of a sweetened takeover offer by Vodafone AirTouch PLC wasn't enough to win a truce Thursday with beleaguered executives at Germany's Mannesmann AG. 

 Mannesmann spurned its British rival's suggested offer of 49 percent control over a combined telecommunications company. 

 Vodafone's implied compromise is a "marginal" change from its standing offer of 47.2 percent and remains "wholly inadequate," a Mannesmann spokesman said. 

 Mannesmann's rejection followed a sign that Vodafone, the world's leading mobile phone company, was willing to increase its $158 billion offer.

 Southern Co. met Wall Street expectations Thursday by reporting fourth-quarter net income of $123 million, after $20 million in one-time expenses, and wrapped up 1999 with record yearly profits. 

 Southern reported net income of $1.28 billion, or $1.86 per share, for 1999, compared with $977 million, or $1.40 per share, for 1998. Revenue was $11.59 billion, an increase from $11.4 billion in 1998. 

 Income from operations, which excludes one-time items and is closely watched on Wall Street, was $1.90 per share. That was an 8 percent increase from $1.76 for 1998. 

 A.W. "Bill" Dahlberg, chairman and chief executive, said the company exceeded its internal financial target of $1.85 earnings per share and reached its target of 8 percent growth ahead of schedule. 

 "We delivered," Dahberg said, expressing hope that investors will reward the company by boosting its launguishing stock price. "I believe we are well-positioned to continue our success through 2000 and beyond." 

 The company expects to earn $2.05 a share this year, another 8 percent increase, said Allen Leverett, vice president of financial planning and analysis. 

 Dahlberg noted that Southern Energy Inc., the subsidiary that runs international operations and unregulated U.S. businesses, accounted for $328 million, or 26 percent, of Southern's 1999 bottom line. Despite economic turmoil in Asia, a 150 percent increase in profits from that region accounted for 14 percent of the parent company's profit, he said. 

 Southern said fourth-quarter net income of $123 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with a loss of $52 million, or 8 cents, for the 1998 fourth quarter, when the company took $200 million in write-down for underperforming South American investments. 

 Revenue for the fourth quarter was $2.62 billion, compared with $2.54 billion for the 1998 comparable period. 

 Results for the quarter included a one-time $34 million charge for work force reductions at Berliner Kraft und Licht, the Berlin utility in which Southern has a 26 percent stake. That was offset by a one-time $14 million gain from an insurance settlement from an explosion and fire at the company's power plant in Hammond, Ind. 

 Fourth-quarter earnings from operations -- which exclude the one-time items -- totaled $143 million, or 22 cents per share. That was a 24 percent decline from $188 million, or 27 cents per share, reported for the 1998 fourth quarter. The decline was attributed mostly to accounting changes. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had marked down their average forecast for quarterly operating income from 28 cents a share to 22 cents following an October warning from Southern that fourth-quarter profit would be less than expected. 

 Southern attributed that decline Thursday mostly to new accounting procedures for accelerated depreciation on power plants that were part of Georgia Power Co.'s 1998 rate settlement with the Public Service Commission. Southern also cited a shift in operations and maintenance expenditures last year to the fourth quarter. 

 Southern shares closed Thursday at $23.81 1/4, down 12 1/2 cents.

 I almost never disagree with Joe Morgenstern, this newspaper's estimable movie critic, but I must take issue with him on "Any Given Sunday," the Oliver Stone-directed pro-football film now making the rounds. He found it "hugely entertaining," I didn't. I thought it was too long, too loud and cliche-ridden, and the sport it depicted resembled a video game more than the actual one. I'm tempted to call it "football on steroids," but that would make it seem more real than it is. 

 Nevertheless, it's a rare thing that's without some virtues, and "Sunday" has a few, not the least of which is the chance it gave Ralph Barone to realize a lifelong ambition. As the football double for the quarterback character played by the actor Dennis Quaid, he got to rock and roll with some of the big-timers in the sport. 

 Sure, it was "only" a movie, and, sure, it wasn't the National Football League. Indeed, the film's producers were rebuffed when they asked the NFL for permission to use its symbols and logos. But being a member of the "Miami Sharks," the fictional team around which the drama revolves, was thrill enough for the 28-year-old schoolteacher. Says he: "I got to throw passes to Terrell Owens [the San Francisco 49er wide receiver and fellow player-actor] and hang out a bit with Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown [former NFL greats who had substantial roles]. I'll definitely want to tell my grandchildren about it." 

 Now, there are several things you should know about Mr. Barone, but one of the most important of those is his devotion to the gridiron game. Many American men play organized football at the kid or high-school levels, but the vast majority are more than happy to drop out in favor of a stadium seat and lifetime post as a Monday-morning quarterback when the hits get too nasty. Only a relative handful persists as far as college, and aside from the bionic few who are NFL material, not many venture beyond that. 

 Mr. Barone is part of that last group. Growing up in Schenectady, N.Y., he was a quarterback of note in high school, but his average-guy stature (he says that he stands 5-feet-10-and-9/10-inches tall) and left-handedness discouraged major-college recruiters. He went instead to a local junior college where he starred in football, but, alas, emerged from there still average in height and still left-handed. The college that showed the most interest in him was Northeastern University in Boston, which plays at the I-AA level, a notch below the highest one. That was because the head coach there, Barry Gallup, as a Boston College assistant, had coached the diminutive All-American quarterback Doug Flutie and saw young Mr. Barone playing in a similar, mobile mold. 

 Mr. Barone didn't disappoint, setting passing and total-offense records and receiving All-New England honors in his two years at Northeastern, but, again, the next level proved elusive. He signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, in which Mr. Flutie once performed, but was cut in training camp, and a tryout with an Arena League team had the same result. A gig with a team in an American-football league in Italy ended when he separated a shoulder in his fifth game. 

 But he wasn't done with football, nor was football done with him. He's played for the last four years with the Marlboro Shamrocks, a rough-and-tough semipro club based in a Boston suburb. It's a good team -- the champion of its national federation in three of those four years -- but is professional in name only. "We get a nice banquet at the end of the season, and our owner picks up our bar bills after games, but that's about it," says Mr. Barone. "It's for guys who can't bear the thought of hanging it up, which, I guess, describes me." 

 That was why, when the movies beckoned, he answered. Being shortish and left-handed might have been a liability on real gridirons, but they were an asset for "Sunday" because actor Quaid also is both, and Mr. Barone got the part as his double. Single and otherwise unattached, he packed his suitcase and headed for Miami, where the movie was shot. With the 40 or so other young men who played most of the action-scene parts, he was at it for six months, from November 1998 to last May. 

 Movies are made so seamlessly these days it's impossible to spot Mr. Barone when he's filling in for Mr. Quaid. "When he's in the huddle, calling signals or fading back, it's him, but when he's throwing, it's me," Mr. Barone summarizes. 

 It also was him being tackled a few times, but even though he volunteered to take a couple of the film's more spectacular hits (graphically dubbed a "sandwich" and a "helicopter"), trained stunt men were called. "I'd have gotten stunt man's pay of about $1,500 a day to do those, instead of the $250 a day I was making, but when I watched those guys work I decided they earned their money," he allows. 

 Mr. Barone has seen the movie, and while he liked it he was disappointed in the way his part turned out. Mr. Quaid's role in the final cut was reduced in favor of a bigger one for Jamie Foxx, who plays Mr. Quaid's brasher young rival, so Mr. Barone's scenes also were reduced. A line he spoke as an extra in a locker room scene likewise wound up on the cutting-room floor. But he was on-screen wearing No. 11 in several sideline shots, and got a "bonus" when one of his niftier spirals was shown coming out of Mr. Foxx's hand instead of Mr. Quaid's. 

 He's back home now, and a bit let down, but believes he's better off for the experience. Because he earned a degree in education at Northeastern, and found time later for a master's degree, he got a job teaching emotionally disturbed children at a high school in Webster, Mass., and thinks he'll make it his career. 

 "It's about time I got down to real life, and I think being in the movie will help reconcile me to that," he says. "I used to think of myself as a football player who taught, but now I'm more of a teacher who plays football. 

 "Still, if the Canadian League called. . ."

 Lucent posts 23 percent drop in profits, missing Wall Street's deflated forecasts

 MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) - The world's top communications equipment maker, Lucent Technologies, saw quarterly profits plunge 23 percent for 1999's last three months, narrowly missing Wall Street forecasts that were already slashed after a warning two weeks ago. 

 Operating income for the former division of AT&T totaled $1.18 billion, or 36 cents per share, during the three months ended Dec. 31, which is the first quarter of Lucent's fiscal year. 

 Those figures, reported Thursday, don't reflect certain one-time gains and expenses unrelated to Lucent's core business that gave the company a net profit of $1.25 billion, or 38 cents a share, for the quarter. 

 In the same period in 1998, Lucent earned $1.523 billion, or 48 cents a share, also excluding one-time events. 

 Revenues for the quarter edged higher to $9.9 billion from $9.8 billion a year earlier. 

 The operating profit was at the lower end of the range suggested in Lucent's warning on Jan. 6. Analysts, most of whom were caught off guard by that announcement, had reduced their forecasts to about 37 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 On Thursday, Lucent offered the same explanation for its disappointing results: weak software revenues, customer delays in deploying network equipment, and Lucent's inability to keep up with demand for its fast new fiber-optic gear. 

 "Lucent left the front door open for their competitors to walk right through, and Nortel and Ciena took advantage," said David Powers, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, referring to two of Lucent's top rivals in developing fiber-optic gear to speed up the flow of voice and data traffic on the Internet and other networks. 

 Powers said the earnings report was mostly in line with Lucent's Jan. 6 forecast, although the company's gross profit margin came in slightly lower than he expected - down 11 percent to $4.65 million. 

 "Lucent was a company that was cruising right along, beating (Wall) Street estimates ever since they were spun off from AT&T, and now they've hit a speed bump," Powers said. He predicted Lucent would need a few quarters to get back on track, but said "the company is well positioned to benefit from the tremendous growth in the telecommunications equipment market." 

 Lucent's stock, which traded as high as $84 per share in December and plunged into the low 50s after the earnings warning, rose $1.18 3/4 to $52.62 1/2 in advance of the report, which was released after Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. There was little change in the price in extended trading on other markets. 

 Several class-action shareholder lawsuits were filed after the Jan. 6 warning, charging that Lucent had misled investors. 

 Despite the weak showing, Lucent noted that the quarter was still the three-year-old company's second largest ever both in revenue and net income. That's because the October-December quarter typically is Lucent's biggest. 

 Richard McGinn, chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated that the company expects to solve its manufacturing and shipment problems by the end of the current quarter, and also anticipates that network deployments delayed from the first quarter will occur later in the fiscal year. 

 "The fundamental needs of our customers continue to grow, and we intend to capitalize on this demand as we've done in the past," McGinn said.

HORSEMEN ASK FOR RACING HIATUS TO SAVE TRACK

With Virginia's ailing horse track threatening closure, thoroughbred horsemen on Wednesday asked the state to consider temporarily ceasing harness racing this year.

The suggestion, made at a meeting of the Virginia Racing Commission, represented the first public break between Virginia's two horse racing camps, both of whom want desperately to keep live racing in Virginia as the Colonial Downs track in New Kent County struggles to survive in its fourth year.

``I don't think we can say, `Keep harness racing at any cost,' '' said Tyson Gilpin, president of the Virginia Horseman's Benevolent and Protective Association, which negotiates purses for the state's thoroughbred horsemen.

``If we're sustaining ourselves and they're not, it's not fair for us to go down at their expense,'' Anne D.W. Poulson, president of the Virginia Thoroughbred Association, added outside the meeting.

Thoroughbred horsemen, by far the more numerous of the racing groups in Virginia, have struggled privately for months with whether to break ranks with standardbred - or harness - breeders and owners. Colonial Downs officials have been warning since last year that the track cannot survive past the spring if it is forced to hold a harness race meet in October. The track, which has lost more than $6 million overall in the last two years, said it lost about $600,000 on harness racing alone in 1999, while turning a minuscule profit with the more popular thoroughbred meet.

The five-member Racing Commission so far has been unsympathetic, ordering Colonial Downs in December to hold a 40-day harness meet in 2000 and to deposit money in a harness racing purse account.

The track, as it has done on other occasions, is fighting the commission's orders in court. It has asked a Richmond Circuit judge to stay the order on the purse accounts and several other edicts, as it argues its appeals. The track also has filed suit against the Virginia Harness Horseman's Association, which maintains Colonial Downs has a binding contract to hold harness racing in 2000. The track says the contract is void.

A representative of the harness horsemen expressed regret that thoroughbred horsemen were willing to see them excluded from any racing at Colonial Downs.

``It's disappointing - we've always been supportive of all horsemen in Virginia,'' said John B. Mumford, an attorney representing the Virginia Harness Horseman's Association.

But thoroughbred racers appear to be taking Colonial Downs officials at their word. In December, Colonial Downs owner Jeffrey P. Jacobs said he would shutter the facility if it is not sold or the commission did not agree to the track's financial restructuring plan by the end of next month. One of the cornerstones of the plan is to cease holding harness meets until the track is on firmer financial footing.

Track officials on Wednesday altered that threat somewhat. One of its attorneys, John C. Ivins Jr., told the commission that if the parties don't reach some kind of resolution by March 15, the track would be ``forced to finally deal with its financial situation.''

Asked later whether that meant closure, officials ducked. The track's lead attorney, James L. Weinberg, said, ``It's a dynamic world we live in.''

The commission meanwhile is pressing ahead with plans to push legislation this year that would automatically set the amount of purse money the track must set aside each season, instead of letting the track engage in rancorous negotiations with horsemen, as it has done in the past. The commission also is asking for summary power to void the track's license. The track opposes the measures and vows to lobby against the legislation.

As for harness racing, commissioners said the state has expected Colonial Downs from the beginning to benefit all types of horse racing in Virginia.

``I don't think the commission has changed its position all along,'' the commission's chairman, Robin Traywick Williams, said. ``We expect the licensee to abide by all contracts. We expect the licensee to comply with the commission's orders.''

 LINDA O`BRYON: The price of oil flirts with $30 a barrel, a level not seen since the 1991 Gulf War. Part of the reason: the severe winter weather now gripping the Northern U.S. Good evening, everyone. I`m Linda O`Bryon. 

 JEFF YASTINE: And I`m Jeff Yastine. Strong earnings from tech stocks convince investors to buy in. That sends the NASDAQ to another record high with a 38-point gain, but the Dow loses 138. Then, Kraft Foods is living la vida Boca. Its purchase of Boca Burgers puts it in the middle of the hottest trend in the food industry, soy products. 

 YASTINE: Good evening, everyone. Mother nature is making her presence known today, even on Wall Street. Throughout the Northern U.S., plummeting temperatures are helping keep demand rising for heating oil. In New York, crude oil futures closed up 12 cents at $29.66 a barrel. That`s the highest level since the Persian Gulf War. Erika Miller looks at what`s pumping up prices. 

 ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: A powerful winter storm is blasting through much of the country, boosting demand for heating oil. That`s part of the reason crude oil is now approaching $30 a barrel, a nine-year high. 

 DAVID GREENBERG, LOCAL CRUDE TRADER, STERLING COMMODITIES: We`ve been in a tremendous up-trend over the past six to eight months. We`ve gone actually from a low of last year of $10.75, to a high made yesterday of $29.70. So we`ve been in quite a bull market for the last few months. 

 MILLER: Oil supplies have fallen to the lowest level in 20 months. Until this week, the weather had been unusually mild, so many refineries had curbed production. They also cut back output at the end of last year as part of their Y2K preparations. 

 JIM ROEMER, METEOROLOGIST, WEATHERRISK: A lot of the refineries, the distillate operations that turn crude into gasoline into heating oil, were busy really upgrading their systems and their operations. And in the midst of warm weather, they were more busy doing that than actually refining product. 

 MILLER: At the same time, OPEC has been strengthening its resolve on production limits. Last week, an OPEC committee recommended that output cuts remain in place beyond their scheduled expiration in March. 

 GREENBERG: For the first time in many, many years, OPEC has actually kept the cartel together. There`s been very little cheating. Their percentage on their quotas have been kept to where they should be. So, and that in itself is enough to keep the price up. 

 MILLER: Despite the rapid rise in crude prices, oil stocks have not seemed to benefit. The AMEX Oil Index has been basically flat the past nine months. But analyst Fred Leuffer says now is the time to buy. 

 FRED LEUFFER, OIL ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: But I think if oil goes through 30, and the outlook at that time is that supply and demand remain tight, and oil could go higher. I think you`ll see analysts raise earnings estimates and I think the oil stocks will rally. 

 MILLER: His top picks are USX Marathon (MRO), Amerada Hess (AHC), Shell Transport (SC) and trading, and Chevron (CHV). Meteorologists say the Northeast is likely to experience colder than-normal temperatures for the next several weeks. Analysts say a long cold spell could trigger even faster increases for the oil prices. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 O`BRYON: Those rising oil prices sent the U.S. trade deficit gushing to a new record in November. The Commerce Department says the trade gap widened to $26.5 billion in November, up 3.7 percent from October. The government says brisk consumer demand and surging imports from Canada and Europe were also key. But there was one bright spot in the report. Deficits with Japan and China narrowed in the same period, and some economists believe the deficit will improve later this year as overseas demand for U.S. goods increases. 

 YASTINE: Well, the blue chips and the tech stocks continued to head in opposite directions today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened about 9 points higher, but it was then pummeled with profit-taking in some key stocks, like General Motors, Wal-Mart (WMT), and ALCOA (AA). Bond prices firmed up a bit, but big-board breadth remained negative by 6 to 5 margin. And by noontime, the blue chips were off about 82 points. Not so for the NASDAQ. In afternoon trading, the Index suffered through a short bout of selling, before moving higher again. Big-cap tech stocks like Oracle and Apple were the standouts. In late trading, market breadth widened a bit, with decliners outpacing advancers by an 8 to 5 margin. Again on the big board bond prices also weakened some, and that kept the pressure on the blue chips all the way through the close, with the Dow finished off 138.06 points to 11351.30. In today`s 283 3/4 point range, the Dow closed down 207 1/2 points from the best level of the session and up 76 1/4 points from the low. The NASDAQ Composite achieving yet another record, get tired of saying it, it is up 38.22 to 4189.51. In its 84-point range, the Index settled about 38 points below its high of the day and up 46 points from the low. 

 Big board trading volume 1.1 billion shares exchanging hands. Today, down volume outweighing up volume by 234 million shares. 

 The Dow Transports Index falling 53.73 points. That is the lowest that it has been at since October of 1998. So, it has been sliding some lately. 

 Utilities rising 7 1/4 points, helped by the cold snap across the Northeast. 

 And the Closing Tick somewhat bullish at +161. 

 In the broader market the Standard & Poor`s 500 dropping a little over 10 points. 

 The S&P 100 falling about 7. 

 And the MidCap 400 edging up to another new high there. 

 And you can see the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index gaining 66 points on the day. 

 The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index dropping a little over nearly 4 3/4 points. 

 The Value Line ending down about 2 1/2. 

 And another record day for the small caps. The Russell2000 Small Cap gaining over 7 1/4 points. And the broadly based Wilshire 5000 dropping 33 2/3 points. 

 And after the Federal Reserve reported in the week ending January 10 the M-2 money supply fell by $5 billion. 

 Bond prices fell today as the news on that widening U.S. trade gap prompted more selling. The long bond saw some improvement in the middle part of the day as some buyers stepped in, encouraged by the inverted yield curve that started yesterday between the 30-year and the 10-year issues. That can sometimes signal something of a bottom in bond prices. But that bottom promptly disappeared this afternoon, as bond prices dropped almost back to their morning lows. So tax free and corporate issues fell a 1/4 to an 1/8. And Treasuries declined as well. 

 The 5-year note losing 7/32. 

 The 10-year note fell 11/32. 

 And look at the higher yield there compared to the 30-year bond on the next board. That`s the inversion I was talking about. It hasn`t happened since 1994. 

 And finally, the Lehman Brothers Long Bond Index fell nearly 4 points. 

 I`ll be back later to show you what stocks did today. Linda. 

 O`BRYON: Well, Jeff, the economy is red hot but according to Federal Reserve Governor Laurence Meyer, it may be too hot. Speaking before a group of economists in Washington today, Meyer said inflation remains modest despite the fact that unemployment is at a 30 year low. That`s the good news. The bad news? Well, Meyer signaled that it won`t last. He said the Fed`s first order of business should be to slow growth. 

 LAURENCE MEYER, FEDERAL RESERVE GOVERNOR: It seems to me the fundamental question today is whether the current set of macroeconomic conditions, and I mean specifically the rate of growth in the economy and the unemployment rate, whether this set of macroeconomic conditions is sustainable. 

 O`BRYON: Meanwhile, a senior new York Federal Reserve economist says Alan Greenspan has done "everything but stand on his head" to signal higher interest rates are coming. But economist Rae Rosen says she doesn`t know exactly when the Fed will raise rates. 

 YASTINE: Well, raised expectations for soy products are moving them beyond health food stores and into mainstream grocers. Since government health experts said soy can reduce cholesterol, food products, food companies have been racing to sell soy-based foods. Diane Eastabrook reports. 

 DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Soy, the stuff that makes tofu, is now the stuff that makes just about everything, from meatless burgers and breakfast patties to beverages. Now that the government says food companies can make health claims about soy, schools are looking to use it more in kids` lunches and sales of soy products are expected to soar. Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) processes soybeans and sells soy ingredients to food companies. It estimates sales will increase 15 percent this year for soy milk and 30 percent for meatless soy products. 

 ANTHONY DELIO, PRESIDENT, ADM NUTRACEUTICAL: I think it`s going to grow rapidly. I think what`s going to make it grow is successful marketing and I think the larger companies coming in and making that commitment will make it successful. 

 EASTABROOK: Large food companies that don`t make soy products themselves are buying up smaller companies that do. Dean Foods (DF) recently bought a stake in the company that makes silk soy milk. Kellogg`s (K) recently acquired the Morningstar Line. And just this week, Kraft announced the purchase of Boca Burger. Boca Burger says it has doubled sales for its meatless products in the last two years. The company believes Kraft has the resources to increase sales even more. 

 KATIE TORRES, VICE PRESIDENT, BOCA BURGER: They have very strong business across a lot of different channels of distribution, so I think that they will take it to the next level. 

 EASTABROOK: But while food companies are sold on soy, some analysts still are not. 

 PATRICK SCHUMANN, FOOD ANALYST, EDWARD JONES: The key here is taste and consumers have shown over the years that even if it does have health benefits, if it doesn`t have the right taste or it doesn`t meet consumer acceptance, the products don`t sell. 

 EASTABROOK: Price could also determine the future of the soy segment. A lot of food companies charge a premium for soy-based products because they are considered to be functional or nutritional foods. But analysts aren`t sure most consumers will want to pay that premium. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago. 

 YASTINE: Well, the blue chips revisiting the 11,300 level today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping a little over 138 points to 11,351.3. Decliners with an easy 9 to 6 lead over advancers and exactly 30 more new lows than new highs. American Online (AOL) gaining 3/16. Analysts at Merrill Lynch, DLJ and Warburg Dillon Reed believe AOL`s numbers were encouraging for the online giant`s planned merger with Time Warner, each firm raising earnings estimates for the next two years. 

 Lucent Technologies (LU) advancing 2 1/2. After the close, Lucent, as expected, turning in sharply lower first quarter earnings of $0.36 a share. That`s on flat revenues. But investors think better days are now ahead for those shares of Lucent. 

 Compaq (CPQ) rising 5/8. 

 And IBM (IBM) gaining 6 3/8. Big Blue still believes it can deliver earnings of $4.35 a share this year despite a dip in fourth quarter revenues given the precaution taken ahead of the Year 2000 turnover. 

 Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) moving up 9/16 on the day. 

 And Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slipping 1 3/16. The company`s latest assessment of the first quarter shows seasonal factors will hurt sales. 

 Enron (ENE) bolting 13 3/4 on news it will purchase $350 million in equipment from Sun Micro for use in expanding its fiber and satellite communications network. 

 Time Warner (TWX) advancing 1 11/16. 

 And Citigroup falling 2 3/16, part of a weak banking group today. 

 SBC Communications (SBC) edging up 5/16. 

 And among the widely helds, shares in Alcoa (AA) heading south by 4 9/16. The company`s going to add more aluminum capacity. That means more supply in the marketplace and investors fear it will mean lower aluminum prices, as well. 

 Delta Air (DAL) down 1 7/8, a weak transport group today, of course. 

 But GE (GE) falling 2 5/16 despite reporting better than expected fourth quarter earnings of $0.93 a share. That was a penny above Street estimates but a couple of areas showing weakness were its appliance and aircraft engine divisions. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) rising 3/4, the nation`s number one auto maker pulling in profits of $1.95 a share that beat Wall Street projections by $0.14. 

 Perot Systems (S) rising 3 11/16. The company`s in a partnership with Novell (NOVL). 

 Sears (S) finishing down 1 11/16 after reporting a 34 percent jump in fourth quarter profits. 

 Among the big movers, General Cigar (MPP) climbed 5 5/8. Swedish match Abitu is going to acquire the company for $15.25 a share. 

 And Chyron (CHY) ended up 1 3/16, the company landing a contract from Panasonic to provide character generators for the 2000 Olympics. 

 Avista (AVA) shooting up 7 5/8. According to SEC filings, Bill Gates holds a 5 percent stake in that company. 

 And Corning (GLW) jumping 22 1/4, riding the strength of JDS Uniphase`s (JDSU) planned merger of E-Tech. Management is on a road tour this week. They`re highlighting a pending acquisition of Seaman`s and Oak Industries (OAK). 

 Sunterra (OWN) falling 2 5/8 on a fourth quarter profit warning. Earnings expected to be way down to $0.01 to $0.08. They were expecting $0.42 for the year. 

 And Bergen Brunswig (BBC) ended off 1 3/8, Merrill Lynch downgrading the stock from "buy" to "neutral." 

 In NASDAQ Composite trading, another record, up more than 38 points, volume the heaviest ever, 1.8 billion shares and you can see advances and declines nearly even. 

 Among the dollar volume leaders here, Intel (INTC) falling 4 7/16. 

 Microsoft (MSFT) down 1 even. 

 QUALCOMM (QCOM) gained 9, though, today. 

 And JDS Uniphase (JDSU) up 26 15/16. Sutro, a brokerage firm, issued a "buy" in response to its planned acquisition of E-Tech. 

 Yahoo! (YHOO) falling 12 1/16. Some profit taking there. 

 Sun Micro (SUNW) climbed 3 5/8 on the day. 

 Cisco Systems (CSCO), though, edging up a fraction. 

 But Apple Computer (AAPL), the star of the day here, finishing up 6 15/16. Wednesday`s earnings report prompted analysts to raise estimates by about $0.15 a share. 

 Oracle (ORCL) moving up 2 1/8 on the day. 

 And MCI WorldCom (WCOM) ended off 1 11/16. 

 RELM Wireless (RELM) rose 3 13/16. RELM and Hitachi Denshi of Tokyo will jointly develop and sell RELM`s wireless products. 

 And the NASDAQ volume leader, Legato Systems (LGTO), tumbling 23 7/8. The reason? It had a disappointing fourth quarter and analysts lowered their earnings estimates. The stock was hammered. Visx (VISX) falling 13 1/8, has slower than expected revenue growth and prompted analysts to cut earnings projections and have downgrades as well there. 

 On the American Exchange, you can see it reaching yet another new record high there, up more than 9 points. 

 E-Sim (EIM) gaining 4 1/8. This is an Israeli-based company. E-Sim will license its technology, which will allow cellular phone users to surf the Internet. It`s the next big thing. 

 FuelCell Energy (FCL) jumping quite a bit today, up 11 1/4. That whole group, Ballard Power (BLDP) and Plug Power (PLUG), have all moved higher on excitement about fuel cell technology. 

 Finally, the Index Shares all lower except for the NASDAQ 100 Index. 

 That`s the Wall Street Wrap Up. Linda? 

 O`BRYON: Well, Jeff, its stock started off in the fast lane. Now Autoweb.com (AWEB) faces challenges in keeping it there. Still, Autoweb`s president, Samuel Hedgpeth, says the company is driving forward despite its stock price shifting into reverse. Autoweb went public in March. The stock zoomed, opening at $14 a share to close at $40 on its first day of trading. Well, since then the market has driven the stock down dramatically, that despite Autoweb`s revenues revving up almost 300 percent from its start in 1997. In tonight`s prime movers segment, Donald van de Mark of Myprimetime.com asks Hedgpeth about his IPO experience. 

 SAMUEL HEDGPETH, PRESIDENT & COO, AUTOWEB.COM: The first thing you do, of course, is you file the book, you file the S1 and then you get to rest because we did that whole thing in 19 days, which was really compact, a lot of late nights. And then on the road show it`s just meeting after meeting. I mean Dean DeBiase, the CEO, was great in his role and I did, you know, I did my part as the CFO at the time. And it was just meeting after meeting and then finally, you know, it`s like, kind of like writing in a blue book at a final and, you know, and eventually the bell rings, you turn in your blue book and it`s over. And that`s what happened. 

 DONALD VAN DE MARK, MY PRIMETIME.COM: And you guys went public at around $14 a share and the stock shot up to around $40 a share. Wild day. 

 HEDGPETH: Oh, it was really, it was incredible. 

 VAN DE MARK: Let me ask you about a disappointment that you may have suffered, and a lot of Internet companies have suffered. You left a lot of money on the table. You could have raised $150 million more dollars had you gotten $40 right out of the gate. 

 HEDGPETH: We were really happy with getting our $14. It was a nice market cap on the company. We got $70 million plus into the company. We were satisfied and what happens after you start trading, is, you know, these stocks are pretty volatile. They go up they go down and we were satisfied with it. And since then we`ve really, we`ve met all our commitments, what we said. 

 VAN DE MARK: What do you say to the small investor who`s left holding the stock, who believes in the company? The company is growing its revenues but nonetheless the stock has come down throughout the year. How do you talk to the investing public? 

 HEDGPETH: Oh, in fact part of it is I talk to myself because I`m a shareholder and from our view all we can do is we can tell the market what we`re going to do, we can go do that and then the market has to deal with the results. We`ve met, we`ve grown about 20 percent every quarter. We said when we went on the IPO we`re going to solidify our online investing situation. We did with AOL (AOL) and Yahoo! (YHOO) We said we were going to advertise offline. We`re advertising offline. And we said we`d look at acquisitions, potentially and we brought a couple of companies. So we`ve done-with nice revenue growth. So we, that`s all we can do is control our business. 

 VAN DE MARK: How do you feel about all the competitors that are out there, not only Autobytel (ABTL), but Microsoft (MSFT) through Carpoint and Priceline (PCLN) is out there auctioning cars through Ford (F) and there are others. Its pretty daunting competition. 

 HEDGPETH: Well, there is a lot of competition but the market is in total $1.4 trillion, $670,000, $670 million for new and used cars, $440 million for financing. And so it`s a really big market. And you`d think a market that big would attract competition and we have some. 

 VAN DE MARK: What about auto dealers opening their own Web sites? Analysts say that could be the biggest threat to a company like yours. 

 HEDGPETH: Oh gee, I think one of the issues for dealers, and that includes even the large, the large chains, is that to get traffic, they have to get traffic to their site and then they have to satisfy the demand. 

 VAN DE MARK: Congratulations on educating a lot of car buyers and thank you very much for joining us. 

 HEDGPETH: Thank you. 

 YASTINE: Tomorrow, our market monitor guest is Douglas Raborn, Chairman and CEO of Raborn and Company. 

 O`BRYON: A Canadian Internet company is in hot water with the U.S. entertainment industry. Ten film companies, CBS, ABC, and Fox are suing to stop Icravetv.com from sending copyrighted TV programs over the Internet without permission. The complaint says it`s one of the largest and most brazen thefts of intellectual property ever committed in the United States. But Icravetv says its practice is ethical, legal, and moral. Stay tuned. 

 YASTINE: The Chicago Board of Trade is splitting up. The directors of the 150 year old futures exchange today voted to replace its membership structure with two for profit companies. One will be for open outcry trading, the other will be for electronic trading and may sell shares to the public. The exchange hopes the restructuring will let it better compete with electronic trading networks. 

 O`BRYON: Many factors affect the decision to buy a mutual fund, including the investing strategy of the fund`s manager. But what if the fund manager isn`t really a manager at all? With tonight`s commentary, here`s Allan Sloan, Wall Street editor of "Newsweek" magazine. 

 ALLAN SLOAN, COMMENTARY: Everywhere you look, the computer technocrat types seem to be taking over the world. And I`m not even talking about AOL (AOL) buying Time Warner (TWX). I`m talking about the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFINX) becoming the country`s biggest mutual fund. Even as we speak, the Index Fund has either passed Fidelity`s Magellan Fund (FMAGX) to become number one or is about to pass it. This is a big psychic deal. Even though Gus Solder, definitely a human being, Vanguard`s index fund, he doesn`t pretend to manage it. His big thing is programming computers to efficiently buy and sell stock to mimic the S&P 500. Having this fund pass the human-managed Magellan Fund is like IBM`s Deep Blue computer beating Gary Kasparov in 1997 at chess and like Microsoft (MSFT) passing GE (GE) in 1998 to become the world`s most highly valued company. Magellan, of course, became the world`s biggest mutual under under the legendary Peter Lynch. The fund hit rough patches after Lynch left, but has lately outperformed the S&P 500. But the Index Fund caught up in size because it`s still taking new investors, while Magellan closed in 1997. The people at Fidelity and Vanguard will tell you they don`t care who`s number one. The folks at GE and Microsoft talk the same way. Don`t believe it for a minute. Computers don`t care about winning or losing, but the people who run them sure do. I`m Allan Sloan. YASTINE: Recapping today`s market action, an up and down day. The Dow closed down 138 points but the NASDAQ closed up 38, yet another new record high. And please join us at our Worldwide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword: NBR. 

 O`BRYON: And finally tonight, it`s a case of life imitating the Internet. Last night, the town of Halfway, Oregon, voted to change its name to Half.com, becoming the first dot.com city in the world. It made the change because an online company called Half.com is donating more than $100,000 in computer hardware and Internet time to its citizens, all 345 of them. Half.com, the company, set up the deal as a publicity stunt. But it`s not a permanent change. Half.com, the city, gets its original name back in a year, Jeff. 

 YASTINE: Some companies will do anything for publicity, right? Well, that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 20th. I`m Jeff Yastine. Good night everyone. And good night to you, Linda. 

 O`BRYON: Good night, Jeff. I`m Linda O`Bryon. We`ll see all of you again tomorrow night.

 JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: Let`s check in with Christine 

 Romans at the New York Stock  Exchange. When is General Electric going to report, Christine? 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  They confirmed with First Call Thompson Financial,  they will report during this week, the week of January 17. There are analyst and First Call also say it will probably today, but it`s not a  certainty for GE (URL: http://www.ge.com) . So, we`ll be watching that one. I can tell you that in terms of General Electric, I can`t tell you because I don`t have it I front of me what they`re looking for there. But, we could see that one come out today. But what we do know for sure is that we`re going to see more of these tech companies, these New York Stock Exchange techs reporting today. As you pointed out, AOL (URL: http://www.aol.com/) , AMD (URL: http://www.amd.com/) , IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , all reported better than expected as did Apple (URL: http://www.apple.com/) ,  but that is over at the Nasdaq. All reported better-than-expected earnings for the most recent quarter. They are all up in after hours trading. And it looks like tech sector could lead things here in the early going. There are calls for a higher Dow in the early going. We`ll be watching the other New York Stock Exchange techs to see if they come in also beating the street. Lucent (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) is among them that we are going to be watching. LU is its ticker symbol. Now, Lucent as you recall had issued a warning not too long ago, January 6, I believe it said that it was going to fall short in this quarter. Saying that  between 36 and 39 cents a share was more in line with what it was looking for. So,  we have estimates on the street for 37 cents a share that compares with 49 cents 

 in the same period a year ago. We`re expecting that one after the bell. This is a widely held stocks. You can see it is down 10.1 percent over the past-- I am assuming that is a 52 weeks-yes, over the past 52 weeks. So, you can see since that profit warning, there was a huge pullback in that one. So, we`ll see if Lucent can fare like IBM did. IBM warned the street on October 20, and told analyst and investor to get in line with expectations, that profits would fall off from the previous year. And the stock adjusted. And the analysts and the street adjusted and then it can beat the street`s lowered expectations then that can be good for the stock. So, we`ll see if the same thing happens for  Lucent. Also Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) , it is expected to report 42 cents a share. This one is also likely to come out after the bell. GTW is this ticker symbol. Gateway reported 41 cents a share the same time last year. And GM (URL: http://www.gm.com/) , that`s a Dow component, we`re going to get that today. General Motors $1.81  a share is what they are looking for there versus $2.83 cent a year ago. That`s down 36 percent. So, that`s  a profit pullback of 36 percent is what the street is looking for. Now here are a couple of things that play for GM stock. Analyst say that consumer demand remains strong and that underpins this stock. But you are not going to see it the fourth quarter of `99, because it is compared to a fourth quarter of `98, that had a ramp up in production because  it was right after that big GM strike. Remember, Jack? So, that means that this is going to  be sort of a difficult comparison for GM from the fourth quarter of `99 to the fourth quarter of 1998. Jack, back to you.

SPOTLIGHT Raytheon shares fall 26 percent

Raytheon Co., the No. 3 U.S. defense contractor, cut its earnings forecast Tuesday for the third time since September as it struggles to digest more than $15 billion in acquisitions. 

The company's shares tumbled 26 percent, the second-largest decline in at least two decades. Raytheon closed at $18, down $6.31. 

Raytheon said production delays on 19 aircraft and higher costs pushed fourth-quarter profit down to 20-25 cents a share, well below the 59-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial. 

Like rival Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon has made a string of acquisitions in the past four years to win a bigger share of the shrinking U.S. defense budget. 

Both companies' profits have plummeted as they cut costs and streamline operations. 

The situation isn't likely to improve this year, Raytheon warned. 

"Raytheon's financial systems have been unable to handle the complexities brought on by the numerous acquisitions over the past few years," said Keith Patriquin, an analyst with Loomis Sayles & Co., which owns about 250,000 Raytheon shares. 

Raytheon also blamed "further erosion in international opportunities" for its missile systems, such as the Patriot program, for the lower profit forecast. 

The company's Class B shares fell $6.38, to $19, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

The stock has dropped 66 percent over the past 12 months. 

Raytheon's Oct. 12 warning that sales and profit will be less than forecast triggered a 44 percent stock drop. 

"The outlook for Raytheon is dead money for a while," said Todd Ernst, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc., who has a "hold" rating on the shares. "With a change in the earnings outlook, perhaps they take a look at divesting some noncore businesses." 

Raytheon expects to report earnings of $1.15-$1.20 a share in 1999, less than its earlier forecast of $1.40-$1.50. 

Profit for 2000 is forecast at $1.60-$1.75 a share, down from $2.10-$2.25, the company said. 

"This is part of an ongoing process of cleaning up a company that was sick," said John Hayes, an analyst at Boston-based Independence Investment Associates, which used to own Raytheon shares.

Insight
Our health system is failing us

Montreal -- To explain overflowing hospitals here and across the nation, Canadian health officials are blaming the annual winter flu epidemic.  

But, at the mention of flu, Daniel Brochu, the veteran head nurse here, gave a smirk and ran his pen down the patient list: "Heart problem, infection problem, hypertension, dialysis, brain tumour, two cerebral hemorrhages."  

On Thursday, he said, crowding was so bad that he was able to admit one patient only after the ambulance crew agreed to leave its stretcher.  

When Canada's state-run health system was in its first bloom, in the 1970s, Americans regularly trooped up here on inspection tours, attracted by Canada's promise of universal "free" health care. Today, however, few Canadians would recommend their system as a model for export.  

Improving health care should be the federal government's top priority, said 93 per cent of 3,000 Canadians interviewed last month by Ekos Research Associates. In another poll last month, conducted by Pollara, 74 per cent of respondents supported the idea of user fees, which have been outlawed since 1984.  

"There is not a day when the newspapers do not talk of the health crisis," said Pierre Gauthier, president of the Federation of Specialist Doctors of Quebec. "It has become the No. 1 problem for Quebecois and for Canadians."  

In Toronto, overcrowding prompted emergency rooms in 23 of the city's 25 hospitals to turn away ambulances one day recently. Two weeks ago, in what one newspaper later called "an ominous foreshadowing," police officers shot to death a distraught father who had taken a doctor hostage in a Toronto emergency room in an attempt to speed treatment for his sick baby.  

In Winnipeg, "hallway medicine" has become so routine that hallway stretcher locations have permanent numbers. Patients recuperate more slowly in the drafty, noisy hallways, doctors report.  

On the Pacific Coast, ambulances filled with ill patients have repeatedly stacked up this winter in the parking lot of Vancouver General Hospital. Maureen Whyte, a hospital vice president, estimates that 20 per cent of heart attack patients who should have treatment within 15 minutes now wait an hour or more.  

The shortage is a case of supply not keeping up with demand. During the 1990s, after government deficits ballooned, partly because of rising health costs, the government in Ottawa cut revenue-sharing payments to provinces -- by half, by some accounts. Today, the federal budget is balanced, but seven hospitals in Montreal have been closed and 44 hospitals in Ontario have been closed or merged.  

Ottawa also largely closed the door to the immigration of foreign doctors and cut the number of spaces in Canadian medical schools by 20 per cent. Today, Canada has one medical school slot for every 20,000 people, compared with one for 13,000 in the United States and Britain.  

With a buyout program, Quebec induced 3,600 nurses and 1,200 doctors to take early retirement. And across the nation, 6,000 nurses and at least 1,000 doctors have moved to the United States in recent years.  

At the same time, demands on Canada's health system grow every year. Within 30 years, the population over age 65 is expected to double, to 25 per cent.  

Unable to meet the demand, waiting lists for operations now stretch for months or longer -- five years in the case of Boucher.  

As a result, Canada has moved informally to a two-tier, public-private system. Although private practice is limited to dentists and veterinarians, 90 per cent of Canadians live within 100 miles of the United States, and many people are crossing the border for private care.  

Last summer, as waiting lists for chemotherapy treatments for breast and prostate cancer stretched to four months, Montreal doctors started to send patients 45 minutes down the highway to Champlain Valley Physicians' Hospital in Plattsburgh, N.Y.  

There, scores have undergone radiation treatment, some being treated by bilingual doctors who had left Montreal.  

Business has been so good that the Plattsburgh hospital, which was on the verge of closing its cancer unit, has invested half a million dollars in new equipment. And on the Quebec side, the program has allowed health authorities to boast that they have cut the list of cancer patients who have to wait two months or more, to 368 last week from 516 last summer.  

In Toronto, waiting lists have become so long at the Princess Margaret Hospital, the nation's largest and most prestigious cancer hospital, that hospital lawyers drew up a waiver recently for patients to sign, showing that they fully understood the danger of delaying radiation treatment.  

With the chemotherapy waiting list in British Columbia at 670 people, hospitals in Washington have started marketing their services to Canadians in Vancouver, a 45-minute drive.  

A two-tier system is also being used for other kinds of operations.  

"I would like to buy Mother a plastic hip for Christmas, so she doesn't have to limp through the year 2000 in excruciating pain," Margaret Wente, a newspaper columnist for The Globe And Mail in Toronto, wrote last month. "I could just drive her to Cleveland, which is fast becoming the de facto hip-replacement capital of southern Ontario."  

Allan Rock, Canada's health minister, disapproves of such attitudes. In an essay in the same newspaper, he wrote sarcastically: "Forget about equal access. Let people buy their way to the front of the line."  

In defence of Canada's state health system, he wrote, "Its social equity reflects our Canadian values." Rock said that health delivery could be improved through better, computerized planning. He attacked a proposal in Alberta to allow private hospitals, warning readers, "The precedent may be set for American for-profit health-care providers looking to set up shop in Canada."  

But the idea that there may be room in Canada's future for private medicine is gaining ground.  

"We have no significant crises in care for our teeth or our animals, largely because dentists and veterinarians operate in the private sector," Michael Bliss, a medical historian, wrote in the National Post Jan. 12. "So we have the absurdity in Canada that you can get faster care for your gum disease than your cancer, and probably more attentive care for your dog than your grandmother."  

In Ontario, Canada's wealthiest province, the waiting list for magnetic resonance imaging tests is so long that one man recently reserved a session for himself at a private animal hospital that had a machine. He registered under the name Fido.  

To Boucher, who jealously guarded her 15 square feet of corridor space, such cocktail circuit anecdotes were not amusing. Glumly eating her cold breakfast toast, she said, "It scares us to get sick."  

"We have the absurdity in Canada that you can get faster care for your gum disease than your cancer, and probably more attentive care for your dog than your grandmother."

 Re: Father Felix Hall decision wrong, Jan. 13 letter.   Editor: The letter omits a number of facts that should be of interest to your readership.   When the Diocese of St. Petersburg agreed to sell its property to the city of New Port Richey, the diocese provided notification to the occupant of the building on Washington Street, including the AA groups making use of Father Felix Hall. In response to the notification from the church, most of the occupants of these buildings, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Project S.O.L.V.E., Boy Scout Troop 46 and Connections, each approached the city for permission to stay in their buildings.   The City Council, in keeping with its long-established practice of support for social service agencies working in our community, provided each of these groups with a short-term lease of public property. 

  Unfortunately, the city was never approached by any of the AA groups using Father Felix Hall and the diocese did not ask the city to make these facilities available.   On the day that the city was advised of the needs of the AA organization, the city extended an invitation to provide the same use of publicly owned facilities to the AA at no cost. This group was offered the same courtesy afforded the other occupants of the former diocese properties. Subsequently, the city was informed that the AA groups have secured alternate meeting facilities from the church. The name calling directed at the City Council and the city staff is misplaced. In addition to the agencies' house on Washington Street, the city of New Port Richey provides facilities at little or no cost to a number of not-for-profit organizations and community service groups in our city:     CARES Inc. provides a variety of services to our senior population and occupies the Claude Pepper Senior Center on Van Buren Street, constructed by the city at no cost to CARES. The Red Apple School operates in a city-owned building at Marine Parkway and Grand Boulevard, providing services to adults with learning disabilities. The building is provided at no cost to the school.     The New Port Richey Community Cooperative occupies office space in City Hall from which it operates its downtown revitalization activities. There is no cash rent charged for the space.     The West Pasco Chamber of Commerce occupies City owned property at Main Street and River Road as a base of operations for its economic development functions carried on throughout the West Pasco community and for community service activities like Chasco Fiesta. The rental for this prominent location is $100 per month.     The New Port Richey Tourist and Shuffleboard Club occupies city property on Grand Boulevard at Montana Street at the cost of $10 per month.   In addition to these organizational efforts, members of the city staff serve in leadership positions at United Way of Pasco County, at First Call for Help, at the Sertoma Speech and Hearing Foundation of Florida, and in other organizations serving the West Pasco community.   The city's track record in providing low-cost facilities for social service agencies and community service groups, as well as the volunteer commitment from other members of the city family to the service organizations working in our community, speaks for itself.Peter A. Altman, mayorCity of New Port RicheyJustice for ABC Disposal customers is at ballot box   Editor: Pasco County Commissioners caused 2,000 Pasco residents to lose $52,000 by revoking the license of ABC Disposal Inc. on Jan. 4. Though it was known May 6, 1999, that the employees of the company had dumped toxic and illegal products, the county let ABC continue to service the public with garbage pickup for seven months. Then without warning after 2,000 residents had already paid $26.31 for pickup service for January through March 2000, the commissioners stopped ABC service on Jan. 4, the day of ABC's first pickup of 2000.   Unless you were a newspaper subscriber you would not have known you were without garbage pickup service. Since this service is prepaid by the first of January 2000 for the first three months of the year, the customers of ABC are out $52,000. ABC was allowed to continue to serve the public for seven months after the May 6, 1999, illegal dumping so why could the commissioners not have allowed ABC to finish the three months contract with their customers? The ABC employees did wrong, but it is the 2,000 customers who are paying the price, as we will have to pay another company for three months of garbage pickup for which we have already paid ABC and the chance of getting our money back is very doubtful.   I hope when it is time to vote for new commissioners the 2,000 customers of ABC will remember how this situation was handled.   Thanks to the Times reporter who notified the ABC customers where to call for new garbage service. I'm sure anyone with a telephone book and able to read could have done as well. We would prefer advice as to how to get a return of our lost garbage fee from ABC.Mildred Gareau, Port RicheyHitler had a free handbecause people were disarmed   Re: Gun ownership never thwarted an invasion, Jan. 6 letter.

How could he think that Dr. Zuballaga would ever condone such behavior?

 MARKET WEEK -- Foreign Investment 
 International Trader / Europe: Expect More Telecom Deals -- and Fights -- in Europe

 Last week saw the latest volley in Europe's most-watched merger battle, plus the takeover of Ireland's second-largest phone firm in a deal that could presage more consolidation among the Old World's smaller telecom players. 

 In the main event, Mannesmann on Friday unveiled its "defense document" against the hostile $143 billion tender offer by Britain's Vodafone AirTouch. Mannesmann's tome outlined its standing rejection of the Vodafone bid, arguing that going it alone offers Mannesmann holders better growth prospects and that the Vodafone offer is too low. 

 Mannesman asserted Vodafone's 20% growth in earnings before taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) compared unfavorably to Mannesman's own plans for 39% EBITDA growth through 2003. Mannesman valued its shares at 350 euros, far above Vodafone's offer, which amounts to about E280 per share. 

 Mannesman also zeroed in on the risks and costs of selling off Orange PLC, its U.K. wireless subsidiary. If Vodafone AirTouch buys Mannesmann, Orange would have to be sold because both Orange and Vodafone provide wireless service in the U.K. Moreover, European Union regulatory authorities might not approve the Vodafone bid, the German company warned. 

 Vodafone, of course, disputed the report. Chief Executive Chris Gent told Dow Jones Newswires, "There is nothing new in it." He also doubted Mannesmann's claim that its base value was E350. "You look at independent analysts and most of them have Mannesmann at E170-E180," said Gent, who added he was confident of regulatory approval. 

 Vodafone contends that Mannesmann would have a hard time establishing itself as a leading technology business without a U.S. presence, which Vodafone has. Vodafone also has argued that its 25% profit growth would rise to 30% after a combination with Mannesmann. 

 While the general feeling has been that Vodafone will get more than 50% of Mannesmann's shares in the tender offer, the decision is likely to go down to the wire, which is February 7, the planned close of the offer. 

 Martin Luley, head of equity investments for Commerzbank International Capital Management in Frankfurt, allowed that Mannesmann's effort Friday "might somewhat improve the chances of it succeeding" against Vodafone. Still, he puts the odds at "50-50." What irks Luley the most about Vodafone's offer is that it's all stock and no cash. With any deal likely to take months to close, "Vodafone's share price can fluctuate," he grouses. 

 The market apparently believes Vodafone will ultimately prevail: Mannesmann shares rose about 6% Friday, putting them at a level not far below Vodafone's offer price. Vodafone's shares rose about 7% Friday. Anyone interested can find the 47-page text of Mannesmann's argument in English at www.mannesmann.com. 

 -- While investor focus has been heavily concentrated on titans like Vodafone and Mannesmann, a smaller takeover last week has underscored the view that 2000 will be a big year for mergers among smaller European telecom firms, as well. Ireland's Esat Telecom Group agreed to be bought by British Telecom. But even this smallish deal wasn't simple. 

 Telenor ASA of Norway began the fun with an $85-per-share offer for Esat, which was rejected. Then British Telecom played the White Knight by offering $100 per share for the Irish phone company this week, valuing it at nearly $2.5 billion. Late in the week, BT and Telenor came to an agreement giving Telenor the right to exchange its 49.5% shareholding in Esat Digifone, Esat's mobile subsidiary, for a 33% shareholding in Esat itself. Telenor has the right to increase that stake to just under 50%. 

 Denis O'Brien, the amiable chairman and chief executive officer of Esat, says the "gloves are coming off" among telecom companies battling for footholds across Europe. Indeed, O'Brien says that although BT wound up claiming Esat, several "major players" were seriously interested in the company. He declines to name names. 

 "Anyone with a strong No. 2 or 3 position in a country is up for grabs," asserts O'Brien, who made himself a tidy $350 million selling his 13% Esat stake to BT. "The major players have recognized that to get market strength, they have to scoop up the locals," he says. There's going to be lots more action, he opines. 

 The Esat CEO figures small outfits like CompleTel, a French competitive local exchange carrier; Jazztel, a Spanish telecom start-up, and VersaTel Telecom International could one day be of interest to the bigger players. O'Brien himself holds about 8% of VersaTel. Marconi PLC isn't a name that U.S. investors are very familiar with, but that will probably change this year. The company, which carries the name of the man who invented wireless communication, is a well-known telecom-equipment maker in Europe, competing with the likes of the much larger Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies and Nortel. 

 Marconi's shares trade in London, but with 40% of its revenues coming from the important U.S. market, and with that portion likely to grow as a percent of the total, it's a good bet Marconi will be listed in New York before the year is up. Marconi Chief Executive George Simpson, who's looking to broaden the company's investor base, says "the natural place is the U.S." 

 The British company was formerly known as General Electric Co. PLC, a sleepy British conglomerate that has sold off its defense businesses, among others, to concentrate mainly on telecoms. It is no relation to America's GE. 

 With investors mad for technology stocks last year, Marconi shares rose steeply. However, they slipped back from highs in recent weeks, thanks partly to a profit warning from rival Lucent. 

 Simpson believes that the mergers happening among his customers, the telecoms, will eventually lead to structural change for his industry. Just as the auto companies have pushed more and more of the car-making process onto components makers, Simpson believes telecoms "will push back" their business to the equipment makers. 

 "Owning and running the infrastructure is risky and costs a lot," he says. Eventually, the telecoms companies will be aggregations of customer lists. That will likely lead to further consolidation among telecom-equipment firms, he says. 

 -- Last week, the Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606 shares in Europe rose almost 4% on the week, putting it close to levels reached before the downdraft experienced in the first week of January. 

 London's FTSE-100 Share Index closed up 2.3% last week, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index gained 5.5%. The Paris CAC-40 Index added on 4.5%.

 Modern theater inherits the 'Wind' Half-century hasn't healed science/ religion schism, as recent events and Rep production reveal

 Fate has been kind to "Inherit the Wind." 

 The famous courtroom drama by Jerome Lawrence and the late Robert E. Lee is produced as widely today as at any time since its Broadway premiere - despite it's not being among the nominees for best play in the 1956 Tony Awards. 

 Critics can point to anachronisms, dated dramaturgy and outmoded notions about human psychology in plays from the 1950s, but "Inherit the Wind," unlike many other plays of the era, has acquired greater relevance. Lawrence and Lee modeled their drama on the so-called Scopes monkey trial in Dayton, Tenn., in the summer of 1925. The conflict between science and religion, so vividly captured in a play written 45 years ago about a legendary trial held almost 75 years ago, is with us still. 

 " 'Inherit the Wind' has become a classic," the 84-year-old Lawrence said from his home in the Los Angeles area. "As of last count there were 16 million copies in print  ...  This is a play that nobody wanted to do back in the early '50s."  'On and on and on' 

 Every day commuters leaving Johnson County on their way downtown on northbound Interstate 35 see a billboard picturing a Bible and warning, perhaps hyperbolically, that this book could become the standard science text in Kansas. The billboard was paid for by a new not-for-profit group called Save Our Schools. 

 The sign is graphic evidence of the ongoing evolution vs. creationism debate, which is what prompted George Keathley, Missouri Repertory Theatre's artistic director, to alter his season and add "Inherit the Wind" to the 1999-2000 schedule. His decision was a direct response to the Kansas Board of Education's approval in August of science standards that de-emphasize the teaching of evolution. 

 "It's done all the time," Keathley said of the play. "It's  such a defense of man's right to think that I think it's going to go  on and on and on. There are so many restrictions put on us today, so  many people want to think for us today, and the play revolves around that. 'Right' has no meaning to me. Truth has meaning to me." 

 But the play's endurance isn't all good news. Many Americans who believe they know something about the Scopes trial are informed not by the facts but by the play - and the 1960 film version. And the play departs from the facts in significant ways. 

 The Lawrence and Lee drama unfolds this way: The fictional town of Hillsboro is gripped by intolerance and mob rule. Bertram Cates, a science teacher, has been thrown in jail for teaching evolution. A cynical reporter, E.K. Hornbeck, arrives to cover the trial for his Baltimore newspaper and watches as Matthew Harrison Brady, three- time  presidential candidate and an advocate of "old-time religion," is  given a jubilant welcome when he appears to assist the local prosecutor. 

 With the arrival of famed lawyer Henry Drummond, known for his tactic of defending murderers by putting society on trial, the stage is set for a rationalist vs. fundamentalist showdown. When Drummond calls Brady to take the stand by virtue of the latter's standing as a biblical expert, Drummond proceeds to wear him down under intense questioning. 

 Cates is convicted, but Brady, overwhelmed by the moment, is felled by a stroke. 

 The reality of the Scopes trial unfolded somewhat differently. Tennessee had, indeed, enacted a law banning the teaching of evolution at any public school or university supported by state funds. 

 "It shall be unlawful for any teacher ... to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals," the bill read in part. 

 When the American Civil Liberties Union, still a young organization, heard of the law it immediately wanted a test case. After a discussion at the local drugstore, townspeople convinced John Scopes, a high-school science teacher in Dayton, to voluntarily be arrested and tried in an effort to have the law declared unconstitutional. The case quickly became the subject of national attention. 

 H.L Mencken, famed journalist and acerbic social critic, covered the trial for the Baltimore Sun. Legendary lawyer Clarence Darrow joined the defense team, and three-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan lent his fame and talents to the prosecution. 

 The highlight of the trial was Darrow's flamboyant decision to call Bryan to the witness stand and grill America's most famous biblical expert on the inconsistencies of the Old Testament. The examination took place outdoors on a platform as a respite from the oppressive heat inside the courtroom. 

 In one exchange, Bryan accused Darrow and the defense team of wanting only to "try revealed religion. I am here to defend it, and they can ask any question they please." 

 Cheers rose from the crowd and Darrow observed for the record: "Great applause from the bleachers." 

 "From those people you call yokels," Bryan shot back. "Those  are the people whom you insult." 

 To which Darrow responded: "You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion." 

 Despite these moments of acrimony, Bryan bore no ill will toward Scopes and even offered to pay his fine. He died in his sleep during an afternoon nap a few days after the trial. 

 Hearing of Bryan's death, Darrow commented on the man's legendary appetite by saying "he died of a busted belly." 

 Mencken made a joke of the event: "God aimed at Darrow, missed and hit Bryan instead."  Points of departure 

 Darrow's interrogation of Bryan was the source for the play's dramatic climax, but the authors never intended their work to be taken as a docu-drama. 

 "It was a model in the same sense that the Salem witch trials were a model for (Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible,' " said historian Edward J. Larson, author of Summer for the Gods - the Scopes Trial and America's Continuing Debate Over Science and Religion. "When it appeared on Broadway, there was a notice in the program ... that stressed that it's not history and that it's not reporting. It wasn't journalism. It was a great work of fiction. It's nice, clear, good vs. bad in the same way 'Star Wars' is. It's a good plot." 

 In an introduction to the play prepared for a 1995 collection of their work, Lawrence wrote: "The collision of Bryan and Darrow at Dayton was dramatic, but it was not a drama. Moreover, the issues of their conflict have acquired new dimensions and meaning in the years since they clashed at the Rhea County Courthouse. So 'Inherit the Wind' does not pretend to be journalism. It is theater. It is not 1925. The stage directions set the time as 'Not too long ago.' It might have been yesterday. It could be tomorrow." 

 Larson, speaking from his office at the University of Georgia in Athens, said the play digressed from history in three important ways. 

 The drama presented a distorted version of Bryan's position.  "The actual arguments being made by William Jennings Bryan and the  anti- evolutionists back then ... mainly attacked social Darwinism and  did not defend a literalist interpretation of Genesis. So the  arguments were more philosophical. Bryan did not believe the Earth  was created in 4004 B.C., as he is purported to believe in the play.  He actually accepted that nonhuman forms of life probably evolved,  but you don't get that picture in 'Inherit the Wind.' " 

 The Darrow character is depicted as an idealist. "Darrow - or Drummond in the play - articulates the ACLU's views about individual freedom without capturing Darrow's belligerent style. The real Clarence Darrow was much closer to the H.L. Mencken of the play (called Hornbeck by the writers). 'Inherit the Wind' is a ... morality play with the virtue being tolerance. Darrow never really argued for tolerance, but the ACLU did." 

 The town, presented as a malevolent force, is itself on trial. "The town is depicted as a mob, but in reality the town did not even support the law. The town set this up as a publicity stunt to challenge the law. So the town was sort of along for the ride as entertainment, and the play gives it an ominous attitude that wasn't there. Tennessee did pass what I think is a very stupid law. But the town wasn't trying to enforce the law, they were trying to fix it." 

 Some have argued that the play has less to do with the  science- vs.-religion debate of the '20s than it has to do with the  red- baiting paranoia of the McCarthy era. An accurate dramatization  of the trial might be closer to farce than drama. 

 Lawrence said that the evolution argument was central to the story but that the play dealt with issues beyond the scope of the debate. 

 "It's about the right to think, to teach, to learn," he said.  "I think George Keathley was brave to do this play in Missouri,  right across the river from Kansas." 

 Peter Altman, who will succeed Keathley this year, said "Inherit the Wind" was among the earliest Broadway plays he saw. 

 "I was 10 or 11, but I remember the excitement of that evening  in the theater," Altman said. "The issues are still important, and  you have those two great characters and you have a fascinating  interplay between what actually happened in history and the way it  was adapted. 

 "Broadway would be a lot better if we had more plays like  this."

Lucent Technologies Inc. shares declined in heavy trading Friday amid speculation that the No. 1 phone-equipment maker is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, analysts said. 

Lucent declined 3.25 to 53, its lowest close since March 15, on the New York Stock Exchange. Lucent officials said they were unaware of any investigation and the SEC would not confirm or deny an inquiry. 

"We're not aware of any such inquiry," said Lucent spokesman Jeff Baum. 

Lucent has been criticized by some analysts for the amount of receivables on its balance sheet, pension overfunding, and how it used a restructuring fund established during its 1996 spinoff from AT&T Corp. Lucent said Jan. 6 that its fiscal first-quarter profit fell short of analysts' expectations by as much as a third and that sales were little changed from a year ago. 

The warning has brought many of the concerns, ignored while Lucent was beating profit estimates, back into focus, said analyst Mike Geran, of the Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette Securities Corp. 

Critics have charged that earnings in past quarters were artificially high because of money paid back to Lucent from the restructuring fund; that Lucent was able to boost earnings by making fewer contributions to overfunded pension plans; and that Lucent sold receivables to third parties to improve the appearance of its balance sheet. 

Lucent will report earnings next Thursday.

 Intel Corp. (INTC/NASDAQ), up $12 to $103 1/16 (all related figures in U.S. dollars), on volume of 92.1 million shares. 

 Fourth-quarter earnings that bettered even optimistic forecasts drove Intel shares up as much as 17% yesterday. The stock hit a record high of $106 5/8 -- for its biggest one-day gain since 1987 -- before moving back to its close. 

 The firm shipped a record number of microprocessors to computer makers in the fourth quarter, a fact that flew in the face of concerns year-end business would sag due to Y2K fears. 

 Several analysts issued positive ratings on Intel stock yesterday. Erika Klauer of Deutsche Bank Alex Brown, for instance, maintained a "strong buy" rating with a 12-month target of $122 a share. John Lazlo at PaineWebber Inc. maintained a "buy" rating and moved his target to $120 from $90. Daniel Niles of Robertson Stephens issued a "buy" rating with a price target of $125.

 One analyst, however, said the magnitude of Lucent's recent profitwarning could have sparked some interest from the SEC.

Hershey Foods Corp. stock, already depressed by computer-related distribution problems and industry-wide lethargy, fell 10 percent yesterday to the lowest level in more than three years before rebounding to a 4.7 percent loss. 

The shares traded as low as $40 -- the lowest since July 1996 -- before closing down 2.12 1/2, at $42.56 1/4. More than 4.7 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, 10 times the daily average of 452,500 shares during the last 50 trading days. 

Hershey stock is down 34 percent from a 52-week high of $64.87 1/ 2 a share last Feb. 24. 

The nation's No. 1 candy maker and analysts were unable to explain the stock slide and heavy trading. 

"There's no news coming out of Hershey [yesterday] that would have an effect on the stock price," company spokesman Mike Kinney said. "Basically, the food group as a whole has taken a beating." 

During the last 12 months, Hershey shares have fallen 28 percent, compared with an average decline of 19 percent for food-industry stocks in general. During the same time, the Standard &Poor's index of the nation's top 500 companies -- one of them is Hershey -- rose 19 percent. 

Hershey stock has been under pressure -- the company fell short of earnings expectations in five of the last six quarters -- but analysts said the shortcomings already were factored in the market. 

"Every major package-food stock [was] getting hit," said Jeff Kanter, an analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "Hershey's getting hurt the worst. There's no explanation for it. It's almost as if someone just decided to get out of food stock holdings." 

Hershey, which employs 7,200 people in central Pennsylvania, issued its latest profit warning on Dec. 28, saying fourth-quarter earnings will fall below already lowered expectations. Those earnings will be announced on Jan. 31. 

Last week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it will continue to rely on other candy manufacturers to help stock its shelves through Valentine's Day and probably Easter. Wal-Mart accounted for 14 percent of Hershey's $4.4 billion in sales last year. 

Hershey has been plagued with distribution problems since it installed a $112 million computer and software system last summer. It is still unable to meet all of Wal-Mart's candy needs, a spokesperson for the retailer said. 

"I think that's very significant," said analyst Doug Christopher of Crowell Weedon in Los Angeles. "When the world's largest retailer comes in and says it's still having problems, something's wrong." 

Both Hershey and Wal-Mart said they are seeing progress in Hershey's ability to fill orders timelier. Hershey said some orders were taking up to 12 days to fill -- more than double the usual turnaround time -- last summer and fall, but that distribution has since improved. 

"They say they're working with customers," Christopher said. "But these days you are supposed to react -- and react quickly."

 UAL SHARES TUMBLE AFTER  WARNING  ON  PROFIT  AIRLINE EXPECTS FUEL, LABOR COSTS TO PUSH ANNUAL EARNINGS 28% BELOW ESTIMATES

 Shares of the nation's top air carriers plunged Thursday after UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, said its earnings this year will be far below expectations because of higher fuel and labor costs. 

 UAL Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James Goodwin told airline analysts in New York that UAL's annual earnings would be as much as 28 percent below the consensus estimates. 

 Just hours before the UAL announcement, Continental Airlines said its fourth quarter would fall short of expectations because of changes in the way it accounts for the cost of its frequent-flier program. 

 UAL blamed a combination of woes for its shortfall. "If we were only dealing with the challenge of higher labor costs in 2000, unit cost growth would actually be consistent with recent trends," said Goodwin. "However, we also face the industry-wide issue of higher fuel costs for the year." 

 Earnings are expected to range from $7 to $9 per share, rather than the $9.95 per share Wall Street expected, Goodwin said. 

 UAL stock closed at $64.87, down $9.87, or 13 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Shares of Ft. Worth-based AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, and Houston-based Continental, which issued the earnings warning late Wednesday, were sharply lower. 

 Separately, United announced the creation of an e-commerce unit that will become a UAL subsidiary during the second quarter. 

 The unit will manage the company's on-line business, which has been doubling annually since 1995. 

 United said the unit would become involved with developing all Internet avenues--UAL's own Web site, partnerships with other travel sites, a group site being developed by major U.S. airlines and wireless Internet. 

 United received about 4 percent of its bookings on the Internet in 1999 and hopes that total will grow to 20 percent by 2003, Scott Praven, head of the new e-commerce unit, told Reuters. 

 The unit is being structured with an eye toward attracting Web- savvy talent, providing an entrepreneurial environment and compensation structure, United said. 

 UAL eventually could spin off the unit, Praven told Reuters. 

 Meantime, analysts reacted sharply to the UAL and Continental earnings warnings, which came just one day after Sam Buttrick, airline analyst for PaineWebber, issued a report saying, "Many March quarter estimates are probably too high unless oil retreats immediately." 

 The industry's profit forecasts are "totally back-end loaded on lower oil forecast and steady demand growth," the report said. A drop in demand or a slower drop in oil prices than expected could easily upset those profit forecasts, it said. 

 But Brian Harris, airline analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said the market's reaction to the UAL and Continental announcements was overdone. "UAL is very likely to fall on the high end of 2000 guidance given superior revenue performance," said Harris, who cited strong trends in Pacific routes and easier comparisons with earlier domestic results. 

 "UAL is getting analyst estimate cuts out of the way early," he said, alluding to the profit warning the airline was forced to make last June after an overly-optimistic presentation to analysts at the end of 1998. 

 Other analysts were less optimistic. Merrill Lynch lowered its recommendation to a hold from a strong buy. 

 Further revisions of profit forecasts among other major airlines are almost certain, according to Charles Hill, director of research for First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 "Even the airlines themselves, including UAL, have apparently been behind the curve on where fuel costs were headed," said Hill. 

 "If the airline analysts have been keying off the oil-price estimates of their firm's oil analyst, then further downward earnings per share revisions at other airlines are likely," he said. 

 In Thursday's analyst briefing, UAL said fuel prices were going to be 71 cents a gallon, 25 percent higher than last year's estimates. Labor costs are being driven higher by new contracts being negotiated with pilots, mechanics and agents. 

 UAL also said that while its domestic capacity will remain essentially unchanged, its international capacity will grow 7.5 percent. 

 The airline said its Atlantic capacity will be up 7 percent, and its Pacific capacity up 11 percent. Its Latin America capacity will be down 3 percent.

 NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday with the blue chip index striking its second record this week after bond yields fell off recent highs on mixed inflation news and a Government debt buyback plan. 

 The Nasdaq market surged after software giant Microsoft Corp., which accounts for about 12 percent of the Nasdaq composite's moves, and General Electric Co. announced a pact to interconnect consumer devices. 

 After the market closed on Thursday, Microsoft said co-founder Bill Gates was giving up the chief executive position at the software giant and named long-time No. 2 Steve Ballmer to replace him in the job. 

 "The market had been overreacting to interest rates concerns," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "It is really not a big surprise that it has rallied back." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) rose 31.33 points, or 0.27 percent, to 11,582.43, surpassing Monday's record of 11,572.20. Leadership in the 30-stock index came from financial services firms J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc., up 3-3/16 at 122-13/16, and American Express Co. 13/16 at 156. 

 Intel Corp., the world's largest chipmaker and a Dow component, slipped 3/16 to 91-1/16 ahead of its report on earnings, which beat Wall Street's estimates. 

 The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC) sprinted ahead 107.19 points, or 2.78 percent, to 3,957,21, recouping most of its losses from the previous sessions. 

 The technology-rich index got a big boost from Microsoft, which rose 2 to 107-13/16, and No. 2 U.S. long-distance carrier MCI WorldCom Inc., which was up 3-11/16 to 47-7/8, on favourable comments from Wall Street analysts. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX) ended up 17.43 points, or 1.22 percent, at 1449.68. 

 Stoking the gains in the stocks was the improving bond market, which has stumbled recently on fears the U.S. Federal Reserve may hike interest rates several times this year to curb inflation. 

 The U.S. Treasury 30-year bond rose 24/32, pushing the yield down to 6.65 from Wednesday's close of 6.72 percent, its highest level since July 1997. 

 News on the inflation front was mixed with prices at the wholesale level for December matching expectations but retail prices for the same month showing Americans spent more than was anticipated. 

 The U.S. Commerce Department reported retail sales rose by a stronger-than-expected 1.2 percent. Economist polled by Reuters had expected a 1 percent rise. Excluding autos, retail sales rose by 1.4 percent, the biggest rise since April 1996. 

 "On balance, these two key reports reinforce the underlying story of red-hot growth and stable inflation, which was the hallmark of the U.S. economy in 1999," Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, said in a research note. 

 Analysts said some on Wall Street had been bracing for numbers showing greater inflation, which would have set off more alarms about more aggressive Fed action on interest rate hikes. 

 Helping the bond market was news the U.S. Treasury plans to buy back $30 billion in debt, which would pull some supply out of the fixed income market. 

 The market closed ahead of word from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who was scheduled to deliver a speech on technology and the economy at the Economic Club of New York. 

 The market will get some more news on the inflation front on Friday, when the Consumer Price Index, a gauge of inflation at the consumer level, is due out. 

 In the broader market, breadth was positive for a change with advancing issues beating declines 18 to 11 on volume of 1.02 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 90 stocks at new highs and 63 at new lows. 

 In corporate news, Warner-Lambert Co. rose 5-1/16 to 91-7/8 after the drug maker's board authorised talks with suitor Pfizer Inc., which jeopardises Warner-Lambert's $53.8 billion merger plans with American Home Products Corp.. 

 Pfizer rose 1-13/16 to 36-7/8 and AHP climbed 7/16 to 42-5/8. 

 The airline sector took a dive after UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines and the world's largest carrier, issued a profit warning and saw its stock dip 9-3/4 to 65. 

 Internet service provider America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc., the world's largest media company, both stopped a multi-day decline that followed initial enthusiasm for their merger announced on Monday. AOL, the most actively traded stock on the NYSE, was up 4-3/16 at 64-5/16. Time Warmer was up 3-11/16 at 82-5/16. 

 The Internet sector on the whole was robust with theStreet.com's Internet index up 6.43 percent. 

 Apple Computer Inc. rose 9-9/16 to 96-3/4 after several Wall Street analysts raised their ratings on the stock. 

 Banking stocks rallied on the improving bond market with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's index .BKX) up 2.88 percent. 

 Charles Schwab Corp., the world's No. 1 discount and Web broker, rose 2-11/16 to 40-5/16 after saying it would buy U.S. Trust Corp. for $2.7 billion in stock to create a full-service brokerage. Other online brokers also advanced. 

 U.S. Trust rose 53-7/8 to 132-3/4. 

 The The Washington Post Co., publisher of the newspaper of the same name, was up 10-3/16 at 583-7/16 after its board of directors increased its common stock dividend to $5.40 per share from $5.20 and approved the repurchase of 500,000 shares.

 BILL TUCKER, CNN ANCHOR:  Inflation in check, retail sales up, wholesale prices flat, the markets unsure. 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN ANCHOR:  The little operating system that could:  We talk with VA Linux`s CEO about the window of opportunity for this high-flying stock to compete with Microsoft. 

 TUCKER:  It`s "Investment Club Thursday":  Father against daughter in a generational clash of investment styles as this New Jersey group figures out how to cash in on this market. 

 KEENAN:  And, the future is the pits at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Our "It`s Their Job" series continues as we sort through the signs and screams that make up the day of a futures trader. 

 ANNOUNCER:  From CNN and CNNfn, this is IN THE MONEY, with Bill Tucker, Terry Keenan and Daryn Kagan. 

 TUCKER:  Hello, everyone, and welcome to IN THE MONEY.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 KEENAN:  And hello from me as well.  I`m Terry Keenan. 

 Brace yourself for another wild day in the markets, although today the swings are pretty much to the upside for the Nasdaq so far. We have a lot of news to tell you about, investors on full earnings alert this morning.  We`re on earnings watch, waiting for the numbers out from Intel; that due after the closing bell this afternoon. 

 TUCKER:  And of which we`ve been telling you all week, Alan Greenspan is set to address the New York Economic Club this evening. It`s his first speech of the year; dare we say, it is his first speech of the millennium, and many people are expecting the Federal Reserve chairman to give some hints about where he sees interest rates headed. 

 KEENAN:  And hopefully he will, because a lot of people will be disappointed, there`s been so much focus on this speech. 

 We`re also following a huge hit in the shares of UAL this morning, the parent company of United Airlines warning of an earnings shortfall.  And our Rhonda Schaffler`s going to have more on the carnage in that stock, down about 8.      TUCKER:  That`s right, because the problems they warned about there are not specific to UAL, they`re higher costs and higher fuel prices. 

 And we`ve got a big deal this morning:  Charles Schwab is cutting a deal this morning saying it`s buying US Trust for nearly $3 billion. 

 KEENAN:  And that stock, US Trust, up about $38 a share, so a big winner, and a happy morning if you own those shares. 

 There is sort of some news if you own shares of AOL, the stock, of course, as you know, has fallen nearly 20 percent this week after the announcement of its acquisition of Time Warner, the parent of this network. This morning, some relief, AOL shares having a pretty nice bounce.  We`re up about 1 3/4 and we`re going to keep you up to speed on all the twists and turns in this deal. 

 And, you know, it`s important, so we hear, that that AOL stock stays above $60 a share, some of the deal makers behind that deal looking for that stock to stay above those levels. 

 TUCKER:  That`s because, if it falls below there, the premium that was offered initially diminishes and maybe the incentive for the deal begins to disappear.  But, as Terry mentioned, AOL stock is higher today, as is Time Warner`s. 

 Let`s get a quick on all the markets, as a matter of fact.  Very quickly, the Dow opened today higher, turned lower, back in positive territory now.  The Dow being helped by a very happy J.P. Morgan today, up better than $3 a share.  However, it`s being hurt in terms of performance by IBM and Microsoft, IBM down more than 2, Microsoft down more than 3 at the moment, the Dow Industrials posting a collective gain of 14 1/2 points at 11565. 

 Nasdaq has been in positive territory all day long.  We are off of our highs of the session, but it`s a much better looking market than we`ve seen in the last several sessions, currently up 36 1/2 points. 

 KEENAN:  Now, let`s take a look at what`s going on in the bond market. And for a change, we have a little bit of rally.  We`re up a quarter of a point.  Lots of economic numbers that we`re going to run through in just a minute, but the yield -- the important thing is that the yield is down below that 6.7 percent level. 

 And let`s go to the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade, the heart of all the action in the bond market, and bring in Ceci Rodgers. 

 And, Ceci, a bit of a relief rally this morning. 

 CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Terry. 

 Well, many analysts are calling it a brief bounce and don`t count on it lasting; that`s at least the sentiment, still very negative on interest rates even though we`re getting a bit of a respite today. Still, the news out this morning on the economy shows that wallets were opened wide in December and consumers were spending on everything in sight, and that means that the economy came roaring into the year 2000. And they believe that the Federal Reserve is more concerned about consumer demand right now than it is about inflation. Inflation, at the producer level this morning, coming in completely tame, really. 

 So, inflation is still no problem, but the demand side of the economy is, and all eyes are sort of tuned toward New York and what the Fed chairman may have to say tonight in his speech to the Economic Club. And people do expect for him to sort of hint at whether the Fed is going to be really aggressive in raising interest rates at this upcoming February meeting or just raise the 25 basis points a quarter of a percentage point that`s pretty much built into the market right now -- Terry, Bill. 

 KEENAN:  OK. 

 TUCKER:  All right, thanks, Ceci. 

 Well, that`s the look from the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade. Let`s get a check from how things look from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Rhonda Schaffler is standing by there. 

 And we had a big drop in the Dow transports with UAL under pressure. Rhonda, bring us up to date on that. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  I`ll say.  Right now, that index is down close to 40 points, and UAL is really the primary problem. 

 Let`s take a look at how that stock is holding up at the moment. A big loss for it, in fact:  It is down better than $8.  You made reference to the situation with UAL coming out with an earnings warning.  Seven to $9 a share is what UAL is looking for; the Street was looking for $9.82. Fuel costs are going to be up about 25 percent over the previous year. The company said that would be OK, it could handle it.  But it`s in the middle of contract negotiations with both the people who fly and fix the planes, and UAL coming out and saying they know they`re going to be paying these workers more money, and that is part of the problem for the earnings shortfall, combined with the fact that you`ve got this sharp run-up in fuel prices. 

 Continental is currently down 1 7/8.  Late yesterday, it said it would take charges totaling $48 million in 1999 related to how it accounts for frequent flyer mileage credits. 

 Let`s show you what`s going on with the Dow now.  A very moderate gain in the index, and we`re seeing not too much movement in a number of the stocks on the Dow.  The reason for that is everyone is waiting for this speech by Alan Greenspan tonight.  As far as how groups go, we mentioned transports aren`t doing we`ll; financials having a pretty steady performance, getting some help from the bond market at the moment.  But traders here are saying, in some ways, the market is a bit confused because people are just unclear with the interest rate picture, and we`re heading into earnings season, too.      Here`s the Dow stocks for you:  J.P. Morgan currently up 3 1/4; General Electric is up 1 5/8. Among the stocks slumping, Alcoa, best performing Dow stock last year, down near $1, and IBM is off more than $1. 

 That`s it from here.  Back to Bill and Terry. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks, Rhonda. 

 You know, the semiconductor stocks have been on fire of late. Intel`s out with earnings after the bell today. 

 Let`s go to the Nasdaq where a chip deal leads off today`s most active and most -- biggest movers.  Let`s bring in Charles Molineaux -- Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes and, Terry, we`re looking at a pretty positive day for tech stocks overall; the Nasdaq is now up about 42 points at 3892, which is pretty nice.  We`re also looking at decent volume, 420 million shares.  And, yes, we`re following a big deal in the chip sector; chip stocks are generally down slightly, but not Etec Systems.  Etec Systems makes equipment that spins those patters onto silicon wafers for making microchips. It is being bought by chip equipment giant Applied Materials for $1.7 billion or 82.46 a share. Etec is the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq today, up $23.  Applied Materials, however, is not doing as well.  It is off by $6.  Some analysts have been questioning the wisdom of buying Etec and whether it`s really a good fit for Applied.  Some of them are also concerned about high research and development costs. 

 Take a look at some of these other names that are in motion on the Nasdaq today: Real Networks.  The analysts at Deutsche Bank have actually started covering Real Networks and they give it a strong buy rating and an 18-month price target of $250 a share.  Right now, it is up about 11 percent or $14 on the day today. 

 Also, take a look at Apple Computer.  It is having a bullish day, up $7 or 8 percent, now at 94.25.  Morgan Stanley has upgraded its rating on Apple from neutral to outperform.  Also, Credit Suisse First Boston analysts have raised their projection for Apple`s first-quarter earnings up to 91 cents -- dollars a share -- cents a share, rather. They all like the strong quarter that Apple has been having. 

 MCI WorldCom, one of our big telecoms, is gaining today.  Still, it`s up almost $2 or 4 percent on the day today.  It`s recovering after having sold off to a 52-week low on Tuesday.  Some analysts say it got unfairly dumped because investors got the wrong idea about the impact of the America Online-Time Warner merger and its impact on MCI. 

 Intel, for its part, continues to slip on the day.  It is now down by almost $2, or almost 2 percent, too.  Intel, of course, is going to report its fourth-quarter earnings after the markets close today. Analyst are expecting a profit of 63 cents a share. Expectations are pretty much bullish all around for Intel, but it did see a nice run up yesterday even as the rest of the market slipped. We could be seeing a little profit taking heading into that earnings announcement which is coming out tonight. 

 The Nasdaq Composite continues to look good.  We`re now up by 44 points.  Wait -- no, now we`re up to 46 points at 3896.  So the tech stocks, after being sold off for the past couple of days, are looking at something of a recovery, at least so far, today -- Bill, Terry. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Charles, thanks for that report. 

 KEENAN:  Well, different story, though, for Microsoft, that stock down sharply again today.  It`s down about 2 1/2.  That, of course, is one of the most widely held tech stocks and it`s down from a high of 119, trading now at just about 102.  We may know more today about its fate regarding the government`s antitrust suit against the company. 

 And we`re getting some word from different sources... 

 TUCKER:  Yes, two sources actually close to the prosecution confirm to CNN that federal and state lawyers suing Microsoft are recommending that the company, in fact, be cut into pieces. 

 Steve Young joins us now with more and what such a move might mean for investors. 

 And, Steve, right now, investors not upbeat about what it might mean for them. 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Bill, we`ve had indications from the prosecutorial side of this debate that they want Microsoft carved up into at least three companies, could be more.  They don`t want to maintain an operating system monopoly.  As you indicate the company is under pressure, and the stock`s been off several points today and several points yesterday, as well. 

 It`s unclear whether this is an end-stage play by the prosecutors or whether they indeed need to hold to this position.  We are told that this carve-up-the-company-into-three-places was conveyed to the federal prosecutor -- rather the mediator on Monday of last week. 

 I`m afraid there`s an interruption in my audio line to you, so I think I`ll have to return it to you now. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Steve.  Unfortunately -- can you hear me now, Steve, or if you can`t we`re just going to have to move on. 

 YOUNG:  I can. 

 TUCKER:  You can?  You know, the argument of breaking the company up is not necessarily new, but what is new is an argument being advanced, yesterday, in an article in the "Times" that perhaps this merger of AOL and Time Warner would mitigate a ruling by the court because, in their eyes, it creates a, quote, unquote, competitor to Microsoft.  Any reaction to that view? 

 YOUNG:  Microsoft is saying that the AOL-Time Warner deal was concocted just to compete with Microsoft.  I`m sure that may be a factor, but no one is suggesting that when AOL combines with Time Warner they`ll be competing in the operating business, so I think that`s fair to say that`s a bit of subterfuge.  Microsoft has and would continue to have a monopoly in desktop operating systems. 

 One of the wilder rumors heard today in New York, in fact, is that Microsoft may try to bust up that deal by acquiring either Time Warner or AOL. 

 The audio interruption has occurred again, so I think I`m going to rest my case. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks a lot, Steve. 

 TUCKER:  Right on the good stuff too, as a matter of fact. 

 KEENAN:  Yes, it would be interesting if Microsoft made a bid for one of those companies.  Not sure if it would help its case with the government, but we will stay tuned. 

 Just ahead on IN THE MONEY: it`s the company that holds the record for the best first day performance ever for an initial public offering, and it could give Microsoft a run for its money.  We`re going to talk about the future of VA Linux with its CEO in just a moment. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, and plus, should we be adding Biogen to our IN THE MONEY portfolio?  We`ll put that company under scrutiny.  It`s today`s "Stock of the Day." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  A rude awakening, this morning, for investors in Tommy Hilfiger.  That stock is dropping almost $3 a share as the designer warns earnings for the last quarter will come in at least nine cents less than estimates, also warning for the current quarter; disappointing holiday sales are to blame.  And that stock down from the 40`s to just 16, this morning. 

 TUCKER:  It`s funny, coming off a strong holiday season, too, to give a profit warning like that. 

 Well, Attorney General Janet Reno is defending her position on the future of young Elian Gonzalez.  What she had to say about the legal tug-of-war over the six-year-old is coming up. 

 KEENAN:  Time now for a look at the day`s headlines beyond the markets, and for that we turn to Daryn in Atlanta. 

 Good morning, Daryn. 

 DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Good morning, Terry and Bill.  The latest on Reno`s comments in just a moment. 

 First, though, to Michigan, where a 13-year-old is undergoing a sentencing hearing, this hour, for a second-degree murder.  Nathaniel Abraham was 11 when he shot an 18-year-old man with a rifle.  A Michigan law lets juveniles receive adult prison sentences.  The question of whether he should be sentenced as an adult or as a juvenile has prompted protests from the Reverend Al Sharpton, Martin Luther King III and others.  They`re right now surrounding that Pontiac, Michigan, courthouse.  When that sentence coming down, we will bring it live here to you on CNN. 

 Attorney General Janet Reno won`t say what the government might do to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba, but she`s standing behind last week`s INS ruling to send the six-year-old back to his father, and, she says, the boy`s best interests should come first. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 JANET RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL:  There is a little six-year-old boy who survived one of the most traumatic events that any child could experience, to lose his mother there in the gulf stream, to float for as long as he did and live, to come ashore under the circumstances that he did, we`ve just got to think about that little boy. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KAGAN:  Lawyers for Elian are taking the federal government to court hoping to overturn the INS ruling. 

 International criticism is growing over a new Russian restriction in Chechnya.  It prevents most Chechen men between 10 and 60 years old from entering or leaving the breakaway republic.  Russian military forces were caught off-guard by a weekend rebel strike in Chechnya. Soldiers at checkpoints are now on alert.  Moscow says that its forces have the situation under control. 

 And in downtown Cleveland, streets are expected to remain closed until early next week, that following a huge water main break.  The break sent 25 million gallons of water onto the streets.  Schools throughout the city are closed.  Residents are asked to boil drinking water while bacteria tests are conducted. 

 And that`s the news for now.  I`ll be back later with the latest word on global warming.  The Earth is on a slow sizzle, but the air around it is not.  Figure that one out.  Right now back up to Bill and Terry in New York. 

 TUCKER:  What is this, like today`s puzzle or something? 

 KAGAN:  It`s a puzzle, yes, it`s a riddle. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Daryn, thank you very much. 

 KEENAN:  Maybe that`s why we had snow for a couple of minutes here in New York City... 

 TUCKER:  First snow of the season, by the way, here in New York, and it didn`t... 

 KEENAN:  Yes, and it didn`t last very long. 

 TUCKER:  It went away, I know.      Well, let`s talk about VA Linux. This stock soared 698 percent on its first day of trading.  That`s the best first-day debut ever. The stock closed at 239 after pricing at $30 a share, but it has been pretty much downhill ever since, the stock closing yesterday at 144. As you can see today, it`s down another 4 1/4, trading at 140 1/2. 

 But what is Linux besides a stock?  Well, VA Linux builds computers and workstations which operate on the Linux operating system.  Now, Linux is a free, open-source operating system.  It`s known for its reliability, it`s extraordinarily stable, as they say in the business, but it is also known for being a little bit less than consumer friendly. 

 KEENAN:  That`s right.  Joining us now to give us some answers on how perhaps you can make money on this complex and free operating system, from Mountain View, California, is the chief executive officer of VA Linux, Larry Augustin. 

 Mr. Augustin, welcome.  Good to have you with us. 

 LARRY AUGUSTIN, CEO, VA LINUX SYSTEMS:  Thank you, Terry, thank you, Bill. 

 KEENAN:  You know, you were so enamored by Linux that you decided not to go to work at Yahoo! and to stick with this company and creating this company.  What`s so great about Linux? 

 AUGUSTIN:  Well, Linux is this change in the way we do operating systems.  Instead of coming from a big proprietary vender like Microsoft, Linux is developed openly on the Internet by programmers working together.  It`s a change in the way we build software. 

 TUCKER:  But Larry, how do you make money at it?  I mean, it`s --a lot of people I know that work with Linux do like it.  However, you`ve got to -- you`ve got the task of making money off of it, and you haven`t been successful yet, though many think your business model is promising. 

 AUGUSTIN:  Well, you know, we`ve been profitable in the past, and as we`ve decided to invest in growing and reaching the markets, of course, we`re losing money while doing that.  But as we grow, there`s a tremendous opportunity.  We sell to those companies like eToys and DoubleClick, building out Internet infrastructure on Linux.  Linux is the leading operating system powering servers on the Internet.  It`s a tremendous market opportunity, and that`s where we make our money. 

 KEENAN:  You`re often referred to as Microsoft`s menace or the only competition to Microsoft.  How, if at all, do you think a breakup of Microsoft would effect Linux and companies such as yours? 

 AUGUSTIN:  Well, I think the breakup of Microsoft would have a positive effect.  One of the things is, we`d love to see all of the Microsoft applications, like Microsoft Office, running on Linux.  If those applications were in a separate company, I think we`d see them ported to Linux and available there.      TUCKER:  One thing that Microsoft has been able to do very successfully, Larry, is make a very friendly face on its operating system, which is why people feel comfortable with windows.  Same can`t be said yet, really, of Linux.  Do you ever see it being a consumer product, or does this really remain a back-room corporate product? 

 AUGUSTIN:  Well, I think people don`t realize that Linux can be very easy to use.  Some of the most advanced development going on in user interfaces is happening for Linux today.  I think it can be a friendly, easy to use consumer product, as we get applications on it for consumers. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks, Larry, we appreciate it. 

 AUGUSTIN:  Thank you. 

 KEENAN:  Larry Augustin, he is the CEO of VA Linux. 

 TUCKER:  And just ahead on IN THE MONEY: our "Stock of the Day. It is a company that says it will beat the street`s earnings estimates this quarter.  But will it win over investors?  Find out in today`s "Stock of the Day" segment. 

 KEENAN:  And it`s "Investment Club Thursday." Today we will introduce you to a group with $40,000 to invest and some differing ideas about what risks to take in this market.  We`ll be right back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  All right, happy looking stocks today.  The Dow is up 26 points.  The Nasdaq up 31 points.  Most of the major market indices higher today, save for transports, they are under pressure, airlines falling, and that index is down 35 points. 

 KEENAN:  Our "Stock of the Day" today, a company that has been under pressure in the last couple of sessions.  Biogen has already said it will beat the Street estimates in the fourth quarter.  It will be reporting after the bell today.  Despite the advance notice, the stock has been caught in a sell-off in the red-hot biotech sector.  It has dropped almost $7 in the last two trading sessions.  So is it a buying opportunity?  We consider this, as Biogen is our "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 (voice-over):  Biogen is one of the darlings of the biotech business, and with good reason.  The company`s multiple sclerosis drug, Avonex, has been a home-run with sales of more than $700 million.  It alone has helped make Biogen one of the most valuable biotech companies in the world. 

 The stock doubled in value last year, although it has fallen off so far in 2000.  Still, until it gets approval for other marketable drugs, its growth is expected the rise 24 percent over the next five years, trailing behind the sector`s average growth rate by six percent. The bulls expect Biogen to continue ringing in solid results, thanks to Avonex, and they`re betting on its treatment for psoriasis. Testing looks promising, although federal approval is still several years away. 

 But the bears say Biogen is in need of a blockbuster, particularly since it halted trials on its immune system regulator drug Antova last fall, and R&D expenditures could possibly weigh on future earnings. 

 So the question is, should we inject our portfolio with some Biogen shares? 

 KEENAN:  OK, ahead of those earnings numbers due out after the bell, Biogen is up 1 11/16. 

 TUCKER:  Well, joining us now to talk more about Biogen is ING Barings senior biotech analyst Jon Alsenas. 

 And John, welcome to IN THE MONEY. 

 JON ALSENAS, ING BARINGS:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  So is Biogen a one-trick pony in essence?  Is Avonex really all it has in its arsenal. 

 ALSENAS:  It has got a couple of products in the pipeline, one for psoriasis, which we think is promising; but primarily, right now, all of the interest is in Avonex, and we think that Avonex is particularly interesting because it is the gold standard for multiple sclerosis care, and physicians are beginning to rethink the way they treat multiple sclerosis.  They want to treat patients immediately, soon, early in the course of the disease, to prevent the progression of the disease.  So it is a very important product. 

 KEENAN:  They also have this drug Antova, and it seemed very promising against some autoimmune diseases, and they stopped testing, right, in the fall.  What happened there?  And is there any hope to revive that drug? 

 ALSENAS:  Antova was an extremely promising drug against a very interesting target.  And what happened was, there were some instances of coagulation in those patients that were unexpected.  There were a few strokes that occurred.  We`re not sure if those had to do with the fact that these patients were already sick and were at higher risk. 

 The company put the trials on hold and is in the process of evaluating what`s going on.  But the good news is, we have a lot of good drugs that work as anticoagulants, and it is possible to develop the drug in tandem with an anticoagulant. 

 TUCKER:  How risky an investment is a biotech investment? Against others, how does it compare? 

 ALSENAS:  Well, right now, Biogen, based on traditional valuation metrics, is actually quite inexpensive.  Compared with some of the other larger cap names, which have gone up as much as two-to-five fold this year.  Biogen looks cheap.  There is minimal downside risk, some of these other names that have done so extraordinarily well.  It has almost become like the Internet.  We`re really looking far into the future to see the potential of some of these companies. 

 KEENAN:  Are they spending enough on R&D to ensure a strong pipeline going forward? 

 ALSENAS:  This year, we estimate they will spend just over $200 million, which is roughly a quarter of their revenue, it is actually a little bit more than that, which is very much the industry standard. So I don`t think they can get criticized for that. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Jon, thank you. 

 ALSENAS:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  John Alsenas, of ING Barings, thanks for being here. 

 ALSENAS:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  All right, now that you`ve heard the pros and cons for Biogen, click onto our CNNfn.com Web site and vote on whether we should put it in our IN THE MONEY portfolio. 

 KEENAN:  And 69 percent of you voted to buy JDS Uniphase, yesterday that was our "Stock of the Day." And that means that we are going to buy $1,000 worth of the fiber-optic telecommunications maker. 

 TUCKER:  As for your on-line poll asking you to vote on which stocks we should sell out of the portfolio, the ones that got the thumbs-down: you can see there on the screen, we sold off Lernout & Hauspie, and the whole group down through Ford Motor Company, got rid of two auto stocks in there as well. 

 KEENAN:  I was just checking JDS Uniphase, having a nice pop today, up about six.  Brian Finnerty making a really good case for that stock, and it got a pretty high vote from our viewers. 

 TUCKER:  That`s true.  Now, we sold those 10 stocks, just so you know, we made a profit of about $1,900, enabling us to go into the market here and a do a little bit more buying. 

 KEENAN:  And just ahead on IN THE MONEY:  It`s "Investment Club Thursday." This week, meet a group that is looking to turn things around.  After keeping up with the S&P 500 for five years straight, they didn`t have a very good year last year.  Can this New Jersey club get back their investments back on track? 

 TUCKER:  And into the pits we go.  Our "It`s Their Job" series continues, as we show you what it takes to navigate the chaos of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  You`re looking at a live picture of the Chrysler Building, through the clouds here, but no snow day in New York City. We just had a brief flurry, our first snow of the year. 

 TUCKER:  A lot of disappointment in the newsroom too, I might add. Everybody was excited that snow finally began to fall from the skies. 

 KEENAN:  First snow of the season, in fact, we haven`t seen any snow at all. 

 Hello, everyone, and welcome back to IN THE MONEY. I`m Terry Keenan. 

 TUCKER:  And hello from me as well, I`m Bill Tucker. 

 KEENAN:  Well, another busy half hour coming up for you, including today`s investment club.  The Jefferson Investment Club had $40,000 to spend and we sat with them while they decided which stocks to buy.  They are going to be joining us in just a minute. 

 TUCKER:  And with interest rates on the rise, what does that mean for you if you are in the market to buy a home?  Well, we`ll be joined by the chairman of the nation`s biggest home lender, Fannie Mae. 

 KEENAN:  Yes, mortgage rates up to levels we haven`t seen in a couple of years. 

 TUCKER:  In better than three years, as a matter of matter of fact. 

 KEENAN:  OK, let`s get you up-to-speed on the markets and what is going on this Thursday morning.  And as you can see, we have moved to the upside for both the Dow and the Nasdaq composite.  The Dow now up about 19 points, despite a drag from shares of Microsoft, that stock is down almost 3 again today, amid continuing talk that the government is seeking to break the company up into three parts. 

 The Nasdaq composite enjoying a fairly healthy rebound, as you can see there, up 28 points.  And we`re on earnings watch for Intel. It has been on a roll of late, and it is expected to report after the closing bell. 

 TUCKER:  Bond, look at that: 6.70 percent.  Interest rates definitely on the rise.  Market a little edgy ahead of a speech by Chairman Alan Greenspan, who speaks tonight in New York City before the New York Economic Club. 

 Well, in this installment of our weekly "Investment Club" series, we spotlight the Jefferson Investment Club of Montclair, New Jersey. Like many of the more than 37,000 clubs nationwide, the group meets monthly to select which stocks could be winners and sell the ones they think are sinners.  The day we visited, they were armed with $40,000 and mulling the red-hot Internet stocks. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER (voice-over):  It is a Sunday afternoon in Montclair, New Jersey.  At the Blue Sky restaurant, 10 investors meet to eat lunch and talk about their diet of stocks.  The Jefferson Investment Club digs in right away. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Checks, checks.  Give me your money. 

 TUCKER:  They`re up to $40,000.  Deciding where to invest that money isn`t as easy as writing out checks. 

 CHRISTINE BUCHANAN, JEFFERSON INVESTMENT CLUB:  You watch a stock and you decide:  OK, it`s a little bit too pricey right now, I`m going to wait, and then you watch it, and it goes up and it goes up, and it goes up, and you just want to absolutely have a heart attack, but you didn`t get in. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I want both. 

 BUCHANAN:  If you had to pick one. 

 TUCKER:  They`ve been meeting for five years and have an average annualized return of 22 percent, almost on par with the S&P 500.  But last year, they only gained nine percent. 

 BUCHANAN:  How do you guys feel about getting some Amazon? 

 TUCKER:  At today`s meeting, some of the group want to use the weakness in the market to buy some of the high-flying stocks, like Amazon.com, at better prices. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It`s down, and I think it`s -- they are the only ones in that space.  They`re branded very well. 

 BUCHANAN:  Amazon at market on Monday. 

 TUCKER:  Good enough for this group.  They vote to buy $1,500 of the Internet retailer.  But whether to buy another high-flying tech stock has turned into a family feud.  Christine wants to buy JDS Uniphase, but her father is worried about the stratospheric stock price, ripe perhaps for a fall. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  JDS is up to 180.  The highest was 190. You`ve been through it for a couple of months, and it`s been frustrating for you.  see it going up. 

 TUCKER:  The only way to work this out is by taking it out of the family. 

 BUCHANAN:  OK, so we`re voting, we know we`re going to have one person saying, no way, Jose! 

 TUCKER:  Majority rules here, as the group buys eight shares, perhaps a sweeter decision for some members than others. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 KEENAN:  OK, joining us now here in our studios are Jefferson Investment Club members, Christine Buchanan and MaryAnne Ciniglio, and acting as our money coach today, Jon Burnham of Burnham Securities. 

 Welcome everyone to IN THE MONEY. 

 And Jon, I`m going to toss it over to you.  How are they doing in your opinion? 

 JON BURNHAM, BURNHAM SECURITIES:  Well, I think they`re doing very well.  They have an average appreciation over the last few years about 22 percent.  I understand the nine percent that you`re talking about is not really right, that you actually did quite a bit better because you had a rather large withdrawal. 

 BUCHANAN:  Correct, in August. 

 BURNHAM:  OK, so I don`t know how they actually performed.  You should have performed certainly in the mid 20s last year... 

 BUCHANAN:  Absolutely. 

 BURNHAM:  ... if you were with the types of securities that you are owning.  But anyway, I`m glad to talk to you because I`m a big believer in investment clubs and in people learning about companies. 

 BUCHANAN:  Thank you very much. 

 BURNHAM:  I`m curious, what do you look for when you decide to buy a stock?  What is your -- what specific things do you look at? 

 BUCHANAN:  We take our traditional knowledge of looking for low P/Es, looking for low price-to-book value, as well as high yields.  We look for things that have a lot of potential, and that hopefully that anyone in the club at least knows about and is familiar with. 

 BURNHAM:  It`s interesting because some of the stocks that you have in your portfolio don`t really fill those requirements.  But you have some companies in there that I like very, very much.  And particularly EMC, which you own, which is one of my favorites, and I think you will be very happy that you own that one.  And your other --you have some very good companies in here.  I think you`ve done a great job. 

 BUCHANAN:  Thank you.  We have a few questions. 

 BURNHAM:  Please. 

 BUCHANAN:  As an investment club, we only meet once a month, and as an individual investor you have the opportunity to invest every day, you can take advantages of dips in the market.  If you had the opportunity only to trade once a month, how would your investment philosophy alter? 

 BURNHAM:  Well, number one, if you can only invest once a month, you can`t trade.  So you just have to hope that on that particular day that you buy, maybe you get a weak day, maybe even a really weak day. I think you have to have a bit longer view.  I don`t know exactly what your long-term view is, whether it`s a year, two years, three years, or six months.  But I think investing once a month, you have got to have at least a six-month view, otherwise -- particularly in this market that`s so volatile. 

 BUCHANAN:  Absolutely. 

 BURNHAM:  You can have a big profit and have it go away in a day. 

 BUCHANAN:  Right. 

 MARYANNE CINIGLIO, JEFFERSON INVESTMENT CLUB:  So in light of the recent volatility in the capital markets, do you think this is something that will end?  Is it a fad much like the biotech stocks and the casino stocks? or is this here to stay?  Will we ever return to the Warren Buffett scenario of the buying and hold? 

 BURNHAM:  I don`t think so.  I think that, by definition, with the stock market at very high levels that it`s at, or high historically, time will tell whether we are really that high over the years.  The higher it goes, the more volatile it`s going to be, that`s just the way anything works.  So if you have a 200 or 300 point break in the market or 200 or 300 point up day, it`s not that big a move percentwise. 

 So I think the volatility is here to stay, it reflects the incredible numbers of people that are in the business.  It also reflects the type of markets we have.  All these electronic markets, which I think accentuate the wide moves, because it`s all done by machine.  And so if everybody piles in, you know what happens.  So, no, I think it`s here to stay, and I expect it to get worse. 

 TUCKER:  All right Jon, thank you very much.  Jon Burnham serving as our investment coach today.  We also want to thank members of the investment club MaryAnne Ciniglio and Christine Buchanan fro coming in from Montclair, New Jersey.  Thank you, ladies, appreciate it. 

 KEENAN:  Thanks, ladies.  We also have some breaking news. Warner-Lambert is authorizing talks with Pfizer, perhaps a break in this bidding war for Warner-Lambert.  What had been a hostile bidding war, Warner-Lambert refusing to talk previously to Pfizer, despite what appeared most trading days to be a higher offer than the offer that Warner-Lambert had expected from American Home Products, but evidently Warner-Lambert has decided to make this friendlier.  They, of course, were going to all have a showdown in Delaware court, but Warner-Lambert now agreeing to talk with Pfizer, and Warner-Lambert`s shares are up fractionally on that news.  American Home Products down just a fraction. 

 TUCKER:  It is also worth noting here, you know, legal fights are expensive.  It is lawyers, it is court time, and it is a lot of other stuff, and it might be part of the thinking on Warner-Lambert that it`s better to go ahead and make this somewhat friendlier, at least sit down at the table, then they can with some kind of good conscience turn around to their shareholders and say:  See, we made a good faith effort and we don`t think or we do now think that the Pfizer deal is in our best interest.  But this would seem perhaps to be a little more reasoned approach. 

 KEENAN:  And of course, the big prize in all of this is Lipitor, it is the cholesterol-lowering drug.  Warner-Lambert and Pfizer have a joint marketing agreement for that drug, and that`s one of the reasons that Pfizer and American Home Products is so hot to get Warner-Lambert. 

 TUCKER:  And interesting: Lipitor about to go on sale in Japan, Terry. 

 KEENAN:  OK, just ahead on IN THE MONEY:  With interest rates rising, should you be looking at buying a home sooner rather than later?  We`re going to talk to the nation`s largest home lender to find out whether now is a good time to pick up a new mortgage. 

 TUCKER:  Plus, we`ll head down to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and to a 23-year veteran of the currency pits as he helps us make sense of all that action and chaos you`re looking at. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  OK, there you see the gains for the Dow Industrials. Despite a sell-off in Microsoft, the Dow holding above water and fairly-active trading. 

 TUCKER:  All right, welcome back to IN THE MONEY. 

 If you`re hot, there`s a reason. 

 KEENAN:  Let`s check in with Daryn in Atlanta for the latest on global warming. 

 Hello, Daryn. 

 KAGAN:  Hi, Terry and Bill.  We`re going to start with the air that you breathe. 

 Environmentalists rank California and Texas among states with the worst smog problem, last year.  The preliminary findings by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group are based on initial air quality data. Rounding out the top five states with the worst smog problems: North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio. 

 In other news, today, a blue-ribbon panel of researchers with the National Academy of Sciences has taken an uncommonly-strong stand against global warming.  In a new report released last night, the group says that global warming is well under way and has been for the past 20 years.  But it says while the Earth is getting hotter, the atmosphere is not.  The team offers no conclusions about that contradiction or why the Earth`s surface is warming. 

 One thing is for sure: the Earth is getting more crowded.  The Census Bureau predicts the nation`s population will double in 100 years.  The agency projects today`s estimated population of 273 million will increase to 571 million by the year 2100.  Overall, the population a century from now will be older, which could mean increased demand for nursing home care, prescription drugs and greater pressure on the country`s Social Security system. 

 So, Terry, if you thought New York City was crowded today, just wait until 100 years from now.  It`s going to be really impossible. 

 KEENAN:  Oh no, I`ll never be able to get -- catch a cab. Thanks, Daryn. 

 OK, well, if you`re thinking of buying a home, you`d better hurry up and lock in your mortgage rate soon.  A rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage climbed further, last week, to just below 8 1/4 percent, and that is the lowest level we`ve seen since September of 1996.  A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage jumped by eight basis points up to 7.85 percent. Now, one-year-adjustable is pretty high: 6.73 percent. 

 That creep-up in mortgage rates is already dampening home buyers` appetites, as Dan Ronan reports.  Areas like the fast-growing suburbs of Atlanta could soon feel the pinch. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  So that`s what the trade-off is that we`ve talked about, is... 

 DAN RONAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Graduate student and potential-new-home-buyer Kamila Valenta is looking at properties in the Atlanta area with her realtor, Deb C. McGuire.  For Valenta, there`s a sense of urgency. 

 KAMILA VALENTA, HOME-BUYER:  If we wait too long to buy a house, then we might end up with a higher interest rate, so we were thinking of buying a house probably -- now, this year, within the next three months. It also works nice, because our lease expires in April. 

 RONAN:  Here`s the dilemma Valenta and thousands of other potential home-buyers face.  Let`s say your loan amount is $180,000. About two years ago, when 30-year fixed rates were in the 6 1/2 percent range, your principal and interest payment would have been $1,139 a month.  At 7 1/2 percent, the payment would have been $1,260. Now, with rate`s nearly 8 1/2 percent, the payment would be $1,384, a 21-percent increase from two years ago. 

 (on camera):  One area of the lending industry already feeling the effect of higher rates is refinancing.  Last year at some mortgage bankers, it was as much as 50 percent of their activity.  This year, with rates creeping up, that could drop to 25 percent. 

 (voice-over):  Still, many mortgage bankers say the key to keeping their business healthy is increasing the number of first-time buyers. 

 PATRICK FLOOD, PRES., CEO, HOMEBANC MORTGAGE COMP.:  The purchase money business, though, is about like the economy right now, which is incredibly resilient, and as far as I`m concerned, in the housing industry, the party is continuing, maybe at a little bit lower noise, but it`s still very, very healthy. 

 GARSTEN:  Kamila Valenta says she and her husband will be in their new home by spring.  The question they must now decide is, how expensive a house and mortgage they can afford.      Dan Ronan, CNN Financial News, Atlanta. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 KEENAN:  Well, if you need a mortgage, chances are many of you will go to Fannie Mae.  It is the biggest source of money for mortgages in the nation.  The company today reporting record earnings of $3.9 billion for 1999.  That`s the 13th year in a row of record profits. 

 Joining us now, the man who heads up Fannie Mae, Chairman and CEO Franklin Raines.  Mr. Raines, you might remember, served as President Clinton`s budget director until the spring of last year. 

 And Mr. Raines, welcome. 

 FRANKLIN RAINES, CHMN. & CEO, FANNIE MAE:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Fannie Mae is not a name a lot of home-buyers would probably recognize right away, so can you explain how people generally interact with you and how Fannie Mae affects their lives, you as the biggest home lender here in the country? 

 RAINES:  Absolutely.  We don`t make mortgages ourselves, but we work with banks and mortgage banks and credit unions and thrifts who make mortgages, and what happens is, we create products and they sell them, and so they sell them to consumers.  And because we can raise money all over the world, we can reduce interest rates.  So, a Fannie Mae mortgage will cost you 25 to 50 basis points less than a mortgage that we don`t buy. 

 KEENAN:  Obviously, as you head up the company, you have to have an opinion on where interest rates are head.  Where do you think they`re headed right now? 

 RAINES:  Well, from our standpoint, we hedge against interest rates, so it really doesn`t matter to us as a company, but it matters vitally to consumers, because their rates can go up higher.  We think that the Fed is likely to increase the rates that they control, the federal funds rate, but we think a lot of that`s already in the long-term rate.  So, we don`t know that mortgage interest rates will rise much above where they are today, and, in fact, they could come down some later in the year. 

 TUCKER:  Yesterday, your agency went to the credit markets and pulled off the largest non-U.S. Treasury offering ever, two-year and 10-year notes, $10 billion dollars.  Were you happy with the way that auction went? 

 RAINES:  We were thrilled, because we began last year a new series of debt offerings called benchmark notes, where we`re trying now to raise money all over the world to bring home financing in the United States, and last year, we did about $40 billion of these benchmarks.  We`re now doing $10 billion in one day.  What that means is we`re able to get the kind of long-term funding you need for home mortgages, but we`re now getting it everywhere.  You don`t just get it from your local neighborhood now; we`re getting it from around the world.  So, we`re thrilled by the result of that. 

 KEENAN:  The reason the Federal Reserve raises interest rates is to cool down an economy that they might feel is too hot.  They`ve already raised rates three times, last year.  Have you seen any significant slowdown in the demand for housing, though? 

 RAINES:  Well, there`s been -- refinancing has almost stopped, but new home purchases are keeping up.  Even though we all remember how low rates were a few years ago, 8 1/4 looks pretty good when you compare it over the last 10 years.  So, lots of people who are buying existing homes or people who are trying to buy a brand new home are still out there, housing demand continues, and that`s good for Fannie Mae, because that`s how we grow; we grow by new mortgages coming in or by buying mortgages that were issued before that we can put into our portfolio. 

 KEENAN:  OK, great.  Thank you.  We appreciate you joining us today. 

 RAINES:  Thank you. 

 KEENAN:  Franklin Raines.  He heads up Fannie Mae. 

 TUCKER:  If you want to know more about the company, Terry, they have got a terrific Web site at Fannymae.com.  Go by and take a look at it. It`s very nice.  Looking at it earlier. 

 Just ahead:  He looks into the future for a living.  Our "It`s Their Job" series continues from the pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as we try to make sense of some of the madness there. 

 KEENAN:  Plus, Charles Schwab and U.S. Trust merge.  We`re going to look at what this almost-$3-billion deal may mean for you.  Andy Serwer will be here when we return. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  All right, we`re back and we`re talking on the set here. 

 KEENAN:  Yes, we are.  We`re talking about a big deal between Charles Schwab and US Trust. 

 And our Andy Serwer joins us now with some insight behind this deal. 

 And it`s almost a $3-billion deal. 

 ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, "FORTUNE":  Right, absolutely. 

 I was talking to Charles Schwab co-CEO David Pottruck about 20 minute ago right before he walked into a press conference that`s going on right now in New York City where they`re explaining how the deal`s going to work.  Interesting story behind the deal:  You know, Charles Schwab and -- himself and Pottruck were looking to do an acquisition, looking to take this company to the next level.  And they were considering various companies, and Charles Schwab walked over to Dave Pottruck and kind of handed him a crumpled up tear sheet -- we can see the press conference going on right now -- and handed him a crumpled up tear sheet and said: We should check this company out.  And Pottruck said:  Of course. 

 Turns out he`s a US Trust customer.  He didn`t even really consider it.  They spent a lot of time, these two companies, kind of getting to know each another.  Pottruck told me they got together over a year, basically, and met in various hotel rooms around the country, didn`t want to tip off the press or Wall Street that they were talking.  They thought there was a really good fit, and they decided to go ahead and do the deal, you guys. 

 TUCKER:  What kind of fallout can we expect?  Other mergers in the making because of this, people playing catchup -- what? 

 SERWER:  Bill, I think this is kind of a singular case.  I mean, Charles Schwab is a pretty unique company.  It`s the largest discount and on-line brokerage in the country.  It`s the -- I think it`s the fourth largest financial services firm now. 

 And, basically, what happened here -- let me explain what goes on with the Charles Schwab customers because I know a lot of people out there might be Schwab customers.  You sort of start out as an on-line customer and you, you know, start trading stocks, you have a small clump of assets, you get more and more assets and it gets more and more complicated.  All of a sudden, you know, you really do start to need a full-service broker. 

 So Schwab set up a network of financial consultants to help them. Still, that wasn`t enough because you start to use these guys, then you realize you might need a trust to set up for your kids.  So they were losing customers on the high end; people were going to more full- service firms. 

 US Trust is big in helping very wealthy people.  They look for people who have accounts of $5 million-plus.  So you`ve got to be a real kind of heavy hitter.  I`m looking at Bill; he`s kind of groaning there. But, you know, someday, we keep working hard, maybe we`ll get there. But it`s a good deal if you`re a Charles Schwab customer because you can sort of use the firm forever if you`re lucky enough to get that kind of wealth. 

 KEENAN:  OK, great.  Thanks, Andy. 

 SERWER:  OK, you guys. 

 TUCKER:  Appreciate it. 

 Well, it`s not your typical day at the office, waving and screaming, running and jumping, the folks in the colorful pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange trading more than 200 million dollar --200 million contracts last year, worth $138 trillion. 

 To make sense of what looks like mayhem, Christine Romans spent some time with a Merc floor trader who`s been at it for almost 23 years. It`s his job.      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  To the untrained eye, it looks like chaos.  To futures trader Ira Harris, it`s the way he makes his living.  Most often, you can find him in the currency futures pit buying and selling euros and yen, Canadian dollars and pesos.  Here, there`s a reason for everything, like the colors. 

 IRA HARRIS, FUTURES TRADER, CHICAGO MERCANTILE:  Every coat, as you look around, has significance.  A gold jacket is a runner; people know they can`t trade.  Anybody else in a colored jacket is a broker or a trader, and they can trade.  So there are designations that make life a lot easier. 

 ROMANS:  And the wild gestures. 

 HARRIS:  We have a language here.  We speak in hand signals and the signals go to the head because that tells you the size; if you`re away from the head, it tells you the price so you can differentiate, so you don`t confuse the two, because errors in this business are expensive. 

 ROMANS:  Harris is one of about 3,000 Chicago Mercantile Exchange traders.  His business day never really ends.  He shouts and gestures on the Merc floor from 7:20 in the morning till 2:00 in the afternoon and uses the Internet to prepare at home for the next trading day. 

 HARRIS:  It`s truly like going to war.  And if your battle plan is good, you can execute that battle plan.  But if all of a sudden you weren`t prepared for what was coming at you, you have to change, and you have to have an alternate plan. 

 ROMANS:  Here, there are futures and options on everything from pork bellies, to short-term interest rates, to Japan`s main stock index. Harris`s trading plan knows no boundaries. 

 (on camera):  So you go from trading peso futures to trading euro-dollar futures to... 

 HARRIS:  To trading gilds and bunds in Europe to trading Nikkei in Tokyo, yes, it`s all -- because it`s really all just money, and you want to follow the money around and see where the greatest advantages and what should generate the best return. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 ROMANS:  So where is Ira expecting to chase the money this year? He`s got his eye, he tells me, on emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico, and about two weeks ago he began buying the euro currency and selling the yen.  That`s a trade, Bill and Terry, that`s turned out to be profitable for him. 

 TUCKER:  Christine, thanks. 

 KEENAN:  Thanks.      OK, that`s going to do it for today`s edition of IN THE MONEY. I`m Terry Keenan. 

 TUCKER:  And goodbye from Daryn Kagan and myself as well.  I`m Bill Tucker.  We`ll see you tomorrow.

 PAUL KANGAS: Bond traders watch prices continue to slide and yields continue to rise as concerns continue to mount over what the Fed will do when it meets next month. Good evening. I`m Paul Kangas in Miami. 

 SUSIE GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. Also today, more worries over the future of Internet stocks. The NASDAQ falls another 71 points but the blue chips gained 40. Then MCI/WorldCom (WCOM) says it`s making the right call, rolling out a new plan to compete for long distance dollars. 

 GHARIB: Good evening everyone. Two way traffic on Wall Street today. The Dow edged up 40 points but the NASDAQ tumbled 71 after another day of selling in Internet stocks. Also weighing on stocks, higher interest rates in the bond market. The yield on the benchmark 30 Year Treasury reached the highest level in 2 1/2 years. Suzanne Pratt looks at what`s behind the bond market blues. 

 SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For bond investors, the year 2000 is off to a bumpy beginning. The price of the 30 Year Treasury bond has fallen sharply and today the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, hit its highest level since July of 1997. It closed at 6.71 percent. There are a number of factors contributing to bond market bearishness, but most experts first cite the Federal Reserve and interest rates. The bond market is already braced for the Fed to boost rates by a quarter of a percentage point at its February meeting. But some investors are now worrying about a series of increases this year to slow the economy and restrain inflation. 

 WILLIAM SULLIVAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: The market is beginning to recognize that there`s a potential for several quarter point adjustments over the next few months and that`s becoming more likely considering the evidence of an accelerating economy. 

 PRATT: A large supply of corporate debt coming to market is also weighing on Treasuries, as new issues are luring away investment dollars. In addition, some worry strong world growth will spark rate hikes overseas. Because of all this anxiety, many experts see yields on the 30 year bond headed higher in the coming months, some believe even as high as 7 percent. But others think yields are nearing a peak and say it could soon be a good time to buy treasuries. 

 MICHELLE GIRARD, TREASURY MARKET STRATEGIST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: The bottom line is inflation is low. I think it`s going to remain low in the year 2000 and given a 2 percent or a 2.5 percent inflation rate, bond yields at current levels are extremely attractive. And I think ultimately that`s going to limit how high bond yields rise. 

 PRATT: In the next few days there could be more trouble for bond investors. Tomorrow, the Producer Price Index and retail sales figures will be released. And tomorrow night, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is scheduled to speak in New York. Any time Greenspan talks, the bond market listens. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 KANGAS: Stocks on Wall Street opened on a mixed note today, with the NASDAQ high tech sector extending yesterday`s sharp sell off. But investors appeared to be using some of the proceeds from those sales to buy blue chips because at 10:00 a.m., the Dow Industrial Average posted a 45 point gain while the NASDAQ Index was down 70 points. Weakness in Yahoo! shares after yesterday`s earnings disappointed Wall Street was part of the reason why the NASDAQ Index was down 85 points at 10:30 this morning. But things started to improve when the blue chips continued to rally. At noon, then, the Industrial Average was up 82 points. The NASDAQ Index cut its loss to only 1 1/4 points. Stocks along a broad front lost their luster in afternoon trading when the bond market showed a protracted weakness. The Dow Industrial Average saw its closing gain trimmed to 40.02 points, putting in at 11,551.10. In today`s 108 point trading range, the Industrial Average closed down 61 1/2 points from the best level of the session, up about 46 points from the low of the day. The NASDAQ Composite dropped 71.17 points, ending at 3850.02. In its 117 trading point range, the Composite settled 101 points below its best level of the day. Big board volume, 973.8 million shares, down a bit from yesterday`s billion dollar level and down volume had almost a 5 to 4 ratio over up volume. 

 The Dow Transport Index down 13 1/3 points. 

 Utilities, however, rallied 3.86, the closing tick slightly bullish at +134. 

 Standard & Poor`s 500 down 6 1/3 points, just over a 2 1/2 point drop on the 100. 

 MidCap 400 fell just about 4 1/4. 

 And the Bridge Futures Price Index rose 1.21. 

 The New York Stock Exchange Composite off 3/4 of a point. 

 Value Line down 1 2/3. 

 Russell 2000 Small Cap off over 2 1/2. 

 And the Wilshire 5000 fell about 85 1/3 points. 

 As we mentioned, the bond market remained on the defensive today amid concern that tomorrow`s reports on December producer prices and retail sales will reveal an economy that is overheating, which will in turn trigger an aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal reserve over the near term. A relatively heavy supply of new debt offerings hurt the market and so did a rebound in New York oil futures. Tax free and corporate issues closed 1/8 and 1/4 lower and the treasury market fell across the board. 

 We see the 5-year notes dropping 6/32. 

 The 10-year note down 8/32. 

 The Bellwether 30 year bond down 14/32 with the yield up to 6.71 percent, a two and a half year high. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long Term Treasury Bond Index was down just over 2 1/2 points. 

 I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie? 

 GHARIB: As you said a moment ago, Paul, another difficult day for the stock of Yahoo! It lost almost 40 points or 10 percent, investors reacting with disappointment to the latest earnings that the company didn`t meet the highest expectations. And there`s also the question of what Yahoo! will do in view of that big merger announcement between AOL (AOL) and Time Warner (TWX). When I talked with Yahoo!`s chief executive this morning, I asked Tim Koogle what`s his strategy and would he consider a merger with Disney (DIS) or Newscorp? 

 TIM KOOGLE, CEO, YAHOO!: We have been from the beginning building a comprehensive global branded network. Comprehensive is the key word. It`s one of the reasons we`re open. We aggregate as broad an array of commerce and content and communications services as possible. It`s why we`ve attracted 120 million users to Yahoo! as of December of this year. We have almost 1,000 content partnerships worldwide under contract and some of the names that you talked about just a second ago are ones with which we have business partnerships already. We are going to be flexible, make use, optimize the value of our distribution platform on Yahoo!`s network and extend and extend and extend our relationships with them. 

 GHARIB: Mr. Koogle, in my conversations with Wall Street analysts a lot of them are scratching their heads and wondering did this strategy of going it alone, pretty much, is Yahoo! going to be missing out on some opportunities and then allowing other companies to have a competitive advantage? 

 KOOGLE: you know, the key things to understand are that it`s important to remain fast and flexible on the Internet. I think some of the discussion post the AOL/Time Warner announcement of a proposed merger centers, with good reason, on, you know, is it going to grow as fast? And, you know, we`re all about building a company for the long term, one that we`re going to build into as large a franchise as possible and speed is everything. 

 GHARIB: Well, you know, right now Yahoo! has a lot of access to content. But let`s say that with AOL has now locked up Time Warner content, what if it becomes very proprietary? Isn`t it possible that Yahoo! will lose access to all this content out there? 

 KOOGLE: Right, it`s a good question. You know, I think that I don`t really fundamentally believe that Time Warner`s content will become proprietary. You know, many of the brands CNN, etc., already have Web sites, Web presences. And, you know, it will be a decision that AOL/Time Warner will have to make as to whether they close access to all of those Web presences on behalf of all those brands to anyone except subscribers to the AOL service. It`s not likely because, you know, if you`re in the business on the Web of getting as large an audience as possible, you want to be syndicated as broadly as possible, as kind of a rough analogy. 

 GHARIB: Right. I`m wondering to what extent in your strategy here at this juncture is stock valuation a factor? I mean, we`ve seen what`s happened to AOL stock and its valuation from the point of view of the marketplace. Are you leery of perhaps doing a big mega deal because your stock will be judged on a different metric? 

 KOOGLE: Well, we`ve always focused on doing, on executing the right strategy, building the business and managing it carefully, communicating with the Street, and then the share price, of course, takes care of itself. I think in this particular regard, we are very, very, very adamant on when we acquire, when we invest in other companies, that, in fact, it speeds us up and grows us at the same rate that we are capable of in Web only strategy. 

 GHARIB: We just have a few seconds left. I want to ask you real quickly, your projection for growth, for revenue growth for 2000 is slower, is what you told the Wall Street community. A number of analysts said to me they theorize that maybe you`re low balling your numbers so that you come out with higher numbers and beat the estimates and make everybody happy, especially considering what happened with your numbers yesterday. 

 KOOGLE: Well, we always issue words of caution to the Street. We always, always do. It is our absolute model, where we do. You know, investors out there sometimes get a little carried away and we always bring them back, you know, into reality and it`s part of our normal operating procedure. You know, we hope that we`ll always continue to overachieve expectations. At the same time, I think it`s important for every investor out there to understand that, you know, as you build scale it becomes increasingly hard to turn in the same kind of, you know, 30 percent, 50 percent, quarter to quarter on a much larger scale. And we`re large scale now. 

 GHARIB: Thank you very much for talking to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. We appreciate it, Mr. Koogle. 

 KOOGLE: My pleasure. 

 KANGAS: A big deal for big blue today. IBM (IBM) inked a multi year, $2 billion deal to supply components to electronics distributor Bell Microproducts (BELM). The agreement is the latest in a string of mega supply deals the computer maker has signed in the past year. Big blue`s stock rose a point to 119 7/8. 

 GHARIB: Paul, the stock of MCI WorldCom rose almost two points today after its CEO outlined plans to compete in New York State`s long distance market. But as Stephanie Woods reports, the company also still needs to convince regulators to OK its plans to merge with Sprint (FON). 

 STEPHANIE WOODS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: MCI WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers is on the offensive these days. He has to make the case to regulators why the company`s proposed $129 billion merger with Sprint benefits consumers. Ebbers says he hasn`t underestimated the task. 

 BERNARD EBBERS, CEO, MCI/WORLDCOM: We didn`t go into this thing blind and think that, and do very thorough analysis. Just imagine from Sprint`s point of view, if they had not felt very, very strongly that this transaction would be concluded, they wouldn`t be left hanging out there in the wind during this time period. 

 WOODS: Today the company took aggressive steps to battle new competition Bell Atlantic (BEL) in New York State. Next month, MCI WorldCom will offer all distance pricing in New York, one monthly fee for both local and domestic long distance calls. And it will soon offer a new product for infrequent callers in New York. MCI WorldCom`s stock has been under pressure since the Sprint deal was announced, falling from the 70`s to the 40`s. 

 KIM WALLACE, POLICY ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS: There are a number of factors that go into that. Investor uncertainty about closing the deal, and then if you close it, executing on the business plan certainly is one of the overhangs on the stock. But I think it`s hard to separate out the various factors that are pushing it down. 

 WOODS: One of those factors is concern that a combined AOL/Time Warner could move its Internet traffic off the MCI/WorldCom network. But some analysts think the negatives are overdone. 

 ANTHONY FERRUGIA, ANALYST, A.G. EDWARDS: WorldCom has always been a company that is very aggressively priced. The expectations are very, very high and any time you have even just a little bit of doubt, for whatever reason, creeping into the minds of investors, you`re going to see volatility in the stock. 

 WOODS: Betting against Bernie Ebbers so far hasn`t been a profitable move. As the CEO boasted today, WorldCom`s stock has increased an average of 54 percent a year since 1989 and he isn`t dampening expectations now. Stephanie Woods, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 KANGAS: Well, the blue chips fared a little bit better than the market in general today, as indicated by the closing gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of just over 40 points.

 KANGAS: Next week, Wall Street will be watching as the nation`s large banks report earnings. One bank that will be watched very closely is Bank of America (BAC), which is facing many challenges. Joining us now with more on that is Mark Calvey, senior banking reporter for BridgeNews. Welcome, Mark. 

 MARK CALVEY, SENIOR BANKING REPORTER, BRIDGENEWS: Hi, Paul. 

 KANGAS: What are the major challenges that we`re talking about here facing Bank America? 

 CALVEY: Well, my sources at the bank tell me that the company`s experiencing an exodus of talent, aggressive cost-cutting, and falling morale, especially in California. 

 KANGAS: In San Francisco, where the city itself is the bank`s largest customer, and they have a problem with the bank? 

 CALVEY: Well, the city treasurer is actually making some inquiries to see how layoffs and cutbacks are going to affect banking services delivered to the city and other Californians. 

 KANGAS: So, in other words, there`s kind of a problem with the culture from the bank`s home in Charlotte, North Carolina and San Francisco, is that the case? 

 CALVEY: Yes, and actually having lived in both cities, I can see, from what my sources are telling me, there`s a cultural chasm between the Charlotte headquarters and its California operations. 

 KANGAS: What is the bank doing about this, to solve these problems. 

 CALVEY: Well, so far, they have tried to launch what some are calling a misguided morale-boosting effort of adopting an ATM program, where employees would volunteer on their own time and at their own dime to clean ATM machines. Here again, Charlotte sees it as a morale-boosting effort and in California state officials say the program may actually be illegal. 

 KANGAS: Mark, how do you think this situation will resolve itself and what will be the time period that it`ll take? 

 CALVEY: Well, as analysts will tell you, Bank of America is known as a mighty merger machine. That`s what created it, turned it into the largest bank in the nation. And I think over the next year or two we`ll probably see some more pain, as the California integration continues. But many analysts are confident that the bank will resolve these issues eventually. 

 KANGAS: We`ll keep an eye on it. Thanks for telling us about it, Mark. My guest, Mark Calvey, senior banking reporter for BridgeNews. 

 GHARIB: Tomorrow, Jim Clark is the Silicon Valley`s ultimate "serial entrepreneur." We talk with him about his latest venture. 

 GHARIB: One day on the job and already Toys "R" Us` new CEO John Eyler is facing a lawsuit. An angry online shopper is suing the retailer`s Internet division, claiming that Toys "R" Us.com knowingly accepted Christmas orders for toys that were not in stock. The company has already admitted to online problems during the holidays. The suit was filed today in Washington state, it is seeking class action status. As for the stock, it was unchanged today at 11 9/16. 

 KANGAS: The shares of Carnival Cruise Lines sailed into trouble, after a fire on one of its ships. A generator fire left the "Celebration" without power near Jamaica. There were no injuries, but the cruise was canceled. Passengers will receive refunds and other compensation. As a result, Carnival (CCL) says its earnings will be cut by 1 or 2 cents a share in the first quarter. The stock today down 2 5/16 to close at 48 3/16. 

 GHARIB: The countdown to April 15 has begun, and the 1999 Federal Income Tax forms will start showing up in mailboxes this week. In the "Money File" tonight, some suggestions on how to make tax time less stressful. Here`s Kevin McCormally, executive editor of "Kiplinger`s Personal Finance" magazine. 

 KEVIN MCCORMALLY, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, KIPLINGER`S MAGAZINE: Let me start the new century with the oldest form of communication known to man: the nag. A suggestion that you know is right on target but you still hate to hear. And this one is simple: now is the time to get started with your tax return. Don`t wait till April. A little bit of effort now can make the process much less painful and less costly, too, if it protects you from rushing into a mistake. The first step is to set up a folder to capture all the tax-related mail that`s coming your way. The w-2 from work and the 1099`s from banks, mutual funds and Brokerages. Year-end statements from funds and brokers contain essential tax information, too. So keep them in your tax file. Also, tossing in that stub from your last paycheck of 1999. It will show payroll deductions that went to charitable organizations, such as the United Way. If you sold stock or mutual funds during 1999, don`t wait until you sit down with your return to figure the basis of the shares you sold. That can be an enormous job if you made multiple trades. So break it up into manageable chunks starting now. Don`t think you`re sitting pretty if you higher an accountant to do your return. You`ve still got to provide all the pertinent information. In fact, you may have already received a fat questionnaire from your accountant. Don`t ignore it. Remember, the more thoroughly you fill it out, the better job your tax pro will be able to do for you. Of course the real incentive for starting early comes if you`re among the 70 percent of taxpayers who will get refunds this spring. The average check will break the $1,600 level for the first time. And the sooner you file, the sooner you`ll get your money back. End of nag. I`m Kevin McCormally. 

 KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, a mixed day on Wall Street. The Dow gained 40 points, but the NASDAQ Index lost 71. And please join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword "NBR." 

 GHARIB: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, January 12. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone, and good night to you, Paul. 

 KANGAS: Good night, Susie. I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.

 BANK ONE TO BREAK SILENCE, ANNOUNCE 4TH-QUARTER CHARGE

 Bank One Corp. is expected to announce Tuesday at a meeting with investors and analysts in New York that it is taking a fourth- quarter charge to earnings as part of its plan to get the company and its stock price back on firm ground. It is unclear how large the charge will be. 

 The meeting, which was scheduled after the bank missed a November presentation to analysts, is supposed to give Wall Street a clearer idea about what is happening inside Bank One. Executives there have been almost mute about the company's condition since announcing in August that troubles at its credit card operation, First USA, would lead to lower-than-expected earnings. 

 Since then, the company has been in turmoil, and its stock price is trading at almost half its preannouncement price in August; shares closed Monday at $30.25, down $1.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Although Bank One is the country's fourth-largest bank and would be a large meal for any company to digest, its weak condition has made it a viable takeover target. 

 Investors know that pricing and service problems at First USA led the once-golden credit-card giant to stumble seriously. But beyond that, information about what is happening inside Bank One has been limited to a few key announcements: 

 In October, the head of First USA, Richard Vague, resigned, and Vice Chairman Richard Lehmann said he would retire at year's end. He had overseen Delaware-based First USA's operations from Chicago. 

 In November, when Bank One canceled the meeting with analysts, the company also made a second profit warning, saying its operating earnings would be $3.45 to $3.55 a share for 1999, down from the $3.60 to $3.65 it had promised during its first warning in August, and considerably below the $3.92 that bank analysts had expected before the credit-card problems were announced. 

 In December, Bank One CEO John McCoy resigned under pressure from investors and the board. 

 Tuesday's meeting will be led by acting CEO Verne Istock, who had been the head of First Chicago NBD Corp. before it merged with McCoy's Banc One Corp. in 1998 to form Bank One. 

 Presentations will be given by William Boardman, the new head of First USA, and other executives who lead Bank One's lines of business. No surprises are expected from operating units outside First USA.

Gateway turns to Athlon chips sales.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said Monday that Gateway Inc. is buying Advanced Micro's top-of-the-line Athlon microprocessors for its personal computers after a shortage of Intel Corp. chips cut into Gateway's sales. 

Gateway PCs using Athlon chips are available now. 

The Athlon is a new chip that Advanced Micro is counting on to stem losses and stay in business after a decades-long battle with Intel, the world's biggest PC-microprocessor maker. 

The announcement comes less than a week after San Diego-based Gateway, the No. 2 direct seller of PCs, warned that it won't meet fourth-quarter earnings forecasts because it couldn't get enough chips from Intel. 

Gateway is one of Athlon's biggest customers, along with Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. 

Advanced Micro shares rose $2.88, to $35.38, the highest since September 1997. Gateway climbed $2.50, to $64.13. 

Many analysts and investors expected the move because Gateway said in its profit warning Wednesday that it would take steps to ensure that its supply problems don't recur. 

The supply of Intel chips "was severely constrained, spotty and unreliable," particularly for PCs costing $999 to $1,299, Gateway said last week. The shortages resulted in $200 million to $250 million in lost revenue, the company said. 

Advanced Micro last week announced that it was shipping Athlon chips running at 800 megahertz, matching Intel's fastest Pentium. The two companies had been leapfrogging each other in the race for the fastest chip.

 PAUL KANGAS: No cheers for Yahoo!: earnings beat the Street and revenues more than doubled, but the stock plunges. We`ll tell you why. Good evening. I`m Paul Kangas in Miami. 

 SUSIE GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. Back to reality on Wall Street a day after that huge AOL/Time Warner merger: the NASDAQ drops 127 points, the Dow loses 61. Then, this car gets 80 miles to the gallon and can go 500 miles between fill-ups. From the Detroit auto show, we`ll kick the tires. 

 GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. A nervous day on Wall Street: the Dow loses 61 points and the NASDAQ tumbles almost 128 points. Investors waited anxiously all day for Yahoo! to report its earnings, and they were disappointed despite earnings that beat analyst estimates and a two-for-one stock split. The stock got hammered in after hours trading, down almost 20 points. Scott Gurvey explains. 

 SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Yahoo! shares took a beating along with the rest of the Internet sector during the regular session. The sell-off continued in the evening not because its fourth-quarter report was bad, but apparently because it was not good enough. The company earned 19 cents a share. That beat Wall Street`s consensus estimate of 15 cents a share, something Yahoo! has a history of doing. Yahoo! Is an Internet portal. That means it want to be the site Web users visit first and use as a stepping-off point to other locations. It has been expanding into overseas markets, adding content specific to each locale. In light of the AOL/Time Warner deal, Yahoo! is seen by many as an Internet company now shopping for a media company partner. But with Yahoo! shares trading around $400 a piece, many analysts believe it is a high-priced currency and Yahoo! may find it easier to plan a joint venture with a media company than to buy one outright. Yahoo! today also announced a two-for-one stock split, and Merrill Lynch reiterated a "buy" rating on the shares. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 KANGAS: Wall Street`s bullish euphoria over the last few days was toned down by some moderate profit-taking on today`s opening, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55 points at the outset while the NASDAQ Index dropped 30 points following yesterday`s 167 point record one-day gain. The Dow then made a nice recovery, thanks in large measure to over a 5 point jump in Intel stock after it was upgraded by First Boston Brokerage, and a 2 point rise in Coca-Cola, also in reaction to a First Boston upgrade. This helped the Blue Chip Index post a 62 point gain by 11:00 a.m., while the NASDAQ Index cut its loss to only 4 1/2 points. The budding upturn began to weaken during the mid-session hours on concerns about a rather steep sell-off in the bond market, which sent long yields to the highest level in over two years. The selling picked up along a broad front in mid-afternoon after the NASDAQ technology sector became the target of very aggressive selling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to a closing loss of 61.12 at 11511.08. And in today`s 160 point trading range, the Dow closed down 152 points from the best level of the session. The NASDAQ Composite down 128.48 points to 3921.19. In its 162 point trading range, the Composite settled 145 1/2 points below its best level of the day. 

 Big board volume just over a billion shares, but down a bit from yesterday. And more than twice as much down volume as up volume. 

 The Dow Transports Index fell nearly 31 points. 

 Utilities down exactly 2 points. 

 The Closing Tick moderately bearish at -381. 

 Standard & Poor`s 500 fell just over 19 points. 

 A 5 2/3 point drop in the S&P 100. 

 MidCap 400 off nearly 11 1/4. 

 And the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index moved up .74. 

 New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell just over 6 points. 

 A loss of 4.63 in the Value Line. 

 Russell2000 Small Cap off just over 9 1/4 points. 

 And the very broadly based Wilshire 5000 down about 210 3/4 points. 

 The bond market fell victim to some aggressive selling today, part of which was linked to Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Alfred Broaddus, who said in a speech last night that inflation risks in the economy may be on the rise. Weaker European bond prices and a heavy schedule of new debt offerings also put downside pressure on the market, as did over a one-dollar-per-barrel jump in New York oil futures. Tax-free and corporates ended down 5/8 to 3/4 of a point on average. And the Treasury market was even harder hit. 

 The 5-year notes down 12/32. 

 The 10-year notes down 24/32. 

 And the Bellwether 30-year bond off 1 132, bringing the yield all the way up to 6.72, a 2 1/2 year high. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index down just over 13 points. 

 I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie. 

 GHARIB: Paul, the stock of Toys "R" Us (TOY) tumbled almost a point today to 11 9/16, even though the company hired a new president and CEO. John Eyler used to run FAO Schwarz. His new job though, won`t be fun and games. Toys "R" Us had a disappointing holiday, with sales down 2 percent from last year. Also, its market share and stock price have been falling. 

 KANGAS: Meanwhile, investors in General Motors (GM) watched its stock price fall today, even as the company rolled out one of the most fuel efficient cars in the world. GM and other U.S. auto makers are racing to get these types of cars to market. Diane Eastabrook reports from the Detroit Auto Show. 

 DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: For General Motors, the future is the Precept. The lightweight concept car is powered by a diesel engine and an electric motor. That innovative propulsion system and other features help the Precept get 80 miles to the gallon. 

 HARRY PEARCE, VICE CHAIRMAN, GENERAL MOTORS: There are some 130 inventions or innovations embedded in this remarkable vehicle. 

 EASTABROOK: U.S. auto makers have been working aggressively to develop highly fuel efficient vehicles that will be available to consumers around 2004. Ford (F) also rolled out a fuel efficient vehicle this week called the Prodigy. It uses a technology similar to the Precept. But both vehicles still need to be fine tuned to meet new clean air standards and that could take additional time getting them into mass production. 

 JACQUES NASSER, PRESIDENT & CEO, FORD MOTOR COMPANY: Most of the technology that we have in Prodigy, and it was developed over years of research, is really applicable to almost any form of propulsion that we have. And most of the gasoline engines that are out today don`t meet future government requirements either. 

 EASTABROOK: But if there is a race to a get a highly fuel efficient vehicle to American consumers quickly, the Japanese are already the winners. Both Honda (HMC) and Toyota (TM) have developed hybrid cars that are either on sale now or soon will be. Honda`s Insight went on sale last month and is the first gas and electric vehicle to be sold in the U.S. It gets between 60 and 70 miles to the gallon. Toyota`s Prius uses a similar technology and will be in U.S. showrooms by summer. 

 MARK AMSTOCK, MARKETING MANAGER, TOYOTA MOTOR SALES/USA: Beginning in July of this coming year we`ll hope to sell about 1,000 a month as a 2001 model. 

 EASTABROOK: But 1,000 a month isn`t a huge volume. Analysts say it may take years before many American consumers will want to leave their gas guzzlers and buy these types of vehicles. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Detroit. 

 GHARIB: The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is stepping up his warnings to investors tonight. In an exclusive interview with Washington Bureau Chief Darren Gersh, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt cautioned investors not to let their emotions get the best of them in a volatile stock market. 

 DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mr. Chairman, you`ve been talking about the euphoria investors have out. There are investors getting sloppy? The market`s been so good. Are they starting to chase performance and have unrealistic expectations? 

 ARTHUR LEVITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMMISSION: I guess my concern is that I sense that America`s investors are becoming more emotional than Intellectual about their investments and that concerns me. If you examine the buildup of borrowing, if you look at volatility in the market, these are signs that investors are beginning to move away from the kind of standards of judgment that I think are important to be applied at a market such as this. And that does concern me. We have investors who are the best informed of any in the history of our markets and yet they`re not taking advantage of that information in ways that I think would be more helpful to them. I think this is a time to ask more questions, to be less emotional and more analytical. I don`t believe the standards of analysis really have changed. I don`t accept the notion that we`re in the midst of a new era and the standards of prudence and analysis that that held forth in the past should be discarded today. 

 GERSH: It`s supposed to be a very exciting year in the financial markets and perhaps the most visible change investors will see is decimalization, which is a long way of saying instead of stocks being quoted in quarters, eighths or sixteenths, people will buy them in dimes, pennies and nickels. You`ve called that a watershed. Why is that so important? It sounds simple. 

 LEVITT: Well, I think in the first place it`s an investor friendly device. Investors really have difficulty in understanding 16ths, for instance, and there`s no reason why things have to be as complex as that. And secondly by quoting in decimals the chances are that spreads will narrow and investors will be able to buy securities at better, more favorable prices. 

 GERSH: The second big issue is demutualization, which is another long way of saying that the stock markets will go from being owned by their members to being owned by shareholders and will be for profit. What would that mean for investors? Should investors be watching that? 

 LEVITT: I think investors should be watching that and the reason that this issue has come about is because there has developed a whole new universe of competitors for existing marketplaces. What is the response of membership organizations such as the NASD and the New York Stock Exchange? In order to compete against these new agile electronic technologically sophisticated entities they`ve got to develop a business plan that is more functional in terms of speed, in terms of efficiency. 

 GERSH: You`ve said the New York Stock Exchange is a national asset, almost talked about it in terms of being a treasure. Does that mean it`s so important that the Securities and Exchange Commission should move to preserve the New York Stock Exchange in some way? 

 LEVITT: I don`t think so. I don`t think it`s the responsibility of any government agency to determine which competitor survives and which fails. It is our responsibility, as I see it, to encourage competition that is fierce but fair in the benefit of investors, which is our overall goal. 

 GERSH: Mr. Chairman, thank you. 

 LEVITT: Thank you very much.

 That`s our Wall Street Wrap Up. Susie? 

 GHARIB: Paul, we begin tonight an occasional series looking at the realities of retirement. And our reporter should know. He`s retired. Well, mostly retired. Over the next few months, Stephen Aug will look at the issues he faces in this new phase of his life, issues you`ll face when you retire. Here`s the first part of a series that we call making it last. 

 STEPHEN AUG, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Until I retired about four years ago, I worked at ABC News. I covered business and economic news and I earned a salary well in the six figures. Now, I`m living on about 30 percent of what I used to make. But last summer when we returned from a trip to Europe, I was faced immediately with my annual property tax bill. Two weeks later my credit card bill from our overseas trip. A couple weeks after that our quarterly estimated income tax return, all a big drain on savings. I was flabbergasted to find out I`d been spending so much money, but among retirees, I found out I was not alone. Patricia Houlihan, a certified financial planner says people tend to over spend early in their retirement because they`ve got time to spend. 

 PATRICIA HOULIHAN, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER: They shop because they get bored, maybe. They play golf because they`ve always loved playing golf but they never had time. So it used to be they played once a week. Now they can play every day. 

 AUG: A study by the College for Financial Planning says an overwhelming percentage of people expect their standard of living to remain the same after they retire. Houlihan says people simply have mismanaged their expectation. 

 HOULIHAN: They`ve said I, if I needed $5,000 a month when I was working, I only need $3,500 or $4,000 in retirement and they`re used to spending $5,000. And we may just change how we spend it, not on work clothes, on play clothes. Not on being at the office all day, but we`re out traveling. 

 AUG: In fact, two of her clients, Cathy and Jim Fort, say that unlike what most people think, spending may not go down early in retirement. It certainly didn`t in their case. 

 JIM FORT, RETIREE: We still buy new clothes. We still buy cars. We have no expense account to cover us when we go out to nice meals. 

 AUG: On Houlihan`s advice, they prepared their first budget and it forced them to take a look at their spending patterns. 

 CATHY FORT, RETIREE: We began to watch the times that we ate out and the clothes we were buying and the miscellaneous on the spot spontaneous purchases that are so much fun to do but that weren`t really essential. 

 AUG: So they decided that for every major item they bought for their house, some other item would have to go. The Forts live on 158 acres in a valley in central Virginia. Jim spends time as a wood sculptor. His work had been widely exhibited. He`s also a volunteer at several organizations and despite the budget, he has new expenses in retirement that he did not have while he was working. 

 FORT: Our expenses have gone up primarily because of the large mortgage on this country property which we have acquired and the long term health care and the insurance policy. 

 AUG: The insurance policy pays off after both Forts die and provides enough money so their children will not have to sell the house to pay inheritance taxes. So the Forts, like many other retirees, found that being retired initially does not mean spending a lot less. But at least one study says we do spend less as we age, with spending down 20 percent by the time we`re 75. And the Forts recently had a pleasant surprise. As a United Parcel Service (UPS) retiree, Jim still has some UPS stock which, under the old rules, he had to sell back to the company over time. Now that the stock is publicly traded and its value has soared, he can worry a little less about how much he spends. Stephen Aug, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 KANGAS: Tomorrow, it`s that time of year again. Some tips on getting ready to file your Federal income taxes. 

 GHARIB: Speaking of taxes, Republican presidential candidate John McCain detailed his tax plan today -- $237 billion in cuts over five years. McCain wants to move 85 percent of Americans into the lowest tax bracket, 15 percent. He also wants to use the budget surplus to protect social security. His rival, George W. Bush, wants the surplus to fund a bigger tax cut. But the highlight of McCain`s plan is a tax free family savings account. 

 SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My plan will encourage and reward savings and investment. That`s why as president I will establish a new family security account into which families can place up to $6,000 tax deferred per year as long as the money is saved for at least one year. 

 GHARIB: McCain intends to pay for the tax cuts by closing corporate tax loopholes, $150 billion worth. 

 GHARIB: Recapping today`s market action, a down day for stocks. The Dow falls 61 points and the NASDAQ loses 128. And please join us at our Worldwide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword: NBR. 

 KANGAS: And finally tonight, some thoughts on the America Online/Time Warner takeover. A company that had barely existed a few years ago now owns two of the greatest names and companies in journalism and entertainment. And as Dennis Moore says, the founders might approve. 

 DENNIS MOORE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This was the studio that gave us Casablanca and Daffy Duck. This was the publisher who gave us the first news magazine and the first big picture magazine. And it isn`t hard to imagine Henry Luce and Harry, Abe, Jack and Sam Warner aghast as their once mighty empires are taken over by the former Pizza Hut manager from Hawaii, until you look at a little history in the Freedom Forum`s Newseum. In 1923, Luce was an upstart, too. 

 PETER PRICHARD, PRESIDENT, FREEDOM FORUM: It`s similar in the sense that it`s innovation. I mean, Luce realized that people were busy and they could use a digest of the week`s news. 

 MOORE: No publication has adapted itself to the time which busy men are able to spend on simply being informed, he said. Sound like publishers going online to you? And the Warners in 1923 also just another bunch of upstarts in Hollywood creating a new mass medium with new technology. Sound like AOL? 

 PRICHARD: It`s a bet on the future. I think that they see that the Internet is really going to change people`s lives. 

 MOORE: It`s easy to imagine Luce and the Warner Brothers rolling in their graves at the changes. But if they were operating in this kind of media environment, it`s just as easy to imagine them voting their shares for just this kind of deal. Dennis Moore, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 GHARIB: I bet if Henry Luce were alive, he`d probably be having a dot. com. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Tuesday, January 11th. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone. Good night to you, Paul. 

 KANGAS: Good night, Susie. I`m Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.

 Bank One Expected to Take Earnings Hit in Fourth Quarter

 Bank One Corp. is expected to announce Tuesday at a meeting with investors and analysts in New York that it is taking a fourth-quarter charge to earnings as part of its plan to get the company and its stock price back on firm ground. It is unclear how large the charge will be. 

 The meeting, which was scheduled after the bank missed a November presentation to analysts, is supposed to give Wall Street a clearer idea about what is happening inside Bank One. Executives there have been almost mute about the company's condition since announcing in August that troubles at its credit card operation, First USA, would lead to lower-than-expected earnings. 

 Since then, the company has been in turmoil, and its stock price is trading at almost half its preannouncement price in August; shares closed Monday at $30.25, down $1.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Although Bank One is the country's fourth-largest bank and would be a large meal for any company to digest, its weak condition has made it a viable takeover target. 

 Investors know that pricing and service problems at First USA led the once-golden credit-card giant to stumble seriously. But beyond that, information about what is happening inside Bank One has been limited to a few key announcements: 

 In October, the head of First USA, Richard Vague, resigned, and Vice Chairman Richard Lehmann said he would retire at year's end. He had overseen Delaware-based First USA's operations from Chicago. 

 In November, when Bank One canceled the meeting with analysts, the company also made a second profit warning, saying its operating earnings would be $3.45 to $3.55 a share for 1999, down from the $3.60 to $3.65 it had promised during its first warning in August, and considerably below the $3.92 that bank analysts had expected before the credit-card problems were announced. 

 In December, Bank One CEO John McCoy resigned under pressure from investors and the board. 

 Tuesday's meeting will be led by acting CEO Verne Istock, who had been the head of First Chicago NBD Corp. before it merged with McCoy's Banc One Corp. in 1998 to form Bank One. 

 Presentations will be given by William Boardman, the new head of First USA, and other executives who lead Bank One's lines of business. No surprises are expected from operating units outside First USA.

Turnaround expert is new Fruit chairman Fruit of the Loom Ltd. named turnaround specialist Brian Wolfson chairman of the largest U.S. maker of underwear and T-shirts as it attempts to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy brought on by mounting losses. Wolfson, formerly chairman of the board's executive committee, replaces William Farley as chairman. The company didn't release any other details and couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Ford plans line of electric vehicles Ford Motor Co., the company that put the world on wheels powered by gasoline, will soon sell a plastic-bodied hatchback, a golf cart and bicycles - all powered by electricity. The line of electric vehicles, under the brand name Th!nk, will become the company's home for vehicles powered by something other than internal combustion engines. It will not only build vehicles, but also act as a research center for Ford. 

"The idea of Th!nk is to work on vehicles and technology that's a little more out there," Ford President and CEO Jac Nasser said today. Th!nk, the name of a Norwegian electric car that Ford bought a year ago, will sell its models over the Internet as well as through Ford dealers. Ford showed off the Th!nk line today during previews for the North American International Auto Show. The show opens to the public on Saturday. Aon stock declines on profit warning Aon Corp., the world's No. 2 insurance broker, said fourth-quarter profit fell as much as 91 percent short of estimates because of a settlement of disputed workers' compensation claims, higher costs and slower sales. Earnings probably declined 5 to 10 cents a share from 53 cents a year ago. Analysts expected the Chicago-based company's Feb. 8 report to show it earned 58 cents during the three months ended Dec. 31, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Aon fell more than 25 percent. The drop came after Aon announced that it had agreed to participate in an industrywide settlement over workers' compensation coverage set up by Unicover Managers Inc., as well as threats to future profits. "The concern is that, despite the fact that this appears to solve a problem, it also opens a myriad of others," said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at Standard &Poor's Corp. "Aon left the door open for further disappointments this year." SBC seeks OK to offer long distance SBC Communications asked federal regulators today for approval to become the second Baby Bell to offer long-distance service to its local customers. Hot on the heels of a decision by the Federal Communications Commission to let Bell Atlantic provide long-distance in New York, SBC filed an application with the FCC seeking to do the same in Texas. SBC officials said the company had more than met the prerequisite for being allowed to offer long-distance to local customers. Under a 1996 telecommunications law, a Bell company must first open its local phone business to competition before it can offer long-distance in its calling region. The company, parent of Chicago-based Ameritech Corp., must win approval from the FCC. The commission has 90 days to decide on the application. IBM: All network machines Linux-ready IBM today announced that all of its powerful network computers will be able to run on the Linux operating system, embracing the fast-growing rival to other Unix formats and Microsoft's Windows as the best platform for Internet commerce. The leading manufacturer of computer servers said all four of its product lines will now be compatible with Linux, a Unix-based operating system that's grown hugely popular among independent software developers since its Finnish creator started giving it away for free. Coming from IBM, the announcement essentially finalizes the mainstreaming of Linux - elevating it from the ranks of grass-roots upstart to the same playing field as the Solaris system that Sun Microsystems sells with its Unix servers, the Windows NT system, and AIX, which is IBM's version of the Unix platform. Corn rallies on hope of end to slump Corn futures reached a two-month high today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid bullish sentiments that the long price slump may be over. Wheat for March delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.53 1/2 a bushel; March corn rose 1 1/ 2 cents to $2.08 1/2 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at $1.09 1/ 2 a bushel; March soybeans fell 5 1/4 cents to $4.73 1/2 a bushel.

 Despite Friday's rise, analysts think DJIA selloff may return

 NEW YORK (AP) -- Despite a rocky start, the Dow Jones industrials finished last week in record territory after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. 

 The Nasdaq Composite, which also tumbled earlier last week, recorded its biggest point gain in history Friday. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 269.30 Friday to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three- day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at 54. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 20.4375 to 97.4375, Cisco Systems rose 5.875 to 105.875, Ciena rose 11.875 to 57.75 and JDS Uniphase rose 30.1875 to 179.9375. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the nation's labor market remains strong. 

 Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting company profits.

 BUSINESS & MONEY 
 SOME FEAR LUCENT'S WOES MAY LINGER ONE ANALYST SAID THE AT&T SPINOFF HAS BEEN "STRETCHING" TO ACHIEVE ITS AGGRESSIVE SALES.

 NEW YORK - Lucent Technologies' bleak first-quarter profit warning rattled the confidence of even its most loyal Wall Street fans, who questioned whether the telecommunications-equipment maker's more optimistic forecast for the second half of the year will ring true. 

 Lucent, known for its once-stellar track record of surpassing Wall Street's profit expectations every quarter since it was spun off from AT&T Corp. in 1996, said late Thursday that its profit for the first quarter ended Dec.31 will fall below analysts' estimates. Revenue, it said, will be flat. 

 The company, whose Cirent unit employs 2,600 in Central Florida, now expects to report first-quarter earnings in the range of 36 cents to 39 cents a share, down from 48 cents a share a year ago and below Wall Street expectations of 54 cents a share. 

 Lucent said first-quarter revenue was $9.8 billion to $9.9 billion - flat compared with the year-ago quarter and about $1 billion below most analysts' expectations. 

 Lucent, one of the most widely held stocks, said it failed to gauge its customers' changing buying patterns properly and that it lacked the manufacturing capacity to keep up with the red-hot demand for optical networking equipment. 

 Wall Street's reaction in after-hours trading Thursday was swift and merciless. 

 Shares of Lucent fell nearly 28 percent, or $20.38, to $52 as several influential brokerages quickly downgraded the stock, including Merrill Lynch, Lehman Bros., Salomon Smith Barney, Warburg Dillon Read and SG Cowen. 

 Lucent's trading volume was more than 136 million shares Friday, a single-session  New York Stock Exchange record for any one stock. 

 A class-action lawsuit was filed against Lucent on Friday, claiming the equipment maker previously made false statements about its financial condition. 

 Lehman analyst Steve Levy said he expects Lucent shares to trade at lower levels "until credibility and confidence are restored." Salomon Smith set a 12-month price target of $50 a share on Lucent, and Warburg Dillon set a $57 a share price target. 

 Lucent has been "stretching" to achieve its aggressive revenue targets for the past five quarters, which has "left the company vulnerable to small pockets of turbulence that it would otherwise have been able to safely navigate," Levy said. 

 Lucent has been pitted against chief rivals Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. in a fierce battle to supply telephone companies, Internet service providers and large corporations with sophisticated equipment that can transmit increasingly large volumes of data and voice traffic. 

 Some analysts criticized Lucent for growing too quickly and losing touch with some of its customers. Lucent, which has expanded aggressively through acquisitions, missed crucial clues about customers' insatiable need for more powerful optical networking equipment and changes in buying and ordering patterns, analysts said. 

 Lucent Chairman Richard McGinn dismissed criticism that the company was growing too fast. 

 "Some people have suggested that maybe we're pushing too hard in terms of growing the business, but I would report that it hasn't been at the expense of margins. Every single year, margins have gone up and profits have gone up. That is inconsistent with the notion that we're pushing too hard," he said. 

 Lucent, based in Murray Hill, N.J.,  said it expects its strongest growth to be in the second half of the year as it works out its manufacturing problems and produces enough optical, network access and semiconductor products to meet demand. 

 For the full year, Lucent expects its revenue to rise at the low end of the 17 percent to 19 percent range that it previously had forecast. Meanwhile, it said full-year profit should grow 20 percent to 25 percent over last year's earnings of $1.20 a share. 

 Some analysts voiced skepticism over Lucent's rosy outlook for the second half of the year. 

 "We remain cautious in the near-term on LU shares as management's revised 2000 guidance appears aggressive given [first-quarter) results, indicating potential exists for future negative revisions," CS First Boston analyst James Parmelee said in a research report. He reiterated a strong buy rating on the stock but trimmed earnings estimates. 

 Salomon Smith, which cut its rating on the stock to neutral from buy, echoed those sentiments and said Lucent's financial guidance for the second half of fiscal 2000 "may be too aggressive." 

 During the quarter, Lucent lost business to rivals who were able to deliver products more quickly to customers, and that business may not be easy to recoup, analysts said. 

 "One company's loss is another company's gain. As Lucent could not execute during the quarter, apparently others did, such as Nortel and Alcatel," said Cruttenden Roth Inc. analyst Dave Kang. 

 In addition to Nortel, CS First Boston analyst Paul Weinstein said Tellabs Inc., CIENA Corp. and Cisco may benefit from Lucent's $1billion first-quarter sales shortfall. 

 Suppliers of dense wave division multiplexing equipment - which increases the capacity of fiber-optic cables - such as JDS Uniphase Corp., SDL Inc. and E-Tek Dynamics Inc. - also may siphon off some of Lucent's customers, other analysts said. 

 In addition to Lucent's key manufacturing problems, it also had flat sales to large corporations and of central office switching equipment, as well as declining sales of wireless equipment and software, said Warburg Dillon analyst Nikos Theodosopoulos. 

 "There was generic weakness across many businesses," Theodosopoulos said in a research report. 

 That weakness alarmed some other analysts, who said Lucent's problems may go deeper and linger longer than the company indicated. Lucent also has yet to jump-start its stagnant "enterprise," or corporate customer sales, segment, an area where it lags far behind data networking leader Cisco. 

 Lucent's first-quarter profit warning marked its second "January surprise." A year ago, the company suffered a revenue shortfall because of a delay in finalizing some customer contracts. 

 While Lucent easily recovered from that stumble, the profitwarning may be difficult for investors to forget.

 The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory yesterday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent. 

 The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its best day in history. 

 On Wall St, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30, or 2.4 per cent, to close at 11,522.56, topping its December 31 closing record of 11,497.12. 

 The rally, which was fuelled by consumer goods stocks, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.48, or 4.2 per cent, to 3882.61 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 per cent, over the previous three sessions. 

 Other broad-market indicators also posted sizeable gains. 

 According to preliminary calculations, the Standard and Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1441.47. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the sell-off that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 Investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. 

 The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from Lucent Technologies, a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent said late Thursday it would not meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. 

 On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged well below its Thursday close on the NYSE. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying fibre-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the internet. 

 Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. 

 Those companies, considered cyclical stocks, have thrived this week as investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999. 

 But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management.

 The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory yesterday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent Technologies and sent stocks sharply higher. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average topped its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The Nasdaq composite recorded its best day in history after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." STEIN MART HIRES NEW MERCHANDISING CHIEF 

 Gwen K. Manto, president and CEO of Venator Group's Kids Foot Locker division, is leaving that post to become executive vice president and chief merchandising officer at Jacksonville-based Stein Mart Inc., the local retailer said yesterday. 

 She assumes her duties at Stein Mart on Feb. 1. Manto, who has more than 25 years of retailing experience, worked for Federated Department Stores Inc. and is credited with turning around the Kids Foot Locker chain. 

 She replaces Mike Remsen, who left Stein Mart to pursue other interests. STARBUCKS HEADED TO WEST JACKSONVILLE

 TECHS CLIMB AS BLUE CHIPS KEEP SOARING RECORD DOW CLOSE; NASDAQ GAINS; BONDS HOLD STEADY

 Bungee jumping has nothing on the great sport of investing in the first week of the new year--which ended Friday with a sharp snapback by technology stocks. 

 While investors continued to pursue big-name basic industry stocks to send the Dow Jones industrial average soaring to a new record close, they also started buying computer-technology issues that had been pummeled by tax selling and profit taking. 

 The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index, which reached a new high on Monday, then sank for three days, rallied with a record gain of 155.49, or 4.2 percent, to close at 3882.62. That pared the week's loss to a still-hefty 186.67, or 4.6 percent. 

 Blue chips lost none of their early 2000 luster. The Dow rose 2.4 percent, or 269.30, closing at 11,522.56, and wiped out the remnants of a 359-point slide Tuesday. The close topped the previous record of 11,497.12, set last Friday. For the week, the Dow edged up 25.40 points. 

 Volume continued heavy as portfolio managers and individuals shifted assets. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1.21 billion shares, and winning stocks overwhelmed losers by almost 3-1. 

 In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index advanced 38.02, or 2.7 percent, to 1441.47. But the index was still down 27.78, or 1.9 percent, for the week. 

 Smaller stocks also began to recover. The Russell 2000 index showed an increase of 12.97, or 2.7 percent, to 488.31. The week's loss came to 16.44, or 3.2 percent. 

 Meanwhile, bond yields held steady despite a strong employment report for December. The yield on the key 30-year Treasury bond eased to 6.54 percent from 6.55 percent late Thursday as the price gained 94 cents per $1,000 invested. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the sell-off that began Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors demonstrated their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment-maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged $15 below its Thursday close on the NYSE, ending the session at $54. But that was up $2 from its level in Thursday's after- hours trading. 

 Investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were because of specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared $20.44, to $97.44, Cisco Systems rose $5.87, to $105.87, Ciena rose $11.87, to $57.75, and JDS Uniphase rose $30.19, to $179.94. 

 Locally, a profit shortfall warning by W.W. Grainger, a Chicago- based distributor of maintenance and repair parts, sent the stock lower by 69 cents, to $44.37. It traded as low as $41.25. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the labor market remains strong. Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, some economists believe the Federal Reserve could boost interest rates again next month to try to keep inflation under control, possibly hurting company profits. 

 Many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter & Gamble surged $8.62, to $116.50. 

 Also, Merck gained $6.56, to $74.94, and Johnson & Johnson rose $3.94, to $96.50. 

 Those companies, considered cyclical stocks, have thrived this week as investors took profits from the big run in technology shares.

 Markets turn hot again --- Toronto, N.Y. see record gains in spirited rallies

 Investors shook off their New Year's hangover yesterday and sent stocks soaring to record gains on the Toronto and New York markets. 

 Led by a resurgent Nortel Networks Corp. and BCE Inc., the Toronto Stock Exchange's benchmark 300 composite index rose 315.18 points, a record one-day increase, to 8,429.42. The 3.88 per cent gain was the sixth-largest percentage past 17 years. 

 On the week, the TSE 300 was up 0.19 per cent, or 16.36 points. 

 "Nobody's really too worried about inflation," Rob Palombi, an analyst at Standard & Poor's MMS, said of the day's market activity. 

 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average continued to soar, gaining 269.30 points, or 2.39 per cent, to a record 11,522.56. That overtook its Dec. 31 closing high of 11,497.12. 

 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which had been reeling from a wave of selling this week, roared back. Its one-day increase of 155.49 points yesterday set a single-session record. The index closed at 3,882.62, up 4.17 per cent. 

 And around the world, stock markets showed improvement yesterday after the battering suffered nearly everywhere earlier in the week. 

 The lure of equities investment at a time of buoyant economic growth in North America and improved business conditions throughout much of the world appeared to outweigh investor fears of higher interest rates. 

 "If this is any indication of what year 2000 is going to be like, it's going to be a wild ride," said Douglas Porter, an economist at Nesbitt Burns in Toronto. 

 Despite the pullback in technology stocks earlier this week, there still seems to be a huge appetite for them. 

 "Any setback is seen as a buying opportunity," Porter said. "The main message here is that the equity markets are extremely resilient even after having a real scare earlier this week." 

 Subodh Kumar, market strategist at CIBC World Markets, warned that investors should expect continued volatility. 

 "In this market cycle, people have tended to buy back into dips aggressively and sell aggressively on uncertainty," he said. 

 Amid the market advances, the Canadian dollar resumed its recent trading gains, closing at 68.67 cents (U.S.), up 0.15 of a cent. 

 TSE heavyweights Nortel and BCE led the market higher yesterday. Together, the two stocks account for about 25 per cent of the TSE 300 index. 

 "It was a tale of two stocks," said Irwin Michael, portfolio manager of ABC Funds in Toronto. 

 The utilities sector rose 8.5 per cent as BCE gained $12.90 to $126.90 with 4.7 million shares traded. 

 Nortel, two-fifths owned by BCE, got a boost from a profit warning from U.S. rival Lucent Technologies Inc. Nortel jumped $17.25 to $141.35, boosting the TSE industrial products sub-index by just under 9 per cent. 

 "Today everybody concluded that it was just really Lucent's problem and not a more general market problem," said Kate Warne, Canadian market strategist for Edward Jones in St. Louis, Mo. 

 "Over-all, there was this sense that the last few days had been overdone. People decided today that, even with rate increases, these are good stocks and they shouldn't have dropped to where they did." 

 "Lucent's problems have certainly been a great assistance to Nortel and anything that helps Nortel will be of assistance to BCE," said Fred Ketchen, chief equities trader at Scotia Capital Markets, observed. 

 "We're seeing a quick turnaround in areas where we've seen substantial erosion," Ketchen said. 

 Elsewhere in the industrial products sector, JDS Uniphase Corp. jumped $40.50 to $259.50. 

 Certicom Inc. hit a record high of $115.00 following price upgrades by analysts a day earlier. The shares closed at $108.00 yesterday, up $21. 

 Over-all, eight of the TSE 300's 14 sub-indices ended higher including consumer products, paper and forestry products, conglomerates, and metals and minerals. 

 On the downside, transportation stocks fell, gold issues were down, pipelines companies slumped, and financial services players were off. 

 In the bank group, the Royal Bank of Canada dropped 60 cents to $61.80, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ended flat at $33.70 and the Bank of Nova Scotia dropped 10 cents to $31. 

 TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. fell 30 cents to $2.20 after filing a claim for $71 million, saying the loss resulted from unauthorized foreign trading. 

 Analysts said the markets are beginning to factor in a potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike in early February. 

 The probability of a rate increase was reinforced by U.S. economic data released yesterday that indicated non-farm payrolls added 315,000 jobs in December, beating expectations. 

 In Canada, December's jobless rate also remained steady and matched estimates at 6.9 per cent, while unemployment increases topped forecasts with 42,000 jobs created in the month.

Qwest, US West say Colorado panel approves merger 

DENVER -- Qwest Communications International Inc. and US West Inc. said the Colorado Public Utilities Commission approved their merger without substantial conditions. 

The commission recognized benefits to consumers and the public in signing off on the companies' $45.2 billion combination, which shareholders approved in November, Qwest and US West said. Colorado is the first state in US West's service area to clear the merger. 

Qwest and US West agreed to combine in July. Qwest gives US West a national network and advanced data and Internet services, while US West brings Qwest 25 million customers in 14 states and the local phone lines into their homes that also can deliver video and fast Internet access. 

Wal-Mart settles suit related to deaf applicants, employees 

WASHINGTON -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will provide closed-captioning in its employee-training videos and develop a sign-language alternative to computerized instructions to settle a U.S. lawsuit claiming the world's largest retailer discriminated against deaf applicants and employees. 

The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., also agreed to hire two deaf applicants who were rejected for jobs at a Tucson, Ariz., Wal- Mart store and pay them a total of $132,000. 

Wal-Mart reached the settlement with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the private, nonprofit Arizona Center for Disability Law, which sued Wal-Mart in 1997 on behalf of applicants Jeremy Fass and William Darnell. 

Wal-Mart also will pay the Arizona Center for Disability Law $528,000 for legal fees. 

Lucent Technologies hits trading record for stock activity 

MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- Lucent Technologies Inc.'s delay in bringing out a new product for fiber-optic networks is opening the door for Nortel Networks Corp. to swipe its customers, analysts and investors said. 

Lucent's shares plunged $15.875 or 23 percent, to $53.1875 on the New York Stock Exchange after it issued its first-ever profit warning Thursday. Lucent cited a delay in its new system that speeds traffic on telecommunications networks. Friday's trading of more than 178 million shares was the most ever by a U.S. stock. It closed up $2 at $54. 

Nortel, which has been selling equipment like the gear Lucent failed to deliver, rose $12.1875 to $97.4375. Ciena Corp., another rival in fiber optics, rose $11.875 to $57.75. 

Chief Executive Rich McGinn said Lucent was surprised at how quickly some customers moved to equipment based on OC-192 technology, which is four times faster than the company's main systems. Lucent didn't have its product ready in the fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 31. The delay, shortages of other fiber-optic products and lower software sales caused its profit to fall as much as 12 cents a share from the same period a year ago. 

Coca-Cola's European chief replaced by marketing officer 

ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. said the head of its European operations is leaving as the world's largest soft-drink-maker tries to restore its image after a tainted-drinks scandal in France and Belgium. 

Stepping down is William Casey, 58, who was appointed less than two years ago as president of Europe by departing Chief Executive Douglas Ivester. He is being replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Charles Frenette, 47. 

The executive changes are the second this week by Chief Executive- elect Douglas Daft, who's taking over for the retiring Ivester in April. The new CEO is expected to shake up management further in the wake of public-relations gaffes such as the contaminated drinks and a racial lawsuit filed by current and former African American employees during Ivester's two-year tenure. 

TiVo shares soar 31 percent with news of Blockbuster deal 

SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Shares of TiVo Inc., which markets an advanced TV recorder that allows viewers to pause, rewind and play back live broadcasts, soared 31 percent after it unveiled an alliance with Blockbuster Inc. 

TiVo rose $11.9375 to $50.375 in trading of 3.21 million shares, five times its three-month daily average. The Sunnyvale-based company first sold shares to the public in September at $16 each. 

Under the agreement, TiVo can promote its services to Blockbuster's 65 million video-rental members worldwide and advertise in Blockbuster's 4,000 U.S. stores. Blockbuster will advertise upcoming film releases, and customers eventually will be able to reserve movies for pickup at Blockbuster stores through the TiVo system. The companies also will work together to develop a video-on- demand service in which TiVo customers could receive a selection of movies through their TiVo devices. The companies said they hope to start service this year.

Taiwan's No. 1 chip foundry buys island's No. 3 chip-maker 

TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwan's largest computer chip-maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said Friday it will buy the island's third-largest producer in a stock swap that analysts valued at more than $3 billion. With an earlier deal, the purchase will make TSMC the world's largest chip foundry. 

TSMC's agreement to buy Worldwide Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. follows recent speculation that Taiwan's No. 2 company, United Microelectronics Corp., had been courting Worldwide. The deal will put pressure on United Microelectronics to find its own merger partner, said Nathan Emerson, director of ABN Amro Asia Investment Consultancy in Taipei. 

TSMC recently agreed to acquire all of TSMC-Acer Semicon, its chip- making joint venture with Acer Inc., Taiwan's largest personal computer-maker. The deal and the Worldwide acquisition will solidify TSMC's position as the world's largest chip foundry.

 NEW YORK - The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, also rallied back. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec.31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks  such as Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent,  during the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who  thought the sell-off that began Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three- day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications-equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent but said its woes were specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared $14.06 to $91.06; Cisco Systems rose $5.88 to $105.88, Ciena rose $11.88 to $57 and JDS Uniphase rose $30.19 to $179.94.

 Those companies have thrived this week as investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999. But their resurgence may be short-lived, Gannon said. 

 "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the dominant players remained telecom and technology."

 Dow rockets to another record  -  Even a warning from Lucent can't stop surge

 The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory yesterday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profitwarning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.

 ''We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at 54. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 ''This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 20 7/16 to 97 7/16, Cisco Systems rose 5 to 105, Ciena rose 11 to 573/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 30 3/16 to 179 15/16. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem yesterday: the latest sign that the nation's labor market remains strong. 

 Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. 

 Notably, many of yesterday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter & Gamble surged 8 to 1161/2. 

 Also, Coca-Cola rose 33/4 to 603/4, Merck gained 6 9/16 to 74 15/16 and Johnson & Johnson rose 3 15/16 to 961/2. 

 Those companies have thrived this week as investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999. But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Gannon. 

 ''I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the dominant players remained telecom and technology."

 NEW YORK - The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. 

 The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. 

 Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the nation's labor market remains strong. 

 A burst of hiring at department stores and construction companies helped keep the nation's unemployment rate at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent in December, marking a strong finish for a year in which Americans enjoyed the best labor market since the Vietnam War. 

 December's jobless rate of 4.1 percent matched the year's low reached in November. That level is better than any since unemployment stood at 3.9 percent in January 1970, the Labor Department said Friday. 

 For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the best since a 3.5 percent jobless average in 1969. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent. 

 The sharpness of the stock rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at 54. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 207/16 to 977/16, Cisco Systems rose 57/8 to 1057/8, Ciena rose 117/8 to 573/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 303/16 to 17915/16. 

 Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter & Gamble surged 85/8 to 1161/2. 

 Also, Coca-Cola rose 33/4 to 603/4, Merck gained 69/16 to 7415/16 and Johnson & Johnson rose 315/16 to 961/2. 

 Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the largest gain since July. Big increases came at department stores, enjoying their best holiday sales season in seven years, and construction companies, basking in a building boom brought on by warmer-than-usual weather. 

 "The century ended on a high note for workers," said First Union chief economist David Orr. 

 He noted that the gain in payroll jobs was far above the 240,000 increase many economists had expected.

 Lucent pays huge price for being late with product

 Murray Hill, N.J. -- Lucent Technologies' lateness in introducing a product for fiber-optic networks is opening the door for Nortel Networks to swipe its customers, analysts and investors say. 

 Lucent's shares plunged $15.875, or 23 percent, to $53.188 after issuing its first-ever profit warning Thursday. Most of the decline came in after-hours trading; the stock rose $1.188 in regular trading Friday, when more than 179 million shares of Lucent changed hands - the most ever by a U.S. stock in one day. The previous record was 171.8 million shares traded in Oracle on Dec. 9, 1997, also after a profit disappointment. 

 "Lucent is a stock everyone loves. Everyone I know who ever sold the stock was sorry they sold it," said Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Shields & Co. "The stock suddenly got a lot cheaper - here's a chance to buy it, and I'm surprised on that kind of volume there hasn't been more of a lift." 

 Lucent cited a delay in its new system that speeds traffic on telecommunications networks. Nortel, which has been selling equipment like the gear Lucent failed to deliver, rose $12.188 to $97.438. Ciena, another rival in fiber optics, rose $11.875 to $57.75. 

 "There are customers out there who have been waiting for Lucent," said Michael Urlocker, an analyst at Scotia Capital Markets. "They may get tired of waiting and just hang up." 

 Chief Executive Richard McGinn said Lucent was surprised at how quickly some customers moved to equipment based on OC-192 technology, which is four times faster than the systems the company now sells. Lucent didn't have its OC-192 product ready in the fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 31. 

 That delay, shortages of other fiber-optic products and lower software sales caused Lucent's profit to fall as much as 12 cents a share from a year earlier. Sales were almost unchanged. 

 PaineWebber analyst Walt Piecyk said he expects Nortel to take advantage of the demand that Lucent can't fill during the next few quarters. "Nortel is clearly in the lead with better optical products," Piecyk said. 

 He raised his price target on Nortel from $72 to $100, and dropped it on Lucent from $100 to $65. He still rates both a "buy." 

 McGinn will have to shake things up to help Lucent recover, analysts said. The company needs a product to compete with Nortel's most advanced fiber-optic equipment, and more production capacity to meet demand for fiber-optic components and cables. 

 "They'll have to make some changes to address the manufacturing issues," Merrill Lynch analyst Mike Ching said. "The company has to make sure it has the necessary capacity." 

 Lucent's problems may stem in part from recent changes in senior management, some analysts said. 

 Carleton Fiorina quit in July as Lucent's president of global sales to phone companies to become chief executive at Hewlett- Packard. Her replacement, Pat Russo, is a Lucent veteran, but she hadn't been involved in sales for a couple of years when she took the job in October. 

 "Carly Fiorina was a very important member of the Lucent management team," Ching said. "Without her watch, communication with customers on some projects may have gone astray." 

 Piecyk said Lucent also was left weaker when Dan Stanzione stepped down in October as head of the Bell Labs research division, which is responsible for developing new products. Stanzione left for personal reasons and now advises McGinn. 

 Lacking a product to compete with Nortel's has hurt Lucent, which lost its lead in fiber-optic equipment sales to Canadian rival Nortel last year. 

 Lucent had hoped to ship OC-192 systems in the recent quarter to waiting customers such as Global Crossing. It didn't and now expects to deliver them this quarter. 

 AT&T, which spun off Lucent in 1996 and still buys a lot of its equipment, said in November that it was accelerating its move to OC- 192 systems. 

 "Someone took his eye off the ball and didn't react quickly enough," said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus who owns Lucent as part of $4 billion in assets he runs. "It was a mistake, not just bad luck." 

 Sales of the fiber-optic transmission gear, which includes OC-192 products, will surge to $41 billion in 2003 from $9 billion last year, according to RHK Inc., a San Francisco market researcher. 

 McGinn said Lucent's fiber-optic revenue increased more than 30 percent in the first quarter and could have been higher. That's a slowdown from the quarter ended Sept. 30, when sales rose 40 percent to 50 percent. 

 Nortel's sales of fiber-optic equipment more than doubled in the same quarter. 

 "You have to do well in your high-growth areas or risk highlighting the fact that your older businesses are experiencing flat or negative growth," Piecyk said. 

 Piecyk and other analysts said Lucent told them on a conference call Thursday that sales of traditional voice switches, products for corporations and wireless gear were unchanged from a year ago. 

 Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, a New York law firm, said it filed a lawsuit Friday on behalf of investors against Lucent in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The suit, which seeks class-action status, alleges that the company and senior executives made false statements about Lucent's financial condition and its ability to control costs and keep profit margins up. 

Behind its stock nosedive is a delay in introducing a product for fiber-optic networks. Nortel benefits.

 NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 20 7/16 to 97 7/16, Cisco Systems rose 5 7/8 to 105 7/8, Ciena rose 11 7/8 to 57 3/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 30 3/16 to 179 15/16.

 Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting company profits. 

 Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter & Gamble surged 8 5/8 to 116 1/2. 

 Also, Coca-Cola rose 3 3/4 to 60 3/4, Merck gained 6 9/16 to 74 15/16 and Johnson & Johnson rose 3 15/16 to 96 1/2.

 "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the dominant players remained telecom and technology." 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, five stocks rose for every three that fell. 

 Composite volume totaled 1.49 billion shares, compared with 1.32 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 to 488.31. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. European indexes bounced back sharply from their own declines this week, with Germany's Xetra DAX rising 4.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 up 1.6 percent.

 Strong faith, strong muscles

 He's known as "The Preacher" in the athletic world and is pastor of Salt Lake's Back to the Foundation, a nondenominational church at 2801 S. Main. However, any way you look at him he's a sort of modern-day Samson, rippling with muscles, full of enthusiasm and a positive attitude. 

 Pastor Ron Williams, who by profession is a personal athletic trainer, is also a world champion bodybuilder -- having won some 100 titles. In his most recent competition he was the overall winner --"Mr. Natural Universe" -- in an international bodybuilding event at Redondo Beach, Calif. 

 He won seven different bodybuilding titles in 1999. 

 "That's a miracle," he said. "I've continued to get better." 

 At age 38, weighing 210 pounds and standing 5 feet 6 1/2 inches tall, Williams is a little short on height and hair, but like Samson of the Old Testament, he believes his strength and muscles are a gift from God. 

 Williams grew up in Indianapolis and played four varsity sports as a teenager. However, his early life was very difficult. 

 "I used to be a street kid," he said. "I know what it's like to hate and not respect authority . . . I had a 'me against the world' mentality, and it developed a hardness." 

 His boxing coach encouraged him to try bodybuilding, and he found he had the genetics for the sport. 

 His goal was then to be the best bodybuilder in the world. He was proficient at the sport, placing second in his first-ever competition even though he had little knowledge about the proper way of posing. After that, he won 13 consecutive titles. 

 "Bodybuilding is a very prideful sport, " he said, admitting he was attracted to it because it was a place he could hide his shortcomings and insecurities. 

 However, by 1988 he realized all that success wasn't making him happy, Williams said. He lacked something. 

 It was a life-or-death situation about 11 years ago that proved to be the turning point in his life, and after a first prayer, Williams said God began to communicate with him, and he became a Christian. 

 "I had to learn how to trust God. He talked to me and trained me . . . I learned the power of forgiveness." 

 He began attending various churches but was turned off by what he called "the traditions of men" he found there. A friend told him he believed Williams would end up in Salt Lake City and sure enough, said Williams, that's where God directed him to go. 

 Ten years ago he came to Utah to train for the ministry. In 1991, he felt God wanted him to retire from bodybuilding to prepare for his ministry. He went on a 40-day fast in 1992 to increase his spirituality. He has been a pastor of the Back to the Foundation Church, which he started, for four years. It now ministers to a congregation of about 80 people. 

 Williams believes bodybuilding provided a forum where the Lord was able to teach him certain traits that are important in life --setting goals, developing desire, courage, consistency and a belief in yourself. 

 About a year ago, he said the Lord "released him" and gave him the approval to go back into bodybuilding competition. 

 His current theme song for his bodybuilding competitions is "I Saw the Lord," a Gospel song. 

 "The titles I've won have helped open the door to speaking opportunities," he said, explaining he loves to speak to groups, especially youths, because he knows where they're coming from. 

 He spends just two hours a day maintaining his physique, puts some time into personal training work with some athletes and a few housewives, and the rest of his time is dedicated to his ministry. 

 "I get lots of calls at 2 or 3 in the morning," he said of his role as pastor. "If they need me, they know to call me." 

 His church studies from the Bible, and his main message is for others to find what's in the mind of God for them. 

 "That's the road to success." 

 He said it is also important to develop a relationship, a father-son bond with the Lord. 

 "Our bodies are the temples of the word of God," Williams said. "The better you feel physically, the more you can do for God." 

 He doesn't expect others to look as muscular as he does. 

 "Just be healthy. Everyone doesn't have to lift weights, but don't live a sedentary lifestyle." 

 Regarding the scripture in 1 Timothy 4:8 that appears to discourage bodily exercise, Williams said the passage is not a warning against exercise but simply a reminder to keep priorities straight -- that godliness is what we should seek in life. He said the scriptures contain many references that say bodily exercise can profit a person. 

 Williams opposes what he calls non-natural bodybuilding competitions. All of his competitions are in the "natural" events, where drug testing is mandatory and drugs, steroids and the like are not allowed. 

 His competitions are sanctioned by the ABA -- American Bodybuilding Association -- or the INBA -- International Natural Bodybuilding Association. 

 Williams said competitors in the non-natural events, including some movie stars and professional athletes, have gained more fame and received more publicity, but some have also paid the price later with health problems. 

 Some bodybuilders look strong but really aren't. Williams, however, considers himself a power lifter as well as a body builder. He has bench-pressed as much as 465 pounds and can perform 50 consecutive repetitions in the squat category while shouldering 350 pounds. 

 He also watches his diet and advises moderation "since you are what you eat." 

 "I've learned to eat to live, not live to eat," he said. 

 Williams is also against what he calls perverted music, pornography and taking anything bad into one's body, whether it be the mental or physical route. 

 "It's what you do the majority of the time that makes a difference (in life,)" he said. 

 His church currently meets in the old Hale Center Theater, but he has another goal -- to develop a special youth facility to train young people spiritually, physically and mentally in a more rural area like Herriman. He would like a facility that can house a dozen young people -- he'd take them off the street -- full-time for some spiritual guidance. 

 Williams has been married to his wife, Glinnea, for 10 years. He describes her as his favorite preacher, someone who is not hypocritical. 

 He said he loves Utah and has nothing bad to say about the state. He admits he had plenty of misconceptions about Mormons before coming here, but most of his friends are LDS. He plans on staying here until "Jesus returns to the earth." 

 Back to the Foundation Church, 2801 S. Main, 474-2549, meets Sundays at 1 p.m. for worship service, Wednesdays at 7 p.m. for Bible study and Fridays from 6:30-8:30 p.m. for prayer service.

 Dow rebounds to 11,522.56 after tumbling this week 

 NEW YORK - The Dow Jones industrials rose into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.

 SHAREMARKETS across the world experienced a swift reversal of fortunes during the first week of the new millennium as the technology market darlings of 1999 were dumped in favour of resources and cyclical stocks while the smart money refocused on the interest rate outlook. Investors hammered the All Ordinaries index more than 110 points, or about 3.6 percent, lower over the week as they took profits on overheated technology stocks and exited the interest-rate sensitive banking sector. However, yesterday's market presented a glimmer of hope as the nation's resources sector pulled the All Ordinaries out of the mire of tech-stock and interest rate pessimism to finish 14.4 points higher at 3044.5 points. This mirrored a sector-switch evident on the Dow Jones index, which recovered from its one-day 3.7 percent tumble on Tuesday, to finish just 2.1 percent lower than its year's-end high, after adding 130.61 points to close at 11,253.26 on Thursday. 

 The Australian sharemarket, like many bourses, slavishly followed Wall Street's plunge early this week on both the Dow Jones industrial average and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index. Earlier, local investors had hoped for a triumphant start to the new year after a record-breaking finish to 1999 at 3152.5 on the All Ordinaries. But accelerating fears of an interest rate hike, a surge in bond yields and a post-Y2K cash glut cut short the fin-de-siecle optimism. ABN Amro chief equity strategist Gerard Minack said the past week was characterised by a rotation out of high price/earnings ratio areas into cheaper areas, such as resources and cyclical stocks. "We also saw some more interest in value plays like paper and packaging, transport and alcohol and tobacco," Mr Minack said. "These are all the larger sectors which have started to enter investors' radar screens." Mr Minack said he believed the trend could continue over the next few months as investors sought "safe harbours" in the cyclical stocks to counter the volatility of the technology sector. Nervous technology investors have so far wiped 8.4 percent from the Nasdaq this week and the losses could worsen following an after-market profit warning on Thursday from United States technology giant Lucent Technologies. Market analysts said offshore funds appeared to be driving the resources rally this week as they did in April 1999, when BHP surged from $13.50 to $17. The resources sector is expected to be the key strength of the Australian sharemarket over the next months as investors cut their exposure to technology and take advantage of positive commodities forecasts. This week, diversified resources giant BHP was one of the few to finish the week on a bright note. Starting at $20, BHP was knocked down with the rest of the market during the week, but yesterday stacked on $1 to close at a record $21.35. Other resource stocks similarly finished the horror week on a firmer note. Rio Tinto started on Monday at $32.72 and closed at $33.26 while WMC lifted from $8.40 to $8.57 and MIM rose from $1.57 to $1.67. In the techno stocks, Solution 6 was the biggest loser, tumbling from $16.60 on December 30 to $10.80 after the stock fell $2.834, or 21 percent, yesterday after a query from the US Federal Trade Commission on its proposed merger with US-based Elite Information Group. - SECT-Finance.

 PRESIDENT Bill Clinton nominated Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to a fourth term at the helm of the nation's central bank. 

 "Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large role in our economy," Clinton said after meeting with Greenspan in the Oval Office Tuesday morning. The Senate will have to confirm the president's choice. 

 The 73-year-old Greenspan's current term expires June 20. Since his appointment by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Greenspan has presided over an unprecedented nine-year period of growth and low inflation.

 It's the first profit warning since its spinoff from AT&T Corp. in 1996. Lucent said earnings in the quarter ended Dec. 31 were 36 cents to 39 cents a share, compared to analysts expectation of a first- quarter profit of 54 cents. "With the magnitude of this kind of surprise, people are going to be guarded until they figure out how we got so blindsided," said Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Mike Ching.

 PRESIDENT Bill Clinton nominated Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to a fourth term at the helm of the nation's central bank. 

 "Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large role in our economy," Clinton said after meeting with Greenspan in the Oval Office Tuesday morning. The Senate will have to confirm the president's choice. 

 The 73-year-old Greenspan's current term expires June 20. Since his appointment by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, Greenspan has presided over an unprecedented nine-year period of growth and low inflation.

 Lucent Technologies' Stock Caught Up in Swap Fever

 Investors traded Lucent Technologies stock with a vengeance yesterday, smashing records along the way. They bought and sold more than 179 million shares, the most active single day of trading ever in one company. 

 When the dust settled and the frenzied "cascades" of transactions were in the books, the Murray Hill-based giant had recouped a tiny portion of the deep cuts it suffered Thursday night after it warned of far lower-than-expected profits. 

 One out of 18 Lucent shares found a new home yesterday and the price closed at 54, up 2 points from the previous evening, when 28 percent of the company's value was lopped off. The ferocious buying and selling helped Lucent eclipse by some 7.4 million shares the single-day trading record Oracle Corp. set in 1997. 

 Lucent shares were up for grabs because the world's biggest phone equipment maker issued a startling warning Thursday night, forecasting up to a third less profit than estimated for the recently completed quarter. Less than three hours after the warning, America's most widely held stock had lost more than $60 billion of its value, or some $20 per share. 

 Despite the enormous trading volume yesterday -- 179,266,100 shares -- Lucent's share price recovered slightly from the downdraft because there was as much demand for a stock that was "stinking up the joint" as there were sellers, said money manager David Rolfe, the chief investment officer for Wedgewood Partners of St. Louis. 

 "You had cascades of selling and cascades of buying. Any time you see that type of volume, it means there is a huge shift in the shareholder base," Rolfe said. 

 Growth mutual funds, which load up on stocks with strong earnings, most likely sold Lucent shares, according to Rolfe. Value funds, which look for stocks that have been hammered, or similarly considered worth more than their current market value, bought the stock because the price was right, he said. 

 "The short-term crowd was out and the long-term value crowd was in," Rolfe said. 

 Now, analysts say, Lucent has to play like a fired-up football team even though it's losing by three touchdowns in the second half. Lucent, they say, must win back fans in coming months by delivering equipment on time for big phone companies. 

 "It's going to be a challenge," said Michael Davies, stock analyst for Gruntal & Co. in New York. "I was comfortable with Lucent for a long time, but it's giving me heartburn at this point." 

 There were several reasons for the stunning shortfall: Lucent couldn't build equipment used in fiber-optic networks fast enough, software sales were slow, and some customers delayed orders or had trouble getting loans to buy Lucent products. 

 Lucent said yesterday it is fixing the problems this way: It will install more testing equipment at its Andover, Mass., plant, which makes high-speed optical networking gear. Delays in shipping the equipment -- which transmits phone calls, data and video at the speed of light -- were partly responsible for the shortfall. Lucent also plans to train more people to install the equipment and to persuade suppliers to ship parts on a more timely basis. 

 "The silver lining is that demand for their products seems very strong," said Mark Cavallone, analyst for Standard & Poor's in New York. 

 "Given their history of beating expectations, it's not surprising that they got clobbered." 

 Lucent chairman Richard McGinn spent yesterday in Boston giving a chalk talk to the company's biggest stockholders. He and other Lucent executives will hit the road next week to put their spin on the big fumble. 

 McGinn is an aggressive leader who has been fond of saying that Lucent delivered higher results for nearly a year and a half that rewarded shareholders with stock splits. Yesterday, however, he told CNBC that his company couldn't deliver leading-edge technology to customers as quickly as it had in previous years. 

 "We failed to exercise on our plan," McGinn said. "This is a company that has a history of performance, and performance over the expectations. We have to now build back that credibility." 

 Lucent is forecasting a weaker-than-expected performance in the first two quarters of the year and says it plans to make up for it in the last two quarters. However, some analysts wonder if Lucent can make up the earnings shortfall by the end of this year. 

 "The expectations are too high for the back half of the year," said Alex Cena, who follows Lucent for the New York investment firm Salomon Smith Barney. "We used to think that Lucent stock should command a premium compared with its peers. That part of the equation is history." 

 Cena pointed out that other big phone equipment vendors had bad quarterly earnings periods that forced them to earn back the respect of the investing public: Cisco Systems in 1994, Nokia in 1996, Motorola in 1997, Ericsson in 1998. 

 "I don't know why Lucent didn't know about this sooner," said Theodore Moreau, stock analyst for Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. "They've got to come back and beat the numbers to get people excited again. That's why money is rotating out of Lucent to other comparable companies." 

 Corporations divide the year into four quarters, each a three-month period. Stock analysts predict how much a company will earn every quarter based on periodic company briefings and their own methods of crunching the numbers. Wall Street uses that guidance to recommend whether investors should buy or hold a stock. 

 Many analysts who follow Lucent cut their annual earnings forecast for the company yesterday. They expect Lucent to earn $1.20 to $1.47 a share. Lucent is sticking by its estimate that it should earn between $1.44 to $1.52 per share. Clearly, Wall Street has lowered its expectations for a company that was once a high flier. 

 Some investors worry that Lucent doesn't get enough sales from newer data switches based on Internet technology, and relies too heavily on circuit switches, which are considered old technology even though they have been updated. The question that will dog Lucent until the end of March is whether customers would rather buy the latest gear from Nortel than wait for Lucent to solve its production woes.

 Dow soars to record high as US markets shrug off unexpected surge in new jobs.

 US MARKETS shrugged off concerns about interest rates and a profit warning from telecoms giant Lucent to soar into record territory yesterday, apparently leaving behind the worries that saw a huge plunge earlier in the week. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 269.30 to reach 11,522.56, a record high. The index had collapsed by 359 points on Tuesday, but traders apparently saw this as a buying opportunity. The Nasdaq composite index, which suffered a 10 per cent drop in the previous three sessions, soared by 155.45 points to 3,882.58. 

 The climbs came despite a warning from the telecoms manufacturer Lucent after hours on Thursday that it would not meet profit forecasts for the last quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of this year. Lucent was down a massive $1578 at $53316 on record volume of nearly 137 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, erasing its market capitalisation by over one-fifth. But other tech stocks soared on the news, including Cisco Systems and its rival Nortel Networks. 

 The market also virtually ignored data showing that the US job market tightened at the end of last year, which had added to concerns that interest rates will have to rise to damp down inflationary pressures. The number of jobs increased at the fastest rate for five months and wages rose at a moderate pace, according to the US Labor Department, while the overall unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 per cent. 

 US non-farm payrolls increased by 315,000 jobs in December, up from 222,000 jobs in November. The figure was well above markets expectations. 

 The data confirmed their belief that interest rates will rise by a quarter point, but it is still not clear if there is reason enough for the Fed to tighten by a half-point. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond fell on the news, and the yield moved up to 6.61 per cent. 

 The hourly wages of non-supervisory US workers rose 0.4 percent to $13.46, a little faster than expected. Financial analysts scan both the jobs and wage data carefully, not only because it would show any signs of inflation, but because they believe that these indicators are scrutinised by the US Federal Reserve and by Alan Greenspan, the Fed Chairman, who was reappointed this week. 

 The Fed's policy-making Open Markets Committee meets on 1 Feburary and is expected to increase short-term rates by 25 basis points. Most analysts see it moving at least once more before the middle of the year, and perhaps increasing rates by as much as 100 basis points over the year as a whole. 

 The figures confirmed the US economy slowed in 1999, but only marginally. Employment grew 2.1 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent in 1998. 

 Outlook, above.

 NEW YORK (AP) - The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history as investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47.

 WASHINGTON (AP) - A burst of hiring at department stores and construction companies helped keep the nation's unemployment rate at a 30-year low of 4.1 percent in December, marking a strong finish for a year in which Americans enjoyed the best labor market since the Vietnam War. 

 For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent, the best since a 3.5 percent jobless average in 1969, the Labor Department reported Friday. In 1998, the unemployment rate averaged 4.5 percent. 

 In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Americans borrowed $15.6 billion more in November than in October, the largest monthly increase in consumer debt in four years. Consumer credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at an annual rate of 13.7 percent led by strong demand for loans for a wide array of goods including automobiles, boats, education, vacations.

 ATLANTA (AP) - Coca-Cola's incoming chief continues to shake things up, naming a new head of the company's critical European division - which struggled through a costly contamination scare last year - and appointing a new chief marketing officer. 

 The moves Friday follow Doug Daft's successful effort to convince Coke's highest black executive to rescind his retirement plans as the company fights a racial discrimination suit. 

 Many analysts viewed the management shuffle as Daft's way of quickly putting together a new team in time for his official takeover of the Atlanta-based soft drink company in April at the annual shareholders meeting.

 SEATTLE (AP) - For a brief, shining moment, Bill Gates was buying hundreds of people in California and Oregon a new TV. Or VCR. Or breadmaker. 

 Customers lined up outside Best Buy stores and other retailers in those two states for hours on Thursday to take advantage of a poorly worded contract that allowed them to get a $400 rebate on any purchase for signing up with Microsoft's MSN Internet service. 

 What Microsoft learned to its dismay was that the contract also allowed customers to then cancel the service whenever they liked, and still be able to keep the rebate. 

 Once consumers started making a run on the stores, Microsoft realized what was happening and suspended the offer Friday morning.

 DETROIT (AP) - If there's one message that will be heard loud and clear over the glad crowing of automakers at this year's Detroit auto show, it's this: The car of the future is a truck. 

 From hulking four-door pickups to micro-sport utility vehicles and station wagons on steroids, trucks will dominate the turntables of the 2000 North American International Auto Show, just as they dominated the sales charts in 1999. 

 Yet industry watchers point to some warning lights such as rising competition and fuel prices that may make the vehicles a tougher sell.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and a Silicon Valley firm are forming a new Internet company that will work to enhance the giant retailer's Web site and bring shoppers online for the first time. 

 Wal-Mart.com Inc. will be an independent company based in Palo Alto, Calif., with its own board of directors and management team. 

 The deal between the world's largest retailer and venture-capital firm Accel Partners was announced late Thursday. It indicates that Wal-Mart is looking for help as it expands its role in the competitive e-retailing world. Wal-Mart has operated a Web site since 1996, but its online business has lagged behind Web-only rivals such as Amazon.com and eToys.

 WASHINGTON (AP) - Saying technology has brought with it too much "power to create havoc," President Clinton on Friday unveiled a plan to guard against cyber-terrorism and said he will ask Congress to earmark $91 million for it in the next budget. 

 The new initiative builds on steps the administration announced last year. It would seek to develop new technologies, increase public and private cooperation against computer sabotage, improve training for government agents and boost protection of computer systems. 

 But Republicans in Congress were skeptical of the plan, saying it doesn't adequately protect federal computer systems.

 NEW YORK (AP) - A judge on Friday ordered renowned market forecaster Martin A. Armstrong to produce $16 million of gold bars and rare antiquities in an attempt to recover the assets of investors who were bilked out of about $1 billion. 

 Armstrong, 50, founder of Princeton Economics International, violated a court order to turn over the valuables to a court-appointed receiver, Judge Richard Owen in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan ruled. The judge ordered him to produce them by Tuesday at 3 p.m. 

 Armstrong has pleaded innocent to charges of fraud brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.S. Attorney. Prosecutors believe Armstrong has 102 bars of gold, a $750,000 bust of Julius Caesar, hundreds of rare coins, a bronze helmet and other antiques.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Buyers beware: Your credit card might get charged more than once because some merchants failed to update their computer software for the Year 2000. 

 The problem, which affects all types of credit and debit cards, is being caused by outdated IC Verify software from CyberCash, which makes electronic transaction processing software. The company offered free fixes last year, but some merchants didn't get them. 

 Visa and Mastercard said Friday they have checks in place to catch duplicate charges, but they suggest that customers review their credit card statements anyhow. A vast majority of transactions are going through without problems, they added.

 CHICAGO (AP) - "Mikey" is coming back. 

 The finicky kid who wouldn't eat his breakfast - unless it was Life cereal - is returning to television, but this time as a grownup. 

 The rejiggered reprise of one of TV's most famous advertising campaigns represents the latest move by the ad industry to bring back its past icons. In recent months, viewers have become reacquainted with the Green Giant, Charmin's Mr. Whipple, StarKist's Charlie the Tuna and others. 

 The Mikey ad campaign is being relaunched more than a quarter-century after its debut with an all-adult cast as an appeal to the baby boomers' bent for nostalgia.

NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its best day in history. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks such as Procter &Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

The Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard &Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff that began on Tuesday would continue. 

"We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three- day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged $15 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at $54. 

But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

"This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

In active trading, Nortel Networks soared $20.43 3/4 to $97.43 3/ 4, Cisco Systems rose $5.87 1/2 to $105.87 1/2, Ciena rose $11.87 1/ 2 to $57.75 and JDS Uniphase rose $30.18 3/4 to $179.93 3/4. 

Many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter &Gamble surged $8.62 1/2 to $116.50; Coca-Cola rose $3.75 to $60.75.

Economy grows again in December

U.S. employers ended 1999 on a hiring binge that kept unemployment at its lowest in three decades and triggered accelerating wage increases, signs that inflation could pick up as a fast-growing economy remains on track to set a longevity record in February. But the stock market Friday rebounded after a volatile week.

The economy added 315,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate stayed at 4.1 percent, the lowest since January 1970, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobs number topped November's gain of 222,000 and analysts' predictions of a 241,000 increase for last month. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent, more than the 0.1 percent increase in November and the 0.3 percent forecast.

The numbers suggest the economy grew at a 5 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, and provide momentum for a likely 3.8 percent expansion in 2000, said Rosanne Cahn, U.S. equity economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.

As the near-record expansion shows little sign of slowing and no evidence that it will stall any time, stocks soared on expectations of rising earnings. Investors shrugged off worries about inflation and a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 269.30, or 2.4 percent, to a new high of 11,522.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 155.49, or 4.2 percent. to 3,882.62.

Lucent's warning fails to scare off investors

Investors ignored Lucent Technologies Inc.'s warning that its fiscal first-quarter profit dropped and sales were unchanged, and instead bid its shares up $1.871/2 to $53.871/2 Friday.

In its first profit warning since its spinoff from AT&T Corp. in 1996, Lucent said that earnings in its quarter ended Dec. 31 were 36 cents to 39 cents a share. The company earned 48 cents in the year-ago period and was expected to have a first-quarter profit of 54 cents, the average estimate of analysts.

Lucent made the warning late Thursday, and its shares dropped in overnight trading.

The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1441.47. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the sell-off that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at 54. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 207/16 to 977/16, Cisco Systems rose 57/8 to 1057/8, Ciena rose 117/8 to 573/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 303/16 to 17915/16. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the nation's labor market remains strong. 

 Before the start of trading, the government reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting company profits. 

 Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter & Gamble surged 85/8 to 1161/2. 

 Also, Coca-Cola rose 33/4 to 603/4, Merck gained 69/16 to 7415/16 and Johnson & Johnson rose 315/16 to 961/2. 

 Those companies have thrived this week as investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999. But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Gannon. 

 "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the dominant players remained telecom and technology." 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, five stocks rose for every three that fell. 

 Composite volume totaled 1.49 billion shares, compared with 1.32 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 to 488.31. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. European indexes also bounced back sharply from their own declines this week.

 NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) - The Dow Jones industrial average continued to rise at the new high while the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index bounced back strongly Friday despite a profit warning from Lucent company and a strong job market report. 

 The Dow index closed up 269.30 at 11,522.56, surpassing the record closing high of 11,497.12 set on December 31, 1999. The index lost 499.19 points in the first two sessions this year. 

 The Nasdaq index rebounded to close up 155.49 at 3,882.62 after plunging 404.02 points, or nearly 10 percent in the previous three tradings. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 38.02 at 1,441.47. 

 The market surged as investors continued to buy the cyclical stocks in defiance of the government report on strong labor market. Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Merck and Johnson & Johnson led the Dow to the new record. 

 The Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December, suggesting that inflation pressure is mounting. 

 Investors also rushed into the market to buy technology stocks after a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from Lucent technology, maker of telecommunications equipment. Lucent said late Thursday that it missed earnings expectations in the final quarter of 1999. 

 Traders sold Lucent's stocks but bought shares from Lucent's rivals, such as Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems. 

 The NYSE index rose 14.87 at 642.41 and the American Stock Exchange index rose 6.00 at 863.76. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 at 488.31. 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 NYSE volume increased to 1.21 billion shares from 1.08 billion in the previous session.

 Mortgage rates started off 2000 by hitting their highest levels since last August amid fears that the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates higher next month. 

 The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 8.15 percent for the week ending Jan. 7, up from 8.06 percent last week, according to a weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 

 Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also were up this week with an average rate of 7.73 percent this week, up from the average rate of 7.66 percent last week. 

 Pratt hiring continues 

 United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney jet engine unit will hire 700 to 900 engineers over those currently moving from the military engine division in northwestern Palm Beach County to Connecticut, Pratt spokesman Mark Sullivan said on Thursday. 

 The move of the division and its engineers who accept jobs in Connecticut is scheduled for completion by year-end, said Tim Burris, Pratt's spokesman in Palm Beach County. 

 The additional engineers will be hired during the next two years. At the same time, Bloomberg News reported Pratt said it would cut manufacturing jobs because engine shipments will drop to fewer than 600 this year from 800 in 1998, the most recent year figures are available. 

 Lucent falls on profit warning

 Lucent Technologies, the world's largest phone-equipment maker, said its fiscal first-quarter profit fell and sales were little changed, sending its shares plummeting. It was Lucent's first profitwarning since being spun off from AT&T in 1996 and wiped out some $64 billion in market value. 

 Earnings were 36 cents to 39 cents a share for the quarter ended Dec. 31. That's down from 48 cents a year earlier and less than forecasts for 54 cents from First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Lucent cited shortages of its new products and less buying from phone companies and corporations than it counted on. 

 Profit also was squeezed by costs of developing and introducing equipment to compete with Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems, its two biggest rivals. 

 Lucent tumbled $20.38 to $52 after the warning. More than 9.2 million shares changed hands after the close of New York Stock Exchange trading, almost as many as traded on the NYSE. 

 Lehman profit quadruples 

 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit more than quadrupled, driven by a surge in trading revenue and gains in investment banking. 

 Lehman, the No. 4 U.S. securities firm, said net income for the three months ended Nov. 30 rose to $301 million, or $2.28 a share, from $74 million, or 51 cents a year ago. 

 The latest results beat Wall Street's average forecast of $1.97 a share. It was the fourth straight quarter Lehman beat analyst estimates. 

 Lehman shares, which slumped as much as 17 percent this week along with most financial company shares, rebounded $2.94 to $72.88. 

 Microsoft has book deal 

 Microsoft Corp., the largest software maker, said it formed an alliance with booksellers Barnes & Noble Inc. and Barnesandnoble.com Inc. to use its product for reading books on portable-computing devices. Terms weren't disclosed. 

 The companies will use Microsoft's Windows Reader software, used to read books downloaded to handheld electronic devices. 

 Chip sales expected to soar 

 Worldwide sales of semiconductors rose 18 percent in 1999 and will increase even faster this year on rapid growth in Internet use and mobile phones, according to Gartner Group Inc.'s Dataquest unit. 

 Semiconductor sales jumped to $160 billion in 1999 from $136 billion a year ago, the biggest gain since 1995. 

 No. 1 Intel Corp. dominated with sales of $26 billion, some $16 billion ahead of second-place NEC Corp. Motorola Inc., which had been No. 3 worldwide, fell to No. 6 after selling a chunk of its business.

Lucent stock drops 30% after predicting a profit slide

Lucent Technologies warned late Thursday that profits were disappointing near the end of 1999, discouraging news from a popular company that may hasten this week's rapid retreat from record highs by technology stocks. Lucent's shares plunged as much as 30 percent, most of it coming after the warning. 

Lucent, a former AT&T unit and a top supplier of Internet equipment, said in a statement it expects to report profits of 36 cents to 39 cents per share for the last three months of 1999. 

Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of about 54 cents a share for the period, the company's first quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

Lucent, which earned 48 cents per share in the final three months of 1998, plans to report its official earnings for the quarter on Jan. 20. 

Investors pummeled the company's stock after the announcement, which followed the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

Lucent had already fallen $3.38, to $69 a share, before the warning, and then tumbled as much as $13.38, to $50.63, in trading on other markets. 

The profit warning by Lucent, the most widely held stock in the nation, was sure to aggravate worries that high-flying technology and Internet shares won't be able to justify the huge gains made last year.

 SINGAPORE (MktNews) - U.S. Treasuries eased slightly early Friday in Asia while the market concentrates on world equity markets and the December jobs data report in the U.S. later, dealers said. 

 "The market is off to a slow start. But, it could pick up later depending how volatile the equity markets get," a dealer said. 

 He added that Treasury prices opened a touch lower on some early selling in the intermediate sector. 

 In the first hour of trading, the Nikkei 225 Index has moved slightly lower. 

 The other closely watched index in Asia, the Hang Seng (which fell over 4.30% Thursday and over 7.00% Wednesday) has not opened yet. 

 "If the equity markets stay calm, trading in the Treasuries is likely to be quiet due to the release of the U.S. jobs data," another dealer said. 

 A Market News International survey showed a median estimate for payrolls to increase by 240,00, an unchanged jobless rate of 4.1% with a 4.0% jump in hourly earnings. 

 The March long bond futures contract is higher early Friday. It has traded as high at 90 25/32 after closing in Chicago at 90 13/32. 

 "The March long bond contract has slipped off its highs as it gets back in line with the cash market," said a futures broker. 

 He added that in early after-hours trading there was a flurry of flight-to-quality buying tied to an expected drop in the U.S. stocks after Lucent Technologies issued a profit warning. -Alan Cooper (65) 835-6850, e-mail acooper@mktnews.com

 JAN HOPKINS, CNNfn ANCHOR, STREET SWEEP:  A wild day for trading in Lucent. Let`s go back to Rhonda Schaffler here on the floor of the Exchange. She`s with Robert Faigenson of Faigenson & Company -- Rhonda. Actually, I guess Rhonda is not standing by. There was so much action on Lucent that  it`s going to take a while until we find out what happened from the floor. 

 Let`s hear again from Bill Meehan, who is here with us and can tell us a little bit more. Lucent, the most trades ever for a stock here at the New York Stock Exchange. But if you look at the end of the day, Lucent shares are up, although down quite sharply from where they closed yesterday. All the damage was after-hours trading, right? 

 BILL MEEHAN, CANTOR FITZGERALD: Yes, apparently. I mean, I don`t know if anybody keeps track of record volume on Instinet, but if we didn`t have it last night we probably came darn close, because there was an awful lot of trading not only in Lucent, but in a lot of other technology stocks that were really getting hammered overnight. 

 HOPKINS: Now, it`s interesting that Lucent`s competitors actually did well, we saw how Nortel Networks did. The assumption is that Lucent`s problem is Lucent`s problem not an industry problem. Is that what you hear, too? 

 MEEHAN: Yes. All of the analysts that I heard today said it was a specific problem to Lucent and it meant probably that Nortel has picked up some market share because of Lucent`s inability to execute. 

 HOPKINS: Let`s, in fact, find out some more about that. Thanks, Bill Meehan. The investor side of the Lucent story, Greg Clarkin has been looking into it from our studios. Greg, what you can tell us? 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jan, it was an incredible day of trading for Lucent. You mentioned the volume. Now keep in mind, this is the most widely held stock in the country, better than 3 billion shares are outstanding, and the stock -- even though it`s not reflected -- if you look at New York trading today really did take a battering in after-hours trading, it ended up losing basically 25 percent of its value from where it closed yesterday just minutes before this news hit, which was at $69 a share. There you can see that the stock has done in one year, down 9 percent. 

 Now, today, in New York trading, Lucent, if you take a look at it, up 1 3/4, but keep in mind, again, it was trading at $69 even right before this news hit. Look at the level now: 53 3/4. And here`s what some of the competitors did today, they tacked on gains. Again, the feeling is that some of these companies are taking market share from Lucent and supplying telecommunications companies and Internet service providers with the equipment to move large volumes of data and voice traffic. 

 Now, Cisco (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) and NorTel (URL: http://www.nortelnetworks.com/) -- you saw those are two of the big gainers today -- they immediately came out with statements overnight saying that their business is good. So they basically moved to stem off any kind of spill-over effect and they were successful in that. Those stocks, as well as some of other competitors in that arena all moved higher today in the overall tech rally. So, again, the feeling is this is confined to Lucent and there is a feeling that it will probably take a couple of quarters before Lucent comes out of this really stunning profit warning. 

 Jan, back to you. 

 HOPKINS: The problem is not that the orders aren`t out there, it`s the problem that Lucent can`t deliver. 

 CLARKIN: Exactly. That is part of the problem. Also, they say, the company admitting that basically they misgauged shifting patterns from their clients, shifting ordering patterns from their clients, so that is part of the problem. And on top of that, they apparently can`t keep up with some of the red-hot demand for some of their more popular products. 

 HOPKINS: And that is just as bad as not having the demand. 

 CLARKIN: Exactly, Jan. If you can`t fill the orders, what good is it? 

 HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Greg Clarkin.

 Olympic Group Grants Three New Licensees 

 Three new licensees have been signed by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, bringing to 25 the number of companies authorized to manufacture and sell products relating to the 2002 Winter Olympics. 

 The newest additions are CRA Knitwear Ltd., which knits and sells wool sweaters under the "Thomas Keeling" label; HB Group, a Draper company that makes silk ties and writing instruments; and Lodge Manufacturing Co., which produces Dutch ovens and cast-iron skillet spoon rests. 

 SLOC licensees have the right to use Olympic-related designations on products sold in retail markets. The Organizing Committee receives an advance royalty and quarterly payments, based on the quantity of product sold at wholesale value, in exchange for the right to use trademarked logos and terminology. 

 "All of our licensees represent more than $18 million in guaranteed royalties to date," said Mark Lewis, SLOC vice president of marketing and licensing. "We are actively engaged in negotiations with a number of potential licensees." 

 Gateway Stock Falls 4% 

 Gateway Inc. shares fell 4 percent Thursday after the No. 2 direct seller of personal computers said fourth-quarter earnings will be below analysts' estimates as chip shortages and Year 2000 concerns reduced sales, Bloomberg News reported. 

 Gateway dropped $2.56 to $59.69 in trading of 4.57 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The company issued its profit warning Wednesday after the close of the NYSE, sending its shares as low as $55 on electronic exchanges. 

 Gateway expects profit of 42 cents a share excluding a charge. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected 49 cents on average. Revenue will be about $2.45 billion, an increase of 6 percent from a year earlier. Gateway blamed a shortage of Intel Corp. microprocessors and reduced buying as companies cut back purchases prior to 2000 to avoid potential computer breakdowns. 

 The chip shortage "is probably a near-term issue," said Frost Securities analyst Cody Acree, who follows the industry. "These shortages are likely to crop up from time to time over the next few quarters because we're looking at a solid economic environment and a tight-demand market." 

 The supply of chips that run computers "was severely constrained, spotty and unreliable," particularly for PCs costing $999 to $1,299, Gateway said. The shortages, which began in October, resulted in $200 million to $250 million in lost revenue, the company said. 

 Energy Grants Available 

 The Department of Energy's Office of Industrial Technology  is requesting proposals from manufacturers interested in studying ways to save energy and reduce waste. 

 The office plans to award as much as $100,000 each to 10 companies nationwide to help them study energy-saving and waste-reducing strategies that they can implement. Companies must contribute at least 50 percent of the cost of the project. 

 The Utah Industries of the Future, which administers a new statewide industrial energy efficiency and pollution prevention program, is accepting the proposals from Utah companies. The deadline is April 3. The contact is Patti Case at (801) 278-1927, or plcase@etcgrp.com.

 Lucent's Drop Felt Far And Wide, Lops $54 Billion Off Market Cap

 LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Whew! Now that's a haircut. 

 The 25% overnight drop in shares of Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) lopped $54.4 billion off of its market capitalization, or total market value, according to Jim Bohart, an analyst at Birinyi Associates in Westport, Conn. 

 At Friday's NYSE open, Lucent's total market value was $162.6 billion, down from $217 billion at Thursday's 4 p.m. EST close, Bohart said. That's $54.4 billion in value wiped out of the millions of mutual funds, institutional portfolios and individual accounts that hold Lucent's 3 billion shares. 

 Lucent, one of America's most widely held stocks, opened Friday at 51 3/4 on the NYSE, following an earnings warning late Thursday. Recently it was trading at 53 3/16, down 23% from Thursday's 4 p.m. close of 69 1/16 on NYSE. 

 Lucent's NYSE volume of 124 million shares has eclipsed the previous NYSE record of 103.8 million set by Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) in June 1988. Its composite volume of 164 million Friday is approaching the overall stock-market volume record of 171.8 million set by Oracle Corp. (ORCL) on Dec. 9, 1997. Oracle trades on Nasdaq. 

 Lucent, a Murray Hill, N.J., communications-equipment company spun off from AT&T Corp. (T) several years ago, is one of the 10 most widely held stocks in accounts at Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest stock broker. Its blow-up is the worst, in terms of overall market-capitalization loss, in recent market history. 

 By comparison, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), another stock on Merrill Lynch's list, lost about $28 billion in market value, a 15% hit, when it issued a profit warning in October, Bohart said. 

 Xerox Corp. (XRX), which issued a profit warning in December, lost 24% of its value, but that only totaled $6 billion. Xerox isn't among Merrill's most widely held stocks. 

 Despite the size of Lucent's price decline, it won't have any impact at all on the so-called wealth effect that's been fueling consumer spending in recent years, said Dr. William C. Freund, director of the Center for the Study of Equity Markets at PACE University in New York. "The reason is the U.S. economy is so large, we're talking personal spending by consumers of over $6 trillion," Freund said. 


For every dollar of capital gains, consumers increase spending by a
nickel, Freund said. "If the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 30%,
it would have a perceptible impact, there's no doubt about that. It
would have a massive wealth effect, but not Lucent."

 Acquisition to Enable Nortel to Expand High-Speed Internet Access

 Nortel Networks announced Thursday it plans to acquire Promatory Communications of Fremont for an estimated $778 million, making it the phone-equipment maker's fourth Silicon Valley acquisition in 18 months. 

 Nortel officials said Promatory's product, a device that lets existing copper phone lines carry multiple voice, data and video feeds as much as 150 times faster than what today's modems receive, will give it an edge in the race to deliver high-speed Internet access. 

 Nortel's move comes at a time when phone companies are looking to equipment makers like Nortel and Lucent to provide lightning-speed Internet access over phone lines as cable companies rush in to offer Internet access using cable networks. 

 "This is almost like a telephone company's nirvana," said Kathie Hackler, Dataquest's principal analyst for remote access. "They're able to take copper lines lying there for many years, use it to offer more services and drive revenues." 

 Promatory's product, Intelligent Multiservice Access System, will be combined with Nortel's current offerings to help make Ontario, Canada-based Nortel competitive with Lucent Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., which already have similar products. 

 Promatory's system makes it possible to turn one phone line into as many as 16 separate lines that businesses and consumers can use. Analysts and Nortel said they expected Promatory's and other similar products will lower the costs of high-speed Internet access through digital subscriber line technology. 

 Nortel will pay about $705 million in stock for the private, venture capital-backed Promatory. If the business meets certain financial targets this year, Nortel will pay an $73 million more in stock. 

 Promatory, which was founded three years ago, logged $1 million in sales but lost money in 1999, although company president Roger Dorf declined to say how much. 

 The deal is expected to close in the next couple of months, Nortel officials said. Shares of Nortel stock fell $4.88, closing at $85. In after-hours trading, the stock plummeted to $77 after Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's largest phone-equipment maker, issued its first profit warning since being spun off from AT&T Corp. in 1996. Lucent's stock also fell sharply, down $4 to $69 at the 1 p.m. market close. 

 Promatory will become a Nortel business unit, and Dorf will be its vice president. Nortel officials say they plan to add workers to Promatory's current roster of 100 employees and move them to a bigger building. Nortel said it expected Promatory's business to grow as much as three times larger over the next year. 

 "2000 is going to be the big year for high-speed Internet access," said Steve Schilling, Nortel's president of Access Networks. 

 During the middle of 1999, there were about 160,000 DSL lines in the country. Within six months, that number exploded to 600,000, according to research firm Dataquest Inc. Nortel estimates sales of DSL equipment will grow to $4 billion by 2003 from $103 million in 1999. 

 Analysts agreed Wednesday the acquisition was a good move for both companies. 

 "This is a next-generation DSL product, the kind people are going to be looking at to expand the market," Hackler said. "Nortel really needed something that was next-generation. This puts them on equal footing with their Lucent and Cisco." 

 Nortel's Schilling says the company will continue its acquisition streak as long as the Internet "continues to ramp." Last month, it agreed to acquire fiber-optic maker Qtera Corp., for $3.25 billion. In early fall, it bought software maker Clarify Inc. for $2.1 billion. In August 1998, it purchased Bay Networks Inc. for $6.9 billion.

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN ANCHOR:  The U.S. jobless rate holds steady. What does that mean for investors?  Plus, we`ll talk live with Labor Secretary Herman about the job market. 

 BILL TUCKER, CNN ANCHOR:  This morning`s other top story: Lucent. The telecom equipment maker dialing up a wrong number on Wall Street after a surprise profit warning. 

 KEENAN:  Plus, do you like the look of 3Com?  It`s one of our stocks under review.  We`ll talk live with the company`s CEO and see if we should keep it in the IN THE MONEY portfolio. 

 ANNOUNCER:  From CNN and CNNfn, this is IN THE MONEY with Terry Keenan, Bill Tucker and Daryn Kagan. 

 TUCKER:  Good morning everyone, and welcome to IN THE MONEY.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 KEENAN:  And hello from me as well, I`m Terry Keenan.  Daryn Kagan has the day off. 

 And it is finally Friday, many investors are saying "thank God" after the week that we have had in this market.  Today, a much-needed rally from both the Dow and the Nasdaq.  We`re going to have team coverage of all of the news that has put investors in a better mood today. 

 TUCKER:  We are also going to get up close and personal with a look at what is wrong with Lucent, the company is one of the most widely held in the nation, it is cratering this morning in extremely heavy volume. 

 KEENAN:  And we are also waiting for the family of young Elian Gonzalez to make a statement in Miami.  We will bring you that live as it happens. 

 But first let`s get you up to speed on all the action on Wall Street right now.  We, of course, are 90 minutes into the trading day, and we are at our highs on the Dow, approaching almost record levels, up 188 points.  Merck one of the standouts there, that stock is up $5 a share. International Paper is also strong, Merrill Lynch very high on the paper stock today, and this continues the move that we have seen into the basic boring names, some of the money coming out of those high-flying Nasdaq stocks. 

 But today money pouring into the Nasdaq as well, we are back above 3800, with a gain of 84 points.  That of course reversing a bit of yesterday`s 150 point decline. 

 TUCKER:  And there are a lot more advancing stocks than declining stocks today in the action. 

 Look at the bond, the bond is coming down 12/32 is price.  That has brought the yield up to 6.58.  Part of the reason for that is a very strong unemployment report that came out today, and we`ll have more on that story in just a moment. 

 But first, the big story of the day and that is the market rally. You have seen the numbers.  Let`s head right straight down into the center of all this action and to Rhonda Schaffler. 

 Rhonda, good morning. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you. 

 Well, a real amazing rally, once again, for the Dow Jones industrial average, considering what the market was doing on Tuesday, when the Dow was plunging.  But we have seen a continuation since then of people jumping into these Dow stocks.  Today, of course, we have got the whole market moving higher, with the Nasdaq up, but some huge moves for some of these Dow stocks. 

 I am going to take a look at a few of the components in the Dow and show you how the numbers are faring.  As far as where the leadership is coming from today, it is coming from stocks like Hewlett-Packard, that stock is currently up $4.  It was not one of the better performers yesterday. 

 Proctor & Gamble is up another nearly 6 1/2.  Yesterday, Prudential made some upbeat comments about Procter & Gamble, raised the rating on the company to a strong buy. 

 Caterpillar, it is up 2 11/16.  Also some upbeat comments about the sector in general this week.  Pharmaceutical stocks like Johnson & Johnson moving higher, up 4 1/4, and Dupont is up $2, that is another stock there where some upbeat comments made on a couple of days ago. 

 Basically, the overall theme here is that people who are worried about what the techs were up to, and the valuations there, started looking around at stocks where there is some perceived value.  The stocks haven`t run up as much as the techs, and also because a lot of these stocks are economically sensitive, the U.S. economy is still growing, as we found out today, so are economies elsewhere in the world, so people are buying the stocks that would supply those countries the products. That`s why stocks like Caterpillar and Dupont are doing well -- Terry, Bill. 

 KEENAN:  And Rhonda, it is almost a mirror-image of what we saw the last few of December, where this week we would see the Dow grabbing the headlines and going up, and a lot of the money coming out of those Nasdaq stocks, as the Nasdaq went down and approached that 10 percent correction. 

 SCHAFFLER:  That`s right.  I mean, there is clearly some portfolio reshuffling going on, we are hearing that on the floor. People made a lot of money in these technology stocks, and they are a little nervous because of the selling. 

 So what they are doing instead is taking some of that money and putting it into these stocks, many of them have really lagged behind the overall market, Dot.Dull, you got to love that one.  Very cute, I`m very impressed by that.  And you can it is straight up.  I mean, the Dow, at this point, you know, really is only about 60 points away from record territory, which is amazing when you think of where that Dow had been, you know, earlier on the week. 

 TUCKER:  Equally amazing, Rhonda, as well as the fact that Caterpillar is the leading Dow stock of the year 2000, up 9.7 percent. Thanks very much, Rhonda. 

 KEENAN:  You know some of the analysts and traders I have talked to are really impressed by the orderly way we`ve seen this reversal, and say it is very healthy.  And of course, we are going to be talking to Jonathan Cohen about that in just a couple of minutes. 

 TUCKER:  We`ll find out how healthy he think this is in a couple of minutes. 

 KEENAN:  Yeah, right, he follows the tech stocks. 

 OK, one of the most widely held stocks, of course, is Lucent Technologies.  It also trades on the Big Board, and its shares have taken a beating since they closed yesterday at $69 a share.  Lucent getting hit with a rash of analysts` downgrades at this hour after warning the Street late yesterday that its first quarter would be a disappointment. 

 Our tech correspondent Bruce Francis has been following this story since it broke last night, and he has the latest on the telecom equipment giant. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Lucent`s perfect track record on earnings is now shattered, along with the belief that the fast-growing telecommunications sector is bullet-proof.  Lucent says it will now report first-quarter earnings of 36 to 39 cents a share, down from an estimated 54 cents. 

 In a statement, Lucent CEO Richard McGinn said that, "We are clearly disappointed with the results for the quarter.  We still expect our revenues to continue to grow three to five percentage points faster than the overall communications networking market." 

 Analysts were shocked by the magnitude of the shortfall in Lucent`s revenue.  The company is now projecting that it will take in as little as $9.8 billion, $1.5 billion less than expected.      PAUL SILVERSTEIN, ROBERTSON STEPHENS:  This was a big miss, absolutely.  And on top of the long road of success the company`s had since 1996, absolutely, this was a blindside. 

 FRANCIS:  Lucent blamed its problems on a shift to new products that it couldn`t manufacture fast enough, while customers slacked off on orders for the old.  Customers were slower deploying new equipment. Some analysts blame Y2K.  And it cited lower software revenues, as customers buy more evenly throughout the year, not just at the end. 

 Lucent`s stock peaked in mid-December, before many tech stocks. Since then, even before this earnings shocker, Lucent shares had fallen 18 percent. 

 ROBERT WILKES, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN:  Lucent remains one of the world-class technology companies, and I think that they have enough new products coming out that customers will be wanting to buy. And the telecommunications equipment marketplace should remain one which will grow at roughly the 14 percent rate that Lucent`s expecting it to achieve over the next several years. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS:  Now right after Lucent made that report, about a couple of hours after, both Cisco and Nortel came out and said:  Well, we are just fine, thank you very much, during the quarter.  And that seems to be lifting the shares of a lot of the stocks in the sector, those that compete with Lucent and those that also supply it. 

 Let`s take a look at how some of those are trading.  Even stocks like you see JDS Uniphase, Lucent accounts for almost a quarter of their business, it is up because of the overall strength in the telecommunications sector.  As you can see, it is up across-the-board, and strongly so, Cisco, Nortel, Ciena and SDL all up sharply this morning. 

 So, Terry and Bill, there is a lot of belief in this sector and a lot of believe that the problems that Lucent were talking about last night are Lucent`s alone. 

 TUCKER:  That would definitely seem to be the verdict of the market. Thank you very much, Bruce Francis, reporting on this one for us. 

 KEENAN:  OK, joining us here in the studio to talk more about Lucent and of course this week`s entire tech sell-off is Wit Capital`s Jonathan Cohen. 

 Jonathan, welcome. 

 JONATHAN COHEN, WIT CAPITAL:  Hi, Terry. 

 KEENAN:  It is amazing, I mean, if there was a bellwether stock aside from Cisco of this tech market, it would be Lucent.  And they disappointed, they disappointed badly, and the rest of the market has not reacted.      COHEN:  The market is absolutely shrugging it off.  I think the take away is that, exactly as Bruce was saying, the market is perceiving this as something that is totally specific to Lucent, it is not factor for the rest of the telecommunications marketplace, and moreover, and more to the point, it is not a factor at all for the rest of the technology space.  So investors are taking some comfort in that this morning. 

 TUCKER:  Well, it is very interesting because this is something unusual and a shift from a pattern in the past.  I think a few months ago we would have expected to see the entire group get hit. 

 COHEN:  Absolutely. 

 TUCKER:  Today they are very surgical about the strike. 

 COHEN:  They are being surgical and they are being fairly sophisticated in terms of how they are looking at technology stocks in general this morning.  I think a large part of that was, as Bruce said, the rest of the world stood up this morning and said:  It is not our problem, it is not our fault, our quarters look great.  And the market is taking that to heart, the market is saying:  Right, this is something that is very narrowly defined.  And if you look at the rest of technology, we are seeing actually something of mini rally this morning back from the last several days. 

 KEENAN:  Put this week in perspective for investors, because it has been a rocky one, and we were down 9.8 percent on the Nasdaq at one point yesterday; is that it? 

 COHEN:  It may or may not be it.  I mean, it is certainly not the end of the volatility for year 2000.  I think what we are going to see -- This actually sets a fairly interesting pattern for the rest of the first half, which is investors rush to sell-off, and then they very, very quickly much, much more quickly than they have in the past start bargain-hunting, saying OK, we`ve got a stock down 20 or 25 percent in a very short period of time, in the Internet space let`s say, let`s take a position, let`s add to a position, let`s average down. 

 KEENAN:  So everything is compressed. 

 COHEN:  Time frames are enormously compressed relative to where they were even six or nine months ago.  The investor population has gotten vastly more sophisticated about buying and holding and even selling technology stocks, and that`s playing out in these kinds of --normally what we`ve seen over the last three or four days would have taken a month or so to ferment and to play out in the equity market. It`s happening very quickly now. 

 TUCKER:  OK, you`re here, we can`t let you get out of here without you giving us a couple of names that you like in the market. 

 COHEN:  Right.  Absolutely.  As you know, we focus on the Internet sector, so Internet stocks are really -- are really where we`ve been spending all of our time.  We think there`s some interesting opportunities in the marketplace this -- today.  Exodus Communications we launched coverage on, this morning. 

 TUCKER:  That`s the B-to-B -- the business-to-business sector. 

 COHEN:  Exactly.  And specific Web hosting, which is growing at an enormous rate of speed.  There are tremendous opportunities in that marketplace.  This stock is a stock that`s done incredibly well already, but we think there`s more to it.  Our analyst, Marlo Berk (ph) launched coverage, this morning, with a buy recommendation. We`re looking for at least 30 percent upside from current levels for Exodus. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks, Jonathan.  Have a good weekend. 

 COHEN:  Thanks very much.  Take care. 

 KEENAN:  Jonathan Cohen, Wit Capital. 

 TUCKER:  The Street is poring over the latest employment picture as well.  The U.S. jobless rate held steady in December at 4.1 percent, and our Kelly Arena is standing by live in Washington with the latest. 

 Kelly, take it away. 

 KELLY ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Bill, as you said, the unemployment rate did hold steady.  It`s at a 30-year low, that 4.1 percent.  Very strong job growth; 315,000 new jobs were created.  That is the biggest gain since July.  Now, for the year, employers added 2.7 million jobs.  What`s more, average hourly earnings rose six cents in December to $13.46. 

 Those are the headlines, Bill, evidence here of a very strong economy and still a very tight labor market. 

 TUCKER:  You know, a lot of concerns, this morning, in particular about that wage growth that we saw in December, $13.46 now the average hourly wage, I believe? 

 ARENA:  That`s right.  For the year, that -- which is what economists look at, the rate of growth in wages has been 3.7 percent. Now, to put that in perspective, in 1998 we had wage growth of 3.8 percent.  So while that was a little upsetting, it`s still very much in line with what economists were expecting overall, and we don`t really have serious signs of inflation in the wage market just yet, but the potential for it is there, because we are running out of workers, plain and simple.  With the labor market this tight, the only way to attract workers is to offer them more money, more benefits, which is inflation, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  All right, terrific.  Thanks, Kelly. 

 KEENAN:  And joining us now from the Labor Department is Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 

 And welcome to IN THE MONEY.  Great to have you with us. 

 We`ve just heard Kelly Arena saying that this economy is running out of workers.  Are we indeed at -- finally at full employment? 

 ALEXIS HERMAN, LABOR SECRETARY:  No, we are not at full employment, because we have to continue to distinguish between a worker shortage and a skill shortage in this country.  We don`t have a worker shortage, but we do have a skill shortage.  Let`s not forget, not only do we have six million who comprise the ranks of the unemployment today. 

 But there`s another number that I pay attention to, and that`s the more-than-four-million workers who say they want to work, they`d be available for work in this labor market were it not for issues like child care and transportation.  So what we have to do is to also to concentrate on policies, as we are doing, to lower those labor market barriers so that they, too, will be available for work.  Then you`re looking at a potential supply literally of 10 million workers to continue to fuel this economy. 

 TUCKER:  What`s the private sector`s role in all of this?  It seems to me that if these companies need the workers they probably ought to pony up with the benefits that are necessary to attract the workers. 

 HERMAN:  And the good news is that more and more enlightened employers understand this issue, and they are providing more family-friendly policies like child care, after-school care, all kinds of new arrangements.  Some companies are even looking at the question today of elder care.  There`s an interesting agreement with the automotive industry, with the UAW unions, for instance, where they have a whole series of around-the-clock care packages for their workers.  Those are the kinds of policies that we`re going to have to pursue in the future to attract more worker into this labor market.  I`m very encouraged by what I see employers doing in the main on this front, today. 

 KEENAN:  And speaking of the auto industry, the manufacturing sector has been losing jobs in 1999.  Do you see any reason for that trend to reverse itself in the year 2000? 

 HERMAN:  Well, I think fortunately in this report we hopefully are finally seeing some stabilization in manufacturing.  For the last two months, we have actually seen steady state.  Compare that to the first six months of this year, when we were actually losing on average about 36,000 jobs.  So, it`s a big change from the beginning of the year and where we`ve ended up at the end of the year.  I hope it bodes well for us as we now go into the year 2000. 

 TUCKER:  Secretary Herman we got an e-mail here at IN THE MONEY, someone realizing you were coming on the show, so we thought we`d put it to you rather than answer it directly.  And they want to know why is it "when you talk about income is refereed as the non-farm income. Are we as farmers substandard as employers or what," and that`s a question that Gary Morgan, clearly a farmer, raises today. 

 HERMAN:  Definitely farmers are not substandard.  It`s simply the way we keep the data.  We track non-farm payroll data differently from the data that we keep in terms of the agriculture sector.      And it`s an interesting change, actually, in the way we look at the whole nature of the workplace, today, because, you know, as we go into the 21st century it used to be that we were one-third manufacturing, one-third agriculture and one-third services sector, and so we kept up with the data in a very different way.  Today, as we go into the 21st century, we are actually only three-percent agriculture, we are about 23 percent in terms of the manufacturing sector and 74 percent when it comes to services today, so it`s a very different labor market. 

 And so we keep up with the data very differently today. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you very much, and we appreciate you spending some time with us, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, joining us from Washington. 

 TUCKER:  Thank you. 

 Coming up on IN THE MONEY:  A collective sigh of relief can be heard from the markets, this morning.  We`ll take you behind the big bounce back on Wall Street. 

 KEENAN:  Plus, taking to the streets for Elian:  The fate of a young Cuban boy mobilizes south Florida`s Cuban community.  We`re going to have a live report.  IN THE MONEY will be right back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Time for this morning`s "Wake-up Call."  If you`re in the market for a new job, you might want to strike while the iron is hot in New York, Green Bay, New Orleans and Foxboro.  Check this out: help wanted, full-time NFL head coach.  Knowledge of football is a plus. Good people skills helpful but not necessary.  Travel is required.  Four positions available.  Starting salary about $2 million.  There is, however, no job security.  Serious inquiries only please. 

 KEENAN:  One job I`m certainly not qualified for. 

 Second "Wake-up Call" this morning goes out to all of you accountants. PricewaterhouseCoopers is dismissing five of its partners due to ethical violations.  The partners guilty of investing in the companies where Pricewaterhouse was responsible for auditing the books.  That`s a clear conflict of interest.  But those five only the worst offenders.  A survey of the Pricewaterhouse ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission found that 31 of the 43 partners had committed at least one violation, including six of the 11 charged with enforcing ethical standards. 

 OK, taking a look at some of our other news headlines, today. The case of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez is far from over.  The White House and the Justice Department say that they won`t intervene in the INS decision to return the little boy to Cuba, but Congress might get into the fray. 

 For that, let`s go to CNN`s congressional correspondent, Bob Franken, on Capitol Hill for the latest. 

 Hello, Bob. 

 BOB FRANKEN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Terry.  And "might" is the operative word right here.  The chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, Dan Burton, who is renowned as an enemy of the Castro regime, still must consider whether to honor the request from several Republican members of Congress from Florida to subpoena the young man in an effort -- they are very, very opened about this -- to stall his return to Cuba. 

 The reason is his particular committee is the only one that can, under these circumstances, issue a subpoena.  There is a tradition that if somebody is subpoenaed to appear before Congress, that person is not allowed, usually, to leave the United States.  The reason would be so those members of Congress could, in fact, come back when the Congress reconvenes and introduce legislation to either provide him permanent citizenship or permanent resident status. 

 The 6-year-old boy will have legislation presented on his behalf by Florida Senate Republican Connie Mack, various Miami-area members of Congress, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, others who are taking his cause right now.  And the reason that we haven`t gotten the decision from Congressman Burton about whether or not he will subpoena the boy is because the lawyers in his committee say they don`t know what the legalities are.  They don`t know if, in fact, this would provide the ability to keep the child in the country. 

 So they`re exploring that right now, they`re having no comment on the matter.  Congressman Burton is deferring comment for the moment until he can find out whether he has the power, and then would have to decide whether the subpoena would be issued. 

 But there is an effort that`s being coordinated now with Senate and House Republican leaders and other members of Congress from the Miami area to try and stall the return of the young man. 

 Bob Franken, CNN, live on Capitol Hill. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you very much, Bob. 

 Well, after a night of angry demonstrations, more protesters are expected today in Miami over the decision to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba. 

 And CNN`s Mark Potter joins us now from Miami with the latest from there -- Mark. 

 MARK POTTER, CNN ANCHOR:  Well, Terry, actually, right now, it`s very quiet in the city of Miami.  Extra police are on patrol throughout the city, but we`re being told that they are reporting no incidents at all. 

 We`re at the house of Little Havana where Elian Gonzalez has been staying with his relatives.  We`re expecting an announcement in about an hour or so.  We`re told by the police department that a family spokesman or a family member is expected to urge the community to remain calm. They came out and made a statement like that yesterday. We hear they`re going to repeat that today. 

 Now, earlier today, we did see the 6-year-old boy, Elian Gonzalez, playing in the yard with his dog with his great uncle. Indirectly, he has been affected by all this commotion.  He was supposed to go to school today, but family members have kept him back, kept him at home, and we are told that`s for his safety. 

 Overnight, there were a number of protests throughout the city. Around midnight, some 50 officers used tear gas to disperse a crowd of about 100 people.  Throughout the day, demonstrators blocked intersections, they blocked traffic, and the idea was to draw attention to their position that Elian should not go back to Cuba. 

 Now, yesterday afternoon, a rally in downtown Miami got out of hand. Protesters broke through barricades, they broke through the police lines and then walked several blocks to the Port of Miami where they sat down in the middle of Biscayne Boulevard, again clogging traffic, and the police in about an hour got that situation under control, and they made a number of arrests.  But we`re told that, all total yesterday, about 100 people or so were arrested. 

 We`re also told that the exile groups, the political groups, are meeting in Miami right now to decide what, if anything, they`re going to do today.  The lawyers are also meeting, preparing the paperwork that we are expecting them to file as they make their attempt to keep Elian from going back to Cuba. 

 Mark Potter, CNN, reporting live from Miami. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you, Mark. 

 Well, despite the recommendation by U.S. immigration authorities that Elian Gonzalez be returned to Cuba, the government of the communist island is urging its citizens to keep up their demonstrations to ensure the boy`s return.  Cuban President Fidel Castro among those attending a rally yesterday in Havana.  The Castro government says nothing is certain because the boy`s relatives in Miami are fighting to keep him in the U.S. 

 OK, straight ahead on IN THE MONEY, eBay is attracting attention today on Wall Street.  It`s stock is down more than $4.  We`re going to take a closer look at eBay and the damage to the other dot.coms. Andy Serwer will be here when we return. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  All right, a rally to end the week on Wall Street, the Dow up 142 points, Dow stocks in growing favor of investors; so are tech stocks today, closing out the week with a modest rally there, at least for the moment.  The Nasdaq is up 69 points. 

 Well, as of yesterday, the Nasdaq was down almost 10 percent since trading began this year, and according to many, that would make it a correction.      KEENAN:  But if you`re invested in techs, you`re going to be feeling a lot better this morning. 

 Let`s go back to the Nasdaq and bring in Sasha Salama. 

 And, Sasha, a lot of people thought we were going to be down this morning, but a nice reversal. 

 SASHA SALAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  That`s right.  We started out down, Terry and Bill, and then we saw some bargain hunting kick in. You mentioned that near-10-percent drop:  Well, a lot of analysts didn`t expect that to happen, and a lot of them telling me that some values are out there, which is why we are seeing this reversal to the upside in fortunes. 

 Bunch of interesting stocks moving higher today, but one that`s moving lower is Applied Materials; we`ll start with that.  It`s down 3 percent. Applied Materials is the number-one maker of chip equipment, and the story here is many analysts are expecting that the company won`t deliver the earnings surprise in the first quarter that it usually does.  But SG Cowen says no need to worry:  Future orders here are very strong.  Even if there is an earnings hiccup, it will be just that, a hiccup in the bigger picture. 

 Ericsson up a nice 8 percent, the maker of mobile phones getting positive comments from Credit Suisse First Boston.  Subscriber growth is strong and the wireless business at Ericsson is in solid shape. Apparently Lucent`s problems with wireless, which it said was flat, unique to Lucent. 

 Moving on, Splitrock up 24 percent to about 27 1/2; SPLT the symbol here.  That`s about $3 shy of a buy-out that it got from a company called McLeod.  McLeod is a telecom provider, Splitrock is in data services, so, together, it`s a $2.1 billion deal in stock and debt -- Bill and Terry. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Sasha, thanks very much. 

 KEENAN:  Well, as we`ve been discussing throughout the show, there has been a move by investors from the more risky technology stocks into some of the more stable industrial names in the last couple of days. 

 KEENAN:  And "Fortune"`s editor Andy Serwer is here to run through the dot.com damage to some of last year`s high flyers. 

 And it`s been a quick take-away. 

 ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, "FORTUNE" MAGAZINE:  A quick punch, some of these Internet stocks are taking.  Overall, the Internet index like the Dow Internet index is down about 10 percent, which matches the Nasdaq, Terry, as you said.  Some of the dot.coms are down more than that, though.  We`ve got a bunch of them here that are down over 20 percent:  BroadVision, DoubleClick -- here we go -- Open Market, VeriSign and Lycos.      And I was talking to people:  Well, what`s the common denominator here?  It`s sort of not readily apparent, doesn`t jump out at you. They`re sort of in different businesses, but there are a couple things.  First of all, a lot of them are way up for the year, right? You can see here, obviously, BroadVision up 1500 percent, VeriSign huge.  And, you know, so what we had here, of course, is some profit taking in January.  You didn`t want to do it in December, you want to defer your taxes.  So people that were selling them in January, then, are looking for new names to jump on.  And, for instance, VeriSign, you know, had a real good fundamental story, but then it just sort of spun out of control as momentum players got in. 

 Second common denominator, not at lot of retail presence in these stocks, Terry, so it`s not your Yahoo!s, your Amazons, your AOLs; not as familiar to people.  And a lot of them are what you call first movers in their space -- in sort of business-to-business space. 

 DoubleClick, let`s take a look at that one for instance.  You know, it is in the ad business -- Internet as business, just like 24/7, but it has a huge premium over 24/7, so some people were selling out of DoubleClick and moving into 24/7.  So you know, 20 percent looks like a lot, obviously, but with these kind of stocks, I mean, anything is fair game, right? 

 KEENAN:  It has been pretty orderly. 

 SERWER:  Yes, actually, it has.  And you know, we will see as things sort of calm down maybe over the next couple of days. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks, Andy. 

 TUCKER:  Thanks, Andy.  Coming up on IN THE MONEY:  Viva Las Vegas, that is where the excitement is for the folks who love gadgets and gizmos, and we will take you there live. 

 KEENAN:  Plus, the company that brought you the Palm Pilot is also there, but 3Com`s stock hasn`t been pressing all the right buttons of late.  We`re going to talk with company`s CEO, and we are going to ask you to decide whether 3Com stays in our IN THE MONEY portfolio.  Get ready to vote. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  OK, we want to take you down to Miami, where a press conference is under way, the family of little 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has just started talking,  Let`s listen in. 

 (JOINED IN PROGRESS) 

 RAMON SAUL SANCHEZ, GONZALEZ FAMILY SPOKESMAN:  ... traffic has slowed down.  Tomorrow at 12:00 noon everybody is being called to go to the Cuban prisoner`s house, which is located on 13th Avenue, Southwest and 9 Street.  And also on Monday, we are calling for everyone to drive with their vehicles throughout the whole day through the Miami International Airport in order to slow down the airport and even bring it to a halt, if necessary.      Today, throughout the day, we are pending to receive news from the attorneys regarding a process, a petition that they are going to file today in court. 

 There are rumors that the president of the United States might, at this point, be reconsidering his decision.  These are only rumors, of course, but we think it would be a very wise decision for the president and a very sensitive one for him to turn around this sad decision that the Immigration Department has made, and allow Elian to have his day in court. 

 QUESTION:  With these protests, why are you doing this? 

 SANCHEZ:  What we are asking for is for the president of the United States to allow Elian to have his day in court.  If even the worst criminal gets a chance to be in court, why not this innocent boy whose mother lost her life to see him free?  We do not understand why the president has refused to allow this very American concept of a person having his day in court, only a family court can do a better determination of the best interests of the child and who should have custody of the child, only a family court can do that.  And we are asking for the president to allow that. 

 Castro has put up a smoke curtain with the case of Elian to divert the attention that all the media and the international community had placed in internal dissident moment after the Ibero-American Summit so that it concentrates in an outside conflict with the United States so that he can crush the dissident movement, as he`s doing right now, this very moment. 

 Since this whole process of Elian began, he has incarcerated over 270 dissidents in the island.  He`s putting up the smoke curtain just like he did when Concilio Cubano was going to meet and then he shot down the Brothers to the Rescue plane. 

 So what we are asking for the president of the United States to do is what any American and the best traditions of this nation should be asking, for the civil rights of Elian to be respected, for him to have his day in court. 

 If a family court decides that the best interests of the child will be served by being with his father after having his father out of Cuba, not being coerced by a dictator sitting right next to him, perhaps making him say what he`s saying right now, but freely saying that he wants the child in Cuba, then we will step back and let the court system decide. 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 SANCHEZ:  We believe that any father love and want his son or his daughter.  We also believe that, because of the nature of the Cuban regime and the manipulations from the beginning of all of this process, the father might be under duress, he might be forced to do what he`s doing, supposedly claiming on his own will that the boy should be returned.      Only a court of law should weight that, it should also weight the fact that the mother died to see the child free, and also the best interest of the child.  And neither the government of the United States, nor the government of Cuba, and not even us in exile, can make an unbias and an unpassionate decision here.  Only a court of law is an independent source that can do that. 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 SANCHEZ:  As soon as the family ask us something we will immediately meet and we will give you our response after that.  But we want to work, and we have been working with the family.  If there are indications that this will be resolved in a satisfactory way to the family and to the best interests of the child, we will immediately of course scale back the protest, and even bring it to a halt, and in the very moment that we see that this is beginning to head in the right direction. 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 SANCHEZ:  (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) 

 TUCKER:  You have been listening to comments from Ramon Saul Sanchez. He is the president of the Democracy Movement, and also acting as the Gonzalez family spokesman.  The Gonzalez family asking that the U.S. government consider and hear its appeal that the case of Elian Gonzalez be heard in a family court, and that Elian Gonzalez`s future be decided in a family court with the father present.  And they say when that request is granted they will call for protests in Miami to be brought to a close. 

 But obviously this is a very passionate issue which, Terry, doesn`t seem to be lacking any passion, and none seems to be dying down either. 

 KEENAN:  No, and of course, and we just heard that new twist from Bob Franken, our congressional correspondent about talk for perhaps a congressional resolution to bring Elian before Congress to testify there.  So we will continue of course to follow this story. 

 The other story that we are following this morning is a huge rally under way in the markets, as we wrap up a very volatile week on Wall Street, the first week of trading.  And of course, there is all sort of market lore that, as goes January, so goes the rest of the year.  So the outcome of this week, and this tug-of-war between the bulls and bears could be very important to the outcome for the markets for the whole year. 

 And there you see the Dow industrials.  We are off our best levels of the day, but we are still up 131 points, and we are seeing buying in some of the stocks that have not been movers in 1999. Proctor & Gamble is up 6.  Merck, which had a terrible year, a flat year last year, is up better than 5 right now. 

 And the buying continue at the Nasdaq composite as well, though we have pulled back below the 3800 level.  That earnings warning from Lucent not hurting some of the competitors that trade on the Nasdaq, such as Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks.  Those stocks in fact are higher, and the Nasdaq is better by 59/ 

 TUCKER:  And the bond market also looking well, too.  Bond had been down as much as a point in price, raising the yield up above 6.60, but we have seen price moderation, we have seen the yield come down.  We are currently looking at a yield on the U.S. 30-year treasury of 6.57 percent. 

 KEENAN:  Well, this week, we have been reviewing our IN THE MONEY portfolio.  We have 33 stocks in the portfolio, and we think it may be time to prune a few, and to raise some cash for the future purchases. 

 3Com, a computer networking products maker, is strutting its stuff at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics show.  So we thought that we would reconsider our investment in 3Com. 

 Now, just two weeks ago, we purchased 20 shares of 3Com at $48 a share, and we`ve lost a little money on that bet since then.  The stock is down  nine percent. 

 Let`s check 3Com shares and how they`re trading at this hour: just a fractional loss, there, at 43 15/16, down from a 52-week-a-high of 53. 

 TUCKER:  All right, and joining us from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is Eric Benhamou.  He is the CEO of 3Com. 

 And Eric, welcome to IN THE MONEY, and thanks for being here with us as we consider your stock in the IN THE MONEY portfolio. 

 Very exciting time for your company... 

 ERIC BENHAMOU, CEO, 3COM:  Thanks for inviting me. 

 TUCKER:  A very exciting time for your company.  You`re getting ready to spin off the Palm Pilot division, you delivered an address out at the Consumer Electronic Show just the other day talking about 3Com`s future in the home networking business.  My question actually has to do with that business, sir:  Cisco announcing it`s going to take you on, in effect, in an area where 3Com had been a dominant player, but Cisco, I think, is somebody you have to take very seriously. 

 BENHAMOU:  Yes, we clearly compete with Cisco in a number of our segments.  However, when it comes to home networking, we feel we have some unique advances.  In particular, we have a brand in distribution channels which enable us to address the home market.  We have consumer presence and an understanding of consumer mindsets and preferences which have enabled us to bring the Palm to market and to make it a successful product, and all of these talents will be brought to bear in our drive towards being a leader in home networking. 

 Up to now, we have -- we have had only two or three months of real experiencing building home networks.  We introduced a home-connect kit last October.  This is a co-branded product with Microsoft that is considerably simpler than the equivalent enterprise-oriented networks. It`s taken a very strong start.  It enables home users to use the wiring in their walls that connects their telephones to connect their computers and printers and fax machines.  It is particularly simple to use. 

 KEENAN:  The Palm IPO widely anticipated on Wall Street.  When do you expect it to go public?  And also, since we are shareholders in 3Com, explain -- explain, if you would, what percent of Palm your existing shareholders will own when you spin it off? 

 BENHAMOU:  Well, we filed an S1 registration statement with the SEC about three and a half weeks ago, and at this point we`re just going through the regular process with SEC of filing for the IPO, and we expect that we`ll be able to complete this IPO in the next few weeks as originally planned.  After the IPO, 3Com will remain an 80-plus-percent shareholders into the company, and subsequently, about six to nine months after that, we will spin our shares to 3Com shareholders of record, and by virtue of that full spin, every 3Com shareholder will become a Palm shareholder. 

 TUCKER:  Any plans to aggressively license the Palm Pilot`s operating system?  It`s been tremendously successful, in fact has Microsoft playing catch up with its CE operating system. 

 BENHAMOU:  We believe this is one of the -- one of the key businesses of our Palm unit.  It`s -- in other words, it`s not just about selling Palm devices, it`s also about licensing the operating system and also, by the way, connecting to Internet via wireless sources.  As far as the licensing of Palm O.S., we really started in earnest about a year ago. We believe that we had sufficient critical mass to be able to attract licensees, particularly amongst the cell phone vendors.  Nokia committed to incorporating the Palm O.S. into its next generation of smart telephones, so did Motorola prior to that relationship with Qualcomm and with Alcatel. 

 In addition to this, in the infotainment area, companies like Sony have also committed to licensing the Palm O.S. and building devices based upon it.  So, we`re going to have several -- several strong branded products which carry the Palm O.S. beyond Palm itself. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you very much.  We appreciate you talking to us, today, Eric Benhamou, the CEO of 3Com. 

 BENHAMOU:  Thank you. 

 KEENAN:  Well, if you think we should drop 3Com or any other stock from our IN THE MONEY portfolio, go to our CNNfn.com Web site and vote. So far, 30 percent of you are telling us to sell our 3Com shares.  As for the other votes, many of you are indicating a sell signal on Lernout & Hauspie, Coca-Cola enterprises and Pixar.  To tell us what you think, go to our Web site address and cast your vote at the bottom of the home page. 

 TUCKER:  Coming up on IN THE MONEY:  We`ll check out the mutual fundamental of a fund that saw its assets more than double in 1999. KEENAN:  But first, as we head to break, here is how some of the stocks in our IN THE MONEY portfolio are doing today.  We`ll be right back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  OK, they don`t look so busy, but they are on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  We have about 800 million shares trading, and about 10 percent of that is Lucent.  It is the most active on the Big Board, and about 100 million shares have already traded so far today. 

 In our "Moneywise" segment for this Friday, a look at a mutual fund that has caught the eye of our IN THE MONEY team with its solid performance since its inception in 1997.  The Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth Fund, the A fund, that is, is up 62 percent.  Its top holdings are in technology, financials and health care, technology and financials, of course, two sectors that have been taking a beating lately. 

 And joining us now to discuss their strategy are the co-fund managers, Steven Colton and Dong Zhang. 

 And welcome to IN THE MONEY, gentlemen. 

 Let me start with you, Steven, and ask you what you make of this first week in the markets, because we`ve had a lot of cross currents that have unnerved a lot of investors? 

 STEVEN COLTON, PHOENIX-OAKHURST GWTH & INCOME:  Oh, it`s just been really hectic, Terry.  I mean, we`ve had earnings warnings from BMC Software, Gateway, and then yesterday Lucent Technologies, so, you know, those technology stocks have really been priced for perfection, and with these earnings warnings it`s pretty troubling.  And actually we`ve been positioning our portfolio, last month, for some of the stocks that would benefit for the global recovery, for example energy and basic materials and things like that. 

 TUCKER:  Well, you notice that 27 percent of your fund is weighted in technology, or at least it was when we asked you about it, the holdings. I`m wondering if you gentlemen have adjusted the weighting there.  Did you get rid of some of your technology stocks, this week, and maybe move more toward some of the health care stocks? 

 COLTON:  Well, I`ll let Dong answer that.  He`s our high-tech guru. 

 DONG ZHANG, PHOENIX-OAKHURST GWTH & INCOME:  Well, currently our technology weighting is really unchanged.  We have been underweighted a little bit in technology since December, and we are keeping that position.  We are adding positions in basic materials and things like chemicals and aluminums and oils and energies and things like that, and we think with the global economic recovery those stocks are positioned to perform much better with a very cheap valuation. 

 KEENAN:  And Steven, you know, we`ve also seen a move particularly, today, into some of the consumer names and some of the drug stocks.  Are you looking at those as attractive buys right now? 

 COLTON:  Oh, well, yes.  And I think the important thing is, we made these moves late last year, and, you know, I think a lot of people now, they`re looking for alternatives to technology, and I think really the key to success in portfolio management is to be one step ahead of the game, in stocks like Lily, which we`ve been in. 

 Coca-Cola is an interesting stock.  We didn`t own Coke last year, but, you know, what you`re seeing now after a series, you know, quarter and quarter after earnings disappointments and downward revisions, you`re actually seeing earnings estimates on Coke going up. So, we`ve actually added that stock to our portfolio. 

 TUCKER:  Also noted that you`re interesting in health care stocks. Are you being an aggressive buyer on the market on health care, and what exactly are those stocks as far as you`re concerned? 

 ZHANG:  Well, health care are a defensive sector, so in this kind of market volatility they do benefit.  However, given that this is an election year and given that health care, a lot of drug companies will have expirations going forward, so we`re somewhat cautious on drug stocks.  So, we stay pretty much mutually weighted on drug.  We prefer the smaller drug companies like Eli Lillys and Pharmacia Upjohns.  We see the Mercks and much bigger drug company that will be take -- will be used -- takeover candidates, you know, takeover targets. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks, gentlemen.  We appreciate it.  Have a good weekend. 

 COLTON:  Thank you. 

 ZHANG:  Thank you. 

 KEENAN:  OK, Steven Colton and Dong Zhang of the Phoenix-Oakhurst Growth Fund. 

 TUCKER:  All right, coming up next on IN THE MONEY:  After-hours trading used to be a very exclusive club, but now more individual investors are starting to trade during the extended hours. 

 KEENAN:  Our Andy Serwer will be back, and he is going to tell you what you need to know to trade after the closing bell in our after-hours 101.  IN THE MONEY will be right back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Welcome back.  We have the markets on a roll, the Dow industrials up 136 points.  The Nasdaq composite up 54.  The only index of note losing today, the Dow transports, Dow transports down 23 in a market that is otherwise very upbeat. 

 KEENAN:  Very upbeat and very resilient after that Lucent bombshell after the closing bell.  Of course, they warned that earnings would come in about 30 percent below what analysts were expected.  And the affect was felt immediately.  In after-hours trading we had incredible volume. Our Andy Serwer is here with a look at how after-hours trading is really starting to be more like full-time trading, Andy. 

 SERWER:  That`s right, Terry.  Of course, what used to happen is companies would announce bad news after the close, traders would take the train home to Connecticut, talk about it, have a few drinks and kind of, you know, not get so upset by the next morning.  Stock maybe open up down a couple of points. 

 But now, with after-hours trading, this whole business -- there`s a whole revolution going on here.  What happened is, you know, Lucent announced after the close, and people started trading like crazy after-hours.  When all was said and done, between the close last night and the open this morning about 8 million Lucent shares changed hand. That`s basically a whole trading day of Lucent because the average volume on Lucent is about 10 million shares.  So huge volume. 

 You know it was crazy, the stock closed at 69 yesterday around there, and opened up at, what, 52 or something like that.  So you had a huge drop.  My sources tell me that Goldman Sachs was selling a lot of stock all night, a 250,000 share block at around 56, and then early this morning at the open, after the open in fact, Sanford Burnstein, the value shop here in New York, was buying it in low 50s.  So it is a real whole different ballgame now with these stocks trading in after-hours. 

 And if you are a retail investor, you are just sitting there watching the smoke go, right. 

 TUCKER:  Some of the things I think that had investors concerned was that when they did extended hours, there wouldn`t be the liquidity there, meaning there wouldn`t be the volume in the stock to guarantee that you would get a good price.  I`m wondering, Andy, if you get a sense that Lucent, in that sense, was a little unusual this time around. 

 SERWER:  I think you are absolutely right, Bill, because the volume, generally, has been very spotty, which makes for incredibly volatile trading in after-hours.  In fact, the quotes you get are sometimes ridiculous, as you know, Terry, seeing these just crazy quotes.  Like with Gateway, which sort of blew up the other day, and the trades were all over the place, and the stock ended up opening up the next morning, amazingly enough.  So you have to be really careful at there. 

 KEENAN:  But with Lucent it was -- it was more orderly, I mean, it was down, and it sort of stayed around that 52, 53 level in after-hours action, so the volume helped, I guess. 

 SERWER:  Well, that`s right, yes, the volume always helps with the volatility like that.  And it just sort of stepped down through the night and it ended up down there at that bottom.  And now it seems to be picking up.  Of course, a lot of people are saying now that in the low 50s, low- mid-50s it is a good buy. 

 KEENAN:  Some real money was lost, $65 billion was wiped off of its market value. 

 SERWER:  That is real change. 

 TUCKER:  Billion here, billion there, we are talking about real money. 

 All right, before we leave you today, many of you called in asking for more information about the University of Alaska`s Student Investment Fund, which we profiled on the show yesterday on our weekly "Investment Club" segment.  Well, we didn`t have their Web site yesterday, we do today.  You can go there and you see it on the screen.  Check out the stocks that helped them gain more than 100 percent last year. 

 KEENAN:  Yes, they had an amazing record.  Also, if you are part of an investment club be sure to contact us and tell us about your club, and how it is doing.  E-mail at inthemoney -- that is all one word -- @cnnfn.com. 

 We also want to tell you about a new series that we are starting next week.  It`s called "It`s Their Job." It kicks off on Monday with a profile of a Wall Street trailblazer, Karen Hacket (ph).  She is a floor broker down at the New York Stock Exchange, and following her around for a day is a lesson in all the lingo and systems.  And she is going to explain what it all means down there. 

 TUCKER:  Yep, and that does it for today`s edition of IN THE MONEY. I`m Bill Tucker. 

 KEENAN:  And I`m Terry Keenan, for Daryn Kagan and myself, good-bye, and have a great weekend.  We will see you on Monday.

 Stocks soar at midday

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks rose sharply Friday, with blue-chip shares surging despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a modest rebound even after a profit warning by Lucent. 

 At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 134.96 at 11,388.22, extending the 250-point rebound of the past two days and wiping out the remainder of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. Earlier in the day, the Dow was up nearly 202 points. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 57.67 at 3,784.80 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. 

 Other broad-market indicators were also posting sizable gains, with the Standard and Poor's 500 index rising 13.34 to 1,416.79. 

 The strength in technology came despite late Thursday's disclosure by Lucent Technologies that the company won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. Lucent plunged afterwards on other markets and was trading today at 52 11/16, down 16 5/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. Nortel Networks was up 6 3/8 at 91 3/8 on the NYSE, while in heavy Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems was up 3 at 103, Ciena was up 9 1/16 at 54 15/16 and JDS Uniphase was up 15 3/4 at 165 1/2. 

 Meanwhile, before Friday's open, the government reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. 

 It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. The Labor Department reported that average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent to dlrs 13.46 in December, the largest gain since September, but in line with what most were forecasting. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting company profits. 

 Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies who make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop: Procter and Gamble surged 7 to 114 7/8 and Coca-Cola jumped to 3 to 60 to help lead the Dow, which also drew a boost from drugmakers Merck, up 5 at 73 3/8 and Johnson and Johnson, up 4 to 96 9/16.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks staged a strong advance in early trading today, with blue-chip shares rising despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a modest rebound even after a profit warning by Lucent. 

 In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 116.35 at 11,369.61, extending the 250-point rebound of the past two days. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 71.27 at 3,798.40 after plunging 400 points over the prior three sessions. 

 Other broad-market indicators were also positive, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index rising 6.09 at 1,409.54. 

 The strength in technology came despite late Thursday's disclosure by Lucent Technologies that the company won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. Lucent plunged afterwards on other markets and was trading early today at 53 1/16, down 15 15/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Before the open of regular trading, the government reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. 

 It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate.

 In other trading today, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than a 3-to-2 margin on the NYSE, while Nasdaq gainers led by a 4-to-3 ratio. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 1.74 at 477.08. 

 NYSE volume came to 161.11 million shares in the early going, up sharply from 118.79 at the same point on Thursday. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.87 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.87 percent.

 NEW YORK (AP) - The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its best day in history. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15 1/2 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at 53 1/2 . 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 20 1/4 to 97 1/4 , Cisco Systems rose 5 7/8 to 105 7/8 , Ciena rose 11 7/8 to 57 3/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 30 3/16 to 179 15/16. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the nation's labor market remains strong. 

 Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. Economists fear that the low jobless rate will force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting company profits. 

 Notably, many of Friday's strongest issues were companies that make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop. Procter & Gamble surged 8 5/8 to 116 1/2 . 

 Also, Coca-Cola rose 3 3/4 to 60 3/4 , Merck gained 6 9/16 to 74 15/16 and Johnson & Johnson rose 3 3/16 to 95 3/4 . 

 Those companies, considered cyclical stocks, have thrived this week as investors took profits from a big run in technology shares at the end of 1999. But their resurgence may be short-lived, argued Gannon. 

 "I don't think the leadership in this market is going to change dramatically," he said. "At the end of 2000, we'll look back and see that the dominant players remained telecom and technology." 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, five stocks rose for every three that fell. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1.21 billion shares, compared with 1.08 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 to 488.31. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. European indexes bounced back sharply from their own declines this week, with Germany's Xetra DAX rising 4.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 up 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 up 1.6 percent.

 NEW YORK (AP) - The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its best day in history. 

 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30, or 2.4 percent, to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by consumer goods stocks, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.48, or 4.2 percent, to 3,882.61 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. 

 According to preliminary calculations, the Standard and Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 13-to-5 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,263 up, 864 down and 420 unchanged. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, five stocks rose for every three that fell. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1.21 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.08 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.97 to 488.31.

 Lucent said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged well below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks rose sharply today, with blue-chip shares surging despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a modest rebound even after a profit warning by Lucent. 

 At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 134.96 at 11,388.22, extending the 250-point rebound of the past two days and wiping out the remainder of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. Earlier in the day, the Dow was up nearly 202 points. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 57.67 at 3,784.80 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. 

 Other broad-market indicators were also posting sizable gains, with the Standard & Poor's 500 index rising 13.34 to 1,416.79. 

 The strength in technology came despite late Thursday's disclosure by Lucent Technologies that the company won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. Lucent plunged afterwards on other markets and was trading today at 52 11/16, down 16 5/16 from Thursday's close on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. Nortel Networks was up 6 3/8 at 91 3/8 on the NYSE, while in heavy Nasdaq trading, Cisco Systems was up 3 at 103, Ciena was up 9 1/16 at 54 15/16 and JDS Uniphase was up 15 3/4 at 165 1/2 . 

 Meanwhile, before today's open, the government reported that the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade-low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July. 

 It was the latest sign of a strong labor market that could force employers to pay higher wages and benefits and then boost their prices to compensate. The Labor Department reported that average hourly earnings rose by 0.4 percent to $13.46 in December, the largest gain since September, but in line with what most were forecasting. 

 While wage and job growth are good developments for workers, the Federal Reserve has already bumped up interest rates three times in less than a year to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under control. Some economists believe the Fed could boost rates again as early as its Feb. 1-2 meeting, possibly hurting company profits. 

 Notably, many of today's strongest issues were companies who make products that consumers need regardless of the economic backdrop: Procter & Gamble surged 7 to 114 7/8 and Coca-Cola jumped to 3 to 60 to help lead the Dow, which also drew a boost from drugmakers Merck, up 5 at 73 3/8 and Johnson & Johnson, up 4 to 96 9/16. 

 In other trading, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-4 margin on the NYSE, while Nasdaq gainers led by nearly a 3-to-2 ratio. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 5.66 at 481.00. 

 NYSE volume came to 582.52 million shares at midday, up sharply from 459.69 million at the same point on Thursday. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 2.87 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.77 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.87 percent.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks rose sharply today, with blue-chip shares surging despite more signs of inflationary pressure and the technology group mounting a modest rebound even after a profit warning by Lucent. 

 By late morning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 200.34 at 11,453.60, extending the 250-point rebound of the past two days and wiping out the remainder of Tuesday's 359-point tumble.

 Euro-stocks find respite in Wall Street blue-chip rally

 LONDON, Jan 7 (AFP) - European share prices finally found respite Friday from the mayhem that has gripped markets this week, as major bourses ended a four-day rout with modest gains thanks to a blue- chip rally on Wall Street. 

 But technology stocks, the darling of investors last year, continued to suffer heavy losses following another slump in New York's Nasdaq index, while telecoms equipment companies were hit by a profit warning from US outfit Lucent. 

 And investors were watching closely for key US labour market data due out later on Friday for an indication of the future pattern of US interest rates. Expectations of a rate hike in February have been the prime reason for this week's market slump. 

 In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares broke a three- day losing streak that has wiped almost seven percent off its value by adding 45.2 points, 0.7 percent, in early trading to 6,492.4 points. 

 The Paris market opened lower but quickly notched up cautious gains, the CAC-40 index standing at 5,491.9 points by midmorning, up 41.7 points or 0.8 percent on the day. 

 Prices in Frankfurt were also higher, and the DAX index of 30 German blue chip shares gained one percent in opening forays to stand at 6,539.69 points. 

 Markets were gently reassured by a solid performance overnight by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 1.2 percent to 11,253.26 points. Asian markets were similarly comforted, Tokyo share prices rising 0.1 percent and the stricken Hong Kong ending a dismal run with a 1.7-percent gain. 

 But further weakness in the hi-tech Nasdaq index, which shed another 3.9 percent on Thursday, sapped at the price of European technology issues, which have been battered this week by the jitters gripping stock markets. 

 The London market's leading losers were tech stocks ARM Holdings, down eight percent at 3,136, QXL.com down 5.1 percent at 1,100 and Freeserve down 4.8 percent at 467.5 pence. 

 Telecoms outfitters were also lashed following an overnight profitwarning from Lucent Technologies in the United States. 

 In Paris, Alcatel shares were down 4.5 percent at 202 euros, while in London, Marconi stock fell 5.8 percent to 894 pence. 

 But British media groups flourished on the prospect of deeper consolidation in the independent television sector, after the Granada group said it was mulling a takeover raid on either Carlton or United News and Media. 

 Carlton stock gained 30.5 pence, 5.5 percent, to 587.5 pence, while United gained 8.5 pence to 806.5 pence. Granada gained 10 pence to 591.5 pence. 

 The Frankfurt market was boosted by upbeat financial statements from the SAP software company and the Mannesmann conglomerate. 

 SAP shares soared more than 10 percent after it said that strong fourth-quarter business would enable it to meet its sales target for the whole year. 

 And Mannesmann shares gained nearly 1.5 percent after it reported a rise in pre-tax earnings on the back of excellent growth in its telecommunications division.

 NEW YORK (AP) - The Dow Jones industrials soared into record territory Friday after investors brushed off signs of inflationary pressure and a profit warning from Lucent and sent stocks sharply higher. The Nasdaq composite, which tumbled earlier this week, recorded its biggest point gain in history. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 269.30 to close at 11,522.56, topping its Dec. 31 closing record of 11,497.12. The rally, which was fueled by old-fashioned consumer stocks like Procter & Gamble, wiped out the last remnants of Tuesday's 359-point tumble. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index soared 155.49 to 3,882.62 after plunging 400 points, or nearly 10 percent, over the previous three sessions. Other broad-market indicators also posted sizable gains. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 38.02 to 1,441.47. 

 The sharpness of the rally perplexed some analysts, who believed the selloff that began on Tuesday would continue. 

 "We viewed the selling all week as being healthy for the market," said Francis Gannon, senior equity portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management. "Is that over? Probably not." 

 Nonetheless, investors proved their reluctance to stay out of a market that richly rewarded them in 1999. The Nasdaq ended a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness from a leading telecommunications equipment maker. 

 Lucent Technologies said late Thursday it won't meet most profit forecasts for the final quarter of 1999. On record-breaking volume, Lucent plunged 15 below its Thursday close on the New York Stock Exchange, ending the session at 54. 

 But in a sign of extraordinary resilience, investors used Lucent's troubles as a reason to throw money at its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic equipment for the communications networks that make up the Internet. 

 "This is not an industry issue," said Alex M. Cena, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. Cena lowered his earnings estimates for Lucent, but said its woes were due to specific problems at the company. 

 In active trading, Nortel Networks soared 20 7/16 to 97 7/16, Cisco Systems rose 5 7/8 to 105 7/8 , Ciena rose 11 7/8 to 57 3/4 and JDS Uniphase rose 30 3/16 to 179 15/16. 

 Stocks dodged another potential problem Friday: the latest sign that the nation's labor market remains strong. 

 Before the start of trading, the government reported the nation's unemployment rate held steady at a three-decade low of 4.1 percent in December as 315,000 workers found jobs, above most forecasts and the biggest gain since July.

Lucent Shares Plunge on Warning



NEW YORK) - At least four major investment firms downgraded Lucent
following the communications equipment maker's warning late yesterday
that its profits from the final three months of 1999 won't meet Wall
Street forecasts. Lucent's troubles were apparently seen as a gain for
its main rivals in supplying speedy fiber-optic gear for the

Jobless Rate Steady at 4.1 Percent



WASHINGTON (AP) - A burst of hiring at department stores and
construction companies helped keep the nation's unemployment rate at a
30-year low of 4.1 percent in December, marking a strong finish for a
year in which Americans enjoyed the best labor market since the Vietnam
War. Employers added 315,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the
largest gain since July. Big increases came at department stores,
enjoying their best holiday sales season in seven years, and
construction companies, basking in a building boom brought on by
warmer-than-usual weather.



Y2K Glitch Hits Some Credit Cards



NEW YORK (AP) - Buyers beware: Your credit card might get charged
more than once because some merchants failed to update their computer
software for the Year 2000. Visa and Mastercard said today they have
checks in place to catch duplicate charges, but they suggest that
customers review their credit card statements anyhow. A vast majority of
transactions are going through without problems, they added. The problem
is being caused by outdated IC Verify software from CyberCash, which
makes electronic transaction processing software. The company offered
free fixes last year, but some merchants didn't get them.



Porn Site Ordered To Drop Mag Name



CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge ordered the operators of an
Internet pornography site to stop using Teen magazine's name in its Web
address. The magazine's president, Lynn Lehmkuhl, said staff discovered
the pornography site last week and soon heard from puzzled girls. Teen,
published since 1957, says the average age of its 2 million subscribers
is 15. The magazine's Web address is
www.teenmag.com. The operator of
the porn site, Blue Gravity Communications, and its owner, Thomas
Krwawecz III, were temporarily restrained yesterday from using the
magazine's name by U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Irenas. He scheduled a
hearing for next Friday.



Trucks Dominate Detroit Auto Show



DETROIT (AP) - The car of the future is a truck, to judge by this
year's auto show. From hulking four-door pickups to micro-sport utility
vehicles and station wagons on steroids, trucks will dominate the
turntables of the 2000 North American International Auto Show, just as
they dominated the sales charts in 1999. Yet industry watchers point to
some warning lights such as rising competition and fuel prices that may
make the vehicles a tougher sell. All the large American manufacturers,
along with several Asian and European automakers, will show off new
production models and concept vehicles at the show, which begins media
previews Sunday.



Britain Broadcaster Race Heats Up



LONDON (AP) - Hotel and TV network owner Granada Group confirmed
today that it might bid for one of its independent commercial television
peers, Carlton Communications or United News & Media. The announcement
had been expected ever since Carlton and United unveiled plans for a
$12.7 billion merger in late November, and heats up the race to create
what would be Britain's largest commercial broadcaster. A ruling on
whether the Carlton-United merger will be referred to Britain's
Competitions Commission is due soon. Granada said it would make its
final decision regarding any bid after the regulatory process has run
its course.



Taiwan Chipmaker Buying Second Co.



TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) - Taiwan's largest computer chipmaker, Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., said it will buy the island's third
largest chip producer in a stock swap that analysts valued at more than
$3 billion. With an earlier deal, the purchase will make TSMC the
world's largest chip foundry. TSMC's agreement to buy Worldwide
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. follows recent speculation that
Taiwan's No. 2 company, United Microelectronics Corp., had been courting
Worldwide. The deal will put pressure on United Microelectronics to find
its own merger partner, said Nathan Emerson, director of ABN Amro Asia
Investment Consultancy in Taipei.



Wal-Mart, Web Firm Create New Co.



NEW YORK (AP) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and a Silicon Valley firm are
forming a new Internet company that will work to enhance the giant
retailer's Web site and bring shoppers online for the first time.
Wal-Mart.com Inc. will be an independent company based in Palo Alto,
Calif., with its own board of directors and management team. The deal
between the world's largest retailer and venture-capital firm Accel
Partners was announced late yesterday.



Incoming Coke CEO Extends Shakeup



ATLANTA (AP) - Coca-Cola's incoming chief continued to shake things
up, naming a new head of the company's critical European division, which
struggled through a costly contamination scare last year, and appointing
a new chief marketing officer. They were the second and third such moves
this week by Doug Daft. Many analysts viewed the management shuffle as
Daft's way of quickly putting together a new team in time for his
official takeover of the Atlanta-based soft drink giant in April at the
annual shareholders meeting.

 Shares of the corporate software maker BMC Software plunged yesterday after it said its third-quarter earnings would not meet estimates. BMC's shares were down $29, or 37 percent, to $48, in Nasdaq trading. The Houston-based company sells software used on mainframes and in corporate computer networks, a market where some of the greatest Year 2000 business disruptions had been feared. The profit warning surprised analysts who had expected BMC to post a solid third quarter as corporate customers bought software for installation in 2000 and used up end-of-1999 budgets. The company expects earnings to range from $100 million to $110 million, or 40 cents to 44 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 53 cents a share.

 DOW BOUNCES BACK - GAINS 124 IN SEESAW SESSION; NASDAQ OFF

 The stock market did its best imitation of a pogo stick yesterday -- bouncing up and down, up and down -- before ending the day mixed. 

 After dropping as much as 4.2 percent in the morning -- nearing a correction after only 10 hours of trading -- the Nasdaq Composite Index clawed its way back to positive territory before ending the day down again. 

 After Tuesday's 5.6 percent drop on the Nasdaq, money fled the volatile technology sector into safer blue chips and the Nasdaq ended down 24.15 points, or 0.6 percent, at 3,877.54. 

 Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said there was a "whiff of panic" during the early morning drop but people soon took it as a chance to buy cheap. 

 "We had a lot broader strength in the markets near the low," he said. 

 "People have been extremely well-conditioned that every time the market moves down it's a good buying opportunity." 

 But Meehan -- who predicts the technology bubble will burst in the next few months -- said buying the lows is a strategy that may not be good for much longer. 

 "The days of it being the no-brainer of the century are coming to an end, because the bond market is in real trouble." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average -- which lost 3.2 percent on Tuesday -- rode a similar roller coaster as the Nasdaq -- ranging between a 59-point loss and a 217-point gain -- before finishing the day up 124.72, or 1.13 percent, at 11,122.65. 

 The broader S&P dropped hard in the morning before rebounding to close up 2.69 points, or 0.19 percent, at 1,402.11. 

 The big move of the day was toward safer, more predictable stocks that move with the business cycle and away from the volatility of Internet-related stocks. 

 BMC Software plunged $27.44 to $49.56 after it issued a profitwarning, while Amazon.com dove $12.19 to $69.75 after its sales figures failed to meet high expectations. 

 Qualcomm -- one of 1999's darlings, with a 27-fold increase -- fell for the third day running, closing at $156.44, off $5.63, and Yahoo! lost $32.50 a share to wrap up 2000's third day of trading at $410.50. 

 The winners for the day were some very old-fashioned companies like Alcoa, the world's biggest aluminum producer, which closed at $86, up $4.69. 

 The Dow Jones Utility Index -- down 9 percent for 1999 -- was up 3.8 percent for the day, with North Carolina's Duke Energy rising $2 to $51.

 Ariba - Chairman & CEO Interview on Nightly Business Report

 SUSIE GHARIB: After the bell today, Lucent chimes in with bad news: it warns earnings won`t meet Wall Street estimates, and the stock goes into a free-fall in after-hours trading. Good evening, everyone. I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. 

 PAUL KANGAS: And I`m Paul Kangas in Miami. It`s a split decision on Wall Street, as the Dow gains another 130 points, but the NASDAQ Index hits the skids again, losing 150 points. Then, MicroStrategy (MSTR) has a big strategy for its software products. We`ll tell you why you`ll be hearing more about them. 

 KANGAS: Good evening, everyone. A big surprise from Lucent: it issued an earnings warning late this afternoon, and investors dumped the stock in after-hours trading. Lucent plunged over 18 points. The telecom equipment giant said its fiscal first quarter earnings will come in at 36 to 39 cents a share, down sharply from last year`s 48 cents, and way below Wall Street estimates of 54 cents. The company blamed the shortfall on production delays and problems keeping up with customer demand. After a late afternoon conference call with the company, analyst David Hager of A.G. Edwards says he thinks despite the current problems the demand is still in the marketplace and the fundamentals have not changed. Hager told NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, he like the company believes Lucent will come back strongly in the second half of year 2000. 

 GHARIB: That warning from Lucent today, and similar news from Gateway (GTW) only yesterday, is forcing investors to focus on earnings again. But despite the negative forecasts, Suzanne Pratt reports that Wall Street is still expecting strong numbers from corporate America. 

 SUZANNE PRATT, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Now that Wall Street is done worrying about the Y2K bug, it`s back to fretting about interest rates and earnings. Some experts believe earnings will emerge as the main focus in the market for the next month, not just because it`s reporting season, but because the Fed doesn`t meet again until early February. 

 EDWARD KEON, DIRECTOR, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: Well, the market`s clearly worried about interest rates, and the future direction of interest rates. But I think once the earnings news starts to come out and you`ll start to see heavy volume of that as early as next week-I think you`ll get a bit of a lift, since I do think we will once again have more positive surprises than negatives out of the earnings season. 

 PRATT: First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, expects healthy profit growth of about 20 percent for S.&P 500 firms in the fourth quarter of 1999. That`s a bit of a slowdown from the third quarter, but still strong. Transportation companies are expected to be the quarter`s biggest losers, due to higher fuel costs. Those higher oil prices will probably mean most energy names will be the quarter`s biggest winners. They are likely to be followed by basic materials, such as paper companies. But experts say technology profits, which often lead the pack, will look a bit soft. 

 CHUCK HILL, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, FIRST CALL: Part of that is this temporary problem of Y2K and component shortages, part of it is a reversion back to more normal comparisons to a year ago. 

 PRATT: The market is already in the peak period for earnings warnings, like today`s news from Lucent. Other big names such as Gateway and IBM (IBM) have also detailed problems with fourth-quarter numbers. And according to First Call, the pace of negative pre-announcements is higher than earlier in 1999. 

 HILL: That gets your attention, in that is there something going on here? But when you dig into it, there really isn`t much in the way of a particular industry that`s being impacted, or sector that would imply problems going forward. 

 PRATT: In fact, going forward, experts are looking for profit growth to continue at a quick pace, something in the order of about 14 percent in 2000. That`s considered particularly impressive, because 1999 results looked to be very strong. Suzanne Pratt, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 KANGAS: Encouraged by yesterday`s 124-point rebound in the Dow Industrial Average, investors continued to buy blue chip stocks, as trading got under way on Wall Street this morning. At 10:30, the Dow posted a 25-point gain, but the NASDAQ Index remained on the defensive, as profit-takers moved in again, sending it down 88 points after the first hour of the session. A firm bond market helped the early blue-chip rally stay alive throughout the rest of the morning, but traders continued to take some of the huge profits run up by the high-tech stocks last year. At noon, the Industrial Average was up 84 points, the NASDAQ Index down nearly 81 points. Investors appetites` for blue chips became almost voracious in afternoon trading, but the source of their funds appeared to come from the aggressive sale of high-tech NASDAQ stocks. The Dow Industrial Average surged to a closing gain of 130.61 points at 11253.26. In today`s 215 point trading range, the Industrial Average closed down 60 points from the best level of the day, but up 155 points from the low. The NASDAQ Composite finished with a loss of 150.41 points, at 3727.13. In its 153 point trading range, the Composite settled 142 points below its best level of the day. Trading volume on big board 1.82 billion shares, up about 6 million from yesterday. And quite a bit more up volume than down volume, a little better than a 3 to 2 margin. 

 The Dow Transports Index had a good day thanks mostly to the rails, up 69 3/4 points. 

 And the Utilities on top of big yesterday, up another 3 1/2. 

 The Closing Tick very strong, very bullish +797. 

 Standard & Poor`s 500 up a 1 1/3. 

 A gain of 1.12 in the S&P 100. 

 MidCap 400 lost nearly 2 points. 

 CRB Bridge Futures Price Index down .26. 

 New York Stock Exchange Composite Index up nearly 6 1/2. 

 Exactly a 2 point gain in the Value Line. 

 Russell2000 Small Cap off just about 3 1/2 points. 

 And the broadly based Wilshire 5000 down 44.30. 

 After the market closed, the Federal Reserve reported in the week ending December 27, the M-2 money supply rose $15.7 billion. 

 The bond market got a boost from today`s report of a 7.1 percent drop in November new home sales, suggesting higher interest rates are finally slowing the economy. A relatively firm dollar was another positive, as was optimism that tomorrow`s December unemployment report will be debt market-friendly. Bonds also got some help from safe haven buying related to the sharp high-tech stock sell-off. Tax free and corporate issues rose a 1/4 to 3/8 of a point on average, while the Treasury market moved moderately higher. 

 A 9/32 gain in the 5-year notes. 

 10-year notes up 13/32. 

 Bellwether 30-year bond up 21/32, bringing the yield back down to 6.58 percent. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index up 9.19. 

 I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. 

 GHARIB: Paul, investors and traders zeroed in on sales numbers from retailers today. Cash registers were ringing during the holiday season, but not for everyone. As Scott Gurvey reports, it was a season of the haves and have nots. 

 SCOTT GURVEY, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Santa was good to most of America`s retailers. Consumers favored the high end and discount stores, while results were mixed at the big department store chains. Wal-Mart (WMT), the nation`s biggest, attracted both price conscious gift shoppers and Y2K fearing consumers who stocked up on canned goods, bottled water and batteries. Wal-Mart reported a 9.1 percent increase in same store sales, led by a 14.2 percent increase at its Sam`s Club warehouse stores. Results were also good at Federated, the parent of Macy`s, Bloomingdale`s and others, sales at Federated rising 6.4 percent. Target`s parent Dayton Hudson (DH) saw sales rise 5.6 percent. At K-Mart, they were up 5.5 percent. The booming economy made its effect felt nowhere as much as at Tiffany (TIF), the symbol of luxury. Tiffany`s sales jumped 27 percent. 

 DANA TELSEY, RETAIL ANALYST, BEAR STEARNS: I think at Tiffany`s, their advertising has just been terrific and there`s been more people who`ve been more comfortable going there, whether it`s to spend $50 on a wedding gift or buy that expensive piece of jewelry. 

 GURVEY: But the picture was not as pretty at some of the nation`s traditional retailers. Sales at J.C. Penney (JCP) and Sears (S) disappointed. Industry analysts say that was because those chains failed to update their brands to shake off their image as generic department stores. They say to succeed, a store must convince consumers that it is different. They also recommend that investors pay more attention to profits than to total sales. 

 JEFFREY EDELMAN, RETAIL ANALYST, PAINEWEBBER: We`re looking for the companies that have shown nice, consistent improvement not only in sales but their operating margin, because that ultimately drives earnings. Now having said that, we have on our buy list Federated, Dayton-Hudson (DH), Nordstrom (JWN), which we think is making very slow progress, as well as companies like Costco (COST) and Wal-Mart (WMT) that are just continuing to blow the cover off the ball. 

 GERSH: Online sales known as e-commerce got a lot of the headlines this holiday season and certainly took a lot of the advertising dollars. But they still amounted to only a few percent of total sales. Scott Gurvey, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 GHARIB: MicroStrategy (MSTR) has macro ideas to become a household name. It`s just announced a major deal to license its software. As Stephanie Woods reports, starting on Super Bowl Sunday, Americans will be hearing more about this little known company. 

 STEPHANIE WOODS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor knows what he wants, and isn`t shy about saying so. 

 MICHAEL SAYLOR, CEO, MICROSTRATEGY: We want to change the world. We want to have 100 million people depend upon us every day of the week, every hour of the day. And when I say depend, I mean literally, there`s a burglar in your neighborhood and you should not go outside right now. I want that kind of Intelligence to be available to everybody in real time, all the time. 

 WOODS: MicroStrategy develops software that culls databases for information. It`s called data mining. NASDAQ uses the software to sift though millions of trades to look for signs of insider trading. Wal-Mart uses it to evaluate consumer buying patterns. Now MicroStrategy is working on bringing the technology directly to consumers. For example, AmeriTrade (AMTD) uses the company`s Strategy.com software to alert customers to changes in their stock portfolios. MicroStrategy is also talking with airlines about using its software to page passengers when a flight is delayed. It wants companies pick up the tab for those services. 

 SAYLOR: A company like McDonald`s, right, I mean would love to sponsor a community channel whereby, you know, you get an alert if school is out or if there`s a snow day or if soccer practice is delayed because while they are telling you soccer is delayed, they`re telling the soccer mom that burgers are two for one. It`s good branding for them. It`s good advertising. 

 WOODS: MicroStrategy has begun a national advertising campaign of its own. The company will spend $2.5 million to air this commercial during the upcoming Super Bowl. Investors already have taken notice. Its stock price has soared from $32 in August to $200 today. Earlier this week, the company announced a 2 for 1 stock split. But to keep growing, the company will have to keep ahead of the competition. Big names like Oracle (ORCL), as well as lesser known firms like Broadvision (BVSN), Epiphany and Vignette (VIGN), all have similar software. 

 DAVID HILAL, ANALYST, FRIEDMAN, BILLINGS, RAMSEY: In technology, as you know, new companies are popping up daily. Today, I view MicroStrategy as having the technology leadership, but they must always continue to invest in research and development to maintain that leadership. 

 WOODS: The Super Bowl ads are expected to launch MicroStrategy into the spotlight. Analysts are watching to see if it can execute the plays that make it a winner. Stephanie Woods, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Vienna, Virginia. 

 KANGAS: For the second day running, the blue chips won the day on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average coming in with a 130 point gain on top of yesterday`s 124 point upturn and the advance/decline ratio the best we`ve seen it in quite some time, 19 to 11 positive. Forty-six new highs for the year, 78 new lows. 

 Compaq Computer (CPQ) topped the active list on 15.3 million shares, down 3/16. 

 Then American Online (AOL) fell 3 11/16. 

 But Citigroup , in a strong financial sector, up 3 3/8 and that helped the Dow. 

 You see Lucent Technology (LU) down 3 9/16 and in after hours trading after that earnings warning the stock was as low as 50 5/8. 

 Burlington Northern (BNI) rising 2 1/2. The IMG Barings Brokerage (LAT) upgraded it from a "buy" to a "strong buy" and has a $30 a share target. 

 Ann Taylor (ANN) plunging 6 1/4 points. The company`s December same store sales were up only 9/10 percent. 

 Tyco International (TYC) back pedaling a bit, down 7/16. 

 But Exxon Mobil (XOM), in a strong oil group, gaining 4 5/8. PaineWebber made some positive comments about the oil group in general and this stock in particular. 

 Kroger (KR) was down 3/4. 

 And then Health Management (HMA) 10th in volume, gained a point. 

 Caterpillar (CAT) up 2 3/16. PaineWebber upgraded it from "neutral" to "attractive." 

 FDX (FDX), that really helped the Dow Transport Index, up 4 7/8. The company said no specific news but perhaps a $0.13 per barrel drop in New York February oil futures helped a bit. 

 Lehman Brothers (LEH) up 2 7/8 on good earnings fourth quarter, better than expected at $2.28 a share, up from last year`s $0.51. 

 3M Company (MMM) up 7 1/2 points, easily the Dow`s biggest point gainer today. 

 Procter and Gamble (PG) up 4 13/16 after Prudential Securities upgraded it from "accumulate" to a "strong buy" for P&G 

 And finally, Sony (SNE) down 32 1/16, traded as low as 208. Reuters reported that Sony`s president thought the recent spike up in the stock lifted it excessively high to a bubble level. The company has no comment on whether he made that statement or not. 

 Pediatrics Medical Group (PDX), the best percentage gainer of the day, up 1 9/16. The company suggested that may be a positive reaction to its acquisition of a St. Louis neonatal practice and another one in Florida. 

 Barnes and Noble (BKS) up 3 5/8. The company`s holiday season superstore sales were up a respectable 5.8 percent. 

 Pier 1 Imports (PIR) rising 1 point. December same store sales up 6.1 percent. 

 Indymac Mortgage Holdings (NDE) up 1 7/16. Prudential Securities began covering the stock today with a "strong buy" recommendation and a $20 a share price target. 

 REX Stores (RSC) plunging almost 15 points. The company had only a slight rise in December same store sales. The company sells consumer electronics products and household appliances, things like that. And 

 Gerard Crower Brokerage downgraded the stock from "buy" to "hold," really got hit. 

 And Mandalay Resort Group (MBG) down nearly 4, this company predicting fourth quarter earnings of only $0.16, $0.09 below the Street estimate. 

 NASDAQ trading, a loss of 150.41, almost 4 percent. Volume heavy at 1.5, almost 1.6 billion. But that`s 138 million below yesterday`s pace. And yet the advance/decline ratio not that bad, 18 to 21 negative. 

 Yahoo! (YHOO) down 42 and a fraction. 

 QUALCOMM (QCOM) off another 16 3/8. 

 And then MicroSoft (MSFT) down 3 13/16. 

 Oracle (ORCL) fell 6. 

 MCI WorldComm (WCOM) dropping just over 4 1/16 after Salomon Smith Barney cut Year 2000 estimates by $0.03 a share to $1.90 and also reduced revenue growth estimates from 15.2 percent to 14.4 percent. 

 CMGI (CMGI), the high tech incubator, down 32 3/4. 

 Cisco Systems (CSCO) off 1 11/16. And that`s partially in reaction to the Lucent news, no doubt. 

 Intel (INTC) off 4 7/8. 

 JDS Uniphase (JDSU) lost 8 1/2. 

 And Sun MicroSystem (SUNW) down 3 7/8. 

 The Cobalt Group (CBLT) had a good day, up 13 5/8 on news it`ll launch a dealer to dealer automotive Web site. It`s going to be called Motorplace.com. 

 Urban Outfitters (URBN) plunging 9 points. The company reported lower than expected December same store sales. They were actually down 3 percent. 

 And AHL Services (AHLS) plunging 6 1/2 points. The company`s in the staffing business and it issued a fourth quarter profit warning. 

 The NASDAQ too-I mean the American Exchange Index down 1.12. 

 And Sonus (SSN) was up 1 1/2, the best percentage gainer. It has hearing care clinics and the stock may have completed a technical bottom recently. That`s what it looks like on a chart. 

 Telephone and Data Systems (TDS) down 10 3/8. No news from that company either. It could be profit taking. It`s more than doubled in the last year. 

 And finally, the Index Shares, Diamonds were up 1 point. 

 But losses in the NASDAQ 100 and the Depositary Receipts. 

 That`s the Wall Street Wrap Up. Susie? 

 GHARIB: Paul, the business to business e-commerce race is heating up and analysts say Ariba is in the lead. Ariba`s Chairman and CEO, Keith Krach, says the key to his company`s success is simple, when the customer talks, Ariba listens. Ariba went public almost seven months ago. It had a market cap of over $16 billion at the end of `99. Ariba has over $45 million in annual revenues and its annual sales growth is up over 440 percent. In this week`s prime movers segment, Donald Van de Mark of Myprimetime.com asks Krach how Ariba makes money 

 KEITH KRACH, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ARIBA: Well, it started off in the e- procurement area in terms of automating these big business buyers. We`ve expanded that to the Ariba network in terms of linking the suppliers on the electronic commerce network as well as a number of digital exchanges out there in the marketplace. For example, we just announced a very significant deal with AMS and state and local governments where they`re really creating business to government what we call B to G portal out there in the state and local governments. 

 DONALD VAN DE MARK, MYPRIMETIME.COM: There`s some who project that B to B e-commerce, business to business, will be $1.3 trillion in just three years. Is that realistic? 

 KRACH: I think it might even be conservative. If you look at the amount of business that`s being conducted just on a traditional basis, it`s probably 10X that. You know, we see this, everybody jumping on board this whole area of business to business electronic commerce. So it could even, it could even beat those projections. 

 VAN DE MARK: I know it`s very difficult for you to talk about sales and particularly earnings but there are analysts who expect you to grow earnings by 63 percent over the next five years. Is it ludicrous to look that far out? 

 KRACH: You know, I don`t think it is because if, you know, the past is a little bit of a predictor of the future, I think that`s certainly possible. 

 VAN DE MARK: How do you stay ahead of that kind of technological evolution? 

 KRACH: Technology`s evolving very quickly and we really stay ahead of it in two ways. The first is have a great team of technologists, computer scientists, product development engineers, product planners. But the second way, which I think is the most important, is listening to customers. Even though we`re an innovative company at Ariba, we believe listening is more important than innovation. 

 VAN DE MARK: If I could back up a second. 

 KRACH: Sure. 

 VAN DE MARK: And talk about the development of the business, the founding of it, at Myprimetime we`d like to have the same kind of growth in value. But you started with a company that was worth $16 million, nine months later, $113 million, now worth $10 billion. Do you ever step back and say good lord, what have we created here? 

 KRACH: Well, you know, we don`t focus on that valuation. I think if you look at things like a stock price, you know, on a daily basis, it`ll drive you crazy. What we`re focusing on is building the long-term value and I think those valuations really reflect our leadership position in this huge marketplace. 

 VAN DE MARK: Keith Krach, Founder, CEO, Chairman and President of Ariba, thank you very much for joining us. 

 KRACH: Thank you. 

 KANGAS: Tomorrow, our Friday market monitor guest is Eugene Peroni, Jr., Vice President of John Nuveen and Company (JNC). 

 GHARIB: The World Bank is giving new meaning to going global. For the first time ever it`s planning a $3 billion global bond offering over the Internet. It`s the first offering ever to be marketed, distributed and traded online. The bank provides loans to developing countries and has been issuing debt securities for more than 50 years for projects in more than 130 countries. 

 KANGAS: Pratt and Whitney, one of the world`s three big jet engine makers, is considering further job cuts because the world aviation market is in a stall. The company is already in the midst of a restructuring and had previously announced it would slash 3,500 positions. But today, Pratt`s president said slumping sales could require even more cuts. The stock of Pratt and Whitney`s parent company, United Technologies (UTX), nevertheless, gained 2 13/16 to close at 61 9/16. 

 GHARIB: Tonight`s commentator says the world will be different in the year 2000 and so should the World Trade Organization. Here`s Barbara Hackman Franklin, president of Barbara Franklin Enterprises and former U.S. Secretary of Commerce. 

 BARBARA HACKMAN FRANKLIN, COMMENTARY: The year 2000 brings a presidential election. One issue is how U.S. companies will fare in the global economy and whether the World Trade Organization is a help or not. Last year we watched the WTO debacle in Seattle. The 135 countries couldn`t agree on much and the protests made clear that we lack a consensus about whether free trade is a good thing. Business is for it, organized labor is against it. And there`s the fear of job loss. Now, this makes the politics interesting. We must be for more trade. It is key to growing the global economy. The U.S. is the world`s largest exporter and we need open markets. And that is what the WTO is trying to advance. Also, there is a mechanism to settle disputes among countries. The U.S. is the biggest user of that system and we win most of the time. It`s ironic, in the WTO, the U.S. is resented for being a heavy but is also looked to for leadership. What we need is a new style of U.S. leadership. We need a president who will tell the American people why free trade is good for us and set a cooperative tone around the world, a president who works to tear down trade barriers but without telling other countries what to do. We`ve got to make the global trading system work. Let`s listen carefully to the candidates. I`m Barbara Hackman Franklin. 

 KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, the Dow gained 130 points but the NASDAQ Index fell 150. And please join us at our Worldwide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword: NBR. 

 GHARIB: And finally, there`s an old saying that the bigger the paycheck, the bigger the problems. Well, that seems to be case for billionaire Larry Ellison. The CEO of Oracle software is suing a California airport for the right to land his $38 billion private jet around the clock. The San Jose airport bans planes weighing more than 75,000 pounds from landing after 11:30 at night because of all the noise. Ellison`s Gulfstream 5 weighs 90,000 pounds, but he says his jet is quieter than some of the lighter planes. And what about you, Paul? You don`t have any problems with landing rights, huh? 

 KANGAS: Well, about the only Gulfstream I ride on is on a boat. It`s out here about three miles off the coast of Miami. It`s a trade current. 

 GHARIB: Let`s not give the wrong impression. NBR, Paul and Susie, none of us have private jets. That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Thursday, January 6th. I`m Susie Gharib. Good night, everyone. Good night to you, Paul. 

 KANGAS: Good night, Susie. I`m Paul Kangas, wishing all of you the best of good buys.

 N.Y. Stocks Diverge Again; Ring Out New, Bring Out Old

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The dynamics changed, but the results didn't, as investors foresook high-technology stocks in favor of stodgy old value names again on Thursday. 

 Shares of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing climbed 7 1/2 to 100 3/4, while Dow Chemical moved ahead 3 3/4 to 136 15/16, and Bowater shot up 3 13/16 to 58 13/16. 

 Capital-equipment stocks, a group that has few backers, found many Thursday. Caterpillar gained 2 1/2 to 51 5/8, after PaineWebber raised its rating on the stock, calling its stock depressed after two years of mediocre market performance. Deere rose 2 1/4 to 46 1/16, finally overtaking the 52-week high set last April, after Merrill Lynch issued an upbeat report about the stock. 

 Consumer stocks attracted buyers as well, with Gillette gaining 1 7/16 to 41 5/16, Pepsico gained 1 9/16 to 36 5/8, and Procter & Gamble, talked up in a Prudential Securities research note, moved 4 5/8 higher to end at 107 3/4. 

 Meanwhile, stocks of cutting-edge technology companies that, up until this week, could command virtually any price, couldn't find buyers, even at considerable discounts. Shares of Yahoo! sank 42 5/16 to 368 3/16, after trading at more than 500 a share just two days ago. Akamai Technologies shed 47 3/8 to 236 1/8 on Nasdaq. Internet hothouse CMGI surrendured 33 points to finish at 250. (All three trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market.) 

 The divergence in the market showed up in the performance of market averages. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 130.61, a rise of 1.17%, to end at 11253.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index, by comparison, sank 150.31, or 3.88%, to end at 3727.23. The loss, on a points basis, represented the second-steepest one-day sell-off for the composite index, trailing only the 229.46 points lost on Tuesday. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 11253.26, up 130.61. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,961 issues advancing, 1,147 declining and 424 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,077,226,330 shares, compared with 1,068,214,600 Wednesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 627.54, up 6.47. The average price per share rose 44 cents. 

 "Investors are lowering their exposure to a lot of these dot.com names, looking for safety instead," Adam Weisman, managing director at SoundView Technology, said Thursday, adding, though, that sellers hadn't been panicking, since most of them still had big profits even in the stocks that are down sharply from their highs. 

 The scope of those profits, of course, has sown the seeds of the technology group's own undoing, as investors with big paper profits declined to cash out until the new year got underway, owing to tax considerations. 

 Now, since Monday's close, when it set a closing record of 41.31.15, the Nasdaq composite has fallen 403.91, a 9.7% drop, just shy of the 10% standard generally regarded as the definition of a textbook correction. 

 Compared with the declines of the two previous trading days, Thursday's sell-off had a slightly different texture - a sense that, more than simply market internals, fundamentals had begun to deteriorate, as well. 

 Investors showed increasing concern, for example, over fourth-quarter profit strength, after computer maker Gateway issued a warning late Wednesday that its quarterly profits wouldn't live up to Wall Street's expectations. The stock, which closed at 62 1/4 in primary NYSE trading Wednesday, only to fall in composite trading after hours that day, finished Thursday at 59 11/16. 

 Other computer makers struggled, as well. Hewlett-Packard lost 4 5/8 to 103 1/4, Dell Computer fell 1 15/16 to 48 on Nasdaq, and Apple Computer dropped 9 to 95, also on Nasdaq. 

 Application software stocks, routed earlier this we by an earnings warning from BMC Software, lost ground again. That stock lost 35% Wednesday, then declined 4 13/16 Thursday to end at 44 3/4 on Nasdaq. Shares of CompuWare fell 6 15/16 to 25 1/8 on Nasdaq after company officials, appearing at an investor conference, talked about their quarterly targets. 

 Other software developers, such as Mercury Interactive, which dropped 8 1/16 to 81 7/16, and Oracle, down 6 at 96, both on Nasdaq, also suffered declines. 

 The wariness about the earnings outlook even prompted Wall Street to engage in a measure of rumor-mongering. Speculation that Microsoft would guide its quarterly targets lower sent the stock, and market averages, sharply lower in intraday trading; a Microsoft spokesman said the company has not changed its guidance for the quarter. The stock finished 3 13/16 lower at 110.

 Market Savvy Savvy Confidential / A Briefing for Investors Hot CSC Stock Could Cool Down, Analyst Warns

 While several tech companies issued profit warnings Wednesday, an analyst issued a bit of a warning of his own for one Southland stock. 

 El Segundo-based Computer Sciences Corp. shares fell 7% after Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut its rating on the third-largest computer services company, citing the stock's brisk rise in the last three months--but not predicting an earnings bomb. 

 Computer Sciences (ticker symbol: CSC) dropped $6.50 to $86.13 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 

 Analyst Thomas Rooney lowered his rating to a "market perform" from a "buy," noting the more-than-50% increase in Computer Sciences' shares since early October. The stock rocketed at a time when many other computer services companies fell on concerns that customers were scaling back purchases until after the year 2000 transition. 

 Now, he warned, it could be due to cool down. 

 "All Y2K lock-down fears have been priced out of the stock, and it is now fully valued," Rooney said in his report. 

 Rooney raised his rating on Computer Sciences in October, setting a three-month price target of $70 a share. 

 Wednesday's cut doesn't change his generally positive view of the company's operations, he stressed. Computer Sciences "continues to announce significant contract wins and has an improving pipeline in federal and commercial sectors," he said. 

 The company has signed a record $16 billion in new business in the last year. Computer Sciences' base of long-term contracts reduces its exposure to more competitive markets such as electronic commerce, he said. 

 The shares reached a record of $94.63 on Dec. 31, a 47% gain for 1999. By comparison, Electronic Data Systems Corp. (EDS), its next-biggest rival, rose 33% last year. 

 Meanwhile Wednesday, shares of at least three other Southern California companies moved in the other direction as equity analysts upgraded their opinions: 

 * Santa Monica-based Stamps.com Inc. (STMP) rose $4.19, or 10%, to $45.44 on Nasdaq. The Internet-postage company was raised to "trading buy" from "market outperform" by Rakesh Sood at Goldman, Sachs & Co., who said he expects the stock to reach $75 within a year. 

 * Global Crossing Ltd. (GBLX), which has executive offices in Los Angeles but is incorporated in Bermuda, rose $1.25, or 3%, to $48 on Nasdaq. The builder of fiber-optic networks was rated "buy" in new coverage by Daniel Reingold at Credit Suisse First Boston Inc. 

 * And Santa Barbara-based Plastic Surgery Co. (PSU) rose 38 cents to $6.50 on the Amex after being rated "buy" in new coverage by Georgia Kounadis at H.C. Wainwright, with a price target of $12. Plastic Surgery has been an ugly performer: The stock went public Dec. 10 at $8 a share and quickly got nipped.

 Power Surge for Utilities 

 Electric and gas utility shares rose sharply Wednesday, building on Tuesdays rebound, as some investors sought safety in the jittery market. The Dow Jones utility stock index jumped 3.8% Wednesday to 289.11 after gaining 0.7% on Tuesday. But the index remains 13% below its all-time high of 333.45 set last summer. Utility stocks have slumped as market interest rates have risen over the last year, making bonds more competitive with utilities dividend yields. A look at some major utility issues, including current annualized dividend yields:

 Lucent  profit warning  threatens to fuel more tech stock selling

 NEW YORK (AP) - Lucent Technologies warned late Thursday that profits were disappointing near the end of 1999, discouraging news from a popular company that may hasten this week's rapid retreat from record highs by technology stocks. Lucent's shares plunged as much as 30 percent, most of it coming after the warning. 

 Lucent, a former AT&T unit and a top supplier of Internet equipment, said in a statement it expects to report profits of 36 cents to 39 cents per share for the last three months of 1999. 

 Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of about 54 cents a share for the period, the company's first quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. Lucent, which earned 48 cents per share in the final three months of 1998, plans to report its official earnings for the quarter on Jan. 20. 

 Investors pummeled the company's stock after the announcement, which followed the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Lucent had already fallen $3.37 1/2 to $69 a share before the warning, and then tumbled as much as $13.37 1/2 to $50.62 1/2 in late trading on other markets. 

 The profit warning by Lucent, the most widely held stock in the nation, was sure to aggravate worries that high-flying technology and Internet shares won't be able to justify last year's huge gains. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index has fallen nearly 10 percent in three days, falling 150.34 points to 3,727.20 on Thursday. The loss, which would have been the biggest point drop ever if not for Tuesday's record 229-point fall, left Nasdaq about 400 points from the record high of 4,131.15 reached on Monday. 

 The company, based in Murray Hill, N.J., tried to put a positive spin on the announcement, saying its factories struggled to meet a surprisingly rapid shift by customers to products based on Lucent's latest fiber-optic technology. Those problems are expected to be resolved by the end of the current quarter. 

 Lucent also blamed delays in deployment of network equipment by certain customers, weak software revenues and disappointing profit margins. 

 Making matters worse, the company also cautioned that it wouldn't meet more optimistic expectations for this year's revenues. 

 "We still expect our revenues to continue to grow 3-to-5 percentage points faster than the overall communications networking market," said Lucent chairman and chief executive Richard McGinn. "However, given the slow start for the year, we expect to be in the lower end of that range for fiscal 2000." 

 In its press release, Lucent said analysts estimate that the communications networking market is growing at about 14 percent a year.

 For weeks now, US stock market investors have wilfully ignored the rising tide of economists warning that America's interest rates are heading higher. Yesterday, when two forecasters said they thought rates could be moving up by a point or more by the year-end, Wall Street could no longer push aside the bearish predictions.Profit-taking added to the mix and all the major indices lost significant ground, the Nasdaq shedding more than 5%. Investors know it will be difficult for the indices to record double-digit gains if rates are substantially higher. Increased rates would crimp corporate profits, reduce domestic demand and make interest-based investments more attractive, potentially threatening the liquidity that drove the Nasdaq up 85% last year.Some investors were adjusting their portfolio mix even before the latest rates predictions. The Japanese pulled $31 billion out of US stocks in 1999 while adding Treasuries to their portfolios. 

  Europeans and Americans keep dumping money in the US stock market but for how much longer is anyone's guess. The shift in thinking on rates is a small vindication for London-based investment advisers, who have generally been more bearish about US prospects than their colleagues on Wall Street.The growing consensus is that the Fed may have to step on the brakes quite dramatically to get the US economy to slow enough to sidestep inflation. The bond market had by the end of yesterday priced in more than a quarter-point rise in the Fed funds rate for February, when the Fed policymaking committee next meets.One irrational fear is that several rate moves will be concentrated in the first few months of the year so the Fed can avoid making headlines closer to the Presidential election in November. The reappointment of Alan Greenspan to another term should be reassuring on that point, as he is not one to act precipitously. The nervousness will make this Friday's unemployment report all the more significant. The markets are expecting a jobs gain of around 230,000 and negligible increases in hourly earnings. Any surprise to the upside would come at a very bad time.

 PAUL KANGAS: A profit warning from one of the nation`s big computer makers: it looks like Y2K problems are taking a toll on its earnings. Good evening. I`m Paul Kangas in Miami. 

 SUSIE GHARIB: And I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. The blue chips stage a comeback after yesterday`s big sell-off: the Dow gains back 124 points, but the NASDAQ ends the day in the red, down 24. And catalog retailers are looking pretty attractive these days to Internet e-tailers. We`ll tell you why. 

 GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. A profit warning tonight from Gateway (GTW). It says fourth-quarter earnings will be 7 cents lower than expected because of a slowdown in sales on Y2K concerns. Investors sold Gateway stock in after hours trading; the computer maker fell as much as 6 points. Well, Gateway`s news reinforces Wall Street`s worries about tech stocks. Even though the Dow bounced back today with a gain of 124 points, tech and financial stocks pulled down the NASDAQ. Erika Miller reports. 

 ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Analysts say fears are growing that fourth-quarter earnings for many high tech companies will fall short of expectations. But Art Russell is still optimistic about the outlook for the sector. 

 ART RUSSELL, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, EDWARD JONES: You know, people have had time to take pause, evaluate their portfolio, the allocation of their assets, their risk tolerance, maybe lock in some profits on some of these high flyers, and try and reallocate some of that to other areas. And I believe it`s healthy. And I think we`ll snap back out of it. 

 MILLER: Analysts say investors are also nervous about the possibility of another rate increase next month by the Federal Reserve. Add to that profit taking: some investors who had planned to sell stocks last year, held off until this year in order to postpone paying tax on the gains until 2001. Those interest rate worries also hurt financial stocks again today, though many bank shares managed a late-day recovery. Still, analyst Mike Mayo is keeping his "sell" recommendation on most money center banks. 

 MICHAEL MAYO, BANK ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: However, we do not think the damage is done. We still think it is early to jump into the banking sector. Additional Federal Reserve interest rate increases can cause unexpected margin declines later in the year. 

 MILLER: The big question on investors minds is where technology and financial stocks go from here. There is no consensus by analysts on when the selling will end, but most agree that investors can count on more volatility. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 KANGAS: Sifting through the ruins of yesterday`s sharp sell-off on Wall Street, investors found a number of blue chips stocks attractive this morning, but many still wanted to reduce their holdings in the formerly high-flying technology sector. As a result, by 10:30 a.m. the Dow Industrial Average managed to recover nearly 50 points of yesterday`s 359-point plunge, but the NASDAQ Index lost another 125 points on top of Tuesday`s record 229-point loss. Solid buying support throughout the morning in old stalwarts like ALCOA (AA), Dupont (DD), 3M (MMM), Boeing (BA), and IBM restored some of the bullish confidence shattered yesterday and New York Exchange breadth turned from 3 to 2 negative early on to a 15 to 13 positive ratio by noontime, when the Industrial Average was up nearly 72 points while the NASDAQ Index had trimmed its loss to 91 points. Continuing strength in the blue chips throughout very active afternoon trading kept the NASDAQ market on the mend. At the final bell, the Dow Industrial Average itself was sporting a gain of 124.72 points putting it at 11122.65. In today`s wide 276 point trading range the Industrial Average closed up 184 points from its worst level of the session. The NASDAQ Composite really cuts its losses considerably down to a closing loss of 24.15 at 3877.54. In its wide 190 point range, the Composite settled 46.75 points below its best level of the day. Not bad, pretty decent comeback! Trading volume on big board over a billion shares. Well up from yesterday. And about 50 million more shares of up volume than down volume. 

 The Dow Transports Index was up 5.19. 

 Utilities had a huge gain of 10.60. All 15 utility stocks in the Dow were up. That is Dow utility average. 

 The Closing Tick neutral at -5. 

 Standard & Poor`s 500 up 2.69. 

 Just over a 2 1/2 point rise in the S&P 100. 

 MidCap 400 up 3.83. 

 And the CRB Bridge Futures Price Index fell a 1/4. 

 New York Stock Exchange Composite Index up 2.20. 

 A similar gain in the Value Line. 

 Russell2000 Small Cap up .45. 

 And the Wilshire 5000 up just over 10 points. 

 The bond market opened lower on profit taking after yesterday`s sharp rally, and some additional selling was triggered by the report that November new factory orders jumped a larger than expected 1.2 percent, an increase that was likely or will be likely to influence the Fed toward hiking interest rates. This market was also hurt by the absence of safe haven buying due to the nice rally in stocks today. 

 Tax free and corporates ended down 3/8 to 5/8 of a point on average. The Treasury market was down across the board. 

 An 11/32 loss in the 5-year notes. 

 The 10-year notes down 22/32. 

 Bellwether 30-year bond off 1 5/32, bringing the yield back up to 6.63 percent. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index was down nearly 13 1/2 points. 

 I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie. 

 GHARIB: Paul, the stock of Amazon.com went down river today, sinking more than 12 points or almost 15 percent. Investors bailed out on news that Amazon`s holiday sales boomed but they won`t help the company`s bottom line. This raised questions about future prospects for online retailers. We have two reports this evening, beginning with Stephanie Woods. 

 STEPHANIE WOODS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The holiday results are in and analysts say Amazon customers got a better deal than shareholders. Amazon`s fourth quarter sales more than doubled from last year, but the company lured shoppers with heavy discounts and the e-tailer says fourth quarter red ink will not slow down, as some analysts had hoped. The stock has been under pressure this week as investors doubt Amazon can justify its $25 billion market capitalization. 

 MARK ROWAN, INTERNET RETAIL ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: It`s put tremendous pressure on them to grow very, very quickly, perhaps too quickly, getting into new businesses, maybe even spread a little bit too thin. And each business that they enter now is probably incrementally a little less valuable than the last one that they entered. 

 WOODS: From toys to tools, Amazon says 99 percent of orders shipped in time to meet holiday deadlines. But even with overall customer satisfaction high, it`s likely to be years before investors see any profits. That`s why Robertson Stephens downgraded Amazon from "strong buy" to "buy." 

 LAUREN COOKS LEVITAN, SENIOR ETAILING ANALYST, ROBERTSON STEPHENS: As we head into the first part of the year I think it`ll be more difficult for Amazon to really stand out as a stock. So in the first part of the year we`re looking for the stock to somewhat go sideways and really move with the market. 

 WOODS: But Levitan is still optimistic about Amazon`s long-term prospects. 

 LEVITAN: We think they have a very unique opportunity to partner with other companies and have them pay them to be the conduit between the other e-tailers and those Amazon shoppers. That can be very high margin revenue opportunities for Amazon. 

 WOODS: Analysts say Internet stocks that aren`t dependent on holiday sales are the ones to look at now. People auctioning unwanted holiday gifts could help eBay (EBAY). Travelers who waited out Y2K could boost sales for Travelocity and Priceline (PCLN). Stephanie Woods, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Diane Eastabrook. For Spiegel (SPGLA), jumping onto the Internet has been relatively easy and profitable. When the catalog company went online a few years ago it already had 95 years of experience filling customer orders. 

 DEBORAH KOOPMAN, VICE PRESIDENT, THE SPIEGEL GROUP: We already had the infrastructure in place. Once we took the order it was the same process for us whether the order came over the Internet or via our phones. 

 EASTABROOK: Retail industry watchers say the fulfillment centers most catalogers have in place make them attractive acquisition targets to a lot of pure play e-tailers. Now many Internet retailers farm out order processing and distribution to other companies. Some of those e-tailers got burned this holiday season because customer orders were not filled correctly or on time. Veteran catalog consultant Maxwell Sroge says buying a cataloger with an existing system could be less expensive for e-tailers than building a fulfillment system. He also believes many e-tailers could use their high stock values as leverage to buy lower valued catalogers. 

 MAXWELL SROGE, PRESIDENT, MAXWELL SROGE COMPANY: The Internet guys now have the money, you know, and they are able to pay megabucks for businesses. 

 EASTABROOK: Analysts say the most likely acquisition targets are those catalog companies with large customer lists and strong brand names. Among those touted by one retail analyst are Lillian Vernon (LVC) and Lands` End (LE). 

 DEREK LECKOW, RETAIL ANALYST, BARRINGTON RESEARCH ASSOCIATES: Lands End has private label products. It has relationships with suppliers. It has a customer file that is growing. So those are all assets that are very difficult to go out and buy. 

 EASTABROOK: Leckow does point out that the prospect of higher interest rates and lower stock valuations for some e-tailers could make mergers with catalog companies more expensive in the months ahead. But he says some e-tailers may have to pay that higher price if they want to survive. Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago. 

 GHARIB: Higher interest rates are not only a worry for e-tailers, but all investors. Stocks and bonds have been under pressure recently on speculation that the Federal Reserve will raise rates at its February meeting. Here to talk about this is our bridge colleague, Mark Serlin. Hi, Mark. 

 MARK SERLIN, ECONOMIST, BRIDGENEWS: Hi, Susie. 

 GHARIB: As you know, there`s been a lot of talk recently and a lot of worries that the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates. Do you think that these concerns are warranted? 

 SERLIN: I think they`re definitely warranted. The economy`s doing very well. The interesting thing, I think, is that this tightening Fed rate tightening frenzy is taking place at the same time people are start to revise down their growth estimates. The economy`s doing very well, there`s no doubt about. Consumer spending is very strong. But I think the economy`s not growing as fast as we thought a couple of weeks ago. And as that psychology or as that realization sinks in, I think talk of a 50 basis point rake hike is going to start to fade. 

 GHARIB: What about the employment report that comes out this Friday? Do you think that that`ll give some ammunition for the argument to raise interest rates? 

 SERLIN: I think that employment report is going to show the economy is very strong, the labor markets are very tight. But there`s no inflation pressures resulting from that. The year over year growth rate in average hourly earnings is perhaps the most important part of that report. It`s peaked and now actually trending downward. So if we get another strong labor market report without inflation, there`s no new news in that. 

 GHARIB: All right, so what are you saying bottom line that`s going to happen at that February meeting of the Federal Reserve? 

 SERLIN: I think they`re going to tighten by 25 basis points. I think the odds of doing nothing are greater than the odds of a 50 basis point hike. 

 GHARIB: All right, well, we`ll leave it there and we`ll know in a few weeks. Thank you very much, Mark, for briefing us. 

 SERLIN: Thank you. 

 GHARIB: We`ve been talking with Mark Serlin of BridgeNews. 

 KANGAS: Just like the cavalry, it was the blue chips to the rescue today. A good day for some of the old stalwarts, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average scored a 124 3/4 point closing gain. Broader market higher by a 17 to 13 ratio. Still only 27 new highs for the year as against 125 new lows. 

 Compaq Computer (CPQ) topped the active list on nearly 23 million shares, moving up a 1/2. It gave back a little of that in after hours trading on the Gateway (GTW) profit warning. But also, Compaq and AOL have an agreement where AOL subscribers will eventually be able to access the Internet, send their e-mail and things like that through Compaq`s handheld computers. 

 American Online (AOL) down 1 7/8. 

 Disney (DIS) up another 1 5/16 after gaining 1 3/4 yesterday when Morgan Stanley upgraded it to "outperform." 

 Citicorp trying to stabilize after recent losses, up 1/4. 

 Lucent Technology (LU) dropped nearly 2. 

 IBM (IBM), the star of the Dow, up 6 3/16. Bank America Brokerage issued a "strong buy" on big blue and has a target of $150 a share. 

 Philip Morris (MO) down 1/8. 

 AT&T (T) dropped 7/16. 

 Tyco International (TYC), a 7/8 point loss there. 

 And finally, Bank of America (BAC), 10th in volume, rose 1/2. 

 Boeing (BA) did well, up 2 7/16 on news the company received a $300 million contract from Taiwan for Chinook helicopters. 

 Computer Sciences (CSC) tumbling 6 1/2. Donaldson Lufkin Brokerage downgraded it from "buy" to just a "market perform" rating. 

 Chevron (CHV) did well, up 2 3/16. The ABN Amro Brokerage repeated a "buy" on that stock. 

 Duke Energy (DUK) up 2 7/16. All 15 Dow utility stocks, as I touched on, were up today and Duke was the best gainer. 

 GTE (GTE) rising 3 9/16. Bell Atlantic (BEL) and GTE, which are in the midst of a merger agreement, have proposed spinning off GTE`s Internet backbone operations. 

 Finally, Goldman Sachs (GS) down 3 1/2. J.P. Morgan Brokerage downgraded it from "long-term buy" to just a "market performer." 

 QMS (AQM) by far the best percentage gain, rising a full point. The company`s in a strategic pact with IBM where IBM will become a global service provider for QMS printers. 

 Pohang Iron and Steel (PKX), American Depositary shares up 4 5/8. The company`s founder is expected to be named as South Korea`s next prime minister on January 11th. 

 Family Dollar Stores (FDO) rising 1 1/2. Morgan Stanley Brokerage upgraded it from "out perform" to a "strong buy." Yesterday the company had higher fourth quarter earnings. 

 Safety Kleen (SK) the big loser of the day, down 3 1/16. First quarter earnings lower, $0.25 versus last year`s $0.27. And revenues dropped 14 percent. The company itself said it was disappointed with its industrial services performance. 

 InaCom (ICO) down 2 1/8 after rising 1 1/2 yesterday on news it was selling $370 million in assets. But today Moody`s Investor Service said it is considering cutting the debt rating on the company`s senior unsecured debt. 

 And Blockbuster (BBI) down 1 13/16. The Sidler Brokerage cut earnings estimates because of disappointing revenues. 

 NASDAQ trading, a loss of 24.15 but it was down nearly 150 at one stage. Trading volume the second highest on record and 220 million shares more than yesterday. Twenty-one stocks higher for about every 19 lower. 

 Yahoo! (YHOO) still under profit taking pressures, down 32 1/2. 

 QUALCOMM (QCOM) down 5 5/8. 

 Oracle (ORCL) dropped 5 11/16. 

 CMGI (CMGI), the high tech incubator, down 10 3/4. 

 But Microsoft (MSFT) bucked the trend, up 1 3/16, helping the Dow Industrial Average, I might mention. 

 Cisco Systems (CSCO) down 5/16.

 JDS Uniphase (JDSU) down 12 7/8 on profit taking. 

 Salon.com (SALN) did well, up 2 3/4 points. The company`s going to become a partner with Red Hat (RHAT) in providing Internet news. 

 And Intuit (INTU) up 17 9/16. Bear Stearns issued a "buy" recommendation. 

 Applix (APLX) was down 2 1/4 after that firm issued a fourth quarter profit warning saying it sees only $0.01 to $0.03 in earnings for the fourth quarter versus the Wall Street estimate of $0.10 a share. 

 The American Exchange Index was up 9.23. 

 Hungarian Telephone & Cable (HTC) rising 2 7/8, best percentage gainer. We talked to a company spokesman. He said no news but he is aware that the chief executive officer has felt for some time the stock was under valued. 

 And finally, Xcelera.com (XLA) up 23 7/8. Traded as high as 174 1/4. 

 Friday is the pay date for the 2 for 1 split stock. 

 The Index Shares had a mixed session but the standouts were the DIAMONDS (DIA), of course, thanks to the nice Dow stock rally. 

 The NASDAQ 100 slumped. 

 While the Depositary Receipts (SPY) closed up a fraction. 

 KANGAS: The final quarter of 1999 was certainly a good one for those who invested in high tech stocks. But how did the various mutual funds fare? To find out, let`s take our quarterly look at mutual fund results. And here to help us once again is Don Phillips of Morningstar. And, Don, welcome back to NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. 

 DON PHILLIPS, CEO, MORNINGSTAR: Thank you, Paul. 

 KANGAS: Don, why don`t we start by seeing which fund sectors did the best in the final three months of last year. 

 PHILLIPS: Well, if you look at the sectors, it really was the same story that you had in the market as a whole. The Internet area did terrific and so if you were technology oriented, if you were in technology or you were in communications, even the utilities really benefited from the phone companies and the communication type companies there and in health care, biotech. If you weren`t in those areas , you look at things like financial services and the returns were much more pedestrian. 

 KANGAS: Right. Now, turning to individual funds with assets of at least $50 million, it isn`t often we see quarrel gains in the triple digits, but I understand several funds did just that. 

 PHILLIPS: Well, it`s not often we see annual returns in the triple digits. I mean, you`re right. A number of funds did that in the fourth quarter alone. Here we saw again the story was technology. We saw the PBHG Group, which is very technology oriented, very high growth, a momentum player, did exceptionally well, even with some changes in management at some of these funds. Their style really prevailed. We also saw the pro funds, Ultra OTC, which is a leveraged play on the NASDAQ Index, turn in exceptional returns for the quarter. 

 KANGAS: All right. And now let`s find out which funds, which fund, I should say, was tops in performance for the full year. 

 PHILLIPS: Well, again, it was the Nicholas Applegate Global Technology Fund. This fund made a huge bet on the Internet a little over a year ago when a lot of people were questioning whether those stocks had sustainability. And they bet big on that. They did very well with IPOs early in the year and they ended up the year owning lots of the big established Internet players and just had a spectacular 12 month run. 

 KANGAS: And going out even further, which was the top fund in terms of five year performance? There we have it. 

 PHILLIPS: That with a would be the First Hand Technology Fund. It is a Kevin Landis Fund. Great idea here to take people whose expertise is in technology companies and then give them the ability to run a mutual fund. I think it shows that smart people who know their industry can do exceptionally well in the market. And I think that`s a good thing for investors as a whole. If you know what you`re investing in, you can do exceptionally well. 

 KANGAS: Don, according to the old saying bigger is better. But among the largest mutual funds, the quarterly gains are far below the levels of the leaders that we saw just a few minutes ago. What happened there? 

 PHILLIPS: Well, the real story is exposure to technology. The fund, the biggest funds, Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX), had the biggest exposure to technology. It had about the S&P 500s waiting. Actually, it went into the year with a bigger percentage and then trimmed it back a bit. That, and the Vanguard 500 Fund (VFINX), which mirrors the S&P 500, had very good returns but not the same as the tech heavy funds. 

 KANGAS: Now, Don... 

 PHILLIPS: You look... 

 KANGAS: OK. Just as in stocks, we saw some pretty big divergences in mutual fund performance over the past quarter. Looking ahead, do you expect any of the downtrodden mutual fund groups of `99 to make big comebacks? 

 PHILLIPS: Well, a trend in motion tends to stay that way. It seems that the party is still going on for the Internet oriented stocks. It`s going out a little more to the mid cap. It may be a while before value sees its day, but eventually it certainly will. 

 KANGAS: Don, most interesting and thanks so much for being with us. 

 PHILLIPS: Sure, Paul. 

 KANGAS: My guest, Don Phillips of Morningstar. 

 GHARIB: Tomorrow, the CEO of Arriba tells us why his software provider for e-commerce is growing at 60 percent a year. 

 GHARIB: Strong December sales at General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) helped the U.S. auto industry post its best year ever. GM sold 420,000 cars and trucks, up 6 1/2 percent from the previous December. For the year, sales rose 9 percent to five million units. As for Ford, it sold 316,000 vehicles, a slight gain from the previous December. For 1999, sales advanced 5 1/2 percent to just over four million units. 

 KANGAS: Steve Jobs is making it official. The Apple Computer (AAPL) cofounder says he`ll stay at the top spot of the computer giant. Jobs has been acting as the interim chief executive officer for more than two years where he`s overseen a stunning stock turnaround. Apple has gone from a low of $12.75 to a 52 week high of $118 per share. Today it was up 1 1/2 to close at 104. 

 GHARIB: In the money file tonight, mutual funds and an important factor to consider when you buy them. Here`s John Waggoner, mutual fund columnist for "USA Today." 

 JOHN WAGGONER, MUTUAL FUND COLUMNIST, "USA TODAY": Mutual funds now offer a bewildering alphabet soup of share classes, A shares, B shares, even Z shares. But if you`re investing a big sum like a pension distribution, stick with shares that let you pay your commission up front. In the beginning, there were A shares. They paid 4 to 6 percent of your fund purchase to your broker. But the industry made a not so surprising discovery: people love advice but they hate commissions. So funds rolled out B shares which have no up front load. You pay the commission over six years through higher annual fees. If you sell before the six years, you pay a redemption fee. Investors loved B shares because they had no up front commissions and so did brokers, because they got their commissions anyway. Most broker sold funds now offer variants of A and B shares but they have gone wild naming them. You can now buy share classes for nearly every letter of the alphabet, including Y, Z and N shares. In most cases, small investors pay about the same and B shares can sometimes be a better deal provided you hold your shares for 10 years or so. But if you`re investing a big sum like a retirement distribution stay away from B shares. Most fund companies reduce the sales charges for A shares but not for B shares and that can cost you lots of money. If you`re not sure which is best, check your long-term costs using the Securities and Exchange Commission`s nifty fund cost calculator. It`s at the SEC`s Internet site. One final word. If you don`t want to pay any commissions and feel you can invest on your own, there are hundreds of no load funds that have no commissions at all. I`m John Waggoner. 

 KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, the Dow gained 124 points while the NASDAQ Index fell 24. And please join us at our Worldwide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword NBR. 

 GHARIB: And that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, January 5th. I`m Susie Gharib. Have a good evening, everyone. And good night to you, Paul. 

 KANGAS: And good night, Susie. I`m Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.

 A Third Shoe? Baan Disappoints Investors Yet Again On Road to Recovery --- Dutch Software Firm Takes $200 Million Charge and CEO Quits; Stock Dives --- Dwindling Threat to Rivals

 Corrections & Amplifications   

 BAAN NV'S supervisory board chairman is Pierre Everaert. His name was misspelled in a page 1 article on Wednesday. Also, Baan's biggest enterprise software customer is Boeing Corp. The article incorrectly said that Boeing was the top client of another company. (WSJE -- Jan. 6, 2000)   

 Baan NV just crashed -- again. And rebooting is looking tougher than ever.   

 The once-highflying Dutch software maker blindsided the market with the resignation of its CEO and the announcement of a $200 million (195 million euros) restructuring charge, its third in five quarters. If nothing else, the developments did prove one thing: Baan hasn't lost the ability to disappoint investors.   

 Baan's shares plummeted 32%, or 4.68 euros, to 10.10 euros in Amsterdam, signaling the market is throwing in the towel on the company's tortured turnaround efforts. Once touted as a potent rival to business software market leaders SAP AG and Oracle Corp., Baan is now widely viewed as a software industry also-ran.   

 "From here on, the gauge of success for Baan will be whether and how soon they break even," says Douglas Lynn, a software industry watcher with META Group in Stamford, Connecticut. "They're never going to be an SAP or Oracle competitor. Those days are over."   

 The stock's plunge lopped 1 billion euros off Baan's market capitalization, leaving it with a market value of 2.16 billion euros. That's a far cry from March 1998 when Baan's market capitalization exceeded 12 billion euros, making it one of Europe's most highly valued technology companies.   

 Baan's problems started in the spring of 1998 when it emerged that it was selling software to private companies controlled by its two founders, Jan and Paul Baan, sparking concerns that it was artificially boosting its revenues. Under fire from investors and analysts, the company was forced to restate earnings again and again. Compounding its woes, Baan ran into trouble integrating a string of software companies it had acquired.   

 Baan's long-running troubles -- and the market's repeated mark-downs of its share price -- say much about the forces reworking the European business landscape. Rewards are sweet in this increasingly shareholder-driven environment, but punishment is quick and severe. Nothing gets swept under the rug, and investors never forget.   

 This is particularly true in the high-tech arena, where the valuations are higher and the tumble from the pedestal can be more dramatic. Ask Alcatel SA. Shares of the French telecommunications equipment supplier tumbled 38% in a single day when it announced a surprise profit warning 15 months ago. Or put in a call to Swedish mobile-phone giant Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson SA, which lost $8.7 billion in market capitalization just over a year ago after it issued its own profit warning and a plan to cut 10% of its work force.   

 Of the two main items of bad news Baan released Tuesday, investors took the departure of Mary Coleman, Baan's well-respected, U.S.-born chief executive the hardest, as it continues the company's recent run of turmoil in the executive suite. Ms. Coleman had been on the job just seven months, having taken the helm of the company in late May when her predecessor, Tom Tinsley, abruptly left. Mr. Tinsley had himself lasted only 11 months as chief executive.   

 Officially, Baan said Ms. Coleman left "to pursue other technology-related opportunities nearer her home in Silicon Valley." A person close to her said Ms. Coleman was exhausted with the grueling pace of her job and her hectic travel schedule had left her feeling out of touch with her California-based family.   

 Analysts, however, speculated that Ms. Coleman may have left because she disagreed with Baan's decision to abruptly shift its focus from so-called enterprise resource planning software, the complex software that streamlines large companies' internal operations such as manufacturing and inventory, to electronic commerce software. ERP software has historically been Baan's bread-and-butter. Baan officials denied that Ms. Coleman left due to a disagreement over strategy.   

 Disagreement or not, she will be sorely missed, analysts and insiders say. Ms. Coleman joined Baan in 1997 when the Dutch company bought a small U.S. software maker called Aurum Software where she held the top job. She was promoted to chief operating officer in October 1998 before becoming CEO in May.   

 "She was the spirit and energy of the turnaround of the company. She was able to keep the spirits of the troops up," says Brian Skiba, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "It could take them six months to find a decent replacement."   

 Baan's chief financial officer, James Mooney, conceded that Ms. Coleman's unexpected departure was a painful blow. In a conference call with analysts, during which he made his best efforts to paint an upbeat picture of Baan's prospects, he admitted that "the resignation of Mary Coleman is obviously a negative to the company."   

 Pierre Evaert, the 60-year-old chairman of Baan's supervisory board, will take over day-to-day management of the company during the search for a new chief executive. Mr. Evaert was once a top executive at Dutch blue-chip companies Philips NV and Royal Ahold NV. At Ahold, he headed the food retailer's U.S. business.   

 Baan said the $200 million charge, which it will chalk up to the fourth quarter of 1999, will be used partly to write off software for which it is ceasing development and partly to cover the cost of closing 14 offices and laying off 190 employees, or 4% of its work force.   

 The latest restructuring initiative comes on the heels of another restructuring plan Baan launched in November 1998. That plan cost 1,200 employees their jobs and forced the company to take a total of $270 million in charges. Taking into account the latest charge, Baan will have racked up $470 million in restructuring charges in just five quarters.   

 More worrying than the $200 million charge itself, which analysts saw as a somewhat positive development in that it will clean up Baan's books, is the fact that Baan fell well short of the break-even operating performance it had hinted at in recent months. Excluding the $200 million charge, Baan posted a $50 million loss for the fourth quarter of 1999. The most optimistic estimates had Baan posting an $11 million profit in the fourth quarter while the most pessimistic ones had it losing only $26 million.   

 Also alarming some analysts is Baan's abrupt shift of focus away from ERP software in favor of developing e-commerce software. Mr. Mooney, the CFO, said Baan has earmarked more than 50% of its future development costs for e-commerce software initiatives.   

 Although demand for e-commerce software is booming as a growing number of companies look to take their businesses online, some analysts questioned the timing of the move, since the ERP market is expected to rebound. The thinking in the industry is that, after devoting most of their software spending on solving the Y2K bug the past two years, many companies are set to invest anew in ERP solutions.   

 "These cutbacks make you fear that they're abandoning their core ERP business where they have established products" in favor of the e-commerce segment where they have no proven software, says Kevin Ashton, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. "They already made a massive cut in their ERP business at the end of '98. To see them doing it again right after the new millennium when the market for ERP software is supposed to pick up dramatically could be interpreted as a withdrawal from that market."   

 That's bound to be of concern to Boeing Co., SAP's biggest ERP customer. Other major ERP clients include BAe Systems PLC, formerly British Aerospace, and Komatsu Ltd. Officials in charge of Boeing's software procurement in Seattle weren't immediately available for comment.   

 What's more, in shifting its focus to e-commerce software, Baan is taking on entrenched competitors such as Ariba Inc. and Commerce One Inc., two young, dynamic Silicon Valley start-ups that have landed some major corporate accounts.   

 Despite its seemingly unending string of troubles, Baan is unlikely to go bankrupt anytime soon. Last summer, the company secured a $75 million line of credit from a consortium of international banks, a cash hoard it says it hasn't yet begun to tap. That loan came on top of a $425 million investment from Fletcher International, a U.S. investment fund. Some analysts believe Baan shares would be trading as low as 6 euros if it weren't for the backing of the deep-pocketed Fletcher.   

 Should Baan shares fall as low as 6 euros, the company could begin attract the interest of predators. One candidate that has been mentioned in the past is PeopleSoft Inc., a California-based company that also specializes in ERP software. For now, about 30% of Baan's equity continues to be controlled by Jan and Paul Baan, the two brothers who founded the company 20 years ago, making a takeover unlikely without their agreement.

 Supply Glitch Haunts Pennsylvania-Based Hershey Foods

 The new year for Hershey Foods Corp. began where the old one left off, with its stock price lagging and continued concerns among a top retailer and analysts about the company's ability to deliver products on time. 

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Hershey's biggest customer, said it will continue to rely on other vendors for candy to stock its shelves through Valentine's Day and probably Easter. 

 Hershey is "still not quite able to meet all of our candy needs," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Jessica Moser said Tuesday. 

 Hershey was able to fill orders for specially wrapped seasonal candies for Halloween, Christmas and the upcoming Valentine's Day, but continues to fall short in meeting Wal-Mart's "basic candy," or non-holiday, requirements, Moser said. 

 The supply problem will continue at least through Valentine's Day -- Wal-Mart wraps up orders for that holiday this week -- and "we expect the same" for Easter, Moser said. "We continue to work with them," she added. 

 Wal-Mart accounted for 14 percent of Hershey's $4.4 billion in sales last year. 

 Wall Street turned a cold shoulder to Hershey last fall after the company announced bugs with its new and complex $112 million computer system. The system, designed to modernize distribution and warehousing, has been blamed for shipping delays and incomplete deliveries. 

 Hershey stock has fallen 25.4 percent over the last year, compared with a 21.4 percent downturn in the overall food industry during the same period. The Standard & Poor's index of the nation's top 500 companies -- Hershey is among them -- rose 18.3 percent during the period. 

 Shares of Hershey Foods on Tuesday fell $1.75, or 3.77 percent, to $44.62 1/2 on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 3.2 percent. During the day, the stock traded as low as $44.43 3/4 a share, the lowest level since February 1997. 

 Hershey spokesman John Long refused to comment on the Wal-Mart development and the decline in the stock price, referring to the company's Dec. 28 statement warning that fourth-quarter profits will not match already lowered expectations. 

 In that statement, Hershey said it is making progress with the computer problems, "and customer service performance has improved significantly." 

 A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 16 analysts who follow Hershey Foods shows the company ranked 2.9 on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being a strong buy recommendation, 3 a hold and 5 a strong sell. 

 Most S&P 500 companies have a 2 rating -- a buy recommendation. Hershey's showing, down from 2.7 two weeks ago, is the "lowest for the last couple of years," said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call. "Analysts may be losing confidence as they look ahead." 

 One analyst, Doug Christopher of Crowell Weedon in Los Angeles, took the unusual step of downgrading Hershey stock from "strong buy" to "strong sell" in the aftermath of the Dec. 28 profit warning. 

 Such drastic shifts are uncommon among most analysts. Of the 27,000 analysts in the United States, fewer than 1 percent recommend a stock as a "sell" or a "strong sell," First Call's Hill said. 

 Christopher said the choice was easy. 

 "We either recommend to buy or sell," he said. "If you look at the decision to turn on the (computer) system when they did -- before the peak selling season -- it was a mistake." 

 In September, Kenneth Wolfe, Hershey's president and chief executive officer, blamed delivery delays on the "the complexity of the system and the steep learning curve associated with its full implementation." 

 Christopher, who predicted Hershey shares could fall below $40 a share, said, "There should have been a preparation curve." 

 The percentage of Hershey's orders successfully filled has risen to 90 percent, compared with 65 percent last summer, said Craig Albert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York. The company's goal is 98 percent. 

 Albert said he would not upgrade his recommendation on Hershey stock from "market perform" -- essentially a hold -- until he sees evidence the company is using the computer system, and not employees, to manage the order process. 

 "Instead of using the system, they have to throw people at the problem," Albert said. "When an order comes in for 100 cases, the system spits it out. They were taking the orders manually and sending out 90 cases right away. Then they would deliver the other 10 cases a couple of days later, increasing their logistic costs."

 U.S. stocks hammered in late trading.

 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. blue chips hit fresh session lows in late trading on Tuesday as fears that several interest rates increases could be in store cut into December's big rally. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) was off 328 points, or 2.89 percent, at 11,028, pulled down by American Express Co., which lost 6-9/16 at 150-11/16 and J.P. Morgan & Co. off 5-4/16 at 116-3/16. 

 The Dow was more than 4 percent below its Dec. 31 record high of 11,497.12, which had capped the index's nearly 5.7-percent gain for the month of December. 

 The drop came as the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond's yield remained above the 6.50 percent level at 6.54 percent. On Monday, the yield rose to a 27-month high of 6.62 percent. 

 "Certainly the sudden run-up in interest rates has spooked the market," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist, Fahnestock & Co., Great Neck, N.Y. "I think the other thing is that a lot of people forestalled their selling late last year and brought it over to this year." 

 The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC) was down 141 points, or 3.43 percent, at 3,989, after falling as much as 182 points, its biggest point drop ever. On Monday, the Nasdaq closed at a record 4,131.15. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX) was down 42 points, or 2.93 percent, at 1,412. 

 The downdraft came after Warburg Dillon Read said in a research report the U.S. Federal Reserve will likely raise short-term interest rates by one full percentage point in 2000. 

 The forecast suggests a more aggressive than previously expected monetary policy and came a day after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's U.S. investment strategist predicted similar strong action from the Fed. 

 "In my opinion, we are going to have difficult times ahead. This is a beginning," said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst and senior vice president at Wachovia Securities. 

 In economic news, President Clinton renominated Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman. 

 Declining shares pounded advances nearly 22 to 8 with more than 755 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. There were only 21 shares at new highs and 155 at new lows. 

 The losses cut across many industries with Internet, financials, retailers, gold and telecommunications shares all falling back on fears of rising interest rates. 

 Computer makers were among the top movers on the NYSE and Nasdaq with Big Board-listed Compaq Computer Corp. off 1-8/16 at 29-1/16 and Dell Computer Corp. off 3-3/8 at 47-1/2. 

 Companies in the news included Sears, Roebuck & Co., up 2-3/16 at 32-3/8 after it projected its fourth quarter earnings should top profits from a year ago. 

 Parametric Technology,, was down 5-1/16 at 20-1/16 after it issued a first quarter profit warning.

 NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell to new session lows in early afternoon trading on Tuesday with financial stocks the biggest losers amid concern about interest rates and second thoughts about lofty technology issue valuations. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 301 points, or 2.66 percent, at 11,055, pulled down by American Express Co., off 6-3/4 at 150-1/2 and J.P. Morgan & Co. Hewlett-Packard Co., which was off 4-11/16 at 116-3/4. 

 The New York Stock Exchange said it imposed programme trading curbs at 12:43 p.m. (1743 GMT) after the Dow fell more than 220 points. The exchange imposes curbs whenever the Dow rises or falls 220 points. 

 The Nasdaq composite index was down 180 points, or 4.36 percent, at 3,950 after setting a record high on Monday. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 44 points, or 3.06 percent, at 1,410. 

 "Other than interest rates, I really don't see anything," said Richard Cripps chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. "I think there is a full realisation that the stock and bond market are linked in a way that prevents the stock market from going higher. What I sense is a willingness to button in more profits. Today more than yesterday there is more realisation that the market has topped out." 

 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond's yield, which was at 6.56 early Tuesday afternoon as its price strengthened 31/32. It closed at 6.62 percent on Monday, a 27-month high. 

 "I think it's postponed profit-taking and a delayed reaction of what is happening on the rate front," said Arnold Berman, Technology Strategist, SoundView Technology Group about stocks decline. "We saw a decoupling between the action in the Nasdaq and the bond market yesterday and today are getting catch up move. It's nothing that will be long in duration." 

 Internet, financials, retailers, gold and telecommunications shares all were falling back on fears of rising interest rates. 

 In economic news, President Clinton is planning to renominate Alan Greenspan as the chairman of the Federal Reserve bank, a senior U.S. official said. 

 "If you own stock, you should view this as a blessing because we know Greenspan always comes to the defence of the stock market when it sells off. So this would be a buy signal," said Paul Kasriel, the chief domestic economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. 

 Declining shares pounded advances 21 to 8 with more than 599 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. There were only 19 shares at new highs and 139 at new lows. 

 Companies in the news included Sears, Roebuck & Co., up 2 at 32-3/16 after it projected its fourth quarter earnings before special items should top profits from a year ago. 

 Parametric Technology,, was down 6-1/16 at 19-1/16 after it issued a first quarter profit warning.

 Finance Chief For Mattel Will Retire

 LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3 -- Mattel Inc. said yesterday that Harry Pearce, its chief financial officer, would retire in March, becoming the latest high-ranking executive to exit the slumping company in the last two months. 

 Mattel also named Bernard Stolar, former president of Sega of America Inc., to be president of its interactive division, which includes the Learning Company, its children's software company whose slow sales prompted a third-quarter profit warning. 

 On Nov. 10, Mattel said the chairman of the Learning Company, Michael Perik, 42, and president Kevin O'Leary, 45, had left, three weeks after the toy maker said sluggish sales of educational programs and returns would hurt its profit. Mattel Interactive is the division that includes the Learning Company. 

 Mr. Pearce, 55, chief financial officer since May 1997, was a 24-year employee of Tyco Toys before that company's acquisition by Mattel in 1997. Mattel said a search had begun to find a successor. 

 Mr. Stolar, 53, paved the way for the United States introduction of Sega's Dreamcast video-game console system by masterminding a marketing strategy and assembling a cast of software companies to develop games for the system. Dreamcast, a flop in Japan, has sold more than anyone expected in the United States, with the company's latest forecast calling for two million units to be sold by the end of March. 

 He left Sega less than a month before the Dreamcast's introduction in September, after clashing with Japanese superiors. 

 Mr. Stolar is being brought in to turn around Mattel's software efforts. The company has benefited from strong sales of titles tied to Barbie but stumbled with its acquisition of the Learning Company, which makes educational and productivity software as well as titles such as ''Dogz'' and ''Babyz'' and war simulation games. 

 Shares of Mattel, which is based in El Segundo, Calif., fell 6.25 cents, to $13.0625, in New York Stock Exchange trading.

 South Florida was not the best place to invest in 1999, for the most part. 

 The Bloomberg South Florida Index rose only 3 percent this year, as some of the region's most well-known names had dismal years in the stock market. 

 Sunbeam, the appliance manufacturer, was down 39 percent; AutoNation, the auto retailer, was down about 38 percent; Wackenhut, the security company, was down 41 percent. Office Depot, the office supply company, was down 55 percent, and Sports Authority, the sporting goods chain, was down about 62 percent. 

 Those drops were offset by gainers that include SportsLine.com, an Internet provider of sports content that rose 222 percent; Citrix Systems, a computer software company, up 153 percent; Sensormatic Electronics, an electronic security company that was up 151 percent; and Sound Advice, an electronics retailer, which gained 277 percent. Coral Gables-based Firstcom, a South American telecommunications company, was up a stunning 1,447 percent. 

 The meager gain in the Bloomberg South Florida Index compares with a gain of 19.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, and more than 25 percent for the Dow Jones industrial average. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 85 percent for the year. The Bloomberg South Florida Index is designed to measure the performance of the South Florida economy. 

 The casualty list 

 One of the biggest losers was Boca Raton-based Atlantic Gulf Communities, the real estate developer, which saw a drop of 93 percent in its stock price, to 5 cents on Friday. The company emerged from the wreckage of General Development, the Florida land company that collapsed in 1990. 

 "At least we made some list," joked Richard Ackerman, the Crocker Realty Trust president who took over as Atlantic Gulf chief executive in August. After Ackerman took over, the company cut 49 jobs and moved its headquarters from Miami to Boca Raton. 

 Another big loser was CHS Electronics, the Miami-based computer distributor, which saw a 93.4 percent drop and finished at $1.13 on Friday. In previous years, CHS had pursued a strategy of buying smaller rivals and paying for them with stock, becoming the world's third-largest computer distributor. But intense competition and falling computer prices narrowed its margins and prompted losses. 

 Last spring, the company cut about 10 percent of its employees and closed about 25 warehouses. By the end of 1999, CHS sold off many of its units in Europe and Latin America and was shifting its focus instead to e-commerce. 

 Sunbeam, the Boca Raton-based appliance manufacturer, was the region's top loser in 1998, and followed that with nearly a 40 percent drop in 1999. The company is struggling under a $2 billion debt load generated by former CEO Al Dunlap, who bought Coleman camping company, First Alert smoke detectors and the maker of Mr. Coffee on the same day in the spring of 1998. 

 Last year, AutoNation executives closed or converted a money- losing used-car superstore chain, and made plans to spin off the company's auto rental operations in hopes of enticing investor interest. 

 Lauderdale Lakes-based Sports Authority has been plagued by a weak sporting goods and athletic shoe business. 

 Delray Beach-based Office Depot surprised investors in August with a warning of a profit drop because of excess competition and unappealing merchandise. 

 All three have suffered in part from Wall Street's infatuation with technology companies, a trend that often favors companies with promise but no signs of earnings. Some technology-related companies were among South Florida's biggest gainers. 

 Looking good 

 Firstcom is a Coral Gables-based company developing telecommunications networks in South America, the world's fastest growing telecom market. Unsurprisingly, even though it gained more than 1,400 percent in stock price to $36.75 Friday, it's still losing money. But it hassigned a deal to merge with AT&T's Netstream unit and form AT&T Latin America, which is expected to go public. 

 Boca Raton-based JWGenesis is a financial services and investment banking company that's ridden its technology connections to stock success. It owns a 5 percent stake in MVP.com, the splashy Internet company fronted by John Elway and Michael Jordan. JWGenesis, however, did report profits of nearly $20 million in the first nine months of 1999.

Accounting and credibility problems. Computer glitches not related to Y2K. Acquisitions and massive job cuts. A family food fight. 

It wasn't business as usual in central Pennsylvania during 1999. 

Rite Aid Corp., the nation's third-largest drugstore chain, encountered most of the heartaches, and it was the kind of pain not readily relieved by a prescription drug. 

East Pennsboro Twp.-based Rite Aid began the year riding high, its stock trading at more than $51 a share in the first week of January. But the balloon soon burst, beginning with stories in The Wall Street Journal about questionable business practices involving members of the company's founding family. 

In mid-March, the stock plummeted nearly 40 percent after Rite Aid said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings would be well below expectations because of problems associated with its rapid opening of new stores. 

Shortly thereafter, The Wall Street Journal weighed in again with a story about Rite Aid's handling of accounts with vendors over damaged or outdated merchandise. 

On June 1, the company restated earnings for fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999. Two weeks later, the chief financial officer announced his retirement. 

With some of Rite Aid's short-term debt coming due in the fall, the company said in August that it was discussing a possible "material transaction." 

Rumors circulated that Rite Aid would be sold to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., or that bankruptcy was imminent. Or that some supermarket chain, Safeway perhaps, might buy the ailing drugstore giant. 

Others suggested that Rite Aid might sell most of the West Coast stores that it had acquired in December 1996. 

The house of cards built by Martin L. Grass, chairman and chief executive officer and son of Rite Aid founder Alex Grass, had fallen apart. By Oct. 18, the board of directors and the bankers had enough. Grass was ousted. 

Also on Oct. 18, the company announced that it would again restate earnings for fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999 -- this time a downward adjustment of $500 million, half of what was originally reported. 

A month later, Rite Aid advised investors to disregard profit projections made by Grass at an Oct. 11 meeting with analysts. On Nov. 11, the stock touched a 52-week low of $4.50 a share. 

But help was on the way. The banks extended for one year their credit lines on Rite Aid's short-term loans. Leonard Green & Partners, a Los Angeles investment firm, agreed to invest $300 million in Rite Aid. Leonard Green had served on the Rite Aid board for 2 1/2 years, leaving in June. 

With Green charting the course, a team of executives once involved with the Fred Meyer supermarket chain in the Pacific Northwest was hired to turn around the struggling Rite Aid. Robert G. Miller was named chairman and CEO, and his new team immediately changed direction on some of the former management strategies. 

Miller said Rite Aid no longer planned to sell most of its West Coast stores. Instead, it would keep the stores, clean them up and stock them with merchandise, Miller vowed. 

The company would sell its PCS Health Systems subsidiary, a pharmacy benefits management operation acquired for $1.5 billion in January, Miller said. And Rite Aid would adhere to strict financial guidelines, he said. 

Rite Aid staggers into the new year. Still to come are the earnings restatements that might give investors an accurate assessment of Rite Aid's financial position. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission has initiated an investigation of Rite Aid, presumably related to its financial reporting and accounting practices. Stockholders have filed a ton of class-action lawsuits against the company, claiming they were misled into buying stock because of inflated and inaccurate financial reports. 

When it comes to Rite Aid's overall credibility, Miller's work in the new year won't be easy. 

AMP acquisition 

AlliedSignal Inc.'s unwelcome attempt to buy AMP Inc. was a major business event in 1998. By 1999, the issue was settled, with AMP agreeing to be purchased by Tyco International Ltd. for $12 billion. 

For some, Tyco was viewed as a white knight. But for many AMP employees, Tyco became a Trojan horse. 

AMP shareholders approved the Tyco acquisition on April 1. That same day, Robert Ripp, AMP's chief executive officer who headed the fight against AlliedSignal and led the company into Tyco's hands, announced his resignation. The next day, the acquisition was completed. 

A few days later, several high-ranking AMP executives were shown the door. By the end of April, many rank-and-file employees joined the unemployment lines. 

Some 8,000 AMP employees worldwide -- 15 percent of the work force -- were dismissed. The jobs of 2,000 workers in the Harrisburg, York and Lancaster areas were eliminated. 

By the summer, AMP closed several of its Harrisburg-area buildings as the reduced work force was consolidated at facilities in Lower Paxton and Lower Swatara townships. The administrative headquarters was closed, as were other buildings on AMP's Swatara Twp. campus near Harrisburg East Mall. 

Near the end of the year, the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency had agreed to buy AMP's former headquarters building at 470 Friendship Road. Harris Savings Bank said it would buy the AMP building at 449 Eisenhower Blvd. to house its central operations. 

AMP, operating as a subsidiary of Tyco, is now hiring workers. As many as 100 jobs are being added in the Harrisburg area, and another 100 openings are to be filled at an East Berlin production facility. 

Company spokeswoman Maryanne Kane said the jobs are the result of increased demand for AMP products. 

The acquisition of AMP -- the world's largest maker of electronic connection devices -- made Tyco the major player in the industry. Tyco acquired Raychem Corp. in August and the electromechanical components division of Siemens in November. 

By the end of the year, Tyco's telecommunications and electronics division had expanded to become the largest of four segments of the $22 billion company. 

But Tyco's acquisition strategy has been the subject of intense scrutiny. Tyco stock, which was flying high when the company acquired AMP, tumbled when accounting practices for the multiple acquisitions were questioned in October. Tyco says its accounting is above-board. 

In December, Tyco reported that the SEC was conducting an informal investigation of its accounting practices. The stock took a major hit with that announcement, dropping to a 52-week low of $22.50 a share. 

As the year ended, the stock began showing signs of a rebound. 

Hershey Foods woes 

Some people deal with stress by eating chocolate. But that may have been difficult late in 1999 for some consumers looking for a Hershey's candy bar. 

Hershey Foods Corp. installed a new computer system in the summer that created problems with distribution, which is was intended to streamline. In September, Hershey warned that its earnings for the third quarter and full year would fall short of expectations because of computer glitches. 

By the end of the year, the candy giant issued another profit warning and reported that sales in December were less than expected. 

Hershey said it is making progress in improving customer service, warehousing and order-fulfillment operations related to the computer problem, and "customer service performance has improved significantly." 

A 1.2 million-square-foot distribution center Hershey is building north of Palmyra also is expected to clear up some shipping and order problems. The building is scheduled to be partially opened in April, but won't be fully occupied until 2001. 

Restructurings 

Appleton Papers Inc. announced in September that it would close its Lower Allen Twp. plant and offer the building for sale. The plant employs 450 people. 

Operations at the plant, which opened in 1973, will be phased out over two years as two production lines that make carbonless paper are shifted to an Appleton plant in Wisconsin. 

Another West Shore fixture, the Quaker Oats Co. plant, also may face some cutbacks. The parent company announced in September that it plans to reduce its work force by 1,200 employees and consolidate some of its cereal-production facilities. 

Hot and cold breakfast cereals and granola products are made at the 45-year-old Shiremanstown plant, which employs about 480 people. 

Quaker Oats said it would announce its plant-consolidation plans in the first quarter of this year. 

Jobs at Richfood's distribution center in Harrisburg were in jeopardy when the food wholesaler's main customer, Carlisle-based Giant Food Stores Inc., announced in April that it no longer would use Richfood as a grocery supplier. 

Giant's decision left Richfood Holdings Inc. of Richmond, Va., in a precarious -- and vulnerable -- position. Its earnings would drop with the lose of Giant's business. 

By June, Minneapolis-based Supervalu Inc., the nation's largest wholesale food distributor, had agreed to buy Richfood. The purchase was completed on Aug. 31, around the time that Supervalu landed a major contract with Kmart Corp. 

The Kmart contract enables Supervalu to maintain the employee base at Richfood's Harrisburg distribution center, where more than 1,000 people work. Supervalu's Perryman, Md., warehouse is handling distribution to Kmart stores in Richfood's mid-Atlantic region, and some work from Perryman has been shifted to Harrisburg, according to Alex Covington, president of the Richfood region of Supervalu. 

"We have no layoffs planned" in Harrisburg, Covington said. 

Another grocery business, Sunbury-based Weis Markets Inc., made a rare appearance in the public eye during the last month of the year. The supermarket chain was rocked by internal dissension among some members of the founding family who own a significant chunk of Weis stock. 

On Nov. 30, members of the Sigfried Weis family asked for a special meeting to elect a new board of directors and called for appointment of a committee to evaluate financial options, including a possible sale of the company. Sigfried Weis was the longtime chairman of the company before his death in 1995. 

Other family members, headed by Chairman Robert Weis, first cousin of Sigfried, initially reacted by rejecting any suggestion that the business be sold. 

Robert Weis and his son, Jonathan, are involved in day-to-day operations of the company. The other side of the family has no direct role in management, although two family members are on the board of directors. Each side owns about 41 percent of the company's stock. 

Just before Christmas, the dispute began to settle down. The company announced that its financial adviser, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, would explore all options to enhance shareholder value, including a possible sale. Recapitalization of the company also is an option. 

With that announcement, the Sigfried Weis faction withdrew its request for a special meeting. The financial adviser for the Sigfried Weis faction has said Weis, founded in 1912, might fetch between $45 and $55 a share.

 One of the area's old-line financial institutions, Dauphin Deposit Bank and Trust Co., took on a new name this summer, becoming Allfirst Bank. The Allfirst name is now being used by all of the U.S. banking operations of Dauphin's owner, Allied Irish Banks. 

 Allied's banks stretch from Harrisburg south to Baltimore and Washington. 

 "We believe it's really beginning to make our brand more powerful," said Gail Sanders, an Allfirst spokeswoman. "We feel very strongly it's beginning to pay off."

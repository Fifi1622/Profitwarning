BANK REWORKS BRANCH CONCEPT THAT LET CUSTOMER SERVICE SLIDE

Five years ago First Union embarked on a highly ambitious strategy: It would seek to change the way people banked.

The staid bank branch was in for a radical overhaul. It would become Future Bank - a branch stripped of some people and some of the standard face-to-face service functions. Those would be replaced with in-branch telephones, ATMs and video kiosks that would connect customers with service people in remote places.

But on the way to the future, First Union has stumbled badly in its efforts to overhaul 2,000-plus branches.

Revenues are far short of original targets. Customers are angry about service. The bank has had to spend heavily to train and retrain employees. Turnover is high among branch employees who can't make the leap from order-taker to sales pro.

Wall Street still isn't clear on why First Union is so far off its overall earnings target this year - which it announced in a stunning profit warning May 25. But a number of analysts say the newly revamped branch system - the third largest among U.S. banks and the very backbone of First Union - is a key culprit.

Just as importantly, service is suffering - so much that the company's president, John Georgius, addressed the issue in a recent memo.

``We have allowed our external service to customers to slip below the top levels expected from a national financial services leader,'' Georgius wrote to employees in May. ``As we look across our company today, there are a number of areas where our customers are not receiving the kind of service they desire or deserve.''

It is unclear whether First Union's service is any worse than other large banks. But Georgius' memo makes it clear that service is not meeting management's expectations.

Anecdotes from customers and analysts who follow First Union suggest that the bank has alienated some of its best customers by pushing them to use the phones when they arrive at the branch for help. Some 70 ``quick fixes'' are under way in First Union's consumer division to tackle everything from how a customer is handled in the branch to how customer calls are routed through the telephone bank at First Union's sprawling customer information center in Charlotte.

No one is saying Future Bank is a failure. Still, many analysts and investors are wondering: Is it a good idea that hasn't worked yet, or is the problem with the business model itself? Still unclear is whether Future Bank is the New Coke of banking, one that may ultimately force a return to the classic model.

Analyst Lawrence Cohn of Ryan, Beck & Co., says management may be guilty of a touch of hubris in pushing Future Bank so aggressively. ``What they've done is require people to act differently,'' he says, continuing, ``We know you got a lot of dissatisfied customers. . . . We don't know if that's because you've blown what you're doing, or if they just don't like it.''

In a telephone interview Tuesday, Georgius said that in launching Future Bank, First Union vaulted three years ahead of its competitors in ``migrating'' customers from the teller line to telephones and other banking avenues - an expensive gamble. Still, he says he is confident that the bank has the right model and that with the fixes under way and the appropriate amount of tweaking, it will work.

``We're probably better positioned to deal with the future than we've ever been, certainly since I've been at the bank,'' he says.

If anything, Future Bank represents one of the big experiments under way in banking today as companies, convinced that branches are increasingly outmoded, seek to offer customers new ways to bank over the phone and Internet. ``Our biggest fear is customers are moving faster than banking institutions,'' Georgius says.

So First Union pushed fast for the branch overhaul: Bank officials initially planned to roll out Future Bank over two years, then decided to complete it in only one.

It was a huge undertaking: In short, it required 25,000 branch employees to change their jobs, Georgius says. Order-takers would have to become salespeople - a far-reaching culture change that executives knew would cause large turnover.

``This was like 100 mergers all done at one time,'' Georgius says.

Turnover has been high. Indeed, the bank just sent out a memo asking for employees' help in providing referrals for the 500 to 1,000 new financial specialists - people who sell everything from loans to mutual funds - it needs to resupply its 5,000-member branch sales force.

Compensation is largely incentive-based; the bank promises salespeople can make $50,000 to $70,000 a year.

Those salespeople are key to boosting revenue from Future Bank. Branch sales revenues were supposed to be up 65 percent by year-end 1999 from the first quarter but will fall short, Georgius says. In its profit warning last month, the bank said revenue shortfalls from Future Bank will cost 10 cents a share this year.

Of all the lessons from Future Bank, one that Georgius is emphasizing today: ``Let customers move at their own pace.''

Many customers resented being prodded to use the telephones once they arrived at the branch. To tackle that, Georgius said First Union has spent a lot of time retraining its customer service reps - the ``greeter'' - who steered customers to the phones and teller lines. The bank has sought to put more responsibility on the reps to solve customers service requests at the branch, rather than redirecting customers to phones.

World Stock Markets
 Tokyo Stocks Advance 1% to High for the Year On Unemployment, Household-Spending Data

 Tokyo stocks powered ahead to another new high for the year, boosted by additional data suggesting that the Japanese economy has at least bottomed out and may well be recovering. 

 Most notable was a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.6% in May, from a record high 4.8% in March and April. Household spending also was up sharply in May from the previous months. 

 The new figures didn't discourage the bears, many of whom continue to insist that the apparent economic recovery is a mixture of artificial stimulus and possibly fudged numbers. But there seems to be growing investor confidence that in certain key sectors, such as electronics and technology, Japan is finding its way again. 

 "Some of the skepticism about the economic numbers is probably justified," says David S. Smith, portfolio manager at Newport Pacific Management in San Francisco. "But you can still do well if you go for what Japan is good at." 

 Other Asian markets were mixed yesterday: Taipei reached a 14-month high, while Hong Kong stocks slipped and the Bangkok market stumbled badly. European markets finished mostly higher, though U.K. stocks fell. 

 Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 1.80 points, or 0.83%, to 218.27. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.12 point, or 0.08%, to 156.97. 

 Japan's Nikkei 225 index advanced 1% to 17782.79, establishing a new high for the year. The benchmark has gained nearly 29% in 1999 and more than 12% in the second quarter. 

 The gains at the start of the year seemed to suggest not so much a vote of confidence in Japan but investor fears of being left behind as Tokyo stocks rose from depressed levels. The recent gains, however, have begun to reflect a new sense that the economy has finally bottomed. 

 Yesterday, analysts focused on the decline in unemployment and on household spending, which jumped 3.9% in May from April and was up 1.5% from the year-ago period. 

 Still, skeptics such as Carl Weinberg, chief economist for the economic advisory firm High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., don't find the number convincing. He notes that the recent surge in household spending came despite a 1.1% decline in household income and a 1.4% drop in disposable income. "The figures don't add up," Mr. Weinberg says. 

 At the same time, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry reported that May industrial production fell 0.7% from April, disappointing investors who bet on MITI's 1% growth forecast. 

 But for stock pickers in Japan, says Eric Ritter, portfolio manager of the Driehaus Asia-Pacific Growth Fund in Chicago, "industrial production may not be the best number to look at." 

 Instead, he suggests focusing on data indicating a comeback by Japan's electronics and technology sector. The May figures for sales of personal computers by Japanese electronics retailers, for instance, were up 75% from 12 months ago. This year marks the first time in three years that PC sales in Japan have risen. 

 High-tech manufacturers also are considered to be at the forefront of Japanese corporate restructuring. A report in Tuesday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that Sony will reduce the number of employees at its headquarters by two-thirds and will relocate about 1,500 employees to other divisions. Sony shares then surged 4% to 13,070 yen. 

 That report follows an announcement last week by NEC and Hitachi that they will combine their memory-chip operations. The move was hailed as one of the boldest Japanese restructuring efforts yet as the chip manufacturers aim to reduce their crippling excess capacity. 

 Away from the blue-chip conglomerates, Tokyo stocks are performing even better. The Nikkei OTC Index, a measure of over-the-counter stocks, has soared 98% so far this year to 1442.77. And after months of muted domestic demand for Japanese stocks, investors report that Japanese pension funds are increasing their allocations in the OTC market. 

 Going into the second half of the year, Tokyo stocks will probably be tested at these recent highs. 

 Although investors believe a quarter-point increase in U.S. interest rates has been priced into the market, stocks could be under pressure if the Federal Reserve acts more aggressively when it meets today. The influential tankan survey of business sentiment will be released on Monday, and a lack of optimism could shake the market's fragile confidence. 

 And there is always the possibility, even bullish investors agree, that Japanese officials may revise what they have said. This is true not only for government figures, but in the corporate sector, too. Some money managers are braced for possible fallout after a series of shareholders meetings this month, where companies tend to tell investors only what they want to hear. 

 "Companies try to suppress all bad news at the meeting," says Mr. Ritter of Driehaus. "Then in July and August they let that bad news come out." 

 In Asia Wednesday, Tokyo closed the morning session up 0.8%. South Korea was little changed in late-morning trading. Hong Kong was off 0.4% in early dealings, while the Taipei market had shed 0.7%. 

 In HONG KONG Tuesday, the Hang Seng Index slid 74.80, or 0.5%, to 13765.49. Investors focused on Tuesday's sale of three plots of government land, regarded as a barometer of the health of Hong Kong's real-estate market. Although the bidding prices were slightly higher than expected, property shares ended mixed. Sino Land shares slipped 2.5 cents to 4.63 Hong Kong dollars. New World Development's shares gained 3.5% to HK$23.85. 

 In TAIPEI, the Weighted Index gained 232.82, or 2.8%, to 8514.27, its highest close since April 1998. Stocks rose after central bank governor Perng Fai-nan indicated Monday that the bank doesn't necessarily feel the need to raise interest rates. Shares of United Microelectronics, Taiwan's second largest chip maker, moved up 4.50 new Taiwan dollars to 70 new Taiwan dollars. 

 In BANGKOK, the SET Index declined 14.23, or 2.7%, to 517.65. Bank shares came under pressure after the central bank said it would reopen the bidding for a majority stake in Nakornthon Bank, throwing into doubt Standard Charter's plan to buy the bank and raising the possibility that Nakornthon could even be nationalized. Shares of Thai Farmers Bank slid 4.5% to 74 baht, while Bangkok Bank shares fell 1.9% to 77.50 baht. 

 In LONDON, the FTSE 100 Index tumbled 98.60, or 1.5%, to 6307.10. The threat of higher U.S. interest rates weighed on bank shares. Bank of Scotland fell 3.9% to 843.5 pence, and Royal Bank of Scotland shares declined 3.4% to 1,275 pence. Tobacco shares also sputtered after a profit warning Monday from Philip Morris in the U.S. BAT shares were down 2.9% to 593.5 pence. 

 In FRANKFURT, the Xetra Dax rose 2.58, or 0.05%, to 5359.53. Telecommunications group Mannesmann was up after Goldman Sachs increased its target share price to 180 euros from 150 euros. The share price closed 1.6% higher at 146.61 euros. Deutsche Telekom also edged up 25 cents to 40.55 euros; a day after floating 250 million new shares, it was again the most actively traded stock. Lufthansa fell after Credit Suisse First Boston lowered 1999 earnings expectations for European airlines. The carrier's shares ended down 2.9% at 17.87 euros.

 THE DOW JONES industrial average fell yesterday afternoon as a crumbling bond market weighed on equities and Coca-Cola Enterprises, a bottler for Coca-Cola company, issued a profit warning. In late afternoon trading the Dow was down 143 at 10,523 while at midday the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index had fallen 38 points to 2,559. Analysts said the market is expecting at least a 25-basis point rise in interest rates when the Federal Reserve Panel meets next week.

 Options Report: Stock Market Jitters Overshadow Options, Reflect Technology-Sector Earnings Slide

 NEW YORK -- The jitters that took hold of the stock market Thursday also overshadowed options trading. 

 Stocks sold off, hurt by disappointing earnings news from the technology sector and by worries about interest rates. In the options market, volatility rose, reflecting fears about the direction of the stock market. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 1.62, or 7.5%, to 23.19. 

 "We're all watching the bonds," said one options trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. "There's certainly quite a bit of interest-rate fears." 

 Options traders got a preview of what the day would bring at the beginning of the session. At that point, the activity seen in out-of-the-money Standard & Poor's 100 index put options -- which increase in value as the stock market goes down -- indicated anxiety about the market, said Paul Foster, the options strategist at 1010WallStreet.com. Later, this activity waned somewhat, bringing some call buyers back. 

 Part of the blame for Thursday's selloff can be pinned on disappointing results from Micron Technology Inc. and a profit warning from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The stocks both fell on the news: Micron shed 4 9/16, or 10.4%, to 39 3/8, while Advanced Micro dropped 1 1/8, or 6.2%, to 17 1/16. 

 The most active Micron options were the July 42 1/2 puts, while the most active Advanced Micro options were the August 15 puts. 

 Elsewhere in the options market: 

 -- Washington Mutual Inc. traded busily as a result of an investor maneuvering between the calls and the stock. Acting through a Wall Street firm, the investor sold all or part of a large position in the stock and bought about 11,000 in-the-money January 30 call contracts, an options trader said. 

 Washington Mutual's NYSE-listed shares closed down 15/16, or 2.6%, at 34 11/16. The January 30 calls fell 3/8 to 7, on volume of 11,050 contracts. Open interest is 30 contracts.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Shares in U.S. high-technology companies Microntech and SCMM are falling in London-based trading midday Thursday, ahead of what is expected to be another losing day on Wall Street. 

 Microntech was trading down 2 1/2 at $41 1/2, after the group reported a wider-than-expected loss of $27.7 million in its fiscal third quarter. This was attributed to a renewed slump in the company's core memory-chip market and lagging shipments of its personal computers. 

 SCM Microsystems was 7 1/2 easier at $47 after a profit warning. SCMM said it expects income between $1.5 million and $2 million, or 10 to 13 cents a share, compared with expectations of 24 cents a share. 

 Also, Advanced Micro Devices said that it expects an operating loss of about $200 million for the second quarter ended June 27, far worse than analysts' expectations. Although market participants are somewhat used to this kind of disappointment, a London trader expects the stock to suffer later in the session.

 PacifiCare Stock Falls Again After  Profit Warning

 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. shares continued to fall Wednesday, a day after the managed-care company warned analysts that some second-quarter financial estimates were too high. 

 On Tuesday, the Santa Ana-based company called certain analysts and told them to lower their expectations for the upcoming quarter. PacifiCare now expects to report earnings between $1.45 and $1.50 a share, compared with the First Call Corp. consensus estimate of $1.58 a share, according to several analysts. 

 The profit warning came as a surprise to many, especially since the company had been touting its growth prospects in recent weeks. When the first-quarter results were released in early May, PacifiCare, in a news release, increased expectations, saying it saw earnings-per-share growth between 40% and 45% for the year. 

 That positive projection excluded the effects of a buyback of 13% of its shares from its largest shareholder, UniHealth Foundation. 

 The stock, which tumbled 14% on Tuesday, dropped another 3%, or $2.25 a share, on Wednesday, closing at $71.75. 

 After the positive announcement about first-quarter results, PacifiCare had complained to some investors and analysts that its growth projections weren't being rewarded with a higher stock price. 

 "It's a good thing we didn't reward them," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. 

 Skolnick was among a number of analysts critical of how PacifiCare issued the warning: calling individuals over the last few days to tell them their models were flawed. 

 Since PacifiCare raised expectations in its second-quarter earnings model, "there's a standard that's set, that, if you're going to lower [expectations], you better put it in writing as well," Skolnick said. 

 A PacifiCare spokeswoman said the company was surprised by the market's reaction to the earnings news, since the company had been "communicating the same message" for some time. 

 The company was trying to temper some of the "tremendous amount of enthusiasm by Wall Street" that followed the first-quarter earnings and get some analysts "back in line," she said. 

 PacifiCare chose not to release a formal statement because it doesn't believe the adjustments are material. 

 Including the buyback, PacifiCare now expects to earn between $6.20 and $6.31 a share in 1999, the spokeswoman said. A survey of analysts by First Call Corp. puts earnings at $6.31. The company earned $4.40 a share in 1998.

 Options Report: Stk Mkt Jitters Affect Options Trading

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The jitters that took hold of the stock market Thursday also overshadowed options trading. 

 Stocks sold off, hurt by disappointing earnings news from the technology sector and by worries about interest rates. In the options market, volatility rose, reflecting fears about the direction of the stock market. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 1.93, or 8.9%, to 23.50. 

 "We're all watching the bonds," said one options trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. "There's certainly quite a bit of interest rate fears." 

 Options traders got a preview of what the day would bring at the beginning of the session. At that point, the activity seen in out-of-the-money Standard & Poor's 100 index put options - which increase in value as the stock market goes down - indicated anxiety about the market, said Paul Foster, the options strategist at 1010WallStreet.com. Later, this activity waned somewhat and some call buyers came back as the stock market bounced off its lows. 

 Part of the blame for Thursday's selloff can be pinned on disappointing results from Micron Technology Inc. and a profit warning from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The stocks both fell on the news: Micron was recently down 4, or 9.1%, at 39 15/16, while Advanced Micro dropped 1 3/16, or 6.5%, to 17. 

 Over in the options market, the most active Micron options were the July 42 1/2 puts, and the most active Advanced Micro options were the July 20 and August 15 puts. 

 Elsewhere in the options market: 

 - The shares and call options of Washington Mutual Inc. traded busily as a result of an investor maneuvering between the calls and the stock. Acting through a Wall Street firm, the investor sold all or part of a large position in the stock and bought about 11,000 in-the-money January 30 call contracts, an options trader said. 

 Recently, Washington Mutual's NYSE-listed shares were down 13/16, or 2.3%, at 34 13/16, on volume of 3.3 million shares, compared with average volume of 1.9 million. The January 30 calls were down 3/8 at 7, on volume of 11,050 contracts. Open interest is 30 contracts. 

 - National Semiconductor Corp. continues to attract attention in the options market. On Wednesday, the stock and options moved on an upgrade from Lehman Brothers. The stock hasn't done much Thursday - it was recently unchanged at 24 5/8 - but the options continue to move. Most active were the July 22 1/2 calls, which were recently up 1/4 at 3 on volume of 7,572 contracts. Open interest is 1,229 contracts.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Stocks are slumping further, giving way to higher bond yields and eroding sentiment. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off 101 at 10565, with declining stocks well in front of advancing issues by a 16-to-9 margin. Volume on the Big Board is 232 million shares. 

 An earnings warning from Advanced Micro Devices and disappointing results from Micron Technology have scratched some of the luster off what is still expected to be a very positive earnings season. And with rates having risen sharply in recent months, there's little room for profit concerns. 

 Analysts said the bond market continues to direct stocks. The 30-year Treasury, up earlier in the day, is off 1/4 point, pushing its yield up to 6.15%. 

 A couple of Dow-component drug makers are managing to edge higher, with Merck up 3/8 to 68 1/4 and Johnson & Johnson up 5/16 to 90 13/16. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 is off 16 to 1316, the NYSE Composite index has lost 6.34 to 624.41, and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 34.90 to 2563.22.

Abreast of the Market
 Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Fall Amid Worries on Interest Rates

 NEW YORK -- Higher interest rates damaged banking and brokerage issues once again, leaving market averages mostly lower. 

 Shares of Goldman Sachs Group finished at 65, down 3. The brokerage giant, reporting its first-ever quarterly profit statement as a publicly held company, beat Wall Street's profit targets. But with rates backing up for a third straight session, investors found more to carp than to clap about in the report and in the financial sector as a whole. 

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which reports its quarterly numbers today, declined 2 15/16 to 93 1/4. Shares of J.P. Morgan lost 4 3/8 to 130 5/8, Chase Manhattan fell 1 1/2 to 80 1/4, and Bank of New York declined 1 9/16 to 35 1/4. 

 Investors also revisited worries about the direction of interest rates, an issue that briefly had seemed to have been resolved last week. 

 Shares of auto makers such as General Motors, which fell 1 3/4 to 61 7/8, and Ford Motor, which declined 1 15/16 to 52 7/8, lost ground on concerns that slower economic expansion would rein in consumer spending. Meanwhile, traditional basic industries, except for oil stocks, lost ground on worries that a slowdown in the economy would hurt their chances to resume strong profit growth. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 54.77, or 0.51%, to finish at 10666.86, despite a strong contribution from oil stocks, which staged a recovery. Technology issues also made some progress, leaving patches of strength scattered across the otherwise declining market. 

 The session marked the third straight loss by the Dow Jones industrials, but market experts eschewed concern. The declines have been limited, with none of the triple-digit point swings in the industrial average that had become so commonplace in preceding weeks. And, beneath the average, there has been enough fundamental improvement by individual issues to engender some optimism. 

 "The last week or so, we've seen the market's longtime leaders break out in very impressive fashion," said Gary Kaltbaum, chief technical analyst at JW Genesis. Three he mentioned -- Cisco Systems (Nasdaq), which gained 2 3/8 to 61 7/8; Lucent Technologies, which rose 3 to 65 11/16; and MCI WorldCom (Nasdaq), which added 13/16 to 94 15/16 -- finished at or near their best levels of the past two months, following an extended period of investor dissatisfaction with growth stocks. 

 "The overall market gets set up in better condition overall when the leaders begin to break out," Mr. Kaltbaum said. 

 There were some gaps in the market. Drug names, another key sector of the leadership group, finished weaker generally, with Warner-Lambert down 1 7/16 to 63 and Eli Lilly off 1 7/8 to 65 3/16. 

 Technology issues, for the most part, made progress as the session wore on, enough so that the Nasdaq Composite Index finished higher for the session, gaining 17.86, or 0.69%, to end at 2598.12. Shares of Oracle (Nasdaq) advanced 1 to 35 1/8 and Intel (Nasdaq) moved up 7/8 to 56 9/16. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, bolstered, at least in part, by the upside contribution from technology, finished narrowly lower, off 2.82, or 0.21%, to 1333.06. 

 3Com (Nasdaq) declined 4 3/8 to 27 1/8. Late Tuesday, the networking-products maker warned that its revenue in the fiscal first quarter would slip and could be sluggish over the next year, prompting several analysts to cut their earnings estimates for the company. 

 Advanced Micro Devices dropped 1 1/16 to 18 3/16. The Sunnyvale, Calif., integrated-circuit maker scheduled a conference call for late yesterday wedNo, and analysts said they worried the company might issue a second-quarter profit warning or other bad news. 

 Cabletron Systems lost 13/16 to 13 5/16. The Rochester, N.H., switching-products developer declined in carry-over after investors reacted pessimistically Tuesday to details of the company's fiscal first-quarter profit report. 

 Crown Cork & Seal declined 3 1/2 to 28 15/16. The Philadelphia packagingproducts concern warned that its secondquarter profit is likely to come in below the levels anticipated by Wall Street analysts and company officials during their previous forecast. 

 A host of merger activity drove share prices in the session. Qwest Communications International (Nasdaq) fell 2 3/4 to 32 9/16. The Denver telecommunicationsservice provider boosted the price it offered U S West and Frontier in a takeover. U S West increased 1 to 58, while Frontier gained 1 7/8 to 59 7/8. Global Crossing (Nasdaq), another telecommunicationsservice company that has offered to buy U S West and Frontier, fell 1 9/16 to 45 7/8. 

 CMGI (Nasdaq) gained 4 to 98 15/16 on news that the Internet investment concern is in talks to purchase some Internet assets from Compaq Computer, including that company's search engine, AltaVista. Compaq, which rose 7.6% Tuesday, declined 3/8 to 23 7/16. 

 Metromedia Fiber Network (Nasdaq) fell 5 to 37 1/2. The New York fiber-optic communication network agreed to buy AboveNet Communications in a stock swap. Shares of AboveNet (Nasdaq) gained 4 1/16 to 40 13/16. Based on Metromedia's Tuesday closing price, the pact valued AboveNet at about $49.94 a share. 

 Shares of DoubleClick (Nasdaq), a provider of Internet advertising software, fell 5 3/4 to 84 15/16. An analyst at Janney Montgomery said CMGI's acquisition of AltaVista could hurt DoubleClick. 

 AirTouch lost 7/8 to 112 3/4. The Federal Communications Commission approved the merger between the San Francisco wireless-communications service provider and Vodafone Group. The British telecom concern's American depositary receipts fell 5 3/16 to 209 5/16. 

 Best Buy moved up 2 9/16 to 63 5/16. Standard & Poor's said the specialty retailer will replace AirTouch in the S&P 500 June 28. 

 Network Appliance (Nasdaq) added 3 1/2 to 48 5/16. The Santa Clara, Calif., developer of data servers is slated to replace Ascend Communications in the S&P 500 after the close of trading today. Ascend (Nasdaq) gained 5 13/16 to 108 3/8. Lucent is acquiring the Alameda, Calif., networkingproducts developer. 

 National Semiconductor advanced 2 1/8 to 24 5/8. Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the stock of the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker. 

 Albertson's fell 2 3/4 to 51 5/8. The Boise, Idaho, supermarket chain Tuesday said it planned to sell 41 grocery stocks to Kroger as part of a pending merger between Albertson's and American Stores. J.P. Morgan cut its rating of Albertson's. American Stores fell 1 3/8 to 32 7/8. Kroger added 3/8 to 55. 

 Declining issues beat advancers, 1,760 to 1,259, on the New York Stock Exchange, according to preliminary indicators. Share volume totaled 723.4 million, up from 704.3 million Tuesday.

 Pacificare Continues Slide As Co. Warns Analysts On 2Q

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Shares of Pacificare Health Systems Inc. (PHSYA, PHSYB) continued to fall Wednesday as the managed care company warned analysts that some second-quarter estimates were too high. 

 On Tuesday, the company called certain analysts and told them to lower their expectations for the upcoming quarter. Pacificare now expects to report earnings between $1.45 a share and $1.50 a share, compared with the First Call Corp. consensus estimate of $1.58 a share, according to several analysts. 

 The profit warning came as a surprise to many, especially since the company had been touting its growth prospects in recent weeks. When the first-quarter results were released in early May, Pacificare, in a press release, increased expectations, saying it saw earnings per share growth between 40% and 45% for the year. 

 That positive projection excluded the effects of a buyback of 13% of its shares from its largest shareholder, UniHealth Foundation. UniHealth's stock ownership is the reason Pacificare has two classes of shares. The company has proposed combining the classes. 

 But, as news of warning trickled out Tuesday, the shares were battered. Class B shares finished down 11 5/8, or 13.6%, Tuesday, while Class A shares ended the day down 10 5/8, or 12.5%, to 74 1/8. 

 In Nasdaq trading early Wednesday, Class B shares recently were off 2 1/4, or 3%, to 71 3/4, while Class A shares were down 2 1/2, or 3.4%, to 71 5/8. 

 Since the positive announcement, Pacificare had complained to some investors and analysts that its growth projections weren't being rewarded with a higher stock price. 

 "It's a good thing we didn't reward them," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. 

 Skolnick was among a number of analysts critical of how Pacificare issued the warning: calling individuals over the past few days to tell them their models were flawed. 

 Since Pacificare raised expectations in its second-quarter earnings model, "there's a standard that's set, that, if you're going to lower (expectations), you better put it in writing as well," Skolnick said. 

 Company officials weren't immediately available for comment. 

 Pacificare still has a chance to meet its previously stated earnings goals if the effects of the buyback are included. In fact, in an odd twist, the bloodbath in the company's shares over the past two days actually may help boost the additive effects of the buyback. 

 The price of the buyback, which is to take place through February 2001, is set between $70 and $120 a share. The lower the price, the more accretive the buyback.

THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING
 Business/Financial Desk; Section C 
 With bare legs in sight, Gillette begins its seasonal push to drive razor sales for women. 

 By Dana Canedy

 THE Gillette Company, seeking to take advantage of the bare-leg season of summer to increase sales of women's razors at a time when its overall business has stalled, recently began a $35 million advertising campaign for its Sensor Excel razor for women. 

 The television campaign is intended to encourage women to use the refillable razor this summer for smooth legs and highlights its two-blade technology. The commercials, created by BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group, use the tag line ''Sensor Excel -- smoother'' and feature women in summer fashions that suggest the need for a closer shave. They began appearing this month during popular television shows like ''Dawson's Creek'' and ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and are also running in Europe and Canada. 

 The company's goal is to persuade more women to try the razor and build brand awareness, said Mary Ann Pesce, vice president of global business management for female shaving at Gillette. 

 Gillette is in serious need of strategies to increase sales because business has stalled, prompting management to warn investors not to expect much improvement anytime soon. But a new advertising campaign for an already familiar brand hardly seems to be enough of a push from a company that has had a habit of disappointing investors. 

 Most recently, Gillette unexpectedly announced last week that profits in the current quarter would most likely decline 20 percent. The company has been hurt by weak economies in some countries overseas and poor performance of some of its peripheral products, like Braun electric shavers and Waterman pens. 

 While still profitable, the company has been struggling to regain its momentum since it reported a 20 percent earnings drop in the third quarter of last year -- its first quarterly decline in eight years. And besides the warning about the bleak earnings projection -- the company's third such announcement in four quarters -- its revenue and profit were flat in the last quarter, hurt in part by weakness in the Braun business. 

 Gillette has long prided itself not only on the strength of its Sensor line of razors and blades but also on its global reach and consistent delivery of double-digit earnings growth. And management promises that it will return to its typical growth rate of about 15 percent to 20 percent by the second half of this year. But investors, who have sent the company's stock tumbling 12 percent below its level at this time last year, so far are not sold. 

 Analysts say that Gillette must either shed its poor performing lines or increase their appeal to consumers through new features or catchy marketing. As important, Gillette management must regain credibility on Wall Street by delivering more consistent results. 

 But as it strives to return to the lofty level of earnings growth it is known for, Gillette may have missed a huge opportunity to drive sales. That is because a year after the company introduced Mach 3, a three-blade shaving system for men that took $375 million and more than five years to develop, it has not extended the technology to products for women. 

 Gillette said it planned to begin offering new products for women but declined to give a time frame for rolling them out or any other details. ''We are fast at work on the next generation of shaving systems for women,'' Ms. Pesce said. But, she added, ''We can't talk to what our future plans are.'' 

 Mach 3 quickly took share from other shaver systems when it was introduced in April 1998 and now has an estimated 17 percent of the United States market and 13 percent of the worldwide market despite a premium price of 35 percent above the Sensor line. 

 Analysts have said that Gillette will almost certainly come out with a Mach 3-type product for women. And Ms. Pesce acknowledged that ''there are tremendous expansion plans'' for the product, saying, ''It's not like we launched it and we're done.'' 

 Gillette, though, is about to face new competition for its three-blade razor. A competitor, the American Safety Razor Company, has started shipping a cheaper triple-blade product called Tri-Flex razor to retailers in the United States and parts of Europe. 

 ''We are looking at this competitive product to ascertain what it truly is,'' said Jill Fallon, a company spokeswoman. She said from what Gillette knows of the product so far, the company does not consider it a significant threat to Mach 3. Customers, of course, may disagree and buy based on price rather than brand. 

 Even so, Gillette is still the top seller of razors and blades, with 73 percent of the worldwide market. It is counting on its entire family of shavers, like a razor called Dazzlers that it introduced in April for teen-age girls, and the rest of its product arsenal, which includes Duracell batteries, to reinvigorate the company. 

 Gillette introduced a new ''ultra'' line of batteries this week that it says lasts 20 percent longer than last year's versions. 

 Gillette plans to support the product with about $140 million in advertising and promotions this year, though the company has not yet disclosed a timetable or details of the planned campaign. 

 Indeed, Gillette could get a much needed lift if its marketing can convince consumers that yet another new battery will keep flashlights flashing and boom boxes booming longer than, say, the competing brands with the pink bunny spokesman. 

 But with $10 billion in annual sales, a ''new and improved'' battery, even if it becomes a best seller, would still not be enough for the company to break out of its slump.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Pacificare Health Systems Inc. continued to lose ground Wednesday as the managed health-care company warned analysts that some second-quarter estimates were too high. 

 On Tuesday, the Santa Ana, Calif.-based company, which operates HMOs in nine states and Guam, called certain analysts and told them to lower their expectations for the upcoming quarter. Pacificare now expects to report earnings between $1.45 a share and $1.50 a share, compared with the mean estimate of analysts for a profit of $1.58 a share. 

 The profit warning came as a surprise to many, especially since the company had been touting its growth prospects in recent weeks. When first-quarter results were released in early May, Pacificare guided expectations higher, saying it anticipated earnings per share growth of between 40% and 45% for the year. 

 That positive projection excluded the effects of a buyback of 13% of its shares from its largest shareholder, UniHealth Foundation. UniHealth's stock ownership is the reason Pacificare has two classes of shares. The company has proposed combining the classes. 

 But as news of the warning trickled out Tuesday, the shares were battered. Class B shares finished down $11.625, or 14%, Tuesday, while Class A shares ended the day down $10.625, or 12%, to $74.125. Both are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 In Wednesday's trading, the more heavily traded Class B shares (PHSYB) fell $2.15, or 3%, to settle at $71.75, while Class A shares (PHSYA) shed $2.50, or 3.4%, to close at $71.625. 

 Since last month's positive outlook, Pacificare had complained to some investors and analysts that its growth projections weren't being rewarded with a higher stock price. 

 "It's a good thing we didn't reward them," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson Stephens. Skolnick was among a number of analysts critical of how Pacificare issued its latest warning: calling individuals over the past few days to tell them their models were flawed. 

 Since Pacificare raised expectations in its second-quarter earnings model, "there's a standard that's set, that, if you're going to lower (expectations), you better put it in writing as well," Skolnick said. 

 Company officials weren't immediately available for comment. 

 Pacificare still has a chance to meet its previously stated earnings goals if the effects of the buyback are included. In fact, in an odd twist, the bloodbath in the company's shares over the past two days actually may help boost the additive effects of the buyback. 

 The price of the buyback, which is to take place through February 2001, is set between $70 and $120 a share. The lower the price, the more accretive the buyback. 

 A Pacificare spokeswoman said the company was surprised by the market's reaction to the earnings news, since Pacificare had been "communicating the same message" for some time. 

 The company was trying to temper some of the "tremendous amount of enthusiasm by Wall Street" that followed the first-quarter earnings and get some analysts "back in line," she said. 

 Pacificare chose not to release a formal statement because it doesn't believe the adjustments are material. 

 While the company said its original projections of 40% to 45% earnings growth in 1999 excluded any gains from the share buyback, the new guidance includes such additive effects, though the company believes it will add only a few cents to the year-end figure. 


Including the buyback, Pacificare now expects to earn between $6.20
and $6.31 a share in 1999, the spokeswoman said. The mean estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call is for full-year earnings of $6.31 a
share.

 Iomega CEO: Problems Caused By Moving To 3-Pdt Co. >IOM

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Iomega Corp.'s (IOM) main problem, which forced the company to issue a second-quarter profit warning and lay off 450 workers last week, stemmed from a too-much, too-fast scenario, according to President and Chief Executive Jodie Glore. 

 "To go from a one-product company to a three-division group is a tough thing," Glore told CNBC in an interview broadcast live from New York's 1999 PC Expo. "Any company in that situation would have that kind of problem." 

 Iomega blamed its projected second-quarter loss - well below analysts' forecasts of break-even - partly on slow sales and partly on delayed shipments of its new credit-card-sized drives. Iomega is perhaps best known for its original product, the super-high-capacity Zip drive. The company also makes Jaz drives. 

 But Glore, part of a new management team hired to stopper the company's bleeding and marshal a turnaround, said Iomega just needs to focus on offering its innovative drives - of which it recently launched a few - and, even more importantly, on supporting software and services, a more lucrative business. 


"We believe the actions we're taking right now will get us to what our
major goal is, and that's profitability," Glore said.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Small-capitalization stocks headed higher Monday, following a good start by technology shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 The Russell 2000 Index, which tracks the direction of small stocks traded on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, rose 2.20 to 447.20 in midmorning trading. The Nasdaq Composite Index, which measures the performance of large and small issues traded on the Nasdaq, gained 31.20 to 2594.60 as advancers led decliners 1,721 to 1,277.

 With the exception of the insurance and telecommunications sectors, all other Nasdaq industry indexes gained ground, Among small-capitalization stocks, with market capitalizations of $1.5 billion or less, bank holding UST Corp. of Boston soared 6 1/16 to 30 5/16 after the Massachusetts bank agreed to be acquired by Citizens Financial Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Bank Of Scotland, for $32 a share, or approximately $1.4 billion. 

 Chesapeake, Richmond, Va., sank 3 1/8 to 33 7/8 after warning that it expects to miss Wall Street's profit estimate for its second quarter by between 10% and 20%. Analysts had expected the specialty-packaging and tissue company to earn 51 cents a shares in the period. 


Metricom, Los Gatos, Calif., jumped 3 11/16 to 14 3/4 after announcing
that it had received $300 million investments from both Vulcan Ventures
and MCI WorldCom to fund a national rollout of its mobile-data service.
   Phoenix Technologies , San Jose, Calif., climbed 2 15/16 to 14 5/8
after announcing the formation of a unit that will supply Internet
providers with products designed to help them reach and retain users.
Phoenix said that Softbank Holdings signed a letter of intent to

 1930 GMT [Dow Jones] Market Talk will resume at 2300 GMT in Asia. 

 1925 GMT [Dow Jones] Ford deal now heard minimum $5B 3-part deal including short term floating-rate, fixed intermediate and long-term tranches. Auto spreads wider by 3-5bps. (KG) 

 1913 GMT [Dow Jones] KN Energy's outstanding bonds continue to be pressured by the failed merger with Sempra Energy and a profit warning for the 2Q and year. KN's 6.8% notes due 2008 are at +180 bps, compared with a spread of +140 bps before the rumors surfaced. (VIC) 

 1902 GMT [Dow Jones] Merrill Lynch likes US bonds and thinks US stocks are "by far the riskier asset class" in 1999, company report says. Conversely, Merrill likes Japanese stocks but does not like JGBs, as Japanese credit market's "liabilities are still substantial." (UT) 

 1846 GMT [Dow Jones] Trader says Sep T-bonds have spent afternoon rotating aroung 114-27 level seen just before market rallied on Greenspan testimony which was taken to spell 25 bps tightening. Late afternoon gains due to day shorts getting out and the covering of positions in case of O/N intervention by BOJ, trader says. (CN) 

 1841 GMT [Dow Jones] DLJ sees Fed maintaining tightening bias after June meeting. By not changing bias, Fed can lessen market volatility after expected rate hike. Continued bias would also fit with Fed view that next move still most likely a tightening. (JM) 

 1837 GMT [Dow Jones] Volatilities on USD/JPY and EUR/USD remain up, however trading activity in NY session has remained quiet. Before any increase is seen in vols, USD/JPY would need to break 123.50, with EUR treaking either 1.0280 or 1.0420-30. (BE) 

 1833 GMT [Dow Jones] More on Japanese accounts: Short-term speculators are simply getting in and out to lock in forex gains, while longer-term investors are concerned about whether there will be more Fed tightening after expected 25 bp rate increase on June 30. (SS) 

 1829 GMT [Dow Jones] With more 30-Year supply coming in Aug., it's time to consider refunding strategies over the next weeks , i.e. sell current and old bonds to make room for cheaper bonds, primary dealer says. (UT) 

 1827 GMT [Dow Jones] Repeated BOJ intervention to weaken yen so far hasn't changed Japanese accounts' strategy toward Treasurys, despite FX gains it produces, says sales manager. Consensus is BOJ is "simply buying time" for economy to get back on solid recovery path and weaker currency is thus not sustainable. (SS) 

 1810 GMT [Dow Jones] Some unwinding of speculative longs set around 114-24/25 after early hedge fund selling ahead of corporate deals drew in buyers. Sep T-bond crests around 115-00 in recent upswing. Futures market "suffering through a summer Monday." (MM) 

 1808 GMT [Dow Jones] Rumors run rampant about FMCC's landmark securities offering. Latest is company will issue at least $5B of a 3-yr floater and 10- and 30-yr bullets. (CV) 

 1806 GMT [Dow Jones] Any wonder dip-buyers are skittish or non-existent in Treasurys? Consecutive gains in cash and futures have been scarce, occuring only once so far this month (last Wed. and Thurs) and only three times in futures since May 1. (JM) 

 1803 GMT [Dow Jones] Corporate calendar busting out. HSBC Holdings $1.5B multi-currency and Aristar $250M 10-year deals added. Secondary trading quiet; spreads out by 1-2bps across the board. (KG) 

 1801 GMT [Dow Jones] A good reason to issue spread products now: With no disruptions from significant economic indicators, this week carries the least risk when compared to next week, when policy makers will decide on U.S. interest rates, analyst says. (UT) 

 1800 GMT [Dow Jones] Additional reason for rush to issuing spread products now is that the vacation period is coming up, which is a period when the issuance dies out, New York-based strategist says. (UT) 

 1754 GMT [Dow Jones] Prudential Securities strategist is "cautiously optimistic" about Treasurys. There wont' be a bond yield below 5 7/8% until the Fed indicates "in some way" that it's finished with raising rates, which could happen in Aug., the strategist said. (UT) 

 1748 GMT [Dow Jones] The 3-month t-bill auction came in at a high yield of 4.610%, as expected, with a good bid-to-cover of 3.53. For the six-month bill auction, the yield was a touch lower than expected at 4.850%, with a healthy 4.83 bid-to-cover. (BE) 

 1732 GMT [Dow Jones] USD/JPY flat; once again, no follow-through after BOJ intervention. Analysts cite enthusiasm for JPY-assets, sharply reduced hedge-fund speculation, and view that Japanese monetary policy still too tight. On last point: Overall bank lending still down, and liquidity not what it could be after BOJ sterilized its earlier interventions. (SH) 

 1720 GMT [Dow Jones] Jun T-bonds go off board wtih little fanfair. Trader says spread went 14 1/2 bid at end from 14, approximatley 17000 still in open interest pool. Measly compared to 30k average usually seen upon expiration. (CN) 

 1716 GMT [Dow Jones] Corporate issues sneak into market before FOMC meeting, causing Treasurys to drop to lows on new hedges. Page 4215. (UT) 

 1632 GMT [Dow Jones] Yield spread between Fed Funds and 2-yr reflecting 50-75 bp tightening. Given mild inflation report last weeek, 2yr seems attractive. But wait until auction. Coupon could reach 5 5/8%. (GK) 

 1623 GMT [Dow Jones] Spread between GC repo and Fed funds still wide at around 0.12%, as collateral remains hard to come by. Biggest reason: $31B in cash management bills - a popular collateral - matured last Tues. GC will stay tight until June 24 settlement of 3-Mo., 6-Mo. and year-bills. (SV) 

 1610 GMT [Dow Jones] GovPx volume to noon $26.72B, up 0.2% from average 2Q98 Mon. Flows picked up in the wake of broad-based sell-off apparently involving dealers, hedge funds, corporate issuers and mortgage players amid full corporate calendar, soaring global stock prices and strong dollar. (SS) 

 1609 GMT [Dow Jones] Long bond yield may be poised to test June 11 high of 6.155% during the vacuum of economic calendar through early July. Earlier, low volume was making market susceptible to a small number of sell orders, notes strategist. (SS) 

 1606 GMT [Dow Jones] Trader says that lack of any kind of bounce in bond futures surprising some traders and accelerating the selloff. Lastest tally shows Morgan Stanley sold 4000-5000 Sep bonds, Carr Futures 3000. Merill and Goldman also in the market. However, Treasurys could hold if stocks get crushed, trader says. (CN) 

 1554 GMT [Dow Jones] Speculation runs wild on Ford multi-billion dollar deal. Heard on the street as much as $8B. Roadshow today in NY, ends Tuesday in NJ. Ford total $10.8B in shelf. (KG, CV) 

 1554 GMT [Dow Jones] "A lot of people realized it's still a bear market" in Treasurys, notes strategist. While mortgage-related selling and rumor of Ford upsizing undermine the belly, 2's are holding up surprisingly well despite Wed auction - thanks to curve steepener trades. (SS) 

 1552 GMT [Dow Jones] Much of the weakness in 5's and 10's is said to be rate lock selling on Ford Motor Credit's deal, expected to price this week. Adding to that are rumors that the deal has been upsized to the $6 billion area. (SV)

Greenspan Flags Minimal Rate Rise

Official interest rates in the US will be lifted by just a modest quarter of one per cent at the end of the month with a one-off hike that will not start a series of increases.

US Federal Reserve chairman Dr Alan Greenspan did not express it so bluntly but that is what analysts and financial markets heard when the central bank chief went before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress yesterday.

His words were blunter than usual though as he warned of the "developing imbalances" in the US economy that could prompt the Fed's Open Market Committee to raise short-term interest rates at its meeting in a fortnight and cited extremely low unemployment and high share prices as factors that trouble the Fed.

"For monetary policy to foster maximum sustainable economic growth, it is useful to pre-empt forces of imbalance before they threaten economic stability," Dr Greenspan said. "When we can be pre-emptive, we should be, because modest pre-emptive actions can obviate the need for more drastic actions at a later date that could destabilise the economy."

Financial markets barely moved as they listened to his widely-televised words, along with other broad hints about the need for an increase in official interest rates, but the bond market sprang to life when Dr Greenspan was questioned about the prospect of further increases to follow.

What the Fed chief said was that, "we very rarely - in fact, I don't recall ever - have a sense that we are going to do a series of increases or decreases . . . because monetary policy can be changed within minutes' notice, we don't have to have a whole series of planned changes one way or the other; we always have the capability of moving fairly quickly".

What the bond market heard was `only one increase' and prices rose immediately, sending yields significantly lower in a break-out from its bear trend of the past two months. The yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond tumbled below 6 per cent to 5.98 per cent, from 6.06 per cent the previous day and 6.17 per cent last week when the 6 per cent level was breached for the first time since November 1997.

The huge rally also dropped yields on 10-year paper (which also broke through 6 per cent last week) to 5.8 per cent while the 5-years dropped to 5.699 per cent and two-year notes fell to 5.556 per cent.

Despite the rocketing bond prices, there was little movement and barely increased volume in the sharemarket which had rallied broadly the previous day following the benign CPI figures for May, adding 103 points (4.27 per cent) to the Nasdaq Composite Index and 1.79 per cent to the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The major indices were negative for much of the session but finally closed with the Dow almost 53 points higher and the Nasdaq Composite 26.35 points higher as the Internet sector continued its recovery from the slide that began in mid-April and the technology sector battled renewed earnings worries. Those were sparked by concerns about leading semi-conductor maker Intel and a warning from Compaq Computer of a second-quarter loss of up to US15c a share compared with analysts' forecasts of a profit of US20c a share.

Dr Greenspan meanwhile re-iterated his often expressed caution about over-valuation in the sharemarket, saying it was not clear that the rise in US share prices represents a "bubble" because "bubbles generally are perceptible only after the fact".

But the Fed chairman pointed out that "a large number of analysts have judged the level of equity prices to be excessive, even taking into account the rise in `fair value' resulting from the acceleration of productivity and the associated long-term corporate earnings outlook".

Dr Greenspan said the best time to address a potential bubble in asset prices was when product prices were stable. "Should volatile asset prices cause problems, policy is probably best positioned to address the consequences when the economy is working from a base of stable product prices, as it is now," he said. The Fed chairman, who has worried publicly that the three cuts in interest rates that lowered the Federal funds rate by three-quarters of a per cent last year might have over-stimulated the US economy, said the Fed had chosen to leave rates unchanged. Productivity gains were strong and that was helping to curb inflation because they allowed businesses to pay higher wages without raising the prices of goods.

Dr Greenspan did warn though that despite the remarkable gains in US productivity, those gains have not kept up with the growth in domestic demand.

"Labour productivity has not grown fast enough to accommodate the increased demand for labour induced by exceptional strength in demand for goods and services," said Dr Greenspan, who also pointed to the declining unemployment rate as a key threat to the long-term stability of the economy.

"Should labor markets continue to tighten, significant increases in wages, in excess of productivity growth, will inevitably emerge," he said. Bond market rallies: Page 61

NEW YORK - The U.S. stock market had one of its most resounding resolutions ever to consonance from dissonance this week. Look for dissonance to begin again.

On Monday, investors were in the dumps:

-- The Bloomberg U.S. Internet Index dived 12 percent, bringing its loss since April 13 to 43 percent. (Day traders, surrender!) The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost almost 500 points in the preceding four days. The Nasdaq Composite Index was 10 percent below its April high.

-- Bond yields had shot above 6 percent. Fund managers feared to trade before Wednesday's inflation report, as the doubling of oil prices since December reawakened memories of the dreadful 1970s.

Remember the '70s? The Dow industrials rose just 5 percent for the entire decade and investors lost half their money, adjusted for inflation.

-- Talk circulated of hedge funds unable to meet redemptions, recalling the near-demise of Long-Term Capital Management last September, when banks and securities firms lost billions and U.S.

stocks had their worst quarter in eight years.

-- New York magazine published a cover story on envy, featuring the $45 million customized Boeing Business Jets and $10,000 bottles of 1870 Lafite Rothschild favored by Wall Street's conspicuous consumers. Surely the market would punish the greed with a resounding crash.

The best description for Monday comes from Dante's Inferno: "Sighs and wails and shrieks of every sort reverberated in the starless air."

There's nothing the market loves to do more than climb a wall of worry, traders say.

By the end of the week, the horror had given way to joy.

The symmetry was perfect.

The Consumer Price Index report, which had set stock, bond and the dollar reeling in May when it showed surging prices, came in unchanged on Wednesday, touching off big rallies in stocks and bonds.

By the end of the week, the Dow had recovered all of the previous week's losses and then some. Wednesday, the Nasdaq had its biggest one-day point gain ever. Internet stocks had a four-day, 18 percent rally.

Bond yields, which are used to set borrowing costs, fell back below 6 percent.

The rally in stocks caught some people by surprise. "You're not going to see any clear direction in the market for another two to three weeks," Barry Hyman, an analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said Tuesday, the day before the big rally. "We have to get the CPI number out of the way tomorrow, and some clear indication (on interest rates) from the Fed at the end of this month." Oops.

There's a passage in "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator," the classic book about 1920s speculator Jesse Livermore, about stock market panics. At such times, he said, old Wall Street veterans take out their canes, leave their comfortable homes and hobble to their brokers' offices to buy stocks to the limit of their bank balances.

On Tuesday it was time to take out the canes.

Next week, fear will start building again. The aftermath of a euphoric move like this week's is an excess of hope that will trap the weak.

The signs were evident yesterday in the optimism with which investors reacted to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning of higher interest rates, and the way they shrugged off negative news on Compaq profits.

Investors interpreted Greenspan's testimony yesterday to mean that rate increases would be limited, perhaps to just one boost.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. strategist Abby Joseph Cohen reassured investors that any Fed move would be a welcome flu shot.

Problem is, the economy's flu symptoms usually have turned out to be a more serious illness. The Fed has switched to raising interest rates from lowering them just 10 times during the postwar period. The average increase was 1.75 percentage points, and it was 2 1/2 years, on average, before the Fed stopped raising rates.

Stocks did little yesterday as ebullience waned. Compaq, after all, was only the vanguard of the end-of-quarter parade of companies warning investors that earnings will fall short of earlier projections. Yesterday, Gillette said its profit would fall short, and Intel had its earnings estimates cut at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

Maybe those canes go back into the closet for now. Still, it's not time to start breaking them over the knee.

When people come into money, they often turn for advice to James Lorie, a University of Chicago professor emeritus who wrote "The Stock Market: Theories and Evidence" and founded the university's Center for Research in Security Prices.

His studies led Lorie to the conclusion that the best returns come from buying good stocks and holding them for years. Or, as he puts it, in homage to Hillary Rodham Clinton's 10,000 percent annualized gain in the commodities market: "If you can't get Hillary to advise you, the best thing to do is buy index funds."

In the market, after all, dissonance is always resolved.

Abreast of the Market
 U.S. Stocks Move Higher On Greenspan's Remarks

 NEW YORK -- Soothing words about interest rates from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reassured Wall Street investors, sparking rallies in the U.S. stock and bond markets. 

 Shares of several rate-sensitive issues marked progress, including American Express, which rose 1 3/4 to 125 3/4, Merrill Lynch, which gained 1 15/16 to 74 7/8 and J.P. Morgan, which increased 1 11/16 to 134 11/16. 

 The gains came after Mr. Greenspan told a joint Congressional committee that he didn't anticipate a long series of interest-rate changes in the coming months, easing some worries that had built up this month. 

 "That opened a pressure valve, and the bond market, which had been very oversold, moved up on that," said Steven Kroll, managing director at Monness Crespi & Hardt. As a result, he added, "interest-sensitive stocks staged a major rally." 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't match the move in the Treasurys market, advancing 56.68 to 10841.63, but analysts noted that the stock market had anticipated the Fed's response Wednesday, when the industrial average climbed 189.86. 

 The improvement in the interest-rate backdrop also drew some comments from Abby Joseph Cohen. In a report Thursday, the market strategist for Goldman Sachs said she wasn't concerned about blue-chip valuations, saying the investment bank didn't expect either higher rates or weaker profits. 

 "Indeed, our profit assumptions may be too cautious," Ms. Cohen acknowledged. The strategist has assumed that earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index would rise 7% to 8% this year. 

 Shares of First Union rose 1 9/16 to 44 5/16 after an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read expressed confidence in the banking concern's earnings outlook. The move countered pessimism about First Union's profit growth, after bank officials last month served up the third earnings warning of the year. 

 Shares of Kroger gained 1/2 to 56 1/2, after the supermarket chain reported a first-quarter profit that matched Wall Street's forecasts and said it was comfortable with analysts' earnings expectations for fiscal 1999. 

 Oracle continued to reap benefits from the better-than-expected results reported in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Shares of the software developer, which surged 31% Wednesday, rose 15/16 to 34 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Other software stocks also rose. BMC Software gained 1 19/32 to 49 5/8 on Nasdaq, EMC added 1 7/8 to 55 5/8 and Microsoft moved 1 7/8 higher to 82 7/8, also on Nasdaq. 

 The gains in technology issues helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index higher. It rose 26.32, or 1%, to 2544.15, its best finish since May 17. 

 The S&P 500 Index rose 9.49 to 1339.90.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Technology issues have been weakened by earnings worries, and some consumer products names have eased on similar concerns, but the broad market has been shored up by the recent improvement in the interest-rate backdrop, leading to a mixed showing on Wall Street Friday. 

 Shares of Gillette are off 4 7/8 to 42 7/16, after the consumer products giant cautioned that its quarterly results won't live up to Wall Street's forecasts. 

 But the fallout from the earnings warning largely has been contained, traders said. Most investors believe that, with a stable interest-rate outlook, and improving global economies, most profit statement will live up to expectations for the quarter, and so investors are treating the occasional gaps on a case-by-case, rather than sector, basis. 

 Losing some early steam, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up just 10 points at 10851, a modest improvement after the sharper gains of the last two trading sessions. 

 Some technology issues are weaker. 

 After Morgan Stanley cut its rating on chip giant Intel, some investors are worried that the broader technology sector could be hurt if a bellwether like Intel can't live up to profit expectations, which puts the group in contrast to the broad market. Shares of Intel are off 3 at 55 on Nasdaq. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index has lost 3 points and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index has declined 1 point. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index has declined 8 points. 

 Big Board advancers lead decliners by a 7-to-6 margin. NYSE volume totals about 358 million shares, ahead of trading levels this week. The pickup, traders said, reflects the impact of the quarterly closeouts of options and futures, which has resulted in a spike in volume.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--New York stocks are expected to start stronger Friday, stretching gains from the previous session, as Wall Street continues to cheer Alan Greenspan's perspicacious testimony Thursday, when he was uncharacteristically clear about his plans for a preemptive mellowing of a churning U.S. economy. 

 "I think the air is clear as far as interest rates are concerned," said John Manahan, head trader at Brown Brothers Harriman. "I think we're on our way back to 11,000." 

 Also with a so-called triple-witching session, when futures and options contracts expire, Friday's trading should see heavy share volume, Manahan said. 

 Still, a profit warning Thursday evening from consumer goods giant Gillette could instill investors with some bearish incentive as stocks open, Manahan said. Blaming soft sales overseas, Gillette said second-quarter earnings could fall 10% below Wall Street expectations. According to Reuters Instinet, Gillette stock changed hands in premarket trading at 43 7/8, off from its Thursday close of 47 5/16. 

 Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 56.68, or 0.5%, to end at 10841.63, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 26.32, or 1.1%, to 2544.15. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 futures were up 3.6 points recently, indicating a stronger opening for the industrials. 

 In European markets, the Frankfurt DAX was recently 1.4% higher, the Paris CAC-40 had risen 0.8% and London's FTSE 100 was up 1.3%. 

 Overnight in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei average lost 0.2%, Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index jumped 1.9% and share prices on the Korea Stock Exchange inched up 0.7%. 


The following companies are among those tentatively scheduled to
report their quarterly earnings Wednesday.
                                       First Call Mean:
  A.G. Edwards (AGE)              1Q       .83

 NEW YORK -- Soothing words about interest rates from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan reassured Wall Street investors, sparking rallies in the U.S. stock and bond markets. 

 Shares of several rate-sensitive issues marked progress, including American Express, which rose 1 3/4 to 125 3/4, Merrill Lynch, which gained 1 15/16 to 74 7/8 and J.P. Morgan, which increased 1 11/16 to 134 11/16. 

 The gains came after Mr. Greenspan told a joint Congressional committee that he didn't anticipate a long series of interest-rate changes in the coming months, easing some worries that had built up this month. 

 "That opened a pressure valve, and the bond market, which had been very oversold, moved up on that," said Steven Kroll, managing director at Monness Crespi & Hardt. As a result, he added, "interest-sensitive stocks staged a major rally." 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't match the move in the Treasurys market, advancing 56.68 to 10841.63, but analysts noted that the stock market had anticipated the Fed's response Wednesday, when the industrial average climbed 189.86. 

 The improvement in the interest-rate backdrop also drew some comments from Abby Joseph Cohen. In a report Thursday, the market strategist for Goldman Sachs said she wasn't concerned about blue-chip valuations, saying the investment bank didn't expect either higher rates or weaker profits. 

 "Indeed, our profit assumptions may be too cautious," Ms. Cohen acknowledged. The strategist has assumed that earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index would rise 7% to 8% this year. 

 Shares of First Union rose 1 9/16 to 44 5/16 after an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read expressed confidence in the banking concern's earnings outlook. The move countered pessimism about First Union's profit growth, after bank officials last month served up the third earnings warning of the year. 

 Shares of Kroger gained 1/2 to 56 1/2, after the supermarket chain reported a first-quarter profit that matched Wall Street's forecasts and said it was comfortable with analysts' earnings expectations for fiscal 1999. 

 Oracle continued to reap benefits from the better-than-expected results reported in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Shares of the software developer, which surged 31% Wednesday, rose 15/16 to 34 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Other software stocks also rose. BMC Software gained 1 19/32 to 49 5/8 on Nasdaq, EMC added 1 7/8 to 55 5/8 and Microsoft moved 1 7/8 higher to 82 7/8, also on Nasdaq. 

 The gains in technology issues helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index higher. It rose 26.32, or 1%, to 2544.15, its best finish since May 17. 

 The S&P 500 Index rose 9.49 to 1339.90.

 NEW YORK -- Investment fundamentals took another appealing turn yesterday, as Alan Greenspan's soothing words helped stocks eke out another gain. 

 Shares of several rate-sensitive issues marked progress, including American Express, which rose 1 3/4 to 125 3/4, Merrill Lynch, which gained 1 15/16 to 74 7/8, and J.P. Morgan, which increased 1 11/16 to 134 11/16. 

 The gains came after the Federal Reserve chairman told a joint congressional committee that he didn't anticipate a series of changes in monetary policy moving forward, easing some worries that had built up this month. 

 "That opened a pressure valve, and the bond market, which had been very oversold, moved up on that," said Steven Kroll, managing director at Monness Crespi & Hardt. As a result, he added, "interest-sensitive stocks staged a major rally." 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average didn't match the move in the Treasurys market, advancing 56.68, or 0.53%, to end at 10841.63, but, then, it had built in much of the good news Wednesday, when the industrial average climbed 189.96. 

 Shares of First Union rose 1 9/16 to 44 5/16, after an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read expressed confidence in the banking concern's earnings outlook. The move countered pessimism about First Union's profit growth, after bank officials last month served up the third earnings warning of the year. 

 Shares of Kroger gained 1/2 to 56 1/2, after the supermarket chain reported fiscal first-quarter profits that matched Wall Street's forecasts, and said it was comfortable with analysts' profit expectations for the 1999 fiscal year. 

 Oracle continued to reap benefits from the encouraging earnings performance reflected in its better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit statement released Tuesday. Shares of the software developer, which increased 31% Wednesday, rose an additional 1 15/16 to 34 7/8 on Nasdaq. 

 Other software stocks also increased. BMC Software gained 1 19/32 to 49 5/8 on Nasdaq, EMC added 1 15/16 to 55 11/16, and Microsoft moved 1 7/8 higher to 82 7/8, also on Nasdaq. 

 The gains in technology issues helped the Nasdaq Composite Index end higher. It rose 26.32, or 1.05%, to finish at 2544.15, its best finish since May 17. 

 The S&P 500 index ended 9.49 ahead, a rise of 0.71%, at a close of 1339.90. 

 Not that all the day's earnings announcements proved positive. 

 Compaq Computer warned Wall Street of another earnings dud, saying it probably would post a second-quarter loss of about 15 cents a share. Wall Street had been expecting a profit of 20 cents a share for the period. 

 But in marking its second-consecutive quarter of disappointment, the forecast didn't shock experts, or spill over to the whole group. In fact, by the close, even Compaq shares, which were off as much as 10% intraday, and had tumbled to a 52week low of 20, had finished higher, up 1/4 to 22 1/2. 

 Intel shares declined 1 11/16 to 58 on Nasdaq, after Credit Suisse First Boston lowered its 1999 earnings estimate for the chip maker. 

 Other chip makers also suffered declines, though they proved moderate. LSI Logic lost 13/16 to 44 1/4. Micron Technology fell 1 3/8 to 45 1/8. However, Rambus, one of the more volatile names in the sector, increased 9 to 95 1/2 on Nasdaq. 

 Away from the technology sector, there were a few earnings-outlook casualties, as well. Omnicare fell 3 1/4 to 12 13/16, a loss of 20%. The Cincinnati pharmacy-services provider said second-quarter earnings are likely to come in below what Wall Street has been expecting. 

 Drug distributor Bergen Brunswig also suffered on some concerns about its profit outlook, which could be hurt by a new Medicare payment program. The stock fell 4 1/16 to 14 13/16. 

 Gillette ended 7/16 lower at 47 5/16. After the close, the consumer-products maker warned that second-quarter profit will come in below what Wall Street was expecting. 

 Procter & Gamble added 2 3/16 to 88 1/4. An analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette made some encouraging comments about the Cincinnati consumer-products company's performance this quarter. 

 McCormick added 11/16 to 30 15/16, after an analyst at Merrill Lynch issued an optimistic report on the Sparks, Md., food-products maker's earnings outlook. 

 Raytheon's Class B shares fell 2 1/8 to 72. Prudential Securities cut its rating on the Lexington, Mass., manufacturer. 

 Illinois Tool Works gained 5/8 to 78 7/16. Bear Stearns raised its rating on the Glenview, Ill., tools and industrial systems maker. 

 AVX advanced 1 5/16 to 26 15/16, reaching a 52-week high. The Myrtle Beach, S.C., maker of electronic components continued the rise that got under way earlier in the week following a Merrill Lynch upgrade of the stock. 

 Xoom.com gained 2 1/2 to 48 3/8 on Nasdaq. The San Francisco online-directmarketing concern acquired Paralogic Software, an online-content provider, for about $34 million in Xoom.com stock. 

 Viad rose 3/4 to 29 1/8. The Phoenix business-services provider received antitrust approval to sell its Dobbs International Services catering unit to SAirGroup, Zurich. 

 New York Stock Exchange trading volume totaled 694.7 million shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 1,851 to 1,196.

 Bond Yields Fall Back Below 6% --- Hints by Greenspan Spark Market Rally; Industrials Rise 56.68

 Investors fell back in love with Alan Greenspan, and they decided that bonds don't look so bad either. 

 The Federal Reserve chairman's broad hint yesterday in congressional testimony that any interest-rate increase will be a "pre-emptive," one-time event sent bonds soaring and pushed stocks up for a fourth straight day. The yield on 30-year government bonds, which frightened investors when it rose above 6% last week, fell below 6% for the first time since June 8. (Bond yields fall when prices rise.) 

 "Everybody thought it was significant that it went above 6%, and for it to get below 6% so quickly is a very positive sign in the short term," said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard A. Rosenblatt. 

 Some bond analysts are hoping that long-term rates saw their highs for the year when they finished Friday at 6.155%. 

 Hopes for a world of falling interest rates, continued economic growth and improving corporate earnings pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 56.68 points, or 0.53%, to 10841.63. The blue-chip index is now up 18.08% since the year began, just 2.39% below its May 13 record of 11107.19. 

 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond gained 1 9/32, or $12.813 for each $1,000 in face value, pulling the yield down to 5.958%. The dollar eased. 

 Even Compaq Computer's morning warning that it will post a loss for the second quarter didn't throw cold water on the market. Compaq rose 1/4 to 22 1/2; investors said that anyone who wanted to sell stock did so after one of the personal-computer maker's previous profit warnings. 

 Technology stocks in general soared, because falling interest rates make it easier to wait for fast-growing stocks to deliver earnings gains in the future. Traders also noted that, despite the Compaq announcement, they are seeing fewer negative earnings forecasts than usual for this time of year, suggesting that secondquarter profits could be strong. 

 After one of its strongest gains ever on Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite Index, heavy in tech stocks, tacked on another 26.32 points, or 1.05%, to close at 2544.15. Despite taking a beating since April, the Nasdaq composite now is up 16.03% for 1999, and is just 4.07% below its April 26 record close of 2652.05. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 9.49, or 0.71%, to 1339.90, up 9% for 1999 and 2.02% off its May 13 record of 1367.56. 

 Some stock analysts have trouble seeing stocks soaring from here, given that they are so close to their records. Bullish Goldman Sachs investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, for example, yesterday reminded clients that, given the progressive interest-rate increases since October, the S&P 500 looks about 5% overvalued to her. She nevertheless remains bullish, noting that with inflation and interest rates under control and with corporateearnings prospects solid, she sees "no valuation impediment to stock prices." 

 Ms. Cohen took a cautious view on interest rates, projecting that "intermediate- and long-term yields will not move much higher and could decline." 

 Conservative analysts noted that until Mr. Greenspan's testimony, many bond traders feared that he could boost rates 0.5 percentage point at the Fed's meeting June 29 and 30, and that more rate increases could follow. The federal-funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight, is now at 4.75%. Analysts say investors simply were taking the expectation of further rate increases out of yields, which doesn't mean that yields can't move up again later. 

 But optimists are hoping that the steady rise in bond yields, and in market interest rates, which began in October, now has finally ended. 

 "I think it has peaked," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management. In fact, he said, "There could be another big movement down in the yield" if any signs emerge that consumer spending is slowing. Long-term bond yields could be as low as 5.3% by year's end, he said. 

 Optimism that the Fed won't choke off global economic growth was even better news for corporate bonds than for Treasurys, noted Mark Mahoney, Treasurymarket strategist at Warburg Dillon Read. "Spreads," or the extra interest corporate borrowers pay above government rates, narrowed, amid hopes that a strong economy makes riskier investments worth pursuing. 

 Treasury yields have moved up a full percentage point since mid-December. Whether they can remain below 6% after this month depends on whether consumerspending growth takes off and alarms the Fed, Mr. Mahoney said. 

 Financial markets will be reacting "from economic report to economic report," said Mr. Epstein of Richard A. Rosenblatt, who warned that more stock volatility is likely. "Inflationary worries are going to be the key," he said. 

 People remain nervous that the Fed could wind up tightening more later, noted Brian Conroy, head of listed-stock trading at J.P. Morgan. But for now, that is overshadowed by hopes about secondquarter earnings. 

 "It is now mid-June and we haven't had a whole lot of preannouncements" of earnings disappointments to come, he said. "So the buzz I am hearing is: fairly strong earnings coming out in July." 

 The average share of stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange rose 28 cents, or 0.61%, to $46.06. 

 World-wide, stocks advanced in dollar terms. Excluding U.S. stocks, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 1.57 points to 158.18. 

 In major market action: 

 Stocks and bonds gained. On the Big Board, where 694.7 million shares traded, 1,851 stocks rose and 1,196 fell. 

 The dollar fell. Late in New York, it traded at $1.0339 to the euro and 119.25 yen to the dollar, from $1.0306 and 120.33 yen.

 Misplaced Comma Reportedly Costs Lockheed Martin $70 Million

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Lockheed Martin Corp. will lose $70 million in potential revenue because a sales contract had a comma in the wrong place, the Financial Times reported Friday. 

 An international contract for the U.S.-based aerospace group's C-130J Hercules had the comma misplaced by one decimal point in the equation that adjusted the sales price for changes to the inflation rate, the London-based newspaper said. 

 It was a mistake, the newspaper quoted James A. "Micky" Blackwell, president of Lockheed's aeronautics division as saying. But the customer, who Lockheed refused to name, held them to the price. 

 "That comma cost Lockheed $70 million," Blackwell was quoted as telling the newspaper. 

 Lockheed has secured contracts from three countries outside of the United States - Britain, Italy and Australia - for its C-130J, the latest version of its Hercules air transportation aircraft. 

 The news comes a day after reports that the nation's second-largest aerospace company could post a second-quarter loss even wider than its revised estimates. 

 The Bethesda, Md.-based company also may be considering divesting some of its acquired assets, Business Week reported late Thursday. Possible assets to be sold include energy and environmental units. 

 Lockheed (LMT) has suffered a recent string of missteps involving failed satellite launches and military-aircraft production problems. 

 Coffman said the company stood to lose 56 cents a share for the second quarter ending June 30, Business Week reported. 

 The revised mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed First Call was for a loss of 12 cents a share for the second quarter ending June 30. Earlier this month, Lockheed revised its second-quarter estimates, revealing that it expected a loss of 10 cents to 15 cents a share, excluding nonrecurring items. Before Lockheed's first warning earlier this month, analysts surveyed by First Call had been looking, on average, for a profit of 72 cents a share, compared with the year-ago quarter's $1.52 a share. 

 Business Week said the company's full-year income could be only half of the $3.10 a share that analysts had expected. 

 Earlier this month, the company attributed its reduced estimates to rising costs, recent launch-vehicle failures, delays in commercial-satellite deliveries and problems with its C-130J transport-aircraft program. 

 For the year ended Dec. 31, 1998, the space, defense and information company earned $1 billion, or $2.63 a diluted share, on sales of $26.27 billion.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Major market averages have reversed course in the first hour of Thursday's trading, making up early losses, and, in some cases, managing to push higher. 

 Technology issues are among the better performers, despite an early decline on the heels of another profit warning. Shares of Compaq Computer have dropped 1 to 21 1/4, after falling to a 52-week low in the early going. The computer maker warned that it was going to post another disappointing profit performance in the second quarter. 

 The spillover initially damaged the technology sector, but traders said investors quickly minimized the warning, noting that it marked the second time in as many quarters that Compaq said it was coming up short of estimates. 

 Meanwhile, trading levels have been tamed by anticipation that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will offer investors some insight into the outlook for monetary policy. The central bank chairman is testifying on Capitol Hill Thursday before a joint Congressional economic committee, one of Greenspan's more high-profile appearances. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is off 20 points in a choppy trading session, slipping to 10764, after shaking off an early 60-point decline. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index has come back to opening levels and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index has slipped a fraction of a point. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index is lone among major market indicators posting an advance, rising 11 points. 

 Big Board advancers lead decliners by a 6-to-5 margin. NYSE volume totals about 177 million shares.

JUMPY' MARKET AWAITS TODAY'S INFLATION REPORT

An Internet stock rally stalled Tuesday as investors continue to flee the high-priced shares of technology companies.

The three major stock indices rose, though they lost most of the day's gains in late trading as bonds retreated before today's consumer price inflation report.

``The market is really jumpy'' about the CPI report, said Jerry Stodden, a money manager at Chicago Trust Co., which oversees $8.5 billion. ``People can no longer count on interest-rate declines as a major motor in the stock market.''

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.66, or 0.3 percent, to 10,594.99, giving up most of a 118-point gain. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 7.16, or 0.6 percent, to 1,301.16, led by semiconductor makers and oil producers. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 16.36, or 0.7 percent, to 2,414.67 Eight stocks rose for every seven that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.

Stable or falling borrowing costs are good for stock prices because they increase the present value of future earnings relative to the guaranteed return on Treasury bonds.

Stocks had been sliding since the April consumer price index report, which showed prices rose faster than expected and led investors to conclude that the Fed will raise rates at its June 29-30 meeting. The May CPI report will be released before the stock market opens today.

Once high-flying Internet shares have been badly roughed up over 23 days of what analysts see as the breaking of ``valuation bubble.'' For example, investors had bid up online bookseller Amazon.com to $221.25 a share in April; Tuesday it managed a gain of $4.50 to close at $96.50. Priceline.com climbed to $198 in April; its shares stood at $78.43-3/4 Tuesday, up $1.56-1/4.

TheStreet.com Internet Sector Index is off 38 percent from its mid-April highs, while the Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 Composite are down only 10 percent or less from their peaks.

Investors have become more reluctant to pay high prices for Internet companies that have yet to make a profit. The prospect of higher interest rates could especially slow the earnings of young companies with high debt loads. A series of pessimistic analyst reports, warning that Net shares were overvalued, also sparked the correction.

 CHICAGO (AP) - Shares of apparel maker Fruit of the Loom tumbled nearly 13 percent Wednesday after the company warned second-quarter profits will fall well below expectations. 

 The company's stock fell $1.37 1/2 , or 12.9 percent, to $9.93 3/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, after the manufacturer said a production shortfall particularly in its activewear business would slash earnings. 

 Sales in the sports licensing division also were expected to fall because of weak industry demand and a decline in the European market, the company said in a statement. 

 Fruit of the Loom said it expects revenues for the quarter ending July 3 to fall to between $570 million and $590 million, from $628 million in the same period a year earlier. 

 The company did not provide an estimate of its earnings, but Wall Street had been expecting it to earn 49 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp.

Jersey City, NJ where Vincent L. practices with his son Vincent S.
Verdiramo, who is also corporate counsel. From time to time this CEO
has loaned money to the company to help it as is often common in
entrepreneurial start-ups. His most successful past venture was
nurturing a shell from $300,000 to $18 million in seed & fertilizer
revenues before its sale. From 1986 to 1994, he was engaged as General
Counsel for several publicly traded companies. Verdiramo has also
enjoyed teaching affiliations with several colleges and universities
within the New York/New Jersey area where he taught various courses in
business and law.
     William J. Auletta, 57, is vice president and corporate director
of marketing. From 1990 to 1994, he was founder, president and sole
stockholder of Small Business Development Group, a marketing
consultancy. Auletta has created and implemented marketing plans for
clients in over 100 different industries. He is a cofounder of IMNI.
     Richard J.



 Verdiramo, 35, is vice president. His duties include
management of online marketing activities, administration and investor
relations. Since graduating from Providence College in Rhode Island
with a marketing degree in 1986 he has been helping his father in
numerous entrepreneurial endeavors and has acquired some very valuable
startup experience.
     Maureen Hogan, 41, is the corporate secretary. From 1990 to 1995,
she worked as a legal secretary. She has extensive experience in
property management. As president of Bishop Property Management, Inc.,
Hogan has managed numerous properties for more than 10 years.
FINANCES
     This is a little company whose management wants to play in the
big league. Establishing a claim in the Internet land grab takes
millions. Management will have to raise enough to ante up if it wants
to play in the game. Also the outcome of the Chapter 11 reorganization
of the CPM subsidiary will have an important impact on the value of
the IMNI current liabilities.

COMPETITORS
     IMNI and it's acquired and targeted companies have competition in
their own industries and market segments. For example, CPM has several
competitors that operate in each of the three business areas in which
it functions. Plus, competition for Internet services and products
such as those provided by the company is increasing at a very rapid
pace and can be expected to increase even more rapidly with even
stronger competitors emerging as the technology and market opportunity
evolves. Some of these competitors will have greater financial and
marketing resources than the company. Furthermore, the Internet is
changing so rapidly as "an Internet land grab" goes on few really
understand what is happening and fewer still will be able to keep up.
Many Internet companies do not appear to care how much money they will
lose in their quest for increased market share. Such companies make it
difficult to make money in many niches.
RISKS
     Additional acquisitions will need to be closed during the coming
year in order for the company to achieve its highly ambitious
projections. There is no guarantee that IMNI and the targeted
companies will agree to a final contract or that the proposed
acquisitions will close. The company's commission salespersons, both
existing and anticipated, must perform well. Indeed, both the growth
in revenues, earnings per share and the financing of additional
acquisitions are contingent on the company's ability to obtain
additional financing.
     The company's current auditors put "a going concern warning" in
the 1997 and 1998 annual statements. Recent current assets exceed
current liabilities by almost $1 million as the CPM operation was put
into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Doesn't that sound like that mill unit is
a difficult business? Will a turnaround stick?
     Another pitfall is that the cofounder's wife, Mrs. Marion
Verdiramo, who is also the company's largest shareholder with
approximately 20% of the total, has options on 2 millions shares
exercisable at $0.10. CEO Vincent L. Verdiramo, who takes no salary,
professes the family wants to build a solid company and is not in it
for a quick profit. To date no insiders have sold any stock. The
options were granted to Marion Verdiramo in exchange for her agreeing
to cancel 2 million shares that had been previously issued to her
through a loan conversion. Her shares were canceled in an effort to
reduce the number of outstanding shares. Still the options exist.

 Europe Stk Focus:Ericsson Seen Topping SEK300 This Yr

 STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Recent strength in Swedish telecom share LM Ericsson AB (ERICY) has forced a rethinking by market observers, who now say the share price may top SEK300 by year-end, up 12% from Monday's close. 

 Interest in the stock is being supported by greater awareness of Ericsson's leading role as a mobile infrastructure supplier, together with the launch of new handsets and a change in the U.S. tariff structure. 

 'We should definitely see the stock moving up to SEK320 this year, and the only risks I see are macroeconomic, like higher U.S. rates, rather than company-specific,' said Lars Soederfjaell, telecoms analyst with Stockholm brokerage Myrberg Fondkommission, which rates Ericsson a strong buy. 

 Many other firms also have 12-month target prices at or above SEK300, such as Deutsche Bank Morgan Grenfell which recently raised its forecast to SEK330 and maintained its strong buy rating. 

 'Many analysts have reassessed the company in the last month or so and taken a much more positive view,' said Soederfjaell. 

 The share took a severe beating during the second half of last year, which culminated with Ericsson issuing a profit warning for 1999 on Dec. 10, partly because of poor handset sales and restructuring in the fixed line division. 

 But in the past three months the share has added around 30%, and Monday it closed at SEK267.5, up SEK2.5 from Friday and up 3.9% in the past week. 

 New Phones To Add To Profits In Last Quarter 

 Investors have now come to terms with the fact that 1999 will be a lost year for Ericsson, and the company has estimated that the 1999 pretax profit will be around SEK17 billion, down from SEK18.2 billion in 1998. 

 For next year, the market consensus is a pretax profit of just under SEK25 billion and the turnaround should start to materialize in the fourth quarter this year, partly due to better handset sales. 

 Ericsson recently released the first of a range of new phones, and sales so far seem solid, industry insiders say. 

 However, company officials and industry analysts have complained that both media and the market have been too focused on mobile phone sales, which only account for 20-25% of Ericsson's sales. 

 'More and more investors are realizing that Ericsson is and has always been an infrastructure company with some handset business rather than the other way around,' said Adnan Ahmed, telecoms analyst with Merrill Lynch in London. 

 He has an 'accumulate' rating on Ericsson and a SEK305 12-month target price. 

 Ericsson is the undisputed world leader in supplying digital network systems for cellular telephones with a global market share estimated by Ericsson to be around 40%. 

 The systems side makes up the backbone of Ericsson's profits, and analysts expect the market to grow by up to 30% per year as mobile phone usage continues to explode globally, reaching an estimated one billion users by 2004. 

 This year, Ericsson cemented its lead as infrastructure supplier with a deal with U.S. rival Qualcomm whereby some long-dated patent disputes were settled and Qualcomm's infrastructure unit was acquired. 

 'The Qualcomm deal was indeed important since it gave them just about the only standard (Code Division Multiple Access, CDMA) they didn't have in their portfolio,' said Gunnar Andersson, chief telecom analyst with Swedish bank group Handelsbanken in Stockholm. 

 Leading Third-Generation Tech Development 

 The telecoms giant has also taken the lead in General Packet Radio Services (GPRS), a technology that speeds up existing digital networks, enabling faster Internet access. 

 Some analysts believe that Ericsson has up to a 12-month technological lead over others in GPRS, and so far Ericsson has won the majority of contracts awarded. 

 GPRS is a step on the way toward third-generation (3G) mobile communication, which enables very fast data transmission speeds and video conferencing using a cellular phone. 

 'Ericsson is very well positioned to take a hefty stake of the business once it takes off commercially,' said Mattias Willander, telecoms analyst with MeritaNordbanken group in Stockholm. Willander has a 'buy' rating on Ericsson and a target price of SEK270 but will probably raise it to around SEK300 later this year, he said. 

 Ericsson recently clinched the first commercial order for third-generation infrastructure from Japan's leading cellular operator, NTT DoCoMo. The network is scheduled to come on stream in 2001. Ericsson has already delivered experimental 3G systems to several operators in Europe and Asia. 

 In North America, it will take longer for 3G to catch on, since the continent lags Europe in cellular development. But one reason for this may soon be history, as the U.S. is set to change regulation to allow calling parties to pay for cellular phone calls - as in Europe. Currently, the North American cellular subscriber pays for all calls to and from the mobile phone. The change is expected to lead to heavier use - as in Mexico where, when a similar change was introduced, traffic in the cellular networks rose 10%. 

 'The increase in traffic will generate demand for more infrastructure which will benefit us as well as other equipment makers,' said Ericsson spokesman Erik Oesterberg.

BAD: UNCONTROLLED GROWTH IS HURTING ALL RESIDENTS

My family and I live in the beautiful Lake Prince area of Suffolk, where the empty lots we purchased in the late 1970s for just over $25,000 now go for $150,000 and a house we built for $100,000 in the early 1980s now appraises for well over three times that much.

And what do we get for this exorbitant valuation? Municipal sewage? No. City water? No. A public school system we'd dare send our children to? No. A decent library - or any library with evening and weekend hours? No. A single public swimming pool in the entire city? No. A public transportation system of any kind? No. An Internet provider within range of a local phone number? No. Just an annual $2,000+ tax bill that provides us with nothing more than once-a-week garbage pickup.

And does this $5.50 per day service come with recycling? Of course not. There's a reason they call this Surprising Suffolk.

Residential development outstripped this city's ability to provide an adequate array of public services for its citizens quite some time ago. If you don't think so, then the letter being sent out from the so-called ``Virginians for Economic Prosperity'' was written just for you. But not for me.

The letter warned me that the value of my property may be reduced because of the proposed Unified Development Ordinance (UDO). I read this letter in utter disgust and then remembered that the out-of-town lawyers who are being paid to put out this drivel are working under some preconceived notions about Suffolk, some of which are now, unfortunately, becoming true after too many years of uncontrolled growth. The drafters of this letter are counting on stupidity and appealing to greed.

Who stands to win if these clowns succeed in convincing enough of us that we should be scared of this simple - and long overdue - mechanism to control growth in our community? Who stands to profit by making it legal to put five or six homes on a plot of land, instead of one or two? Who rushed here to scarf up available land, buying building permits years before any of them planned to actually build?

Who will not be around after all the planned houses get built and the new residents discover we didn't have enough schools to properly educate the children that are already here?

Who doesn't already understand that the beautiful lakes and rivers that drew so many of us out here years ago are becoming progressively more polluted every year because of undersized and failing septic systems? But does Suffolk have any plans to install sewerage to these homes? Not any time in the foreseeable future. Because Suffolk doesn't have enough of a tax base to provide the necessary resources.

We need to pull in the business first and we can do that by careful planning and improving what is already here. And the UDO is a good start.

Notice that only the developers are hinting at ``no growth.'' Nobody wants that. Nor does anybody want Suffolk to continue developing into nothing more than a bedroom community for people who can only find jobs in Norfolk and Virginia Beach.

We need to learn from the Chesapeakes that surround us. Growth without controls is a guaranteed recipe for overcrowded highways, polluted waterways, increased crime, overcrowded schools with low standards and large groups being taught out of ``temporary'' trailers, inadequate services - and, just as predictably - an overall lowering of the quality of life in Suffolk and falling property values.

Now just what were these developers warning us about again? Oh yeah, a potential for falling property values. Only they are talking only about profit per acre and we're talking about enjoying and carefully developing what we already have.

I applaud the political leadership shown by Suffolk Mayor E. Dana Dickens and a handful of elected officials who are doing the right thing. I thought only Meyera Oberndorf had that kind of courage around Hampton Roads. The safe and gutless approach would have been to get in on the developer gravy train until it rode out of town - and publicly complain about becoming another Chesapeake.

 Ford Reshuffles Leadership Of European, Brazilian Auto Operations

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Ford Motor Co. Friday reshuffled some of its overseas leadership, moving James D. Donaldson from president of Ford of Europe to group vice president of Global Business Development, where he will be responsible for directing both automotive and nonautomotive businesses. 

 Ford (F), which is No. 2 behind General Motors in world-wide sales, said Donaldson had strengthened the Ford of Europe organization during his tenure, and Ford will benefit from having a seasoned veteran with a global perspective working on strategic issues. 

 Nick Scheele, who reported to Donaldson, will replace him at the top spot in Europe. Scheele was most recently senior vice president for marketing, sales and service in the European operations. Before he took the job at Ford earlier this year, Scheele was chairman and chief executive officer of Jaguar Cars Ltd. 

 The changes are effective July 1. 

 In another change involving its international operations, Ford on Friday named Antonio Maciel president of Ford Brazil, based in Sao Paulo. Maciel replaces Ivan Fonseca e Silva, who was named vice president for strategy and business operations of Ford South American Operations. 

 Ford Brazil has been struggling to overcome losses as well as a dispute with the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. The state stopped payments in March on financial incentives it had promised if Ford would build a $1 billion assembly plant there. State officials argued that, because of Brazil's shaky economy, the money was needed for public services and wages. In April, Ford Brazil abandoned plans to build the facility. 

 Ford's Brazilian operations posted a loss of $165 million in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $45 million a year earlier. 

 Ford hasn't issued any overall profit forecasts this year, but analysts expect it to extend its string of 12 consecutive quarters of profit growth. The mean estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by First Call is for per-share earnings of $5.56 for 1999, compared with $5.28 in 1998. 

 Nevertheless, Chief Executive Jacques Nasser warned its white-collar work force last month that their 1999 performance bonuses won't be as high as expected unless profit and other indicators of corporate performance improve. Ford said Thursday that Nasser's e-mail message to 50,000 salaried workers was meant to refocus their attention on improving the business, and wasn't a profit warning. 

 Nasser, who took over as CEO in January, has been pushing Ford to focus more on consumers and post higher profits. 

 Separately, Ford's Board of Directors elected six new corporate vice presidents Friday, effective July 1: 

 - Earl Hesterberg, vice president, marketing, sales and service, Ford of Europe; 

 - Brian Kelley, corporate vice president and chief operating officer, Ford Investment Enterprises Corp. Kelley was most recently vice president and general manager for sales and distribution at General Electric Co.'s (GE) Appliance division. 

 - Bobbie Gaunt, corporate vice president. Gaunt keeps his responsibilities as president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd.; 

 - Jim Schroer, vice president, global marketing. Schroer was executive director, Ford Marketing Strategy and Brand Management Office. 

 - William Cosgrove vice president, strategy and chief financial officer, Premier Automotive Group; and 

 - Frank Taylor, executive director, material planning and logistics.

 Paris Air Show To Focus On Deals, Military Themes 

 By Robb M. Stewart

DJ

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Mention aerospace and Europe in the same breath and someone can come up with a scenario for a new merger or takeover. 

 Industry consolidation will be a prominent theme at this year's Paris Air Show, which begins Saturday and lasts until June 20. But with peace apparently agreed in Kosovo, people also are sure to be discussing military themes. 

 This will be the 43rd biennial Paris show and similar to England's Farnborough Air Show, held in alternate years, contracts and orders will be flying fast and thick. 

 But analysts say there will be added incentive for executives in attendance to put across a positive message. By next year's show, the industry order cycle will be well past the recent peak. 

 "Lockheed has spoilt the party a bit already with a profit warning," said Salomon Smith Barney analyst Nick Cunningham. The warning is "specific to them, but it changes the mood." 

 "There's a good chance people will be feeling less good by the time we get to Farnborough," he said, adding observers are now trying to gauge how deep the trough in the cycle will be. 

 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) Wednesday said it expects to be in the red in the second quarter, losing from 10 cents to 15 cents a share. The U.S. company's financial review shocked analysts who had been expecting earnings per share of about 72 cents in the second quarter. 

 But while Lockheed - which had been planning a decidedly no-frills presence at the Paris Air Show anyway - has cast a shadow over the event, another U.S. company has reignited interest in M&A activity. 

 This week began with the unveiling by diversified manufacturer AlliedSignal Inc. (ALD) of an agreement to buy Honeywell Inc. (HON) in a stock swap valued at more than $14 billion. Key to the deal is the combination of the two companies' respective flight-safety and avionics products. 


The U.S. is far more consolidated than Europe, which has had to
contend with political and geographic borders when companies have sought
to strike deals.
   Number Of Possible Orders Could Be Unveiled



There has been a piecemeal approach to consolidation in Europe since
the end of the Cold War.



One of the biggest moves of late, the acquisition of General Electric
Co. PLC's (U.GEL) Marconi defense assets by British Aerospace PLC
(U.BA), continues to meet with brusk responses in Germany and France,
where local group's had been hoping to agree to cross-border deals with
the British companies.



But France's Aerospatiale-Matra (F.AEM) is likely to be quiet on that
front, said Salomon's Cunningham, as it concentrates on showing off its
range of products following its recent merger with the Matra Hautes
Technologies division of Lagardere SCA (F.LGD) and subsequent flotation.



Analysts agree there is still room for deals, particularly
pan-European moves that would create companies capable of competing with
the likes of Lockheed, Boeing Co. (BA) and Raytheon Co. (RTNA).



One small, but strategic deal expected this summer is the sale by the
Spanish government of a stake in Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (E.CSA).



BAe, Aerospatiale, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG of Germany and Alenia
Aerospazio of Italy are all vying for a piece of Casa. The Spanish
company holds minority interests in European joint ventures Airbus
Industrie (F.ABI) and Eurofighter.



One further deal that is currently being worked on is a restructuring
of BAe's missiles joint ventures into a company that could potentially
rival Raytheon, the guided weapons powerhouse.



BAe is linked to Aerospatiale through Matra BAe Dynamics, to Alenia
through the GEC division it is in the process of acquiring and to Saab
AB (S.SAA) thanks to a minority interest in the Swedish company.
Industry insiders say BAe is talking to each of its partners in the
hopes of merging the missile activities.



Missiles are particularly important at the moment. The U.K. government
is preparing to announce the winner of its beyond visual range
air-to-air missile, or BVRAAM, contract, which is likely to become the
backbone of weapons for the Eurofighter strike jet in most countries.



Competing for the contract are a consortium including BAe and other
led by Raytheon.



BAe and its partners have labeled the bid battle a war to break an
American monopoly on the industry, as the war in Kosovo and the number
of Raytheon missiles streaking across the skies suggested.



Raytheon has indicated it expects replacing munitions used by Nato in
the Balkans could lead to about $1 billion in new contracts.



This, say analysts, will stimulate conversation during the Paris Air
Show about levels of government spending in coming years and the
development of so-called smart weapons in preparation for future
conflicts.



Companies "may stress the need to get new equipment into service in a
more timely fashion and about the need for more consolidation," said
Clive Forestier Walker, analyst at Charterhouse Securities.



Also expected, said one company official, is a decision on the U.K.'s
Airborne Stand-Off Radar, or Astor, contract being bid for by a
consortium including Britain's Racal Electronics PLC (U.RCA) and partner
Lockheed against Raytheon and a third group including BAe and Northrop.



The initial Astor order is worth some GBP750 million, but follow on
export orders could be valued in the billions.



There is also likely to be a spree of commercial orders, said
Salomon's Cunningham. "If they haven't saved any up (to unveil at the
show), then the comparison numbers with last year are going to be
terrible."



One theme, carried over from Farnborough last year, will be the
rivalry between Airbus and Boeing, although Charterhouse's Forestier
Walker noted there aren't likely to as many orders as were announced at
Farnborough now that the cycle is reversing.



People will also being looking to Airbus for hints on the development
of the superjumbo A3XX aircraft and on the progress of faltering talks
between the consortium partners on turning Airbus into a single
corporate entity.



Airbus is controlled by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, Aerospatiale, BAe
and Spain's Casa.

 Ford Motor Co.'s chief executive officer has warned the auto maker's roughly 50,000 white-collar workers in the United States that their 1999 bonuses won't be as high as expected unless corporate performance indicators improve. Ford described the E-mail message from Jacques Nasser last month as an effort to refocus salaried workers on improving the business, not a profit warning.

 - NATO and Yugoslav generals met again at a French military base in Macedonia to discuss arrangements for the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. 

 - Senior Indian and Pakistani officials seemed ready to discuss ways of defusing renewed tension since fighting erupted last month over the disputed province. 

 The Wall Street Journal: 

 - US AIR issued a profit warning in an indication that a continued slowdown in traffic and revenue is taking a toll on the industry despite recent fare increases and moderating growth plans. 

 - Stocks and bonds were hit with a new spate of interest-rate worries. The Dow Jones industrials fell 143.74 to 10765.64. The yield on the 30-year Treasury briefly crept above 6 percent, but it eased to 5.99 percent in late trading.

US Airways says 2nd-quarter  profit  won't meet analysts' expectations TRANSPORTATION: It is the second major airline in a week to issue such a  warning .

US Airways Group Inc. became the second airline in a week to warn that second-quarter profit will fall below analyst forecasts because of higher costs and lower-than-expected demand. The No. 6 carrier and most rivals announced reduced fares Tuesday. 

US Airways said profit will be about $1.80, to $1.85 a share, less than the $2.15 average forecast in a First Call Corp. analyst survey. Its shares fell $2.69, or 5.2 percent, to $48.88, leading a decline in airline stocks. 

UAL Corp., parent of No. 1 carrier United Airlines, issued a similar warning last week. U.S. carriers, which are adding seats and flights with the U.S. economy in its ninth year of expansion, have encountered resistance as leisure and business travelers balk at higher fares. UAL responded Tuesday with summer discounts, followed by US Airways, AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and others. 

Among other airlines following suit were Delta Air Lines, Northwest and Continental. 

US Airways revised its second-quarter outlook in a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying May traffic was "softer than anticipated" and that expenses "are expected to be somewhat higher than planned." 

Costs were higher in part because some labor contracts were settled earlier than expected and the company adjusted wages, US Airways said. Another factor is "lingering higher-than-anticipated" transition costs related to Sabre Group Holdings Inc.'s computer- reservations system. 

In late April, President and Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal had said he expected US Airways to "comfortably make" a First Call average forecast at the time of $2.10 a share. 

UAL fell $2.56, to $63.81, while Northwest dropped $1.44, to $31.06. AMR fell $2, to $67.69.

 Power company issues urgent request for use cutbacks

 MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) - New England utilities are preparing to break a record for power usage today. 

 ISO New England, an independent non-profit corporation that is responsible for bulk power transmission in New England, issued its first-ever power warning Monday, calling upon home and business customers to cut back their power use however they could. They continued the power warning today until 8 p.m. 

 "We are seeing power useage that is higher than it has ever been in the month of June, and is approaching all-time records," said Steve Costello, a spokesman for the Massachusetts-based ISO New England. 

 The temperature hit a record high of 94 in Burlington and 96 in Lebanon, N.H., Monday, and more hot weather was on tap today. 

 With that in mind, electric companies said voluntary cutbacks were necessary to counteract the surge of air conditioning use all over New England. 

 "If customers do not respond to this appeal, the electricity companies may have to interrupt power to limited numbers of customers during the day to protect the region's electricity system," ISO said in a statement. 

 The situation is more serious than usual right now because several New England plants are off-line for routine maintenance, Costello said. 

 "This time of year normally that is not a problem at all," Costello said. "Those plants will be on later this sumer, so we don't expect a problem later." 

 Also, heat waves that strike in the beginning of the week, as this one did, use more power because air conditioning systems must cool off office buildings and factories that have been gathering heat all weekend. 

 "There's a huge drain," Costello said. 

 ISO New England has forecast a peak load of 21,021 megawatts of power for today - just shy of the all-time record of 21,407 megawatts, Costello said. The region has operating reserves on hand. As a last resort, the power companies might institute "rolling blackouts," where utilities would shut off circuits for an hour at a time around the region. 

 "It's never happened in New England, and we hope that we won't get there, but it's a possibility," Costello said this morning. "We've never issued a power warning until yesterday." 

 The National Weather Service in Burlington said the temperature would be slightly lower today, in the high 80s, and would drop sharply tonight.

 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - A batch of mergers and speculation of more to come kept European shares firmer on Monday afternoon, countering worries of a wobbly euro and delays in resolving the Kosovo crisis. 

 Defensive stocks such as technology, telecoms and drugs were the strongest performers, along with energy. 

 French conglomerate Vivendi  and film-to-television group Pathe  said on Monday they had agreed to merge on the basis of three Vivendi shares for every two Pathe shares. Vivendi shares traded 0.45 percent higher, while Pathe shares gained 0.11 percent. 

 French broadcaster Canal Plus  soared on the perception that the deal made a Canal Plus/BSkyB link more likely. 

 Shares in Dutch steel and aluminium company Hoogovens  were down 0.44 percent after details of its anticipated merger with British Steel  to create a European steel giant were released. British Steel, the dominant partner in the deal, slid 8.2 percent. 

 But analysts said external factors including developments in Kosovo and concern about a U.S. interest rate hike later this month continued to cloud sentiment. 

 "There is still no solution in Kosovo and that will take time, and we are expecting some economic figures in the United States at the end of the week and so people are focused on that," said Dirk Ley, head of European equity sales at WestLB in Duesseldorf. 

 "The general trend is still sideways," Ley added. 


The broad market Eurotop 300 index	    was up 0.73 percent. The narrower euro zone blue chip Euro STOXX 50 index		 gained 0.97 percent.



S&P 500 stock index futures were up 2.2 two points. indicating a flat to higher start on Wall Street.



But Europe's gains lagged other global markets.



"On the whole, there is not a great amount of money flowing into Europe at the moment," said Philipp Buchli, vice president of equity trading at Swiss Bank Julius Baer.



The euro hit fresh lows against the dollar amid worries about Kosovo, but expectations that the infant single currency will reach parity with the greenback were holding back non-eurozone investors from buying euro-denominated shares, Buchli added.



The euro traded at just below $1.03 after hitting a low of $1.026.



Among individual sectors, technology was the strongest gainer, led by a 12.6 percent jump in Dutch software company Baan , continuing last week's strong run. Traders spoke of rumours that Microsoft  or PeopleSoft  wanted to take over Baan, but other dealers said orders and the appointment of a new chief executive officer, Mary Coleman, lay behind the surge.



Coleman told Reuters the group wanted to remain independent and saw little chance of being acquired.



Shares in Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier   slid 7.9 and 4.9 percent in London and Amsterdam respectively after a profit warning for 1999.



Reed blamed competitive pressures on its Lexis-Nexis legal information product, and weaker advertising at its Cahners Business Information product.



French oil group Elf-Aquitaine  increased its offer on Monday for Norway's Saga Petroleum ASA  in a battle for control with Norway's Norsk Hydro .



Elf raised its cash bid to 125 Norwegian crowns per share from 115, or a total of $2.34 billion. Shares in Elf rose 1.8 percent, while Saga was up 3.6 percent. Norsk Hydro shed 0.46 percent.



Shares in British security firm Williams Plc  rose 13.4 percent after the company said it had received an approach from U.S. security firm Tyco International Ltd. .



Dixons Group  said it will spin off its Internet service provider, Freeserve. The British retail chain's stock rose 3.5 percent.

RESIDENTS APPEAL GROUP HOME IN LELAND GROVE / NEIGHBORS BOTHERED BY SURPRISE OPENING

Residents of a Leland Grove neighborhood plan to express concern Tuesday night about a group home for the developmentally disabled that moved into

the neighborhood last fall.

Residents say they do not mind living by a small group home, but they are upset at the way it came about.

The home, at 2034 Clubview Drive in Leland Grove, houses developmentally disabled residents. The problem is, it was up and running before neighbors even knew it was there.

Residents plan to express their views at a hearing before Leland Grove's Zoning Board of Appeals Tuesday night.

Representatives for Unlimited Development Inc., which administers the five-resident home, are seeking a zoning variance to operate the home.

The outcome may be a foregone conclusion, however. By requesting a variance, Unlimited Development, a Galesburg not-for-profit firm, is merely following a process Leland Grove has wanted them to do all along. But as they've argued since Leland Grove sued them in October, federal law forbids municipalities from discriminating against the developmentally disabled in their zoning laws. "According to the Fair Housing Act, you can't discriminate against the developmentally disabled," said Springfield attorney Edward Cunningham, representing Unlimited Development. (Attempts to contact Unlimited Development were unsuccessful). "We've complied with the statute." However, residents say a little advance warning would have been a matter of common courtesy. "I don't know what it is they need, but I feel they picked Leland Grove because we're a small village in a big city," said Rita Harmon, a resident on Clubview. "We're not trying to get rid of them, but it's like, they moved in and the village wasn't even notified." A big worry, neighbors say, is the traffic around the home. At least six cars are parked outside it at any given time, with as many as 11 parked in the driveway and on the street sometimes. "We're just a cul-de-sac, and I worry whether fire trucks will be able to get up and down the street," said one neighbor, who asked that her name not be used.

Leland Grove city attorney Mark Cullen says cities have some say in group homes despite the federal statutes. "I don't agree with the conclusion that they are not required to follow all applicable zoning ordinances of a municipality," he said. "My belief is a city can enforce its zoning ordinances with respect to group homes." The final decision rests with Leland Grove's city council, which will act on the recommendation of the city's Zoning Board of Appeals.

Since both parties have what amounts to a gentleman's agreement to seek a variance, it's unclear what will happen should either the zoning board or city council deny the variance, said Cunningham, who was unwilling to speak for Unlimited Development on that issue.

He was sure of one thing, however -- group homes do not present a danger to the neighborhood, he said. "The residents there are under constant care, with a staff there 24 hours per day," he said. "These people who help in the cooking and get the residents going in the morning and off to their workshops. They go on outings and offer a supportive environment." The zoning hearing will be 7 p.m. Tuesday in Vachel Lindsay Elementary School, 2000 Chatham Road.

NEW YORK - The Dow Jones industrial average rose for the fifth time in six days, led by AlliedSignal, on optimism that the No. 1 maker of flight systems' purchase of Honeywell will help it cut costs and sell more products to aircraft makers.

"The stock market gets excited when it sees mergers, and I suspect it's going to continue," said Gil Knight, a money manager at Allied Investment Advisors in Baltimore. "Bigger can be better - it means you achieve a lot of synergies and can cut out various costs."

Columbia Energy Group and First Security also soared on takeover offers.

The Dow average rose 77.88 to 10,877.72 in midday trading, with AlliedSignal accounting for 22 points of the gain. Big Board volume was about 351 million shares.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 3.47 to 1,331.22. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 27.81 to 2,506.15.

AlliedSignal gained $4.375, or 7.5 percent, to $62.75.

Honeywell's stock was up $7.813, or 7.4 percent, to $112.813.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Tecnost's EUR9.4 billion bond took Europe's debt markets into a new realm Thursday, breaking records as the largest-ever bond from a European corporate. 

 The deal set a precedent, demonstrating how important a part bonds can play in Europe's burgeoning mergers and acquisitions activity. It's also the first major European test of underwriting and distribution management within the context of a takeover bid. The proceeds of the bond issued through Tecnost International NV will be used to finance Olivetti's hostile takeover of Telecom Italia. 

 Lehman Brothers International, Chase Manhattan International, Mediobanca and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette had lead manager honors on the deal, entering into a redistribution and market agreement. Officials at Lehman, spokesperson for the lead managers, weren't available for comment. 

 Although technically a success - oversubscribed and trading up since pricing - some members of the co-lead manager selling group cited frustrations regarding the exercise: what they said was a lack of information leading up to Thursday's pricing; an over-long gray market period; and a small allocation of bonds. 

 Traders in the group said the bond had been in the 101.5 to 102.0 range all session, well above the par launch price. The bond seemed to be settling around 101.8. "We have seen both selling and buying, with most of the selling coming from Italy," said a trader at a bank in London. 

 The Olivetti bond has had a complicated birth. The bookbuilding process demonstrated the difficulty of balancing shareholder and investor demand for the bonds and in doing so how you can't always satisfy everyone. 

 In a way, problems regarding the allottment of Olivetti's bond were down to its own success. Even when Olivetti raised its floating-rate note to EUR9.4 billion from EUR7.9 billion demand completely outstripped supply as the order book totalled some EUR11.0 billion. 

 Olivetti will use the increase in proceeds to kickoff its refinancing of its EUR10.6 billion syndicate loan taken out to partly finance its hostile takeover of Telecom Italia. In May, Olivetti garnered 51% of Telecom Italia shares after offering its shareholders EUR11.5 a share made up of EUR6.92 in cash and the rest in bonds and shares in Olivetti's Tecnost Spa subsidiary. 

 At 185 basis points over Euribor - some 100 basis points cheap to other Triple-B comparables - trading escalated in the gray market over a period of some 10 days pushing the price of the bond up to around 101.70 before official pricing Thursday. The bonds were officially priced Thursday at par and carry a call option after three-years. 

 By Thursday's close, there had been no sign of the kind of large profit taking some dealers were warning of. Given the trading up, some participants questioned whether 185 basis points over Euribor was too cheap a level for the bond. Others though said that the 51% acceptance takeup showed that pricing was fair. 

 There was never any fixed date for pricing Olivetti's bond, the leads had said earlier in the week. But the gap between the closure of the order book and the official pricing was due to the complexity of allocation along with delays attributed to the regulatory matters regarding Italy's first hostile takeover. The deal could only be priced for example, after Consob, the Italian market regulator, had signed off on changes in the nature of the financing of Telecom Italia, specifically the increase in the bond issue and the downsizing of the loan. 

 When it came down to allocation, with little chance of equity holders selling their bonds through the pot at par when they could sell them outside the group in the gray market at a much higher level, there were only some EUR1.5 billion of bonds available in the open market. 

 Even so, some members of the selling group said they had expected a much larger allocation than actually received given the overall size of the order book. They said they were aggrieved that the work they had put into selling of the FRNs and their client-list name give up to the leads hadn't been rewarded as much as they expected. 

 The selling group weren't also able to join in the positive grey market trading as they had to offer the bonds at the previously determined price of par. Some co-lead managers were also critical about pricing the transaction during a German holiday which they said limited the chance of their German clients getting hold of the rare bonds.

And while American markets convince themselves that an interest rate hike is coming from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada has recently suggested it sees no need to adjust rates any time soon.  

"A worse case scenario is usually when you have a divergence in monetary policy," said Jeff Rubin, chief economist with CIBC World Markets.  

The loonie closed trading at 67.39 cents US on currency markets, down 0.45 of a U.S. cent from Monday.  

Another round of American inflation jitters was triggered yesterday by a manufacturers' report that showed the price of raw materials was on the rise -- the first such price increase in a year and a half.  

The markets, which loathe surprises, reacted swiftly. Interest rates on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond -- a key financial indicator -- rose to 5.93 per cent from last Friday's 5.83 per cent.  

That triggered another mortgage rate increase in Canada, where the Royal Bank raised its rate on six-month mortgages by a tenth of a point, effective today. The big banks have increased longer-term mortgage rates three times in the last month to reflect higher borrowing costs in the North American bond markets, where they finance their house loans.  

LOEWEN GROUP SEEKS CREDITOR PROTECTION  

VANCOUVER -- The Loewen Group Inc. is seeking court protection from its creditors.  

The B.C.-based international funeral-services company said yesterday it is applying to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States and under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act in Canada.  

Loewen said its American subsidiaries have a commitment of $200 million from First Union National Bank to cover trade and employee obligations and other cash needs during the restructuring. Its Canadian operations "have sufficient liquidity to fund daily operations."  

The restructuring had been expected as Loewen struggles with $2 billion in debt taken on to finance rapid expansion in the United States, where it now does 90 per cent of its business.  

WORKERS AT NIAGARA PARTS PLANT INK DEAL  

NIAGARA FALLS -- Workers at a Niagara Falls truck brake-parts plant have ratified a three-year contract that gives them across-the-board wage increases of $1.50 an hour.  

The 83 production employees endorsed the deal at Brunner Manufacturing and Sales Ltd. by almost a 70-per-cent margin. Gains were also made in contract-language changes in safety, vacation scheduling and union recognition. There were also health and other improvements made by the workers, represented by Canadian Auto Workers union Local 199.  

STRUGGLING NEWBRIDGE POSTS MAMMOTH LOSS  

TORONTO -- Newbridge Networks Corp. posted a $29.8 million loss in its fiscal fourth quarter as the troubled high-tech company took a charge to cut costs and streamline operations.  

Net operating earnings for the quarter, excluding non-recurring gains and charges, were $33 million, which represents 12 cents US per share -- far below what analysts had forecast before the company issued a profit warning last month.

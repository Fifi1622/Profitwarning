 Judge to rule on Web use of Ford documents DETROIT - A federal judge will rule by Sept. 7 whether a self-proclaimed Ford enthusiast violated company trade secrets and copyright law when he posted internal Ford Motor Co. documents on his Web site. 

 Robert Lane is under a temporary restraining order issued last Wednesday ordering him to remove the documents and any material copyrighted by Ford. 

 U.S. District Judge Nancy G. Edmunds said she will decide within the next week whether the Dearborn, Mich., resident can repost any of the 112 Ford documents he claims to have received from anonymous sources. 

 Among the documents is an internal memo detailing problems with the 1999 Mustang SVT Cobra. Ford announced recently that all 5,300 models sold had been recalled to fix exhaust problems that cut as much as 50 horsepower from the 320 horsepower the car is supposed to have. 

 Lane and his attorney claim Lane is a journalist, and the limits against his site, www.BlueOvalNews.com, are an illegal prior restraint. SEC chairman wonders about NYSE IPO Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt told New York Stock Exchange officials that their plan to convert to a public corporation doesn't provide enough independence to the Big Board's self-policing unit. Misgivings at the SEC, which must approve any NYSE move to go public, could delay the Big Board's plan to move quickly toward an initial public offering, perhaps as early as November. 

 A NYSE spokesman declined to comment. The NYSE, the world's largest stock exchange, and its chief rival, the National Association of Securities Dealers' Nasdaq Stock Market, both have said they plan to convert their not-for-profit membership organizations into publicly traded companies. Bonds tumble on interest rate concerns U.S. government bonds suffered the biggest decline in three weeks as evidence of strong U.S. growth raised concern last week's Federal Reserve interest-rate increase won't be enough to curb inflation this year. The Fed may also pay more attention to U.S. stock prices when it meets to set rates next on Oct. 5. That's a concern for bond investors, given this year's stock market gains that have increased consumers' wealth and made them more willing to spend. The 30-year bond plunged 1-5/32, or $11.56 per $1,000 face amount, to a price of 100- 30/32. A lineup of corporate debt sales also sapped demand for Treasuries, helping push yields up 9 basis points to the highest level since Aug. 16. Two-year note yields rose 7 basis points to 5.73 percent. Interest rates rise in Treasury auction Interest rates on short- term Treasury securities rose in yesterday's auction. The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 4.875 percent, up from 4.850 percent last week. An additional $7.5 billion in six-month bills was sold at a rate of 4.990 percent, up from 4.950 percent. 

 The three-month rate was the highest since Aug. 24, 1998, when the bills sold for 4.920 percent. The six-month rate was the highest since Aug. 3, 1998, when the rate was 5.030. 

 The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors - 5.017 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,876.80 and 5.205 percent for a six- month bill selling for $9,747.70. July home sales approach a record New home sales unexpectedly rose in July to the second-highest level ever as consumers and builders prospered from job and income growth, government figures showed today. New single- family home sales rose 0.1 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 980,000, exceeded only by last November's total, the Commerce Department said. 

 June's sales pace was also revised to 979,000 units, up from an initial estimate of 929,000. Both exceeded analysts' expectations and put 1999 sales on a pace to beat last year's record by more than 6 percent. A challenger for Wal-Mart Carrefour SA said it will buy rival French supermarket owner Promodes SA for 16.1 billion euros ($16.8 billion) in shares, creating the world's second-biggest retailer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of the U.S. Carrefour offered six new shares for each of Promodes, or 841.8 euros a share, a 20 percent premium to Friday's close. 

 The takeover creates a company with 9,000 stores on three continents, overtaking Germany's Metro AG as Europe's biggest retailer. The combined operations, which will hold one-quarter of the French retail market, will be able to demand lower prices from suppliers to better compete with Wal-Mart, which is expanding in Europe and could target France next. CompUSA looks to cuts costs CompUSA Inc., the largest U.S. retailer of personal computers, will halve its commercial sales force, eliminating 1,800 jobs, to trim costs and help revive earnings. CompUSA has 3,600 employees, many based in its stores, who sell goods to corporations, schools and governments. Those sales will be organized by region to eliminate overlap in jobs and office functions. CompUSA has about 22,000 U.S. workers in total. Investment firm puts $1 billion into McLeodUSA Forstmann Little & Co., a New York-based buyout firm, will invest $1 billion for a 12 percent stake in McLeodUSA Inc., allowing the provider of local and long-distance phone services to expand its fiber-optic network in the U.S. midwestern and Rocky Mountain states. Forstmann Little, led by billionaire financier Theodore Forstmann, will receive McLeodUSA preferred shares that are convertible into common stock at $36.50 each in five years. Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based McLeodUSA may buy back the securities, which pay interest at 3.5 percent annually, after seven years. 

 McLeodUSA said the investment will speed development of its 8,500-mile network and let it introduce services to better compete against the large regional phone companies such as U S West Inc. and Ameritech Corp. McLeodUSA and other fast-growing phone companies need billions of dollars to build networks to handle soaring demand for voice, data and Internet services. A profit warning from Office Depot Office Depot Inc., the world's largest office-supply retailer, said second-half profit will be less than analysts' forecasts because of slow sales, rising paper costs and expenses for opening new stores. The retailer also said it plans to buy back as much as $500 million of its stock. 

 Office Depot said it expects to report earnings for the second half of 38 cents to 40 cents a share, compared with analysts' expectations for 50 cents to 52 cents. It also said it expects to take charges in the third quarter of $62.5 million, or 16 cents a share, to relocate or close older and disappointing stores, and to write down certain fixed assets and slow-moving technology products in its warehouses and stores. The shares of Delray Beach, Fla.-based Office Depot fell 9/16 to 133/4. Dresdner Bank will talk with Banque Nationale Dresdner Bank AG said it will "immediately" hold talks with Banque Nationale de Paris SA on expanding their alliance after a French regulator refused to let BNP, the country's largest bank, buy rival Societe Generale SA. "The bank wants to intensify its cooperation" with BNP, a Dresdner Bank spokeswoman said. "We will open these talks immediately." Germany's third-biggest bank owns 1 percent of BNP. BNP Chairman Michel Pebereau's plan to build a French bank with $1 trillion in assets was thwarted when France's banking regulator ruled BNP couldn't keep the 37.15 percent of SocGen it bought after a six-month takeover battle. FDA rejects filing for cancer drug Coulter Pharmaceutical Inc. and SmithKline Beecham Plc said U.S. regulators rejected their application to sell the cancer drug Bexxar, asking for more information before reviewing it. Coulter shares fell as much as 33 percent in trading before the opening of U.S. markets. The Food and Drug Administration asked the two companies to provide additional analysis of data and to reformat sections of their application to market Bexxar, a radioactive drug to treat non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

 Coulter, a biotech company that has yet to bring a product to market, said the setback will delay the FDA's decision on approval until April.

Riding The American Dream

In her final report after three years in Washington, Jennifer Hewett reflects on the unstoppable economy.

RULES? What rules? The United States economy is simply refusing to play by them. All those regular expert warnings about the possible resurgence of inflation and the damaging collapse of exports and the inevitable slowdown of growth have the tinny tone of another era.

American consumers are laughing all the way to the mall - or at least giggling over their Web pages.

The most sustained crisis on Wall Street in the summer of 1999 has been how impossible it is to find waiters for all those posh New York restaurants opening up weekly.

On Main Street all across the rest of America, established companies keep investing with relentless enthusiasm while entrepreneurs are behaving like rabbits mating with money to spawn thousands and thousands of new small businesses.

And while the ranks of baby-faced Internet millionaires may be expanding daily the high tide of this economy is managing to roll just about everyone along with it.

The largest percentage increases in pay are finally coming for those at the bottom of the scale. The most common sign in store windows - apart from "sale" - is "now hiring". Yet the highest proportion of all those jobs being created are those requiring technical and management skills and paying above the median wage. Nationally, unemployment may be just over 4 per cent but in many areas, and certainly for college graduates, it is less than 2 per cent. And all this is in the middle of an immigration surge.

So much for the misery index. What went so right?

Even the US Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, doesn't profess to be exactly sure. It is almost a year since he announced grimly that the US couldn't permanently remain an oasis of prosperity in a troubled world. Instead, American prosperity has only become ever more lush. It is also more than two years since the Reserve chairman issued the first of many public warnings that the stockmarket was suffering from "irrational exuberance". Instead, despite some nerve-racking dips and a severe case of the wobbles right now, the market has largely continued its dizzying ascent.

The doubts haven't stopped, of course. How long can this version of economic nirvana really go on? Can the trade deficit be comfortably ignored indefinitely? Does the recent fall in many Net stocks mean the bubble has finally burst?

The answers depend partly on whether the good news of the last few years is due to an extremely fortuitous set of circumstances - the big boom part of the familiar boom-and-bust cycle - or whether something far more fundamental has also changed.

Despite the obvious advantages of scepticism, the idea of fundamental change in the economy is attracting an increasing number of supporters. The names for this phenomenon vary only slightly - new paradigm, new growth, new economy.

The most optimistic version of this is that the computer revolution is creating something akin to the changes wrought by the industrial revolution - or at least the development of electricity. It is radically altering the way the economy and society work.

That means that all those high-tech companies and the explosion of the Internet and electronic commerce - not to mention the soaring stock market -have become more like the signposts to the exploding frontiers of a new world. In this world, all the traditional problems have been largely eliminated from the equation. The trade-offs between inflation and unemployment and growth no longer apply, for example, because they have been superseded by the value of constant innovation in a wired world and the ability of companies to transform themselves.

Exhibit A is usually the increase in US productivity over the past several years after a very sluggish two decades. This is regarded as the belated pay-off for the investment in computers and technology that is finally beginning to filter through the whole system and will only increase in pace and scope. The jury is still out on the long-term effect of this revolutionary fervour, of course.

And the opposing argument relies on far more modest old-fashioned explanations for recent US economic strength than on any grand "New Anything" idea. It is based on long decades of tough experience rather than the headiness and possibilities evident in the past few years.

Their version of Exhibit A is that the Asian economic crisis had, if anything, a positive effect on the US economy rather than causing it problems. It drastically lowered the prices of commodities and imports, helping flatten domestic inflation while the lavish spending within the US overshadowed the export decline.

The shockwaves in the world's markets also created a new flood of capital into the US, looking for safety but also helping to cheaply finance all that US business expansion and consumer spending. At the same time, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates three times a year ago to try to prevent the spread of global panic - just when its normal predisposition would have been in the other direction. That's over now.

Consumers, bolstered by their growing sense of wealth, courtesy of the stock market as well as the ease of credit, are more willing than ever to stretch themselves and their wallets. The housing market is burning hot.

This week the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the second time, taking back two of last year's three cuts. But the market, expecting it, shrugged it off.

As for the increases in productivity, the sceptics are still dubious that the numbers are anything like as extraordinary as they sound. Some economists contend that almost all the increase is due to the huge leap in the productivity of computer manufacturing which is still only a small proportion of the overall American economy.

Some of that more cautious assessment should be sobering. Yet at the close of this century, as the US heads steadily towards its longest ever period of unbroken economic growth, it is becoming awfully hard to argue with American-style success and its faith in the value of change.

The result is that if the 1980s gave greed a bad name, the 1990s have made excess thoroughly fashionable. The next decade will surely test the bounds of what is real in cyberspace. But the country is now 8 1/2 years into an expansion that has repeatedly revved itself up again every time it seemed to be petering out. Whatever the precise arguments over productivity statistics, for example, it is obvious in practice that businesses are able to rely on computers and databases and better communication to operate more efficiently and react more quickly. Production lines work more smoothly, deliveries are more targeted, marketing improved, planning more flexible, costs can be pruned. It means business has clearly been able to expand capacity even faster than strong demand. Bottlenecks have become aberrations rather than the norm. Plenty of businesses do fail, especially if they can't adapt to the revised rules, but new ones can begin even more quickly. The significant growth, particularly in jobs, doesn't come from the big companies but from the small ones and particularly the ones associated with high-tech where the US remains an ever stronger leader.

It is true that the vision of a new company with a "dot com" in its name doesn't instantly generate millions of dollars as the usual storyline implies. According to venture capitalists, for every 10 Internet companies that attract financing, about two companies are going to make it big, with commensurate profits for all involved. About three will do reasonably well by being sold off; five will fail.

Several of the huge Net successes of the past few years have had their soaring share prices suddenly drift down to earth. And for all the general hype about day trading and the horror of the recent massacre by a day trader in Atlanta, about 90 per cent of those investors who try it for themselves lose money in a bull market.

Even so, the less spectacular stories about the new economy are still positive. Between 1995 and 1998, the information technology sector accounted for 8 per cent of America's GDP but 35 per cent of economic growth. The US Commerce Department predicts that by 2006, almost half the US workforce will be employed by industries that are either big users or producers of such technology and be adding value at a far faster rate than workers in the rest of the economy.

Yet so far, companies have also been able to help keep wages down - even in such a tight labour market - by more generous use of options and share ownership and pension plans, financed in large part by the boom in the stock market.

A relatively big jump in earnings in the last three months has made people nervous that the wage inflation so long feared by Greenspan may be finally showing up as logic demands. But the competition out there - particularly China - may prove stronger still.

So what's the catch? One potential problem is clear enough. If people are now so used to the stock market going up and up, they may be more directly affected by any move down and down - particularly as their financial cushions are so threadbare. So far, though, the nerves of ordinary consumers have held steadier than most experts.

In the panic of the last northern summer for example - when Russia defaulted on its debts and Latin America looked close to the edge and all the world's markets shook and shivered - it was the blithe confidence of the small investors that did so much to stabilise things.

That Bill Clinton was the one grimly warning at the time that the world faced the greatest financial challenge in more than half a century didn't faze them for more than a few days. That sense of profound optimism about the future could still evaporate relatively quickly. Take the belief that so many new Internet companies which are yet to make a dollar of actual profit should be valued higher than huge and successful manufacturing concerns. Maybe it all really will crumble quickly if investors sense it is just a shell game.

But don't bet on it. At least not yet. And don't believe anyone really knows the right answer.

 NEW YORK - Stocks closed lower Friday, in step with bonds after markets were unnerved by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 

 It was the second session of losses for stocks and bonds and the lightest trading session of 1999 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.28, nearly 1 percent, to close the session at 11,090.17. It has lost just 10.44 for the week. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell more than a full point, sliding by 11/8. The loss pushed the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, to 5.98 percent. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.72 to 2,758.90, and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index declined 13.74, or 1.01 percent, to 1,348.27.     While the S&P was little changed for the week, up 11.66, the Nasdaq gained more than 4percent for a 110.56 gain. 

 Greenspan  said central banks must consider the prices of stocks when setting monetary policy. Wall Street took the comments to suggest a another possible interest rate hike. 

 Analysts warned about reading too much into the losses Friday, considering the very light summer volume and the fact that many traders were lightening positions ahead of the weekend. 

 The Dow is still only about 236 points shy of its new closing high of 11,326.04 set Wednesday. 

 American Home Products Corp. fell $3.88 to $42.13 in heavy trading. A federal judge ruled patients in up to 44 states could collectively sue the pharmaceutical company for health monitoring costs after using two diet drugs. 

 Dave & Buster's Inc., the chain of restaurants with entertainment, warned of disappointing second-quarter profit and fell $11.13, or nearly 45 percent, to $13.75. 

 Another profit warning came from Plantronics Inc., a California maker of communication headsets. It said advance and contingency planning for the year 2000 was beginning to affect demand for its products, which could continue into next year. The stock fell $16.81, nearly 24 percent, to $54.44. 

 Shares of Intuit Inc., the larg- est maker of personal-finance software, jumped $8.19, or almost 10 percent, to $91.06 after it said fourth-quarter sales and earnings topped Wall Street expectations.

 ((Updates to unofficial close)) 

 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed near the day's lows as jumpy investors sold into the weekend, spooked by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on asset valuations. 

 Based on early and unofficial data, the Dow Jones industrial average closed off 108.28 points, or 0.97 percent, to 11,090.17. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq fared slightly better, but still fell 15.75 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,758.87. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners easily beat advancers 1,758 to 1,112 on very light volume of 556.2 million shares, according to unofficial data. 

 Analysts said many investors were lightening up their positions ahead of the weekend, especially with more light summer trading forecast for next week. 

 Fed chief Alan Greenspan startled the markets, knocking stock indices into negative territory, with his comments that central banks must consider the prices of stocks when setting monetary policy, signalling a growing focus on the equities market. 

 "He clearly has expressed concerns about the speculation in the stock market," Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y., said of Greenspan's remarks to a gathering of the world's top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 

 American Home Products Corp. fell 3-15/16 to 41-15/16 in heavy trading. A federal judge ruled patients in up to 44 states could collectively sue the pharmaceutical company for health monitoring costs after using two diet drugs once used in the fen-phen slimming cocktail. 

 Dave & Buster's Inc., the chain of restaurants with entertainment, was one of the day's losers after it warned of disappointing second-quarter profits. The stock fell 11-1/8, or 45 percent, to 13-3/4. 

 Another profit warning came from Plantronics Inc., a California maker of communication headsets. It said advance and contingency planning for the Year 2000 was beginning to affect demand for its products, which could continue into next year. The stock fell 16-13/16, or about 24 percent, to 54-7/16. 

 Shares of Intuit Inc., the largest maker of personal finance software, jumped 8-3/16 to 91-1/16 after it said fourth-quarter sales and earnings topped Wall Street expectations. 

 Earlier Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department said personal income for July was up 0.2 percent, spending was up 0.4 percent and the savings rate declined 1.4 percent. Incomes grew at their slowest pace since December.

 NEW YORK, August 27 (Reuters) - Stocks, bonds and the dollar fell on Friday as Wall Street worked up a frenzy after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said central bankers must consider stock prices when setting monetary policy. 

 It was the second session of losses for stocks and bonds and the lightest trading session of 1999 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 In the commodities markets, gold and oil rose. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 108.28 points, nearly 1 percent, to close the session at 11,090.17. It has lost just 10.44 points since last Friday. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell over a full point, sliding by 1-1/8 late Friday. The loss pushed the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, up to 5.98 percent, close to the key 6 percent level. Late Thursday, the long bond's yield was 5.90 percent. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell 15.72 points or 0.57 percent to 2,758.90 and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index declined 13.74 points or 1.01 percent to 1,348.27. 

 In the broader market, decliners easily beat advancers 1,760 to 1,107 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 553.2 million shares. 

 Fed chief Alan Greenspan startled the markets, knocking stock indices into negative territory by saying central banks must consider the prices of stocks when setting monetary policy. Wall Street took the comments to suggest a growing focus by the Fed on whether the rising stock market could create a "wealth effect." 

 "He has clearly expressed concerns about the speculation in the stock markets," Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said of Greenspan's remarks to a gathering of top world central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 

 Analysts said the comments meant investors could not ignore the chance of a rate hike when the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee meets in October. 

 "I think it's less than a 50-50 chance they will raise rates," said John Manley, senior equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "But (Greenspan) doesn't want the market to be confident that they won't do it. If we see strong growth in the economy, there's a very good chance they are going to raise rates." 

 Analysts warned about reading too much into the losses, considering the very light summer volume and the fact that many traders were lightening positions ahead of the weekend. 

 The Dow closed the week just 10.44 points lower than last week and nearly 236 points shy of its new closing high of 11,326.04 set on Wednesday. 

 Among those stocks that took a hit on Friday were Dave & Buster's Inc., the chain of restaurants with entertainment. The stock plunged 11-1/8, or 45 percent, to 13-3/4, after the company warned of disappointing second-quarter profits. Another profit warning came from Plantronics Inc., a California maker of communication headsets. It said advance and contingency planning for the Year 2000 was beginning to affect demand for its products, which could continue into next year. The stock slid 16-13/16, or about 24 percent, to 54-7/16. 

 In currency markets, the dollar slipped to 111.35/45 late on Friday from 111.50/60 late on Thursday. The dollar also lost ground against the euro, which crept up to $1.0462/69 from $1.0444/51 as Thursday's trading wound down. 

 COMEX December gold ended at $255.50 a troy ounce, up 90 cents, on some light position squaring ahead of the weekend. The outlook is still dark in advance of another British auction of gold reserves, traders said. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October crude oil futures contract settled at $21.27 a barrel, up 32 cents, near its intraday high of $21.30, reached near the close. Traders linked the gains on Friday to a short-covering rally. 

 Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index eased 8.7 points or 0.14 percent to 6,375.2. For the week, the FTSE 100 index was up 194.4 points. In Tokyo, the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended down 66.92 points or 0.38 percent at 17,599.37. The Nikkei 225 average fell 498.74 points over the week.

 Analysts warn of lower earnings at petrochemical companies

 HOUSTON (AP) - After a warning from Houston-based Lyondell Chemical Co., financial analysts have lowered their third-quarter earnings estimates for many petrochemical companies by as much as one-half. 

 Analysts are concerned about the impact of sharply rising prices for feedstocks derived from crude oil and natural gas. The companies use feedstocks such as naphtha and ethane to make plastics, chemicals and products such as antifreeze. 

 Prices for polyethylene and other products of the companies have risen, but not as quickly as the price of feedstocks, analyst Paul Leming of ING Barings in New York told the Houston Chronicle. 

 The feedstock ethane, derived from natural gas, rose from 17 cents a gallon during the third quarter of last year to an average of 32 cents this quarter, trading as high as 41 1/2 cents, according to industry sources. 

 Naphtha has increased from about 30 cents a year ago to about 50 cents per gallon now. 

 Meanwhile, the price of polyethylene that the companies sell rose by about 50 percent during the first half of the year, Leming said. 

 Chemical companies typically can't raise prices right away to reflect higher costs, said Lyondell spokeswoman Jackie Wilson. 

 On Tuesday, Lyondell chief operating officer Morris Gelb warned analysts in New York that earnings estimates weren't factoring in rising feedstock costs. Lyondell didn't make any precise forecasts. 

 As a result of the warning, Leming cut Lyondell's third-quarter profit estimate from 20 cents per share to 10 cents. By late Wednesday, First Call Corp. had counted three downward revisions by analysts - from 25 cents to 10 cents, 5 cents to break-even, and 20 cents profit to a loss of 15 cents per share, said Chris Maher of First Call. 

 Lyondell's stock price dropped Wednesday by $1, or about 6 percent, to close at $15.50. Other chemical companies saw their shares lose value as well, including Dow Chemical, Union Carbide and Millennium Chemicals.

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - U.S. share prices rose Wednesday as gains in the bond market raised confidence for continued strong corporate profits. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial average rose 42.74 to 11,326.04. Volume of the New York Stock Exchange was a strong 847 million shares. 

 The S&P rose 18.29 to 1,381.79, while NYSE winners out weighed losers 1,610 to 1,382. The NASDAQ composite rose 71.24 to 2,719.70. 

 Continued gains in the bond market, where the 30-year bond yield shaved off another 8 basis points to 5.85%, have firmed expectations that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates this year. 

 Bank One shares dropped 12 1/2 points to 43 1/8 after reporting losses in its credit cards area. Bank One's profit warning pressured others in the financial sector, though most issues closed off their lows.

 * U.S. Treasurys ended sharply higher Wednesday for the second consecudive session, amid good volume and led by intermediate issues as a positive tone from Tuesday's Federal Reserve action lured buyers, sources said. Sources said there was strong buying from retail accounts as well as mortgage-related buying and hedge fund buying. In debt futures, Sep T-bonds broke through long-term downward sloping trendlines from last October. 

 * Bond bulls appeared clearly to be in the drivers seat Wednesday as the benchmark 30-year T-bond futures rallied on what floor traders termed as "a one-sided technical rally." Sep T-bond futures rallied to new monthly, weekly and daily highs of 116 25/32 Wednesday at midsession. Rick Kelleher, a floor broker at ED&F Man International, said, "the market was caught a little off base this morning as they never even glanced at the durables data, which was a clear signal that the technicals had built up force." 

 * Implied volatility on U.S. Treasury bond options faltered Wednesday as the underlying Sep T-bond broke out of a consolidation pattern and looked to be moving to higher levels. 

 * U.S. share prices rose Wednesday as gains in the bond market raised confidence for continued strong corporate profits. The Dow Jones Industrial average rose 42.74 to a record 11,326.04. Bank One shares dropped 12 1/2 points to 43 1/8 after reportijg losses in its credit cards area. Bank One's profit warning pressured others in the financial sector, though most issues closed off their lows. 

 * The dollar ended little changed vs the euro !nd the yen Wednesday but was holding near a key technical level against the euro. Euro-dollar hovered near $1.0420 all afternoon just above key technical support at $1.0380. Dollar-yen ended just above Y111.00 as a persistent bid near Y110.80 turned back repeated downside forays, traders said. Japanese life insurance company bids wait just above Y110.50 but stop-loss sell orders lurk between Y110.50%30, traders said. 

 * Former Federal Reserve Vice Chair Alice Rivlin Wednesday said the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to raise leading interest rates appeared not to be an easy one and that the question of inflation in the U.S. economy remains a close one. Rivlin, in a lengthy live interview broadcast on CSPAN, said the Fed could just as easily have decided not to raise rates. The FOMC on Tuesday hiked the federal funds and discount rates 25 basis points each to 5.25% and 4.75%, respectively. 

 * "The evidence that interest rates need to be raised is that we've had a long time of very low unemployment, we're running low on the pool of additional workers that can come into the labor force, wages are going up fairly rapidly and there is concern that this will put upward pressure on prices and the Federal Reserve is acting to preempt that," Rivlin said. "I think that's sort of a close question, could be argued either way and the Fed signaled that i thought it was a close question by saying we have a symmetrical bias now," Rivlin said, referring to the FOMC's opting for a neutral stance looking ahead to its next meeting. 

 * While many of the sharp words ex#hanged by President Clinton and congressional Republican leaders in recent weeks have focused on tax cuts, Medicare and Social Security, the looming fiscal brawl this fall will almost certainly have little to do with any of these subjects. Instead, the sharpest words, hardest fights and most dramatic brinkmanship is likely to occur over efforts to pass the 13 annual spending bills for the 2000 fiscal year tat begins Oct 1. 

 * "There is no doubt the big action this fall is going to be on the appropriations bills," says Stan Collender, director of fiscal policy for the Fleishman-Hillard public relations firm. "It's going to be a very tough, contentious fall. And there is a much better chance than most realize for a government shutdown. Not an intentional shutdown, but one caused by small majorities, especially in the House, and weak leaders," Collender adds. 

 * U.S. bond funds saw asset outflows at an estimated monthly rate of $700 million in the four-day period ended Augusd 23 vs. outflows of $500 million in the three-day period ended Aug 19, Trim Tabs said. Equity funds saw net inflows at a monthly rate of $54.2 billion in the latest period compared to outflows at a monthly rate of $11.6 billion in the previous period. Bond funds h`d actual net outflows of $100 million in the latest period vs. inflows of $800 million in the previous week. 

 * U.S. House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert continued to make the case for the Republican-drafted tax cut package Wednesday, saying the "well-deserved tax relief" will "keep the economy going." Hastert's latest written statement is part of an ongoing effort by Republicans to build public support for a tax-cut package totaling $792 billion over the next 10 years. The bill passed both houses of Congress in early August and will be sent to the White House in September, when lawmakers return from their August recess. 

 * U.S. furniture makers say their industry is as healthy as they've seen "in a long time," spurred by strong consumer demand for furniture across all ends of the cost spectrum. The only exception appears to be in the office furniture segment of the market, which has suffered steep declines in growth rates over the past two years - although year-to-year comparisons continue to be positive, industry officials say. For the second year in a row, there is no sign of the summer doldrums that would otherwise slow manufacturing and sales in furniture intended for the home, they note. At the same time, competition is bringing down prices - a situation that is generally being offset by higher volume sales, they say. 

 * U.S. July durable goods orders jumped 3.3%, much moe than expected, with surges across categories that show factories should remain busy into the fall. The median estimate in a Market News International poll of economists was for a 0.8% gain in durables orders, and the high estimate was +2.3%, still too low for the result. The orders gain suggests a jump in 3Q production - cleaRly not consistent with the slowing in the economy some Fed officials talk about. New orders were pretty uniformly strong in July. Defense orders spurted 27.8%, but new orders excluding defense were up a strong 2.6%. Transportation orders rose 2.0%, but ex-transport orders gained 3.7%, their largest jump since February 1997. 

 * U.S. sales of existing single-family homes fell back in July but continued on a pace to set a new record for 1999, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. For July, realtors reporte$ sales of existing homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million units, down 3.9% from the revised June rate of 5.63 million, but up 4.6% from the July 1998 pace of 5.17 million. The median forecast in a Market News International poll of 17 economists had been for sales to fall 4.5% to 5.29 million in July, with estamates ranging from 5.50 million to 5.50 million. 

 * U.S. self-service regular unleaded gasoline prices rose 8.1 cents to $1.255, per gallon in August vs. $1.174 per gallon in July, the American Automobile Association reported Tuesday. 

 * Total U.S. electricity output was 77,982 million gigawatt-hours in the week ended August 20, up 2.2% from the year-ago week and down 0.7% from last week, the Edison Electric Institute reported Wednesday. Output was 76,283 million gigawatt-hours in the week ended August 22, 1998, while output totaled 79,310 million gigawatt-hours in the week ended August 14, 1999. 

 * Brazil's foreign reserves fell $51 million Tuesday to close at $41.871 billion, down from Monday's clos of $41.922 billion, the Central Bank reported Wednesday.

 Blue Chips Hit Record 11299.76; J.P. Morgan Leads Banking Stocks

 NEW YORK -- Blue-chip stocks jumped to a record despite widespread expectations of rising interest rates. 

 Bank stocks interpreted a steady performance from the Treasury market -- with the yield on the long bond slipping back below 6% -- as an all-clear signal. Shares of J.P. Morgan rung up a gain of 6 13/16 to 139 3/4. Citigroup tacked on 2 1/4 to 48 9/16. First Union improved 1 13/16 to 44 1/2. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average pushed 199.15 points higher, its sixth-biggest single-session point gain this year, and 15th highest of all time. (On a percentage basis, the gain doesn't rank with the all-time leaders.) The industrials ended the session at 11299.76, eclipsing the high of 11209.84 set July 16. 

 A host of growth names, which had been hidebound for the past several weeks, as investors worried about the impact higher interest rates would have on valuations, scored what were, in some cases, stunning gains. 

 Drug makers such as Merck, which added 2 7/16 to 70 1/16, as well as Eli Lilly, which rose 3 7/16 to 71, moved higher. Biotechnology issues advanced sharply. MedImmune (Nasdaq) moved up 7 5/16 to 111 5/16, a 52-week high. 

 Internet issues finished higher, with Yahoo! (Nasdaq) up like the Yahoo of old, gaining 7 1/8 to 152 1/8, while other technology issues posted sharp improvements, as investors flocked into leading issues. Dell Computer (Nasdaq), which had 49.3 million shares traded, added 2 1/2 to 45 3/4, while Microsoft (Nasdaq) moved ahead 3 1/16 to 86 7/16. 

 The strong advance came just a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, where policy makers are broadly expected to raise interest rates a quarter of a percentage point, and flew in the face of conventional wisdom on Wall Street. Most investors, though, apparently agreed that the Fed would limit its rate increases to just this one through the end of the year. 

 The rise in growth stocks, especially among technology names, sent the Nasdaq Composite Index spiraling higher, adding 71.24 points, or 2.7%, to 2719.57, the highest close in more than a month. 

 There were other signs of exuberance. For example, a seat on the New York Stock Exchange sold for a record $2,650,000. 

 The dollar also strengthened after its recent decline, though whether it inspired gains in stocks yesterday, or vice versa, was unclear. 

 The big gains weren't confined to growth names in technology and pharmaceuticals and to bank issues. Many cyclical stocks, which have been fashioning fundamental improvements via mergers and reorganizations, also posted big gains. 

 Among the gainers in the world of the industrials, shares of United Technologies moved ahead 2 7/16 to 70, Caterpillar rose 2 5/8 to 62 15/16, and AlliedSignal added 2 15/16 to 65 7/8. 

 Florida Progress moved ahead 2 3/16 to 46 13/16. Carolina Power & Light said it agreed to buy the St. Petersburg, Fla., electric utility for $5.3 billion in cash and stock and $2.7 billion in debt. Carolina Power declined 2 5/16 to 36 11/16. 

 Phelps Dodge rose 15/16 to 60 1/16, as the Phoenix metals and mining processing concern continued to press ahead with its bid for copper rivals Cyprus Amax, which added 17/64 to 17 41/64, after reaching a 52-week best Friday, and Asarco, which finished 1/16 higher at 22 1/2. On Friday, Phelps offered $2.6 billion in stock to acquire both companies, which already have their own plans in place to merge. 

 Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) added 9/16 to 74 13/16. The business-computer maker agreed to buy Forte Software, an Oakland, Calif., business-software developer, in a stock swap valued at $540 million, or $22.275 a Forte share. Forte (Nasdaq) added 4 1/8 to 21 1/8. 

 Exodus Communications (Nasdaq) moved up 6 3/16 to 81 9/16. The company unveiled its Exodus Rapid Deployment Initiative for companies to set up their own Web operations. 

 Shares of Chevron managed to move higher, despite a warning from the company that third-quarter profit wouldn't live up to Wall Street's expectations. The San Francisco oil company closed 7/8 higher at 95 15/16. 

 Barrett Resources declined 3/4 to 36 1/2. Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the stock of the Denver energy concern. 

 Freeport-McMoRan Copper added 7/16 to 17 3/4, near its 52-week high of 18 11/16, reached July 12. Prudential Securities raised its rating on the New Orleans mining concern. 

 Global Crossing (Nasdaq) advanced 13/16 to 30 15/16. The Bermuda telecommunications concern's chief executive said the company is confident its merger with Frontier, a Rochester, N.Y., long-distance carrier, will go forward, though, under terms of the stock-swap agreement, Frontier can walk away from the deal when Global Crossing shares fall below 34 9/16 under certain conditions. That stock hasn't closed above that "collar" since Aug. 5. 

 Frontier shares gained 13/16 to 47 5/8. 

 CVS declined 5/8 to 43 7/8. The Woonsocket, R.I., drugstore chain launched an expanded pharmacy Web site. Meanwhile, Drugstore.com, a Bellevue, Wash., online retailer (Nasdaq) moved up 2 13/16 to 51 5/16. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette started coverage of the stock with a "buy" rating. 

 Meanwhile, online operations aimed at business, rather than consumer, users, also made progress in the session. Ariba (Nasdaq), for example, gained 15 1/4 to 126 5/8. CMGI (Nasdaq), which invests in Internet start-ups, gained 3 to 82 15/16. 

 Vignette (Nasdaq) moved up 6 5/16 to 67 13/16. US Bancorp started coverage of the Austin, Texas, provider of enterprise software to electronic-commerce businesses. 

 Siebel Systems (Nasdaq) gained 1 1/2 to 61 7/8. The chief executive of the San Mateo, Calif., provider of sales and marketing data software systems said in a CNBC interview that he doesn't consider Oracle a competitor. Siebel said that Oracle plans to market its own sales and marketing software products next year. Oracle (Nasdaq) rose 9/16 to 37 9/16.

 HOUSTON, Aug. 18 -- Executives of Waste Management Inc. sold $19.5 million in company shares in June in the second round of stock sales by insiders in the two months before the company, the largest United States trash hauler, issued a July 6 profit warning. 

 Company executives sold $57.6 million in stock in May. William Rothrock, senior vice president for business development, led in June with sales totaling $6.79 million, according to the Washington Service, which tracks executive buying and selling. 

 Six of the seven who sold in June also did so in May. The company, whose shares have fallen almost 60 percent since the first profitwarning, disclosed on Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange were investigating the sales. 

 In June, the executives sold their shares at $52.875 to $56.3125. The previous month, most of the shares were sold at prices of $54 to $56, shortly after the stock reached a high of $60 on May 4.

  This story appears in the September issue of SmartMoney magazine.



Long-term interest rates are most likely near, or perhaps just past,
their peaks. . . . The threat of Fed tightening has begun to recede."


 -- "The Levy Institute Forecast," Mar. 30, 1999 

 Peaks? Those were foothills compared with what really happened: Long-term Treasury bond yields climbed even higher over the next few months, hitting a record 6 percent by June 9. And Greenspan made his threat real on June 30, when the Fed raised a key short-term interest rate by one- quarter of a percentage point. 

 "1998 was a year of significant transformation for Compaq, and with our strong fourth-quarter results, we enter the new year with a great deal of momentum and optimism." 

 -- Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq President and CEO 

 "Our fourth-quarter results and the successful integration of Digital [Equipment Corp.] over the last six months represent major steps along the way to truly becoming a 'New Breed' computing company." 

 -- Earl Mason, Compaq Senior Vice President and CFO 

 Make that a "new breed" of momentum and optimism. In April, Pfeiffer was ousted and Mason resigned shortly after Compaq issued a sharply negative profit warning. 

 "The forecast calls for a mild recession [in the first half of 1999]."

 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - A rally in blue chip issues in the final hour of trading led Wall Street to a higher close on Monday ahead of economic data that could confirm a report last week that showed inflation is in check. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 73 points, or 0.67 percent, to 11,047. It was the first time the Dow closed above 11,000 since July 21. 

 The Dow had soared 184 points on Friday after the producer price index rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in July. The consumer price index (CPI) for July is due before the start of trading on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect a moderate increase of 0.3 percent in the CPI overall and a rise of 0.2 percent in the core rate which excludes food and energy. 

 The Nasdaq composite rose 7.46 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,645.27. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained an unofficial 3.09 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,330.77. 

 Declining issues led advances by 1,548 to 1,392 on the New York Stock Exchange. Declining stocks also outnumbered advances on Nasdaq. 

 Analysts noted that the rise in the Dow came on moderate volume of about 581 million shares on the NYSE. 

 The long Treasury bond rose 3/32 to yield 6.09 percent. 

 Traders said there was no specific trigger for the late rally, and added that buy programmes probably accounted for much of the move. 

 Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., noted that the inflation data is coming out in close proximity to the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting group, which is scheduled for Aug. 24. A rise of one-quarter percentage point in short-term interest rates is widely expected on Wall Street. 

 "A lot of investors are waiting before the release of tomorrow's CPI numbers," said Charlie Crane, chief market strategist at Key Asset Management. "There's a positive tone on the heels of last week's big gains." 

 Reynolds Metals Co.  fell 1/16 to 68-15/16. Suitor Alcoa Inc.  said it will launch a $65-per-share cash tender offer for Reynolds. Over the weekend, Reynolds rejected the offer as inadequate and said it would explore a sale of the company. Alcoa rose 1/4 to 66-3/4. 

 Waste Management Inc.  fell 7/16 to 23-1/8. The company said board member Robert Miller will take over temporarily as chief executive following the decision of chief executive John Drury to step aside. Chief operating officer and president Rodney Proto is leaving the company. The company also said that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange are looking into a series of stock sales by company insiders prior to a profit warning in early July. 

 Nielsen Media Research Inc  rose 4-1/2 to 37-5/16. Nielsen, which measures television viewership, agreed to be acquired by Dutch publisher VNU . Nielsen shareholders would receive $37.75 per share cash for each of their shares. The transaction is worth $2.7 billion including assumption of debt. 

 Hewlett-Packard Co.  rose 4-5/16 to 110-5/16. Agilent Technologies Inc., a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, said in a filing that it seeks to raise $100 million in an initial public offering. 

 Shortly after the market closed, Hewlett reported third-quarter earnings per share from operations of 85 cents per share, ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimate of 80 cent. In last year's third quarter, the company earned 58 cents per share. 

 Audible Inc.  rose 3-3/16 to 13-7/8. The company, which went public last month, announced deals making its library of audio content available over the Internet through RealNetworks Inc.  and Microsoft Corp. . RealNetworks rose 4-7/8 to 80-1/8. Microsoft fell 6/16 to 84-5/16. 

 Red Hat Inc.fell 10-3/4 to 74-1/2. The stock had soared last week after its initial public offering at $14 per share. 

 Venator Group Inc.  rose 1-1/8 to 10. The retailer said it was getting out of eight businesses involving 500 of its 6,000 stores. A Merrill Lynch analyst said that shedding of unprofitable units would enable the company to focus on core businesses. 

 Separately, the company said Dale Hilpert was named president and chief executive. Roger Farah will remain chairman but relinquish the title of chief executive. 

 The NYSE Composite rose 1.51 to 622.89. The average share was up $0.11. 

 The Wilshire 5,000 index rose 33.86 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,109.08. 

 The Standard and Poor's 500 index was up 3.09 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,330.77, and the American Stock Exchange index fell 4.24 points, or 0.54 percent, to 779.5

 Venator Group is reshuffling management and planning to close or sell eight small chains with about 500 locations. The New York company, the largest U.S. retailer of athletic shoes, said its San Francisco Music Box, Randy River, Foot Locker Outlets, Colorado U.S., Team Edition and Going to the Game chains will be affected, along with its Burger King franchises. President Dale Hilpert will replace Roger Farah as chief executive. Farah will stay on as chairman. 

 Time Warner, the world's largest media company, named Roger Ames chairman and chief executive of its Warner Music Group. Ames will replace departing co-chairmen Robert Daly and Terry Semel. Time Warner is looking for a big boost to its music business from the growth of the Internet. 

 The Federal Communications Commission reasserted its authority to regulate providers of high-speed Internet access and raised questions about how to classify cable companies that offer such services. In its long-awaited friend-of-the-court brief in AT&T's case against Portland, Ore., the FCC warned that local officials could create "regulatory disparity" by exercising authority over cable companies offering Internet service. 

 Roadway Express of Akron, Ohio, will raise rates 5.2 percent on Sept. 12, following its top rivals, to capitalize on the trucking industry's busiest season. Previously, trucking companies boosted rates Jan. 1, the start of their slowest quarter. 

 Waste Management dumped its top management, including President Rodney Proto, who had sold shares before the company issued a profitwarning, and said it was shedding all international and some domestic businesses. The largest U.S. trash hauler also said the Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting a "formal investigation" of financial statements and accounting policies and an "informal inquiry" into stock sales by company officers and directors. It also said John Drury resigned as chairman and chief executive but remains a director. 

 Walt Disney Co. has instructed the heads of each of its businesses to review their capital spending in an effort to boost return on investment. Disney's chief financial officer, Thomas Staggs, is leading the review, which the Wall Street Journal reported may result in Disney slowing or curtailing the expansion of businesses such as its Disney Stores and Disney Quest arcades. 

 T-bill rates fell. The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday fell to 4.680 percent, from 4.790 percent the previous week. Rates on six-month bills fell to 4.900 percent from 4.915 percent. The actual return to investors is 4.815 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,881.70, and 5.108 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,752.30. Separately, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for one-year Treasury bills, a popular index for changing adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 5.23 percent last week from 5.13 percent the previous week. 

 RECALLS 

 DaimlerChrysler is recalling 2.1 million minivans. About 1.4 million 1991-93 Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Caravan, and Plymouth Voyager models are being recalled because the bolts on the lift gate could loosen; 18 people have reported minor injuries from the opened hatch falling on them. The vehicles are also being recalled to fix the windshield wipers. An additional 743,000 of the three minivans from model year 1996 are being recalled to replace the lock nut and gasket on the fuel pump. Owners will be notified of the recalls next month by mail. 

 EARNINGS 

 Lowe's, the world's second-largest home- improvement retailer, said fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 27 percent, to $230.2 million. 

 United Parcel Service said it will restate its fiscal second-quarter earnings to take a charge of $1.44 billion after it was ordered this month to pay back taxes and penalties. UPS said the charge will result in a loss of $854 million for the quarter ended July 30. The company earlier reported net income had risen 28 percent, to $588 million. 

 LOCAL BUSINESS 

 Biospherics of Beltsville said it lost $842,000 on revenue of $3.5 million for the three months that ended June 30, compared with earnings of $276,000 on revenue of $5.5 million for the same period a year earlier. The company, which is largely a telecommunications services firm but is also conducting research on a sugar replacement, blamed "less than projected business growth" under a contract with the National Park Service and two other pacts. 

 America Online's suit against AT&T was dismissed by a federal judge in Alexandria who said that Dulles-based AOL does not have exclusive rights to the expressions "you have mail," "buddy list" and "IM," which is an abbreviation for its instant messaging service. AOL said it plans to appeal the decision. 

 AOL announced a deal with EMusic.com of Redwood City, Calif., in which EMusic.com will sell downloadable music, using the MP3 format, on AOL's ICQ, Spinner and Winamp services. EMusic.com, which has a catalogue of 20,000 songs, will pay AOL an undisclosed fixed marketing fee as well as a share of each transaction over the three-year deal. AOL will also get warrants in EMusic.com. 

 Axent Technologies launched what it calls the first customer-driven, Internet-based system of security improvements in the information security industry. The Rockville-based company's new "product enhancement request form" lets customers submit requests online for enhancements to Axent's e-security services. 

 Hanley-Wood, a Washington-based publishing company that produces magazines for industries including the home-building, remodeling and commercial construction industries, has been acquired by a New York-based investment banking firm, VS&A Communications Partners, for an undisclosed amount.

 Daytrading launched in UK despite hefty US criticism.

 Daytrading, a practice which has swept the US over the past five years, and which has come under hefty criticism from US officials, is about to make its mark in the UK. Daytrading involves small investors buying and selling shares using a computer terminal and a website. The rise in small investor trading over the internet has prompted entrepreneurs Justin Biddle, a former stockbroker, and Dan Conaghan, an internet venture capitalist, to launch the UK's first Daytrading website, Daytrader.co.uk.The launch of this site comes in the same week as two separate announcements that Clive Cooke, the US chief executive at Intercapital, and Stephen Coles, of InvestIN, both in the US, plan to bring trading floors to the UK allowing investors to deal in Wall Street shares. Both Cooke and Coles say that there is as yet only a tiny market in the UK for daytrading, and this is also the main reason why Daytrader.co.uk will begin by just publishing information. 

  The Daytrader site will offer news, information, message boards and a research database, and it will also receive live information on new issues from US website IPO.com, with which the founders have struck an alliance. "The site is currently in its infancy. It's like an online frequent investors' newsletter," says Justin Biddle, co-founder of the site. "But it will grow dramatically once we get the required investment." The site is currently free to subscribers, and earns revenue from advertising income, but once a full service - such as market prices, bid and offer rates and historical pricing - is launched, subscribers will then incur charges. Investors will initially be given access to the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. If all goes well, they will then be given access to the New York Stock Exchange and European bourses.At first, the site will not offer trading facilities, but Conaghan is in discussions with several parties to supply the necessary infrastructure and execution, including online and offline brokers. He says the service eventually on offer will resemble a broker's Primark Topic Trader screen.The practice has reached widespread acceptance in the US where private investors use their computer terminals to access a broker who will execute their trades for them. Daytraders aim to buy and sell shares several times in one day, and they hold no overnight positions. They profit from small changes in stock prices and because they often trade on margin, the gains - and losses - can be huge."True Daytrading is a few months away in the UK," says Conaghan, "but we see the first signs of its arrival, with better online access to the markets, free real time prices and a surge in the opening of online accounts with the major brokers." Daytrader, he says, will find its audience among small investors who typically trade once or twice a week. He says, however, that all signs show that their investing activity is speeding up."The internet is not going to take over from traditional brokers. One of its uses is online brokerage. That market will grow exponentially. But it's also going to grow as a forum for offline brokers to share their ideas, and for investors to discuss the markets. In three years more people will be trading online, but some investors like the human contact they have with a broker, so offline broking will not slump, which is why we are building relationships with high profile offline brokers now."As the site does not claim to act as an investment advisor, it does not have to be regulated by the Financial Services Authority. In time that will change. Biddle says that the site is adequately covered by disclaimers warning of possible losses that can be made on the stock markets. "Investment is risky, but we are not in the business of punting; we are in the business of risk management. Our users will know that they are taking risks, just like if they were gambling in a casino or betting at a bookmakers. Indeed, we are going to provide private investors with as much information as possible to help them understand and gauge the relative risk of each investment. They then choose whether to use a broker to execute that investment decision," says Biddle.The entrance of these systems comes amid a flurry of criticism of Daytrading systems in the US. A seven month study, published by the North American Securities Association, said that Daytrading services were merely "get rich, quick" schemes for private brokers. It said that the largest amount of money lost on a single transaction was $81,522 (E76,189). The report was prompted after Mark Barton, who had lost a significant amount of money with Daytrading firm All Tech Investment Group, killed nine people at two brokerage firms in Atlanta.

 First Union Executives Try to Rally Workers

 After issuing a contrite message to Wall Street this month, First Union's Ed Crutchfield is seeking to rally employees and raise confidence inside the company. 

 The First Union chief executive and his new heir apparent, Ken Thompson, started employee meetings in Charlotte last week and will continue throughout the major cities of the bank's East Coast network. Next week they travel to Florida for meetings in Jacksonville, Miami and Orlando, a bank spokeswoman said. Other meetings are still being scheduled. 

 From employee reports, Crutchfield has peppered speeches with a dose of media and analyst bashing and has sought to lay out the company's strategy for remaking itself as part Merrill Lynch, part traditional bank. 

 The nation's sixth-largest bank is having one of the rockiest years in its history. It laid off 7 percent of its work force earlier this year and then stunned Wall Street with 1999's second profit warning in May. It has alienated customers by attempting to wean them from face-to-face branch service and redirect them to telephones and technological channels. 

 Some employees say that Crutchfield owed them an explanation for the bank's woes. 

 "Morale really is bad," said an employee at the bank's Charlotte customer information center. 

 "I think they lost focus, as least in the bank, on the customer," said analyst David Stumpf of A.G. Edwards & Sons. "They've got to repair damage and ... they've got to get the employees feeling good about things so that image comes through to the customers." 

 Thompson, who oversees First Union's Wall Street-style securities division, will succeed President John Georgius at the end of 1999. 

 Even on a day when many large bank stocks posted big gains, First Union rose only 31 1/4 cents Friday to $41.93 3/4. J.P. Morgan jumped $6.25 to $133.75; Chase Manhattan, up $3.43 3/4 to $79.12 1/2; Bank of America, up $2.06 1/4 to $62.68 3/4.

 Merrill Said To Compensate Teleglobe Debtholders Stung In Slide

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Merrill Lynch & Co. has offered to compensate investors who bought Teleglobe Inc. debt in a July offering led by the securities firm, then took a hit following Teleglobe's July warning that earnings would miss expectations, according to a source familiar with the matter. 

 The source confirmed Friday that Merrill Lynch (MER) has offered bondholders some compensation for "credit deterioration" directly linked to Teleglobe's profit warning. However, the compensation doesn't represent the total difference between the current price of the debt and the price at the time of the July offer, the source said. 

 The source noted that much of the widening in Teleglobe's debt spread reflects an overall sell-off in the debt market over the last several weeks. The source also said the Merrill continues to work with Teleglobe and its debtholders. 

 A spokesman for Merrill Lynch declined comment. 

 The Montreal company aims to provide Internet-service providers and other online companies with robust pipelines for transmitting voice, video and data traffic around the world. In May it announced plans to spend $5 billion to expand its global telecommunications network in an effort to capitalize on the international growth in Internet and data traffic. The five-year project will connect 160 cities world-wide with high-capacity fiber. 

 Shares of Teleglobe have taken a beating since the firm told investors in late July that its second-quarter earnings would be much lower than expected. The company went on last week to report net income that missed analysts' estimates by about three cents a share. 

 Before the July announcement, Toronto-listed Teleglobe shares were trading at around 41 Canadian dollars (US$27.62). But the stock quickly plunged after the bad news, at one point hitting a 52-week low of C$22.90 a share. 

 Similarly, investors who bought Teleglobe debt in the high-profile $1 billion offering issued about three weeks before the earnings announcement also have suffered, with spreads on the debt widening noticeably. For instance, Teleglobe's 30-year notes were trading about 1.95 percentage points above Treasurys after the warning, a market source said. 

 In the wake of the July earnings news, rumors started circulating that some of the bondholders were threatening to sue Merrill Lynch if they weren't compensated. As part of its duties as lead manager for the offering, Merrill Lynch was required to carry out due diligence on Teleglobe. 

 Teleglobe issued the July debt offer to refinance existing debt and to help fund capital spending. 

 The market source said that the Teleglobe debt isn't currently trading, with the price range quoted between 2.25 and 2.75 percentage points above Treasurys. Another source said the recent price range has been between 2.35 and 2.50 percentage points above Treasurys.

 TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) has offered some compensation to Teleglobe Inc. (TGO) debtholders who suffered from the telecommunications company's profit warning last month, a source confirmed. 

 Teleglobe's equity investors have seen the stock price drop dramatically since the Montreal company warned the market late last month about, and subsequently reported, disappointing earning results for the second quarter. Before the warning, Teleglobe was trading at around C$41. The stock hit a 52-week low of 22.90 but has rebounded in the past few days. The stock is trading Friday in Toronto at 28.80, up 1.50. 

 Similarly, investors who bought Teleglobe debt in a high-profile $1 billion offering led by Merrill Lynch in July, about three weeks before the earnings warning, have also suffered, with spreads on the debt widening noticeably. 

 For instance, Teleglobe's 30-year notes were trading about 1.95 percentage points above Treasurys after the warning, a market source said. The 30-year notes were originally priced at 1.74 percentage points over Treasurys. The source said that the debt isn't currently trading, with the price range quoted between 2.25 and 2.75 percentage points above Treasurys. Another source said the recent price range has been between 2.35 and 2.50 percentage points above Treasurys. 

 Teleglobe issued the debt to refinance existing debt and to help fund capital spending. 

 In the wake of the profit warning, rumors started circulating in the market that some of the bondholders were threatening to sue Merrill if they weren't compensated. As part of its duties as lead manager for the offering, Merrill was required to carry out due diligence on Teleglobe. 

 A source familiar with the matter confirmed that Merrill has offered bondholders some compensation for "credit deterioration," directly linked to the profit warning. However, the compensation doesn't represent the total difference between the current price of the debt and the price at the time of the offer, the source said. 

 The source noted that much of the widening in the spreads of Teleglobe's debt reflect an overall sell-off in the debt market over the last several weeks. 

 The source also said the Merrill continues to work with Teleglobe and the debtholders. 


A spokesman for Merrill Lynch declined comment.

 The United States and Argentina completed negotiations on an "open skies" agreement that will immediately allow United Parcel Service to begin direct competition with FedEx, the only major U.S. cargo carrier operating in the Latin American country. Passenger service will be phased in over the next four years, eventually allowing full service between the two countries, now served only by American and United. 

 Kaiser Aluminum, set to become one of North America's last major independent aluminum companies, can expect to attract takeover bids now that bigger rivals have proposed or agreed to purchases, analysts said. On Wednesday, Alcoa, the No. 1 aluminum producer, offered to buy Reynolds Metals for $5.6 billion, hours after Canada's Alcan Aluminium agreed to buy Pechiney of France and most of Zurich-based Algroup for $9.2 billion. Alcan's chief executive, Jacques Bougie, said it isn't ruling out the possibility of making a bid for Reynolds.

 CNN and CNBC are heading to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as they continue their pitched battle for business viewers. A few weeks after CNN quietly announced it would produce a daily show from Wall Street's epicenter, CNBC said it would do the same thing. CNBC's "Business Center" will uproot from its New Jersey studio starting Monday for a new desk at the NYSE. 

 Gillette bought $1.18 billion in stock in the second quarter, as its shares dropped by more than a third after a warning that profit would miss forecasts. Gillette bought 25 million shares at an average price of $47.32, according to a regulatory filing. 

 Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, said it would move its military jet-engine business to Connecticut from Florida and cut at least 1,500 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, in a broad restructuring to be completed by the end of 2000. In addition, the Sikorsky helicopter unit of United Technologies said it would move its S-76 helicopter operation from West Palm Beach, Fla., to a location as yet to be determined. 

 Bing Sung, the former chief investment officer at RhumbLine Advisers accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of making unauthorized trades that led to losses of $162 million for two pension funds, has agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and be barred from the investment advisory industry, the SEC said. Sung neither admitted nor denied the accusations. 

 Livent's former general counsel and secretary, Jerald M. Banks, settled allegations that he took part in a scheme to inflate the Canadian theater company's earnings, the Securities and Exchange Commission said. Banks agreed to pay a fine of $25,000 and not to practice before the commission for five years or violate securities law in the future. He neither admitted nor denied the allegations. 

 W.R. Grace has been awarded $15.9 million in damages and $3.5 million in interest from its patent-infringement lawsuit against Intercat and Conoco. The lawsuit dates to 1997, when the U.S. District Court for Delaware ruled that Intercat and Conoco had "willfully and knowingly" infringed on Grace's patent for Desox, an additive that removes sulfur from petroleum refinery emissions. 

 Texaco said it has increased the number of jobs it is cutting to 2,500, or 10 percent of its work force, from the 1,400 it announced last year. 

 Priceline.com, which lets consumers bid online for airline tickets and hotel rooms, said it reduced a secondary share offering and won't proceed with a debt issue because of market conditions.

 Gap said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 43 percent, to $195.8 million, as its Old Navy chain drew more shoppers. 

 Kmart said its operating profit jumped 44 percent, to $134 million, in the second quarter thanks to stronger sales. The results excluded a one-time charge of $230 million. In the second quarter last year, Kmart posted a profit of $93 million, excluding nonrecurring charges. 

 Nordstrom said its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 2 percent, to $70.8 million, as the operator of high-priced department stores reined in costs to offset slower sales. 

 LOCAL BUSINESS

 NEW YORK, Aug. 6 (Reuters) - Stocks fell Friday amid the hysteria in the bond market after news that the booming U.S. economy created a surprisingly large number of new jobs last month. 

 The big worry is that the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates again soon to head off inflation. 

 "It's bloodied, bruised and battered," said Doug Myers, the vice president of equity trading at Interstate/Johnson Lane. "It's just an unpleasant place to be." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 79.79 points, or 0.74 percent, at 10,714.03, after bouncing off a loss of more than 140 points. For the week, the Dow rose 58.88 points. 

 In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,969 to 966 on moderate volume of 696 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The Nasdaq Composite index was off 17.86 points, or 0.70 percent, at 2,547.97. 

 The U.S. Labour Department reported that the jobless rate was steady at 4.3 percent in July, but the total number of new jobs added to nonfarm payrolls in July was 310,000 - outstripping Wall Street economists' forecasts for a gain of 199,400. Also, average hourly wages climbed 0.45 percent, compared with forecasts of a 0.30 percent rise. 

 The Fed's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Aug. 24. And Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that the central bank will act "promptly and forcefully" if there are signs the economy may generate inflation. The central bank raised the key fed funds rate a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, in June. 

 In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond plunged 1-21/32, propelling its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, to a new 21-month high of 6.18 percent from 6.04 percent Thursday. 

 The bond market is already assuming the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points, said Dick Stein, vice president and chief technical analyst at Boca Raton-based Noble International Investments. 

 "The stock market is building in the next rate rise," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "I see this as continued malaise as the market comes to grips with higher interest rates." 

 Michael Farr, president of investment managers Farr, Miller & Washington, said he anticipates a continued modest decline in stock prices over the balance of the summer. 

 "Most of the earnings season is over," he said. "The earnings were good but it's kind of 'yesterday's news'." That leaves the stock market without any impetus to move higher. But he said a modest pullback is no surprise after a sharp rise from late 1998 into the first half of 1999. 

 American Home Products Corp.  plummeted 6-1/16 to 44-7/8 after a jury in Texas found for the plaintiff in a lawsuit filed over the phen-fen diet drug. 

 The jury found American Home Products acted negligently by marketing the drug fenfluramine, one of the two drugs used in the phen-fen combination. The plaintiff was awarded $23.3 million. 

 Boston Scientific Corp  tumbled 6-1/2 to 30. The company said it was recalling its Rotablator RotaLink Advancer and RotaLink Plus products. The devices are used to remove plaque from inside the walls of blood vessels. 

 America Online Inc.  rose 1-3/8 to 84-7/8. The company said it reached agreements with EarthLink Network Inc.  and MindSpring Enterprises Inc on instant messaging services. EarthLink Network rose 4-1/2 to 41-9/16 and MindSpring gained 2-13/16 at 28-13/16. 

 Sterling Commerce Inc.  fell 2-1/4 to 21-15/16 after the e-commerce company late Thursday issued a profit warning. J.P. Morgan Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston lowered ratings on the stock. 

 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 13.42 points to 1,300.29. The American Stock Exchange was up 1.83 at 777.92. 

 The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 6.35 to 611.04. The average share was down 44 cents. 

 The Wilshire Associates Equity Index - the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues - was 11,842.771, down 108.141 or 0.90 percent.

 Bank of America Leads Industrywide Stock Decline

 Bank of America is leading a steep decline in stocks of large banks. 

 Shares are down 16 percent in the last month -- well ahead of the average 10.8 percent decline in the nation's top 24 bank stocks. 

 While worries about another rise in interest rates are knocking the wind out of bank stocks, it's not clear why Bank America is down so much, especially when analysts say it's well-equipped to handle a rate uptick. 

 "I am not aware of any Bank of America rumors," analyst Tom Theurkauf of Keefe Bruyette & Woods said Thursday. 

 Bank of America's explanation is profit-taking: Spokesman Bob Stickler notes that shares are still up 5 percent for 1999 -- in a year when shares of all but five of the 25 largest banks are down. 

 One theory making the rounds: Is its Charlotte rival First Union dragging it down? 

 First Union's troubles are well-known. In May, it stunned Wall Street with its second profit warning of 1999. The bank has stumbled on rapid growth, expensive acquisitions and a technology-heavy approach to overhauling its 2,300 branches. The upshot: It will earn roughly $3.40 per share this year, well below the $4.40 per share it forecast in late 1997. 

 Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Virginia, is among those who speculate that investors may be lumping together "big banks headquartered in the same town." He adds: "There may be some ruboff factor." 

 Bank of America's profits, by contrast, are expected to lift off this year. It's out of the merger game. The 10-month-old combination of the former NationsBank and BankAmerica is clicking, officials say. 

 "We have a different story than First Union, and as we meet with investors and analysts we're telling that story," Stickler said. "Our merger integration is on schedule and we have met or exceeded all of our performance targets in relationship to that integration." 

 First Call Corp. pegs 1999 earnings at $4.73 a share -- well above the $3.64 of last year, when the nation's largest bank lost nearly $1 billion on a hedge fund investment, overseas bond trading and other messes. And next year, earnings are expected to rise to $5.50 per share, according to First Call, which polls analysts on earnings forecasts. 

 First Union, the nation's sixth-largest bank, and Bank of America are alike in a few key ways. They operate huge U.S. branch networks --Bank of America the largest, First Union the third largest. With the growth of commerce on the Internet and new means to bank without ever visiting the traditional branch, some experts see the branches as increasingly expensive liabilities. Indeed, some of First Union's missteps are tied to its efforts to remake branches and steer customers to telephones and ATMs and away from tellers. 

 Still, a lot of large banks are grappling with questions about how to get the most out of their branch networks, Theurkauf said. Whatever links investors may draw between the two, Theurkauf said First Union is struggling with problems uniquely its own from expensive acquisitions and its branch overhaul. 

 One lingering doubt about large banks in general is the future prospects for their highly lucrative but volatile businesses such as investment banking and securities trading. Profits zoomed in the second quarter. 

 "Investors started to wonder what the encore would be," Theurkauf said. "Bank of America and other large regional and money center banks are fighting a bit of a headwind here."

 REPEAT AFTER ME: THINK. THEN, BUY 

 DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a PC with a 300-MHz AMD processor with Windows 98 installed. I click the print button and nothing happens, so I click it again and still nothing, then I click it a third time. By then, my printer would start, and I would get three copies. When I click and drag something, nothing seems to happen until about three seconds later. When I use Microsoft Word, what I type doesn't show up until about three seconds later. This problem has existed since the computer was new. Unfortunately, it was purchased at a computer show, and the supplier is out of business. Can you give me a hint as to what my problem is? 

 --Delayed Reaction 

 DEAR DELAYED: Yes. You probably spent about three seconds researching your purchase. 

 I certainly hope you didn't buy the thing without playing with it at the show. Such cruddy performance is unacceptable, and you should have seen that right away. If the guy you dealt with was legit, he would have refunded your money or fixed the problem, assuming you were unhappy from the start. 

 But, all that's academic. You're stuck with a lemon, so let's make a nice, tall pitcher of lemon daiquiris. 

 Everything you've mentioned points to a tremendously underpowered machine. It's trying to do too much with limited resources, and it falls behind like the kid from `Deliverance' taking the SAT. Maybe the chip isn't even a 300. Not everybody is as forthrightly honest and above-board as I am, so maybe this weasel re-labeled the chip. Regular people don't know the difference, and there's really no way to tell what speed a chip is without running benchmark tests. If I didn't know who I was dealing with, that's the first thing I'd want to see. It may seem rude, but you can afford to be a lout when it's your bank balance on the line. 

 Next, I'd check the RAM. Nothing slows down a PC, especially one running Win98, like inadequate memory. If you have less than 32 megabytes, you're just begging for things to run in slow motion, especially with something as bloated and RAM-hungry as Word. Windows juggles a lot of stuff around in memory. When it starts to run short, it uses space on your hard drive to simulate more, but that results in another slowdown. 

 Also, how much stuff is going on at once? Remember that the microprocessor has to divide its attention between all programs that are running. It may take it a while to get back to the one you're expecting instant results from. Close down everything you don't need. And even if you only have one thing going, remember that Windows always has a bunch of stuff messing around in the background. If you hit Control-Alt-Delete, you'll get a list of everything running. You won't have any idea what most of that stuff is, but you can try shutting down some of the processes to see if they're needed or not. 

 Most of them get loaded automatically. See if any are in your Startup folder, then dump what you don't need. Others are launched from a mysterious place deep within Windows called the Registry. In Win98 you can selectively whack these by going to Run on the Start menu, then typing in Msconfig (Enter). This kicks up a sweet little utility that lets you play with your startup procedure. 

 Well, we live and learn, I suppose. But I admire a guy like you who's not afraid to take a chance on a bargain. Now, I don't usually do this, but there's a great little Internet startup I know I can interest you in. Cash only, please. 

Warning: This venture involves certain risks. Not all investors will make a profit. Fiscal projections are only estimates based on completely inaccurate and misleading data. Celebrity endorsements compensated. Send power of attorney to Dr. Emilio Bombay at drbombay@star-telegram.com or via snail-mail to Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Box 1870, Fort Worth, TX 76101.

 VIENNA (Dow Jones)--Shares in Austrian messaging systems provider Topcall International (R.TPC) have lost about two-thirds of their value since early March and a major rebound isn't expected soon. 

 The stock is trading around a technical support level of EUR19, a little more than 21 times expected 2000 earnings, which seems relatively modest given its generally solid past record and outlook. But despite signs of the share bottoming out in recent days, there are no signs of investors rushing back in yet. Bargain-hunters can probably afford to take their time. 

 Investors haven't been encouraged by recent sound earnings. The stock stayed put at around EUR20 this week after the company reported a 43% rise in first-half pretax profit from last year. Even after a modest profit warning in July, the company sees full-year profits rising 35% to 45% on sales growth of 30% to 40%. 

 This compares with a 22% and 53% rise in pretax profits on 20% and 45% sales growth in 1998 and 1997, respectively. 

 Topcall, with a niche in the high end of the fax-server market, was a high-flier on the Brussels-based Easdaq growth market, rising more than 900% from its listing in June 1997 to the start of March 1999. 

 But weak fourth-quarter sales hit full-year profits and triggered a share selloff in March. The fourth quarter, which traditionally accounted for at least 40% of annual revenue, accounted for just 29% in 1998, due mainly to companies' spending freeze prompted by fears of global economic slowdown. By the first quarter of 1999, Topcall sales were back on track, rising 41%. First-quarter pretax profits rose 73%. 

 The stock, one of Austria's few technology stocks, has plunged from more than EUR60 to around EUR20 now. In the same period, the Easdaq index has gained about 16%. The market's fascination with technology shares, which has narrowed to Internet stocks, hasn't helped Topcall, say analysts. 

 Earnings-per-share forecasts range from 59 cents to 65 cents for 1999 and from 87 cents to 91 cents in 2000. 

 Sales Of New Product Seen Taking Off In 2000 

 But the opportunities are plenty. Topcall has a well-respected product range. Analysts are upbeat about the July launch of Communication Server ONE, a unified messaging server for companies that integrates communication services, including fax, telex, Internet mail and voicemail. However, the benefits of this service may take some time to feed through. 

 An analyst from Credit Lyonnais Securities, which rates Topcall shares as reduce, expects ONE sales to take off in 2000, once companies' spending on millennium-bug problems has peaked. Even CEO Martin Hannah also plays down the positive contribution ONE sales could make to 1999 profits. 

 Hannah is philosophical about the shares, noting that teething pains aren't unusual for growth stocks. 

 "Like any successful growth company, we get bumps and bruises," he said, comparing Topcall's performance with that of German software group SAP AG (R.SAG) over the years. 

 He says Topcall has reacted swiftly to combat its main problem, namely constrained growth in the key U.S. market, caused by fierce competition for qualified sales staff. Topcall will shortly appoint a global head of sales and distribution as well as four regional managers in the U.S. as part of its efforts to improve performance there. 

 The U.S. accounted for 22% of group sales in 1998, compared with 12% in 1997, so sorting out the distribution problem there is critical to Topcall's growth. One strategy would be to acquire a company with an established distribution network in the U.S. Some ATS200 million is available in cash, but Hannah thinks little of the idea of buying a distributor. It's unlikely that the company will use issue its 3.5 million new shares in authorized capital at current price levels. 

 Partnership Strategy Seen Fruitful 

 Analysts aren't convinced an acquisition would boost the stock anyway. 

 Ingrid von Hentschel, technology analyst at London brokerage Beeson Gregory, who rates Topcall shares a buy, thought the stock will gain more from spending on people rather than on acquisitions, but she urged the company to act quickly. 

 "You are never alone in technology," she said, adding that it is essential to get a strong sales network established fast, before competitors catch up with the product. 

 Topcall will continue to place most emphasis on direct sales, which account for more than 85% of total group sales. Some analysts see direct selling as an expensive method and would prefer to see Topcall strike agreements with resellers in the U.S., but Hannah argues that gross margins tend to fall with reseller agreements as costs rise and resellers still expect the company to do most of the selling. 

 Analysts are more receptive to the partnership strategy, which Hannah aims to expand. These agreements promote cooperation with major software providers. Current partners include IBM, SAP, Novell and Lotus. 

 U.S. sales problems aside, Topcall's biggest headache is investor confidence, which was battered when Topcall reported its surprise fourth-quarter shortfall in March. 

 "Investors feel very disappointed and don't want to get back on board yet," said a trader at Belgian brokerage Vermeulen Raemdonck, which has Topcall shares at neutral. Many analysts criticized Topcall for failing to issue a profit warning ahead of the shock results. 

 Hannah says he has taken advice on investor relations and is being more proactive with information distribution. July's profit warning seems to prove the point. 

 Topcall is particularly seeking to increase its profile with investors in Germany, whose growing pool of capital for tech stocks is fast becoming indispensable for European companies like Topcall.

 U.S. stocks end up as bears stop Internet beating.

 NEW YORK, Aug. 5 (Reuters) - Stocks closed higher on Thursday as bearish traders called a halt to the battering that had sent Internet stocks into a bone-jarring drop. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 119.05 points, or 1.12 percent, at 10,793.82 after shaking off a loss of more than 100 points. 

 The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology stocks, was up 25.81 points, or 1.02 percent, at 2,565.81 after an early slide of more than 65 points. 

 It was the first higher close for the Nasdaq after five straight sessions of losses totalling 166 points. The index remains in what Wall Street considers a "correction" after pulling back more than 10 percent from its mid-July high of 2,864.48. 

 In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,817 to 1,192 on active volume of 854 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 TheStreet.com's Internet index of stocks was up 23.64 points, or 4.83 percent, at 513.55. Earlier in the day, it had been as low as 452.90. 

 Even Wall Street's worries about the outlook for higher interest rates seemed to have taken a day off. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 25/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.04 percent from Wednesday's 6.10 percent. On Tuesday, the yield was at a 21-month high of 6.17 percent. 

 "That's a pretty good rally in the bond market. I would say stocks are getting encouragement from that," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston. 

 Earlier in the day, financial markets were rattled by news that U.S. workers' pay increases far outstripped productivity gains in the second quarter of the year, reviving speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again soon to dampen inflation pressures. 

 The Labour Department said productivity growth rose only 1.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a revised gain of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. A rise of 1.8 percent was expected by economists. 

 "We just got to the point, especially with the Internet stocks, that the market was oversold," said Charles Payne, head analyst at Wall Street Securities. "The thinking is that stocks have gotten hit so hard that you have huge upside potential. There is some positioning for the employment data Friday." 

 Wall Street was awaiting July payrolls figures, due out Friday, for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will jack up interest rates again soon to head off inflation. 

 "If the data isn't too inflationary, we could get a pretty good reversal" of the recent market declines, Payne said. 

 In the Internet sector, online media company Yahoo! Inc. jumped 7-3/8 to 128-3/8, Internet venture capital firm CMGI Inc. added 3-15/16 at 79-15/16, retailer Amazon.com Inc. gained 8-13/16 at 97-1/4 and online auction site eBay Inc. surged 17-1/8 at 92-7/8. 

 But the Internet service providers were pounded down after The Wall Street Journal reported that software giant Microsoft Corp. plans to challenge heavyweight America Online Inc.'s dominance by offering cut-rate or even free Internet access. 

 AOL fell 3-15/16 to 83-1/2 while Microsoft edged up 13/16 at 85-3/4. 

 "It's going to threaten profit margins, especially at America Online and that has investors worried," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. "It's hard to compete against free." 

 Prodigy Communications Corp. was down 1-1/4 at 17, Earthlink Network Inc. slipped 3-5/16 to 37-1/16. Another competitor, MindSpring Enterprises Inc., was down 3/4 at 26. 

 Three companies that made their Wall Street debut closed higher. 

 Venture firm Internet Capital Group Inc. was up 12-7/16 at 24-7/16. Real estate Web site operator HomeStore.com's finished up 2-3/4 at 22-3/4. And Mission Critical Software Inc. was up 9-7/16 at 25-7/16. 

 In other news, U.S. retailers reported solid sales for July as the ever-confident shoppers continued to spend money on everything from home appliances to clothes. 

 But despite the good news on retailers' sales, the stock of teen apparel retailer Buckle Inc. dropped 10-3/16 to 18 after it issued a profit warning for its second quarter. 

 Gap Inc. was down 3-7/16 at 39-7/8 after the ubiquitous retailer reported a modest same-store sales increase that fell short of expectations. 

 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 8.38 points to 1,313.71. The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.87 to 776.09. 

 The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.93 to 617.39. The average share was up 20 cents. 

 The Wilshire Associates Equity Index - the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues - was 11,950.912, up 68.299 or 0.57 percent.

Update
 Coming Out of Hibernation: With a small-cap rally under way, how are our picks faring

 Overlooked. Underappreciated. Because we like to find values in the marketplace, these are the attributes that tend to stoke our interest in stocks. And over the past couple of years, our quest for value has led us to the small-cap sector, where prices have been dirt cheap. If you've invested alongside us, you've no doubt been disappointed by the way many of them performed. But while the rewards for being true to our value discipline have been mixed, that may soon change. 

 Here's why: Small caps have been on the move since early April. The Standard & Poor's 600 small-cap index is up 11.7 percent from early April through June 15. By contrast, over the same period the S&P 500 has been essentially flat. (See: "Street Smart: Sizzling Small Caps Without the Heartburn" -- SmartMoney Aug. 1999 for more about the prospects of small caps in the market rotation.) That means the small-cap sector may finally be poised for a true rally. 

 Of course, as far as our small-cap stock picks go, we have a lot of ground to recover: Over the last two years, all but one of the five portfolios in which we featured small caps (stocks under $1.5 billion in market capitalization) are in the red. The worst portfolio of the lot, "Best Mid-Year Investments," is down 33 percent since we picked it in July 1998. Some of this is due to the natural volatility of small caps; some of it is simply the market's bias against the group. And admittedly, we did pick a couple of real losers along the way. But because these stocks have been so out of favor, their eventual return to the spotlight should produce some phenomenal gains. 

 Indeed, a few have already skyrocketed. Generic-drug maker Barr Labs (BRL), from our July 1997 cover story, "The 11 Best Mid-Year Investments," was able to kick the anonymity of the small-cap sector and climb 37 percent on the basis of its new-drug pipeline. And chip-equipment maker Credence Systems (CMOS) is up 43 percent since we chose it for our "Guilt by Association" portfolio in February 1998. 

 But others continue to languish despite healthy fundamentals. Catellus Development (CDX), a California real estate development company, has fallen 12 percent since we picked it for our May 1998 cover story, "Ten Stocks Under $25," despite recording earnings expansion of 133 percent last year. 

 And, of course, some stocks we've picked have fallen on their own merits. The small-cap bear market may have held Innovex (INVX) back a bit, for example, but the tech company (also from 1997's "Best Mid-Year Investments") had plenty of its own problems. When the market for its lead-wire assemblies that connect computers to disk drives all but disappeared last year, it didn't have a blockbuster product ready to replace the lost revenue. Earnings plummeted, and then the chief executive's wife threatened to sue the company for sexual discrimination. It's down 60 percent since we picked it. From the same portfolio, American HomePatient (AHOM), a supplier of home health services, such as oxygen, detonated amid Medicare cutbacks and has fallen 93 percent. 

 What follows is our best thinking on what you should do with some of our other picks now that a small-cap renaissance could be under way. To find stocks worth mentioning, we went back over our portfolios looking for small-cap companies with the most dramatic news, then sorted through the best and worst. 

 Action Performance, the maker of Nascar collectibles, apparel and souvenir items, has given us quite a ride. The stock is up 42 percent since we recommended it in our "Where to Invest in 1998" cover story January 1998). In less than two years, the company boosted its share of trackside sales to 80 percent, from 50 percent. Revenue has climbed 89.9 percent in that time, and new track openings in Joliet, Ill., and Kansas City, Mo., in 2001 should increase sales even more. Better yet, the Phoenix company has been quick to find new ways of making money off auto racing. Last year it acquired MiniChamps, a company that makes souvenirs for Formula One fans in Europe. The fan base for Formula One, for those not in the know, dwarfs the fast-growing Nascar audience, says CIBC World Markets analyst Steven Eisenberg. But there's more. The company launched a Web site, www.speedmall.com, in February, and sales climbed 233 percent in four months. Meanwhile, analysts' earnings forecasts call for 27 percent growth a year, but the stock trades at just 15 times next year's earnings. All told, Action is one stock that seems worth holding on to. 

 Our timing on Core Laboratories (See related article: "Ten Stocks Under $25" -- SmartMoney May 1998) wasn't as impressive. Seven months after our story ran, crude-oil prices fell to 10-year lows, and oil-service -sector stocks withered. Now that oil prices have recovered, we're betting these stocks will snap back. Amsterdam-based Core, whose technology helps companies squeeze more oil out of existing wells, is still one of our favorites. The stock fell when first-quarter earnings came in lower than expected, but Wall Street Journal All-Star Analyst W. Neal McAtee wasn't surprised -- the stock simply followed a trend already set by the rest of the group. And, says McAtee, just as Core was the last to get hit by falling oil prices, it may be the first to recover as prices rise. We'd hang on to Core, as well as Maverick Tube, a big supplier of steel tubing to the oil industry, which we recommended in "Guilt by Association." 

 When we picked Lennar as our top home-building stock in "Where to Invest in 1998," it seemed a steal, trading at a price/earnings multiple of 11. Today it is even cheaper, at 7.3 times 2000 earnings. Here's why: Shares of Lennar, like those of other home builders, have fallen 20 percent on rising interest rates, which have pushed 30-year fixed mortgage rates to 7.51 percent, from a low of 6.46 percent in October 1998. Nevertheless, Wall Street Journal All-Star Analyst Robert Curran of Merrill Lynch expects a 15 percent earnings jump for 1999 due to the company's impressive backlog of orders. 

 More important, the rate rise hasn't stopped people from ordering new homes yet -- Lennar logged $1.3 billion in new orders in the first half of 1999 -- and we're betting that orders will continue to pile up. Why? California homes represent 50 percent of the company's sales. And, the thinking goes, because the West Coast was the last region to participate in the country's economic recovery, home sales should continue to be strong there long after demand in the rest of the country has petered out. At a recent price of $23.19 per share, Lennar stock is trading at half its 14.4 percent growth rate. While that's certainly a bargain, the company's shares will continue to get battered by every interest-rate rumor that hits the market. Once those issues ease, Lennar should go back to trading on its fundamentals. Our suggestion? Hold on until then. 

 There was something slightly morbid about why we originally picked American Oncology Resources, now known as US Oncology and trading under the ticker USON. The company had a small corner of the market in a fast-growing health care niche: cancer treatment. But with a P/E multiple of 23.6 and an estimated three-year earnings-growth rate of 30 percent, the numbers seemed compelling as well. Since we highlighted the stock in May 1998 as part of our "Ten Stocks Under $25" portfolio, however, it has slipped 17 percent. Is it time to unload your shares? No. American Oncology merged this year with Physician Reliance Network (hence the name change), and now the company is the largest cancer- treatment network in the country, with a market share of 13 percent of new cases. 

 So why is the stock down? Many health care stocks plummeted last year in the face of potential Medicare cutbacks. But as a specialty provider of cancer treatment, US Oncology has remained largely unaffected. Revenue grew 122 percent over the last two years; earnings climbed 65 percent. Once the Medicare cloud lifts a little, says Murray Innes, a Credit Lyonnais analyst, investors will recognize US Oncology as a good bet. "It's the best house in a bad neighborhood," he says. And one of the cheapest, too: At 13 times next year's earnings, it trades well below its 26.6 percent three-year growth rate. 

 Our hopes aren't so high for Brightpoint. We recommended the company, a leading distributor of mobile handsets worldwide, in May 1998 ("Ten Stocks Under $25") because it seemed poised to benefit from the continuing boom in demand for cellular telephony. On top of that, the company had a strong track record: Earnings more than doubled from 1996 to 1998, and analysts expected growth to continue at a 30 percent-plus clip for the next three years. They were wrong (and so were we). First, in March came a profit warning. Then, when the company announced first-quarter results two months later, earnings came in even lower than the company had suggested. Brightpoint stock, which we recommended at $18.06, dropped like a rock, to $6.00. 

 What went wrong? The devaluation of the Brazilian real early this year hurt results in Latin America. And sales plummeted in Asia -- despite strong demand for handsets -- because Brightpoint refused to cut prices to compete. In Europe, Brightpoint made a premature foray into direct distribution, a move that resulted in a 32 percent decrease in sales on the Continent. For the fiscal year 1999 ending in December, analysts expect earnings to drop 65 percent. Given that Brightpoint has had little to say about how it will change its fortunes, we believe there are better opportunities for your money.

THE silence at Marconi was deafening despite another demoralising 15p fall to a 29-month low of 340p. Dealers were flabbergasted that the telecoms giant again refused to budge, as speculation about an imminent profit warning intensified.  

Several overseas rivals, including Nortel of the US and Ericcson have issued warnings, but Marconi boss Lord Simpson and finance director John Mayo have told the market nothing.  

Analysts' red pencils have been working overtime in recent weeks with virtually every sector analyst taking a bearish view on earnings prospects in the short term.  

One miffed fund manager said: 'It really is amazing that we have not had a word from Marconi. Until a statement is made, I would not touch the stock with a bargepole. It makes one wonder if all is well in the boardroom.'  

Rumours suggest Spirent will report bad news first. The specialist electronic products group was sold down to 3293/4p before closing 71/4p easier at 355p on whispers that a cautious trading statement will be issued next week.  

Spirent is also heavily dependent on the US for profits. It bought Hekiman Laboratories for Pounds 1.1bn in December.  

The deal was financed by a five-for-four rights issue at 375p, which raised Pounds 500m.  

Hekiman's products help Internet service providers monitor their networks and remedy faults. Business was booming, but not now. The slowdown in the States is beginning to take its toll.  

End-of-first-quarter window dressing and bear closing helped the Foot-sie close 45.3 points up at 5633.7 and a commendable 231.4 higher on the week.  

Wall Street wobbled again in the early stages, replacing a 54-point gain with a 38 loss.  

The techMARK 100 closed 15.64 points lower at 1927.58 as Nasdaq fell a further 25 points in the early stages.  

Drugs giant Astra Zeneca zoomed 116p to 3360p after it submitted a new drug application with the US Food & Drug Administration for Faslodex, its breast cancer treatment. Rival Glaxo-SmithKline firmed 48p to 1841p on consideration of its defensive qualities.  

Speciality paints giant ICI lost 191/2p to 429p on worries that a profit warning is pending.  

Mike Lynch's Autonomy rallied 69p to 736p on bear covering following launch of Autonomy Asia, which will focus on markets in Singapore, Korea, China and Japan.  

Carphone Warehouse buzzed 111/2p higher to 133p after broker UBS War-burg advised clients to buy and directors bought Pounds 500,000 of shares.  

John Ritblat's British Land jumped 35p to 499p on Pounds 300m bond buyback plans. BL is buying back Pounds 150m of 12.5pc bonds due 2016 and Pounds 150m of 8.875pc bonds  

due 2023.  

Derivatives broker Garban-Inter-capital advanced 19p to 4771/2p after director Michael Spencer bought 15,000 shares at 4331/2p.  

End-week profit-taking left insurance giant Royal & Sun Alliance 121/2p off at 4781/2p. Rumours have been rife all week that Aegon, Europe's sixth biggest insurer, wants to swallow the group's life insurance operations.  

Aegon wants to move into the UK and is apparently looking at everything.  

Independent Insurance edged up 2p to 154p after Schroder Salomon Smith Barney moved to outperform and raised its target price to 200p.  

Engineer Hiscox rose 221/2p to 1801/2p on speculative buying fuelled by talk of a bid from 27.7pc shareholder Chubb Corporation.  

Vague break-up bid speculation prompted a rise of 7p to 1801/2p in engineer Charter. A 410p cash bid from Lincoln Electric of the US was rejected last year.  

Women's health club group Lady in Leisure collapsed 81/2p to 131/2p. Parties interested in buying the company said that, due to the high level of debt, any offer would be below the current market capitalisation of the group (Pounds 2.6m).  

The euro succumbed to selling against the yen and traded below 88 cents. It closed at 87.90 against the dollar and 61.93 against the pound.  

* DAVID Goldstone's property group Regalian closed unchanged at 42p, but will open much higher on Monday. An agreed 48p cash offer from Ruskin came after the close. Ruskin is a vehicle formed by Regalian directors Lee Gold-stone and Roland King and Sir Tom Farmer, founder of Kwik-Fit.

FIVE SESSIONS: THE WEEK'S MARKET ACTION
 Report on Business Column 
 Stock markets struggle to find a bottom Pressure on corporate profits keeps analysts and investors guessing, DAVE EBNER writes

 It was another hard week for North American equity markets -- perhaps doubly difficult because some market watchers felt a bottom had been found last week. 

 No such luck. Corporate profits remain under heavy pressure, made clear by Nortel Networks Corp.'s latest earnings warning. Canada's (still) most valuable company told investors its first-quarter loss would be triple a previous forecast and admitted it didn't know how the rest of the year would play out, given the deep uncertainty in the telecommunications sector. 

 "Fragile," is how Douglas Porter, senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns, described the market's collective sentiment. "Let's face it, the market is still extremely vulnerable to more earnings surprises. And I'd be reluctant to say that we've hit bottom." 

 John Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems Inc., launched the week with another of his increasingly dour outlooks. For the past three months, Mr. Chambers has issued subtle warnings through the press. Over the weekend, he told the Financial Times that the U.S. economic slowdown, which he first believed would last six months, could now stretch through the end of the year. 

 Monday's markets, however, shrugged off such pessimism. The Dow Jones industrial average rose on strength in a variety of sectors, including financial services, retail, construction and transportation. The Nasdaq composite index couldn't manage the same, hampered by Mr. Chamber's musings and a profit warning from chip maker PMC-Sierra Inc. 

 Good U.S. consumer confidence numbers inspired investors Tuesday. The Dow jumped 260 points, extended its three-day run to 558 points -- a 5.9-per-cent increase from its two-year low set March 22. Technology stocks also rose but the news of the day -- as has been the case all too often recently -- came after the bell. It was confession time for Nortel -- news that came as little surprise to the Street. While the company had steadfastly stuck to its 10-per-cent operating profit growth forecast made in February, analysts were expecting a 15-per-cent decline by the time Nortel finally warned. 

 Wednesday was predictably rough. Nortel took another swan dive. The company's news, compounded by a similar tale of woe from electronic organizer maker Palm Inc., kept all North American markets in the red. 

 Investors had another tough time Thursday, the two-year anniversary of the Dow's first close above 10,000. Profit concerns remained at the fore and knocked the Nasdaq to its worst finish in almost 29 months. The TSE 300's slide continued unhalted, closing at its lowest level in 16 months. The Dow, two years after its historic day, closed at 9,799.06. 

 End-of-quarter money gave the markets some energy yesterday but little could disguise the fact the markets just finished three of the harder months in recent history. 

 Keep your head up: Two sets of U.S. economic data next week -- the National Association of Purchasing Management survey on Monday and employment numbers on Friday -- will be closely watched by investors. 

 The week's box score: TSE 300: 7,608, down 31.8 points or 0.4 per cent; S&P 500: 1,160.33, up 20.5 points or 0.2 per cent; Nasdaq: 1,840.26, down 88.42 points or 4.6 per cent; Dow: 9,878.78, up 374 points or 3.9 per cent.

 NEWS 
 Edison Takeover Appears  Unlikely / Parent turnout low at 5 schools' vote

 Privatization of five failing city schools looked unlikely yesterday, with low turnout of parents at the polls to decide if for- profit Edison Schools should manage their schools. 

 As of last night, 1,813 parents, out of about 5,000, had voted in person or by mail, telephone or Internet at CS 66 in the Bronx, MS 246, MS 320 and IS 111 in Brooklyn, and PS 161 in Harlem. 

 A majority of parents at each of the five must vote "yes" to turn that school into a charter school, which would be managed by Edison. Parents who don't vote are counted as "no" votes. 

 Voting continues today at the five schools, from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. The Board of Education plans to announce results on Monday. But if fewer than half the parents at a school cast votes, a "no" is automatic; so far, it appears that half the parents have voted at only one school, PS 161, where parents vocally opposed Edison. 

 Supporters of Edison Schools were few and far between at CS 66 in the South Bronx and MS 246 in Brooklyn. Most were suspicious that a company with stock on the NASDAQ would squeeze their children to make a buck. 

 "It's a business," said Kenneth Wilson, 35, who has two children at CS 66. "Decisions are going to be made by a company office downtown." 

 However, Diane Negron, a mother of two, desperately wanted Edison to run CS 66. 

 "A lot of people that are against it try to put me down because I'm for it," said Negron, vice president of the school's Parents Association. "My children and all the children in the neighborhood deserve a better education." 

 Schools Chancellor Harold Levy said he wanted to give options to parents in schools at "the bottom of the bottom." 

 "If we get one thing out of this process, and that's parents more involved in the schools, that's a win because children win," Levy said at CS 66. 

 Many parents, however, blamed the chancellor for a process that even he called "disruptive." 

 Pro-Edison parents said the chancellor should have visited each school to explain why their schools might benefit from privatization. Anti-Edison parents were upset that the chancellor selected schools in minority neighborhoods. 

 "Why don't they go to white people's schools and try this?" said one mother whose daughter attends MS 246 in Brooklyn. "Why do they have to try it with black and Hispanic people?" 

 The American Arbitration Association, which conducted the election for the Board of Education, set up a voting room in each school, where parents marked paper ballots. 

 Near MS 320, Edison's shiny black van shuttled parents back and forth from housing projects. But large, glossy posters taped on walls and fences showed David Dinkins warning that "we should be more concerned with turning around our schools than turning a profit." 

 Edison officials and supporters said ACORN, a group that went to court to send parents anti-Edison material, scared parents. ACORN said Edison would charge tuition, fire teachers and take back new books or computers to pump up the bottom line, parents said. 

 Marshall Mitchell, vice president of Edison Schools, blamed "a misinformation campaign" by ACORN for low turnout. 

 Nathan Smith of ACORN said parents weren't voting because they didn't support Edison. "Because most parents see a no-show as a 'no' vote, they won't come," he said. 

 One parent offered the ultimate no-win scenario for Edison, which hired local people, went door to door, and made hundreds of telephone calls to parents. 

 "Anything you have to push for that much must not be that good," said Kelly Brown, 29, who has two children at CS 66.

 Warnings eroding confidence: 12 of 14 TSE groups fall: International Paper latest major firm to offer dour forecast

 Most stock market gauges in the United States slipped yesterday, with technology shares closing near 28-month lows, as profit warnings jolted investors' confidence that corporate earnings can recover soon from the economic slowdown. 

 "Everyone's scratching their head about the economy -- no one knows where it's going," said Rick Jandrain, chief investment officer of Banc One Investment Advisors, which oversees US$130-billion. 

 "Yes, stock values look good, but we don't have confidence on the earnings side and that's why investors are sitting on the sidelines." 

 The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index slumped 33.56 points, or 1.8%, to 1820.57. 

 That marked its lowest close since early November, 1998, and moved the market deeper into bear market territory, which is defined as a drop of 20% or more from the high. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 5.34 points, or 0.5%, to 1147.95, also pushing it more into bear mode. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average managed to eke out a small gain of 13.71 points, or 0.1%, at 9799.06. 

 Dour forecasts from tech companies to blue-chip paper maker International Paper Co. kept investors guessing a day after the Nasdaq dropped almost 6% and the Dow snapped a three-day winning streak. 

 The slide dampened hopes the market is headed for a recovery. 

 International Paper, the world's largest paper and forest products company, was the latest big-name company to warn its earnings will fall well below estimates. The stock (IP/NYSE) dropped US$1.11 to US$35.11. 

 Other paper stocks fell, including Boise Cascade Corp., (BCC/NYSE), which dropped US$1.20 to US$$30.63. 

 On the tech front, JNI Corp. (JNIC/NASDAQ) slipped US$1 19/32 to US$7 17/32 after revising its quarterly forecast. 

 The market was also hit by investors pulling US$3-billion from U.S. stock mutual funds in February -- the first monthly outflow since August, 1998. 

 Among other companies to warn, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE/NYSE) fell US$3.02 to US$18.10 after saying it will miss first-quarter forecasts. 

 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.24 billion shares, compared with 1.31 billion on Wednesday.

 Toronto stocks ended lower yesterday as concerns about the cloudy corporate earnings outlook continued to dominate investors' psyches. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell 61.74 points, or 0.8%, to 7444.78. The S&P/TSE 60 index closed down 3.90 points, or 0.9%, to 433.56. 

 All but two of the TSE's 14 stock groups traded lower. 

 The industrial products group fell 1.4%, with Nortel Networks Corp. (NT/TSE) ending down 21 cents to $21.27 a day after issuing a first-quarter profit warning, the company's third since October. Nortel accounted for 12% of the TSE 300's decline. 

 In other technology stocks, fibre-optics equipment company JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDU/TSE) fell $4.10 to $29 and Celestica Inc. (CLS/TSE), an electronics manufacturing services company, lost $3.22 to $43.28. 

 The consumer products group fell 0.6%. In the group, Biochem Pharma Inc. (BCH/TSE) fell $1.22 to $51.60. 

 Shareholders approved the company's planned US$4-billion merger with Shire Pharmaceuticals Group, as did shareholders of Shire, but the merger remains conditional upon approval by the Canadian minister of industry. 

 The banking group dropped 0.6%, as Royal Bank of Canada (RY/TSE) dropped $1.30 to $46.03, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM/TSE) fell 65 cents to $48.95, and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS/TSE) ended down 38 cents to $40.37. 

 The paper and forest products group dropped 0.5%. In the group, International Forest Products Ltd. (IFPa/TSE) rose 10 cents to $4.25 after announcing a $6.65-a-share offer for all the outstanding shares of Primex Forest Products. 

 In blue-chip trading, communications conglomerate BCE Inc. (BCE/TSE) fell $1.06 to $35.03, Canadian Pacific Ltd. (CP/TSE) dropped 68 cents to $56.20 and transportation company Bombardier Inc.'s class B shares (BBDb/TSE) climbed 6 cents to $20.95 

 On the positive side, the pipelines group gained 1.4% and the real estate group rose 0.2%. 

 Volume on the TSE was 144.7 million shares, compared with 166.3 million on Wednesday. 

 The Canadian Venture Exchange index slipped 5.61 points, or 0.2%, to 2957.78.

Wall Street made an expected retreat Wednesday, sending technology and blue-chip stocks sliding on a mix of earnings worries and profit-taking from the Dow Jones industrials' big three-day rally.

The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index fared the worst, falling 6 percent on a profit warning from Nortel Networks that stoked fears of more problems ahead for networking and telecom stocks.

"We had broad-based selling pressures in technology today," said Tom Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Clearly, some people are still very worried about this sector and how it's going to perform in the months ahead."

But some giveback was also to be expected after the market's rally.

"You've had a 10 percent run-up in the indexes since last week," Galvin said.

The Dow closed down 162.19 at 9,785.35, a 1.6 percent loss. The decline ended the Dow's three-day, 558-point winning streak, but the blue chips managed to hang on to 70 percent of their gains.

Broader stock indicators also lagged. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 28.88 at 1,153.29, a 2.4 percent loss, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 118.13 to 1,854.13.

The selling was no surprise. The warning from Nortel after regular trading ended Tuesday sent tech stocks down in the market's extended session, and set Wall Street up for Wednesday's selling.

Nortel, which also announced another 5,000 job cuts for a total of 15,000 planned this year, fell 16 percent, down $2.76 at $14. The news hurt other networking stocks, including Cisco Systems, which tumbled $2.38 to $15.75, a 13 percent drop.

Investors also pummeled Palm, which fell $7.44 to $8.06 for a 48 percent loss, after the handheld computer company announced job cuts and reduced its quarterly forecast. News of job cuts at Disney sent its stock down 84 cents to $28.36.

Stocks of interest in the Tulsa area that saw significant declines included Gemstar-TV Guide International, down $3.06 to $29.69; Williams Cos., off $1.15 to $41.85; Helmerich & Payne, down $2.46 to $48.75; and AMR Corp., down $1.66 to $34.82.

Nationally, beverage and health care stocks were among the few winners, reflecting investors' desire for less risky investments. Adolph Coors rose $2.29 to $65.38, while Merck advanced $1.54 to $75.15.

Stocks began recovering late last week from a 10-session slump that included a 1,468-point drop in the Dow. A better-than-expected consumer confidence report Tuesday, which suggested consumer spending might be able to lift the economy out of its malaise, added to buyers' enthusiasm.

But by Wednesday, pessimism had reasserted itself on Wall Street, as investors realized weak corporate earnings might continue for a while.

"The desperation was last week. Now we're finally getting to the acceptance phase. The casino has closed," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. "You have to let nature take its course. There may be no magic bottom and this may take a while."

The Russell 2000 index fell 10.68 Wednesday to 442.20.

Declining issues led advancers more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to nearly 1.52 billion, compared with 1.59 billion Tuesday.

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.9 percent. Germany's DAX index slid 2.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost nearly 2.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.6 percent.

 Options Report: Bearish Trades Reign In Data Storage

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- For many option traders, the only thing certain about this market is the uncertainty. 

 There were more earnings warnings, and concerns about the length and depth of the economic slump, but these don't always have a consistent impact on stocks' direction. About the only thing investors are sure of these days, options strategists say, is that the market will be choppy for months to come. 

 So options investors watched for news, keeping an eye out for areas of high volatility to sell options. 

 JNI Corp.'s profit warning late Wednesday triggered fear of earnings shortfalls from other computer data storage companies, sending some investors to take up new bearish or protective positions. 

 In Brocade Communications Systems, investors sold thousands of near-month, out-of-the-money bullish calls. As Brocade tumbled to another year low, investors selling calls pocket premium that could help offset losses and likely think the stock is now less likely to reach out-of-the-money strike prices. 

 Brocade stock most recently was down $3.33 or 15% to $18.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the April 20 calls were down $2.50 to $1.70 with more than 8,597 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 441. The May 22.50 calls also traded more than 7,845 contracts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Pacific Exchange, compared with open interest of zero. These calls were at $2.60 at the CBOE. 

 Network Appliance Inc.'s bearish puts also traded actively, as some investors bought out-of-the-money May puts to lock in minimum selling prices for the underlying stock. The stock fell $2.44 or 13% to $16.13. The May 15 puts, for instance, rose $1.06 to $2.56 on Philadelphia Stock Exchange volume of 335 contracts, with 160 contracts trading at other exchanges. Open interest was 83. 

 The data storage woes added to the swirl of speculation surrounding Sun Microsystems, in part because JNI had blamed its earnings shortfall on weak demand for Sun's products, from which it derived much revenue. Sun's bearish puts continued to see active trading as investors fret about a possible earnings warning from computer hardware and software company. 

 But unlike Wednesday, when an institutional investor bought back thousands of April 17.50 puts, at least one institutional investor on Thursday sold April 15 puts to take advantage of the spike in Sun's option volatility. This is a possibly bullish bet for the institution, which has sold puts against a number of tech names - the investor either expects Sun to rebound or is willing to buy stock at the $15 strike price. 

 With the stock down $1.60 or 10.1% to $14.25, the April 15 puts gained 85 cents to $1.90 on Amex volume of 5,952 contracts, with 2,057 contracts trading at other exchanges. Open interest was 24,522. 

 Meanwhile, investors who previously bought bearish puts in industrial names like Ingersoll Rand Co. and oil services company Baker Hughes Inc. saw their moves pay off. On Thursday, these investors took some profits off the table but maintained protection for any underlying stock by rolling these puts down to a lower strike price and out to a further month. 

 In Ingersoll, an investor sold April 42.50 puts at about $460 a contract, and bought just out-of-the-money June 37.50 puts at about $300 a contract, with more than 7,500 contracts of each trading at the Phlx. The stock was down $1.77 to $39.91. 

 In Baker Hughes, whose stock lost $2.66 or 6.9% to $36.14, at least one investor sold 6,000 contracts of the April 45 puts for $850 a contract and bought more than 5,000 contracts of the May 40 puts at $500 a contract. 

 Investors picked spots for optimistic bets too, buying out-of-the-money bullish calls in a number of tech companies. 

 Research In Motion Inc. tumbled to a year low Wednesday with other personal digital assistants following the Palm Inc. warning. But a bullish call spread surfaced in options trading Thursday. 

 At least one investor sold thousands of September 50 calls for about $110 a contract, using the proceeds to help buy September 30 calls at about $410 a contract. The investor likely believes the underlying stock can reach $30 by September and is willing to have stock called away or sold should it exceed $50. With the stock most recently up 42 cents to $20.67, the September 30 calls were at $4.10 on Amex volume of 7,500 contracts. The September 50 calls were at $1.10 on Amex volume of 9,500 contracts. 

 Elsewhere in the options market: 

 - The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 option prices to determine investor sentiment, rose 0.69 to 33.91. VIX rises to indicate that traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market. 

 - The CBOE's put/call ratio for stock options was neutral at 0.64. But the CBOE's put/call ratio for index options - widely regarded as a barometer of institutional sentiment - continued to stay high at 2.41. This ratio, also a contrarian sentiment indicator, is considered bullish when above 1.5.

But by Wednesday, pessimism had reasserted itself on Wall Street, as investors realized weak corporate earnings might continue for a while.

"People ... are still concerned we're heading for a recession and a serious profit slump," said Kevin Bannon, chief investment officer at BNY Asset Management, which oversees about $60 billion in assets.

As if on cue, two tech companies - JNI Corp. and Tech Data Corp. - Wednesday warned future quarterly results would fall below expectations because of weakening demand.

Indeed, the outlook is bleak. Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report that first-quarter profits fell 7.5 percent from the year-ago period. That's the worst first-quarter profit forecast since 1991, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. In addition, about 70 percent of the nearly 900 earnings advisories so far have been negative, a record low in the five years First Call has been tracking the data.

Those worries planted the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indexes in bear territory, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from a market's peak.

 US TECHS' WARNINGS TAKE TOLL ON FOOTSIE.

 US TECHS' WARNINGS TAKE TOLL ON FOOTSIE BY MICHAEL CLARKThe latest slump in the fortunes of the hi-tech Nasdaq market took a heavy toll on City investors in London today.Technology, media and telecom companies led the rest of the market lower as traders marked them sharply down across the board. The setback comes on the back of a spate of profit warnings, including Nortel and Palm, in the US this week that left the Nasdaq index nursing a fall of 6%. Worst-hit among the London leaders was again Marconi, dropping a further 23p, or 6%, to 350p as brokers continued to ponder the possibility of the telecoms equipment maker following the lead of rival Nortel and issuing a profits warning.Deutsche Bank points out that Marconi has lost almost 50% of its value since the start of the year as the market gets to grips with the worsening outlook for business. Profit numbers have been downgraded by 7% for 2001 and 18% for 2002. 

  ARM Holdings fell 131/2p to 3021/4p, Colt Telecom dropped 49p to 775p, Logica shed 32p to 1008p and CMG was off 41p at 6251/2p.British Telecom fell 7p to 501p after getting more grief from the industry regulator. Oftel has given BT two months to reach agreement with rival operators on providing wholesale leased lines and a further six weeks to offer them the product.Curiously, broker HSBC Securities has chosen to move from underweight to overweight in European telecoms because it believes recession fears have been overdone. Top of its shopping list are Vodafone, down 6p at 198p, and Orange, off 31/2p at 590p.ARC International was one of the biggest fallers among the second-liners, losing 81/2p, or 8%, to a new low of 991/2p. Restrictions imposed on the founding shareholders on selling their holdings have now been lifted and brokers fear large lumps of stock, including a 7% stake held by venture capitalist Apax, are about to be dumped on the market. Shares in the microchip designer hit a peak of 4291/2p shortly after it was floated in September.The rest of the equity market extended yesterday's heavy falls in the wake of last night's 162-point setback for the Dow Jones and fresh losses in the Far East. But share prices managed to trade above their worst levels with the appearance of a few bargain hunters. The FTSE 100 index reduced a 94-point deficit to 22.3 at 5591.7.Commerzbank has taken a shine to personnel and logistics group Hays, up 63/4p at 2821/2p. Shire Pharmaceuticals confounded the market, climbing 67p to 1167p after its proposed merger with Biochem Pharma was blocked for the time being by the Canadian government, which sees no benefit in the deal. Arbitrageurs had been selling Shire to buy the more attractive Biochem, and now the deal has been delayed they are being forced to unravel their positions and buy back Shire. Headway fell 111/2p to 54p after calling off bid talks that had been in progress since September. It blamed current stock market conditions for the breakdown.Kingfisher Leisure slumped 141/2p, or 21%, to 551/2p after revealing that offer talks have failed. It has also sold its property in Redhill, Surrey, to Luminar Dancing for #4.5 million, which will be used to reduce debt. Speculative buying pushed Ascot still higher with a rise of 61/2p at 3501/2p. Last week the specialty chemicals group announced it had received a bid approach.

 Investors hammered North American markets yesterday after Nortel Networks Corp.'s latest earnings warning reignited deep concerns over corporate profits. 

 "It just shows, yet again, how fragile sentiment is," said Doug Porter, senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto. "Let's face it, the market is still extremely vulnerable to more earnings surprises. And I'd be reluctant to say that we've hit bottom." 

 After Tuesday's market close, Nortel told investors its first-quarter loss will be far worse than previously projected. Palm Inc., the leading manufacturer of electronic organizers, compounded the bad news with its own warning. 

 The double whammy drove investors out of technology stocks -- and much of the broader market -- yesterday. The Nasdaq Stock Market composite index steadily declined through the day, closing at 1,854.13, down 118.13 points or 6 per cent, not much above its recent low set last Wednesday 

 . The Toronto Stock Exchange composite index dove 244.81 points or 3.2 per cent to 7,506.52, its worst finish in 16 months. The Dow Jones industrial average also lost ground -- dropping 162.19 points or 1.6 per cent to 9,785.35. 

 The general setback comes after a four-day market rally that saw the Dow and the Nasdaq bounce off the lows of last week. A number of commentators and investors said they felt the markets had found a bottom. 

 Mr. Porter called yesterday a "cold dose of reality," but noted that two sets of U.S. economic data due for release next week -- the National Association of Purchasing Management survey and the country's employment numbers -- could shed light on the future of the U.S. economy. 

 "Right now, the market needs some reassurance that the U.S. is not headed for a full-fledged recession," Mr. Porter said. "Those numbers will go a long way to answering that question." 

 Gavin Graham, investment director at Guardian Group of Funds, said that although yesterday might have hurt, the pain has pluses. 

 "While it's not pleasant to have everything going down, it means we're much closer to the bottom than the top," Mr. Graham said. 

 "The major point is the worse news gets, the more [central banks] will cut interest rates, so that's good news for stock markets." 

 Mr. Graham said he expects the Bank of Canada to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 4.75 per cent at its next fixed announcement date in April. He expects the same cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve Board -- which would bring its benchmark rate to 4.5 per cent -- when it meets in May. More bad news, Mr. Graham added, could move the Fed to cut in between meetings. 

 "We will see the beneficial effects in the real economy from these interest rate cuts in the first quarter of next year," Mr. Graham said, "but the stock market will start anticipating it in the second half of this year." 

 Until then, however, the outlook is not good. 

 James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, wrote in his Sparil economic report to clients that the "Stock market bullishness still seems too widespread to achieve a solid bottom with 'launch pad' possibilities."

 Nortel's not alone

 Nortel Networks Corp. took another beating at the hands of jittery investors yesterday, after the computer networking leviathan admitted that its losses in the first quarter of this year will be even bigger than the company's own bleak predictions of just six weeks ago. Adding to the gloomy forecast was the revelation that Nortel considers the economy so unpredictable that it won't even venture to guess how it will fare financially for the rest of this year. 

 "Given the poor visibility into the duration and breadth of the economic downturn and its impact on the overall market growth in 2001, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance for the company's financial performance for the full year 2001," John Roth, Nortel's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement released late Tuesday. 

 Well, Nortel, join the club. You aren't the only one baffled by where the economy is headed. 

 If there's one word that describes the economic outlook in North America right now, it's "uncertain." The economy is sending out more mixed signals than a crowded pickup joint on a Friday night. 

 On the same day Nortel issued its profit warning, the U.S. Conference Board reported that consumer confidence south of the border improved this month for the first time since September. Statistics Canada said our country is in its best financial shape in 50 years. A senior Bank of Canada official said the end of the current economic slowdown might be near. 

 But yesterday came word of an upcoming Canadian Conference Board report that will show consumer confidence in our country fell in the first quarter. Stock markets skidded amid a wave of pessimistic corporate earnings forecasts. Economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank pre- dicted that Canada's economic growth would slow to 2.2 per cent this year from 4.5 per cent last year, led by a "deep and painful" slowdown and rising unemployment in Ontario. On Tuesday, the U.S. Commerce Department said that durable goods orders, a key measure of investment by business in new equipment and software, fell again in February after sharp drops in January and the fourth quarter. 

 Given this mishmash of economic news, who can blame Nortel for treading carefully in the crystal-ball minefield? 

 Well, it appears the investment community can. Nortel's stock tumbled 18 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, contributing to a decline of more than 3 per cent in the TSE 300 index. 

 But it would be a mistake to assume the negative reaction reflects a growing sentiment that the economic sky is falling. Markets hate uncertainty, and the prevailing news these days is about as uncertain as it gets. The logic is simple: When you're unsure, keep your money in your pocket. That goes for Nortel's customers, for investment professionals, for consumers. 

 Conservatism shouldn't be confused with pessimism, or prudence with panic. Things aren't necessarily bad, just maddeningly unpredictable. The economy may be poised for a recession, a quick recovery or anything in between. No one knows. Maybe Nortel deserves some credit for at least being honest about that.

Earnings worries, profit-taking send markets tumbling

NEW YORK --Wall Street made an expected retreat yesterday, sending technology and blue-chip stocks sliding on a mix of earnings worries and profit-taking from the Dow Jones industrials' big three-day rally.

The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index fared the worst, falling 6 percent on a profit warning from Nortel Networks that stoked fears of more problems ahead for networking and telecom stocks.

"We had broad-based selling pressures in technology today," said Tom Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Clearly, some people are still very worried about this sector and how it's going to perform in the months ahead."

But some giveback was to be expected after the market's rally.

"You've had a 10 percent run-up in the indexes since last week," Galvin said.

The Dow closed down 162.19 at 9,785.35, a 1.6 percent loss. The decline ended the Dow's three-day, 558-point winning streak, but the blue chips managed to hang on to 70 percent of their gains. Dow component Microsoft lost $2.69, or 4.6 percent, to close at $55.57. Fellow Dow industrial Boeing slipped 20 cents to $55.

Broader stock indicators also lagged.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 28.88 at 1,153.29, a 2.4 percent loss, while the Nasdaq fell 118.13 to 1,854.13.

The selling was no surprise. The warning from Nortel after regular trading ended Tuesday sent tech stocks down in the market's extended session and set Wall Street up for yesterday's selling.

Nortel, which also announced an additional 5,000 job cuts for a total of 15,000 planned this year, fell 16 percent, down $2.76 at $14. The news hurt other networking stocks, including Cisco Systems, which tumbled $2.38 to $15.75, a 13 percent drop.

Investors also pummeled Palm, which fell $7.44 to $8.06 for a 48 percent loss, after the maker of handheld computers announced job cuts and reduced its quarterly forecast.

The three major indexes had gained since late last week, when they began recovering from a 10-session slump that included a 1,468-point drop in the Dow.

A better-than-expected consumer-confidence report Tuesday, which suggested consumer spending might be able to lift the economy out of its malaise, added to buyers' enthusiasm.

But by yesterday, pessimism had reasserted itself on Wall Street, as investors realized weak corporate earnings might continue for a while.

"The desperation was last week. Now we're finally getting to the acceptance phase. The casino has closed," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter. "You have to let nature take its course. There may be no magic bottom, and this may take a while."

US techs' warnings take toll on Footsie

THE latest slump in the fortunes of the hi-tech Nasdaq market took a heavy toll on City investors in London today. Technology, media and telecoms companies led the rest of the market lower as traders marked them sharply down across the board.  

The setback comes on the back of a spate of profit warnings, including Nortel and Palm, in the US this week that left the Nasdaq index nursing a fall of 6%. Worst hit among the London leaders was again Marconi, dropping a further 27p, or 7%, to 346p as brokers continued to ponder the possibility of the telecoms equipment maker following the lead of rival Nortel and issuing a profits warning.  

Deutsche Bank points out that Marconi has lost almost 50% of its value since the start of the year as the market gets to grips with the worsening outlook for business.  

Profit numbers have been downgraded by 7% for 2001 and 18% for 2002.  

ARM Holdings fell 10p to 305 3/4p, Colt Telecom dropped 69p to 755p, Logica shed 45p to 995p and CMG was off 55 1/2p at 611p.  

British Telecom fell 11p to 497p after getting more grief from the industry regulator. Oftel has given BT two months to reach agreement with rival operators on providing wholesale leased lines and a further six weeks to offer them the product.  

Curiously, broker HSBC Securities has chosen to move from underweight to overweight in European telecoms because it believes recession fears have been overdone. Top of its list are Vodafone, down 9 1/4p at 194 3/4p, and Orange, off 1/2p at 593p.  

ARC International was one of the biggest fallers among the second-liners, losing 8p, or 7.5%, to a new low of 100p.  

Restrictions imposed on the founding shareholders on selling their holdings have now been lifted and brokers fear large lumps of stock, including a 7% stake held by venture capitalist Apax, are about to be dumped on the market. Shares in the microchip designer hit a peak of 429 1/2p shortly after it was floated in September.  

The rest of the equity market extended yesterday's heavy falls in the wake of last night's 162-points setback for the Dow Jones and fresh losses in the Far East. But share prices managed to trade above their worst levels despite the decision of the European Central Bank to peg rates. The appearance of a few bargain-hunters helped the FTSE 100 index reduce a 94-points deficit to 66.9 at 5547.1.  

Commerzbank has taken a shine to personnel and logistics group Hays, up 4 1/4p at 280p. Shire Pharmaceuticals confounded the market, climbing 86p to 1186p after its proposed merger with Biochem Pharma was blocked for the time being by the Canadian government, which sees no benefit in the deal.  

Arbitrageurs had been selling Shire to buy the more attractive Biochem, and now the deal has been delayed they are being forced to unravel their positions and buy back Shire. Headway fell 11 1/2p to 54p after calling off bid talks that had been in progress since September. It blamed current stock market conditions for the breakdown.  

Kingfisher Leisure slumped 14 1/2p, or 21%, to 55 1/2p after revealing that offer talks have failed. It has also sold its property in Redhill, Surrey, to Luminar Dancing for Pounds 4.5 million, which will be used to reduce debt. Ascot soared 47p to 391p after receiving a 400p-a-share offer from Dow Chemical of the US valuing the speciality chemicals group at Pounds 304 million.  

Prices and indices in this section are supplied from various sources and calculated at different times and may not always match those listed in the tables. Ofex prices relate to the previous close.

 Nortel Networks' latest profit warning, announced after markets closed yesterday, is poised to spoil the stock markets' impressive gains this week. 

 A report of increased consumer confidence in the United States had pushed markets higher yesterday, though a pumped-up American dollar hurt the Canadian dollar. 

 But in late afternoon, Nortel issued a revenue warning and said it will cut 5,000 more jobs from its global workforce as it deals with weaker markets in the United States. 

 Yesterday, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index rose 64.73 to 7,751.33, jumping after the upbeat report from the U.S. Conference Board. The western-based Canadian Venture Exchange closed 18.12 points higher at 2,988.71. 

 On Wall Street, the consumer confidence report sent stocks climbing. The Dow Jones industrials rose 260.01 points to 9,947.54, a 2.7 per cent gain. The Nasdaq composite index was up 53.75 at 1,972.24 while the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 29.48 to 1,182.17. 

 The Canadian dollar dove back under 64 cents after Monday's upward surge. The currency closed down 0.45 at 63.78 cents US.

 IMM currencies mixed in quiet trade, yen repatriation key.

 CHICAGO, March 28 (Reuters) - IMM currency futures ended mixed Wednesday in quiet trade, with June yen reversing from a 13-day high of $0.008304 reached on ongoing Japanese fiscal year-end repatriation, analysts said. 

 The June euro contract also ended lower, extending Tuesday's losses to a five-day low of $0.8868, as traders debated the chances for a cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank at the bank's policy meeting Thursday. 

 For lack of more significant news, foreign exchange traders pinned their strategies on demand for yen as Japanese businesses wind up the fiscal year. 

 "There's always talk of this at the end of the Japanese fiscal year," said Greg Mount, senior international economist at Bank One. 

 After March 31, he said, the key to yen direction will return to such factors as Bank of Japan policy and the health of the flagging Japanese economy. 

 "What's really important is the economic fundamentals," Mount said. He said the sour Japanese political climate and slumping economy almost guaranteed renewed weakness in yen futures after April 1. 

 Once again the talk among euro futures traders Wednesday was of the likelihood of a euro zone rate cut. There is little market consensus on the chances for a rate move. 

 "I wouldn't be surprised if we see them go," Mount said. 

 But Tim Mazanec, senior foreign exchange strategist at Investors Bank, said in the morning there was little chance of such a move. 

 "I'm definitely in the camp that says they are not going to go tomorrow," Mazanec said. 

 A New York-based investment bank was seen selling euro lots aggressively all day, according to IMM floor traders. 

 June Canadian dollar finished the day with a small gain after slipping to a two-day low of $0.6360. The pair suffered early on a profit warning from Nortel. The giant Canadian technology firm announced that it now expects a first-quarter loss of 10 cents to 12 cents a share, compared with an earlier forecast for a loss of 4 cents. 

 June sterling ended higher after barely scraping a one-week high of $1.4370 in the U.S. session. Support came overnight from Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member DeAnne Julius, who reiterated that the British economy would not slow as much as the U.S. economy. 

 June yen settled down $0.000015 at $0.008261, euros dropped 0.0067 to $0.8870, Swiss francs fell $0.0029 to close at $0.5812, sterling rose $0.0046 to $1.4352, Canadian dollar climbed $0.0018 to $0.6395, Australian dollar fell $0.0050 to $0.4937 and the Mexican peso jumped $0.00125 to $0.104300.

 Nortel singes market, again.

 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds underperformed Treasuries on Wednesday as traders once again fretted about equities, where the year's second warning of lower-than-expected earnings from Nortel Networks Corp. and Palm Inc. weighed heavily. 

 In secondary trading, spreads - the yield difference between corporate bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries - widened about 0.02 percentage points. 

 "Spreads are open a couple of basis points wider after a nice rally on Tuesday," said one trader. "We're just going to follow the stock market for the next 12 years." 

 NORTEL LOSS TO GROW, BONDS WEAKEN 

 Nortel, the world's No. 1 supplier of telecommunications equipment, was a big loser Wednesday morning, after the company warned of a bigger-than-expected first quarter loss and lower-than-expected revenues because of the slowing U.S. economy and rising competition. 

 It also said it will cut 5,000 more jobs, or about 5 percent of its workforce, by mid-year, on top of 10,000 already announced cuts. 

 Nortel, which issued a profit warning in February, now expects a first quarter operating loss of 10 to 12 cents per share on revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $7.7 billion. 

 Its 6.125 percent notes maturing in February 2026 were bid on Wednesday to yield about 2.2 percentage points more than Treasuries, up from 1.9 to 1.95 on Tuesday, and 1.47 when the company sold them on February 1. 

 SUPPLY 

 Three companies sold bonds late on Tuesday, all in sales they increased in size. 

 American Transmission Co., a Waukesha, Wisc.-based electric transmission system operator, privately sold $300 million, up from $275 million, of 10-year notes yielding 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

 Iron Mountain Inc. , a Boston-based record and information management services company, privately sold $225 million, up from $200 million, of 12-year subordinated junk bonds yielding 3.625 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

 And Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing , the world's No. 3 chip foundry, said it sold $500 million of five-year senior convertible notes with a yield to maturity of 5.25 percent and roughly 33 percent conversion premium. A 5.25 to 5.5 percent yield and 27 to 33 percent premium were expected. The sale was increased in size from an original $350 million. 

 On Wednesday in Europe, General Electric Capital Corp., the finance arm of Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co. , added 100 million euros ($89 million) to an issue maturing in 2015. 

 At least two billion-dollar-plus sales sit on the calendar. Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.'s PSEG Power LLC plans to privately sell $1.6 billion of three-, five-and 10-year notes to buy more generation assets. PSEG's debt is expected to be rated "Baa1" by Moody's Investors Service, and is rated "BBB" by Standard & Poor's. 

 Also, TransOcean Sedco Forex Inc. , a Houston-based offshore drilling contractor, plans to sell $1.2 billion of debt in two parts. The debt should be rated "Baa2" by Moody's and "A-minus" by S&P. 

 Other expected sales come from: Apogent Technologies Inc. , a Portsmouth, N.H.-based laboratory and life sciences products maker, $300 million; Avista Corp. , a Spokane, Wash.-based energy company, $300 million; and Maytag Corp. , the Newton, Iowa-based No. 3 U.S. appliance maker that warned on Tuesday of lower-than-expected quarterly earnings, $185 million. 

 In junk, sales are expected from: Century Aluminum Co. , a Monterey, Calif.-based aluminum producer, $315 million; Sequa Corp. , a New York-based industrial company, $200 million; and TeleCorp PCS , an Arlington, Va.-based regional phone company, $425 million. 

 Ten-year Treasuries rose 11/32 in early trading, as their yields fell to 4.965 percent.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks fell Wednesday, taking back recent gains,
as fresh profit warnings in the technology sector hurt the market.


 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 189 points to 9759 in afternoon trading after gaining 260.01, or 2.7%, to 9947.54 on Tuesday. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was 835 million shares, 1,957 issues declined, 1,002 advanced and 209 were unchanged. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 102.60 to 1869.70 after jumping 53.77, or 2.8%, to 1972.26 on Tuesday. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 10.20 to 589.50, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 29 to 1153.20. 

 Palm missed sales expectations for the third quarter and surprisingly projected a loss for its fourth period, a sign that its hot sector isn't escaping the economic slowdown. Shares of the Santa Clara, Calif., handheld computer maker tumbled $7.44, or 48%, to $8.06. 

 Also, Nortel Networks said late Tuesday that its first-quarter results would fall well short of already-reduced targets as the slowdown in telecommunications spending spreads beyond North America. Shares of the Brampton, Ontario, telecom-equipment maker fell $3.23, or 19%, to $13.53. 

 Stocks had rallied Tuesday amid a perception that the worst of the corporate news and stock declines could be over. But fresh profit warnings Wednesday seemed to suggest otherwise. 

 Meanwhile, ADC Telecommunications tumbled $1.94, or 18%, to $8.63. The Minnetonka, Minn., provider of fiber-optic and networking equipment said it would cut as much as 19% of its work force and post a quarterly loss as it copes with a slowdown in spending for its networking gear. 

 Corning dropped $3.52, or 14%, to $21.48. The Corning, N.Y., maker of optical fiber and components fell following Nortel Networks' profitwarning. Nortel is Corning's largest photonics customer, Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Fox said. Cisco Systems slid $2.19, or 12%, to $15.94. The San Jose, Calif., networking company's earnings estimates were cut by analyst Tim Luke at Lehman Bros. and analyst Paul Johnson at Robertson Stevens. 

 Viacom lost $1.70, or 3.7%, to $44.55. The New York entertainment and media giant is giving up on its long-stalled plan to split off Blockbuster, saying that the video-rental unit's business has turned around so much in the past few years that it wants to keep it. Shares of Blockbuster, Dallas, rose 69 cents, or 5.1%, to $13.98. 

 Walt Disney fell $1.05, or 3.6%, to $28.16. The Burbank, Calif., entertainment company said it will seek to reduce its global work force by 4,000 people, or about 3%, a move it attributed to the 'pressing concerns of the softening economic environment' and the need to please investors. Gillette declined 98 cents, or 3.1%, to $31.09. The Boston consumer-products company is planning to relaunch its battered Duracell unit with a name change, boosted performance and a $100 million marketing campaign. 

 Coca-Cola was down 81 cents, or 1.7%, to $45.80. The Atlanta beverage group estimates that its unit case volume grew 4% to 5% in the first quarter, largely on international sales growth. It said marketing initiatives should boost flat North America sales as the year progresses.

CHEN: Wall Street's rally was fed by a new report on consumer confidence. Renay San Miguel has our MarketWatch report.   

RENAY SAN MIGUEL reporting:   

Consumer confidence was up for the first time in six months, but orders for durable goods--those big-ticket items like cars and refrigerators--were down from February. Investors chose to focus on the confidence numbers and bought stocks like crazy, but that confidence number could also mean the Federal Reserve won't cut interest rates in May.   

Meanwhile, those confidence numbers shot the Dow up 259 points to close at 9,947, its third triple-digit gain in a row--drugs, airlines, biotechs and banks enjoying the ride.

 * Comair, with Pilots Striking, Cancels Another Day 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Comair, a regional airline unit of Delta Air Lines Inc., on Tuesday said it would keep its planes grounded through at least Thursday morning as its pilots continued day two of their strike. As of Tuesday afternoon the two sides had not scheduled any meetings. Both Comair, the nation's second-largest regional airline behind American Eagle, and the Air Line Pilots Association union, which represents its 1,350 pilots, had said they would return to talks if called to do so by federal mediators. 

 The pilots are seeking higher wages, retirement benefits, and improved work rules. Comair's fleet consists mostly of regional jets, and the union says the pilots deserve a better pay scale more in line with larger carriers. Co-pilots with one year of experience at the airline can earn about $16,000 annually in what is considered a training position. That goes up to almost $70,000 for a 13-year captain. Comair's main hub is Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Ky., and the airline has a smaller hub in Orlando, Fla. 

 * Aer Lingus Faces Three Days of Strikes 

 DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish state airline Aer Lingus was locked in urgent talks with union leaders on Tuesday to try to avert planned strike action by baggage handlers and check-in staff over an equal pay claim, a spokesman said. Aer Lingus said it had rejected the claim from 3,000 clerical and operative staff for the same pay as cabin crew on the grounds they had already struck their own separate pay deal. 

 The union, which represents back-office staff as well as baggage handlers and cleaners, plans three one-day strikes - on March 30, April 6, and April 12 - if it does not get its way. "They negotiated their own agreement about 10 weeks ago. The cabin crew did its own deal, and now they want complete parity with cabin crew which we obviously reject," an Aer Lingus spokesman said. He was unable to say how badly the strike would affect flights to and from the Irish republic. 

 * German Flights Hit by Lufthansa Strike 

 FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German flights were badly disrupted early on Wednesday as a pilots' strike at national airline Deutsche Lufthansa led to cancellations at airports across the country. The "warning" strike started at 6:30 a.m. (0430 GMT) and was to last 2-1/2 hours. Pilots union Vereinigung Cockpit (VC) called the stoppage as wage negotiations with the airline appeared to be making little progress. "The strike is affecting all routes and all airports," a Lufthansa spokesman said. Some 74 flights had been cancelled about an hour after the strike began, some to foreign destinations including Brussels and Milan. 

 The airline said operations were likely to return to normal by about midday (1000 GMT). Lufthansa has asked passengers to travel by rail instead and said flight tickets were valid on the trains for the duration of the strike. It has also scheduled 23 emergency flights to enable passengers to reach connecting flights. The pilots are asking for more than a 30 percent salary increase on average and profit-sharing. Wednesday's strike was the second in less than a week at Lufthansa. Workers held similar warning strikes last Friday over the progress of pay talks, stopping roughly 100 flights and delaying 10,000 passengers. 

 * Cyprus Airports Shut by Strike over Healthcare 

 NICOSIA (Reuters) - A 24-hour strike by civil servants on Cyprus on Wednesday shut down the island's airports, inconveniencing thousands of travelers. More than 90 inbound and outbound flights to the airports of Paphos and Larnaca were cancelled by the rare walkout, over government plans to introduce a national health scheme. More than 65 scheduled arrivals and departures from Larnaca were affected, and more than 40 were affected in Paphos, the vast majority of them charter flights to and from Britain. 

 "Air traffic controllers are still working, managing our flight information region. But the rest of the airports are shut down, as is the rest of the system," a transport ministry official told Reuters. "It is the first time in recent years that I can remember an all-out strike. It is a nuisance," the official added. The strike coincided with the new charter flight season bringing hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers to the east Mediterranean island each year. 

 * Lack of Pilots Hitting Iberia Unit Routes Says Union 

 MADRID (Reuters) - A lack of pilots is causing "frequent" cancellations on routes operated by Iberia regional subsidiary Binter Mediterraneo, Spanish pilots' union SEPLA said on Tuesday. The biggest effect of the cuts on the airline's services in southern Spain were on those to the north African enclave of Melilla, where the only alternative connection is by ferryboat, said SEPLA. 

 "With the actual number of pilots it is impossible to comply with the (spring-summer) flights program," said a statement released by the union. The cancellations were being fuelled by the airline's "antiquated fleet" - five CASA CN 235 aircraft - which "require a disproportional (amount of) maintenance." Iberia announced last month that it had signed a pre-agreement to study the transfer of Binter Mediterraneo operations to its regional franchisee Air Nostrum. 

 * S. Korea Airline Union Workers Drop Strike Threat 

 SEOUL (Reuters) - Union workers at South Korea's airline companies said on Wednesday they had withdrawn their strike threat as transport authorities agreed to lower highway toll fees they have to pay to get to work. "The government has accepted most of our demands. So we have dropped our planned strike," said a web-site statement from a union group representing workers at Korea's two airline firms and the Korea Airport Service Corp. 

 Last Friday, transport officials summoned executives of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines to try and avert a strike that threatens to cripple a plan to open Asia's newest airport on March 29. Union officials earlier said some 16,500 unionized workers, about half the total workforce at Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and Korea Airport Service Corp, would go out on strike on April 2. They had also threatened partial walkouts to cripple the official opening of the 5.8 trillion won ($4.43 billion) Incheon International Airport. 

 * SES to Buy GE Americom for $5 Billion 

 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Luxembourg-based Societe Europeenne des Satellites (SES) said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy General Electric Co's satellite unit, GE Americom Communications, for $5 billion in cash and stock, creating one of the global leaders in the satellite services business. In a deal that plugs a hole for SES in the key U.S. market, the company said it had created a new company, SES Global, which will pay GE $2.7 billion in cash and 15.4 million new SES Global shares for U.S. player GE Americom. 

 "SES Global will become the world's premier broadband satellite services provider with a combined satellite fleet comprised of 28 wholly-owned satellites as well as 13 additional satellites through partnership and investment interests," SES said in a statement. SES, which had been on the hunt for a U.S. acquisition for some time, had been widely seen as the leading suitor for GE Americom, one of the largest U.S. satellite service providers. SES said it expected to close the deal by the end of 2001. 

 * India Satellite Rocket Test Postponed Indefinitely 

 SRIHARIKOTA, India (Reuters) - The test launch of a high-powered Indian satellite rocket was postponed indefinitely on Wednesday after a technical snag forced its first flight to be aborted, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) said. "These are all part and parcel of this kind of game," ISRO Chairman K. Kasturirangan told a news conference at the Sriharikota space port, some 100 km (62 miles) from the southern city of Madras. "We have decided that the mission is cancelled for the time being." 

 A successful flight would have put India into an elite club of nations capable of putting big satellites deep into space. The first developmental flight of the Geo-Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, or GSLV-D1, had been due to blast off at 3:47 p.m. (1017 GMT). "And we have lift off!" exclaimed the commentator on state television as a live broadcast showed the engines igniting at the scheduled time. Seconds later flames enveloped the bottom of the rocket. 

 * Qantas Warns Investors to Buckle Up 

 SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's flagship carrier Qantas Airways Ltd warned of earnings pressure from increased competition on Wednesday, sending its shares into a nose dive. The warning, its second in just over a month, slashed as much as 31 cents or 11.2 percent off the Qantas share price to push the scrip to A$2.46, its lowest since November 1998. Shares in Qantas, in which Britain's largest airline company British Airways Plc has a 25 percent stake, closed down 29 cents to A$2.48 in a modestly firmer market overall. 

 Geoff Dixon, chief executive of Qantas, said that trading conditions had worsened in the month since its first-half profit announcement when he first warned of earnings pressure. "The past two weeks has seen a substantial increase in the level and range of discounting on domestic routes," he said. "This will result in a further reduction in our yields." Dixon said the Australian dollar's decline to historic lows and a global economic slowdown were discouraging business travel at home and overseas, and making it difficult to set accurate forecasts. 

 * Ethiopian Airways' Italy Perishables Trade Misses A Season 

 ROME (Reuters) - Ethiopian Airlines is unlikely to send any perishables freighter flights to Italy this season due to ongoing price wrangling between the carrier, exporters and Italian importers, an official told Reuters on Tuesday. "We have not yet begun our service, and with the season finishing at the start of April we are set to miss the whole season," said Marco Tranquilli, Ethiopian's cargo sales supervisor in Rome. 

 Ethiopian's vegetable season starts in December and the carrier has previously flown vegetables to Forli in Emilia Romagna before taking on cargo in Rome for the return journey. Last year the airline flew 1,000 tonnes of perishables to Italy. This year, Ethiopian had planned two weekly flights, most likely a chartered DC8 and Ethiopian Airlines' own Boeing 757F. "I understand the importers have been considering using another operator, perhaps privately chartered Russian aircraft," said Tranquilli. 

 * Korea's New International Airport to Open Glitches and All 

 SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's new Incheon International Airport will open on Thursday as scheduled despite unsettled problems in its baggage handling system and security-check devices. Incheon will become the nation's main international gateway, replacing Seoul's congested Kimpo Airport, which will be consigned to domestic flights. 

 An Asiana Airlines B767-300 passenger jet arriving from Bangkok was scheduled to be the first airplane to touch down at the new airport at 5:00 a.m. (2000 GMT). A Korean Air Lines B747-200 cargo jet bound for Milan via Brussels would be the first to take off at 6:30 a.m. (2130 GMT). Located about 40 km (25 miles) west of Seoul, the new airport was built at a cost of 5.8 trillion won ($4.43 billion) and has taken over eight years to complete. The airport will initially be able to handle 27 million passengers, 1.7 million tonnes of cargo and 170,000 flights a year. The passenger handling capacity is forecast to rise to 100 million by 2020. 

 * Air Philippines to Lease 3 Boeings, Looks Overseas 

 MANILA (Reuters) - Air Philippines Corp said on Wednesday it will lease three narrow-bodied Boeing 737-300s from U.S.-based General Electric Aviation Services next month for use on international routes. The unlisted firm said in a statement it has earmarked one billion pesos ($20.3 million) for its route expansion program, allowing it to service five international routes pending approval by the local regulatory agency. The capital spending will be financed through issue of additional shares, a move approved during a recent special meeting of the firm's board of directors. 

 The routes the airline plans to service are Kuala Lumpur, Kaohsiung, Brunei, Bangkok and Guam. Air Philippines expects regulators to give their approval by April. Air Philippines currently operates 26 flights daily to 15 domestic destinations. The three new aircraft brings to 11 the airline's operating fleet, which currently comprises of Boeing 737-200s. "These new aircraft, plus our bid to break into regional and international points, lay the foundation for our vision to become a preferred global airline that exceeds world-class standards," Air Philippines' president Rogelio Narciso said in a statement. 

 * Japan Transport Ministry Backs New Haneda Runway Plan 

 TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's transport ministry on Wednesday backed a controversial plan to build another runway at Tokyo's second airport, Haneda, to cope with worsening congestion in the skies over the Japanese capital. Officials on a transport ministry research panel said they would place top priority on a plan for another runway at Haneda, arguing that another option, building a new airport, would take too long. Japan has been considering for several years whether to build a new airport near Tokyo or to add another runway to Haneda as congestion increases at the current international airport at Narita. 

 However, issues over noise at Haneda, which is sandwiched between Tokyo Bay and crowded residential areas, as well as disputes between Narita and Haneda over which should have the prestige of being Japan's main international gateway have made the decision-making process a difficult one. Transport minister Chikage Ogi and Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara have been pressing for an additional runway at Haneda. In February, Japan partially opened Haneda to international flights to try to ease congestion at Narita and bolster Japan's role as an aviation gateway to Asia. 

 * Miami Airport Re-Examining Its Planned $6 Billion Makeover 

 MIAMI (Reuters) - Miami International Airport staff began to re-examine its sprawling $6 billion capital improvements program and may recommend changes, the newly appointed director of the airport told Reuters. "There is a pressing need to get some definition on scope, cost and schedule," Angela Gittens, director of the aviation department of Miami-Dade County, Florida, the owner of the Miami airport, said in an interview. The airport recently raised its estimate of the total cost of its capital improvements program to $6 billion from $5.4 billion, and pushed forward the estimated year of completion, from 2006 to 2008. 

 "I can't imagine anything in it, having just reviewed it, that we don't need," said Gittens, who began her job as Miami airport director this month. "Some things may have to fall out, or you know, perhaps we just increase the total scope." Development of new cargo-side facilities at the Miami airport has been outpacing facility development on the passenger side, which is proceeding in gradual stages to avert major service interruptions, she said. "Miami's problem with cargo had been, it just wasn't developing facilities," Gittens said. "So as it has done all of the physical things that it needs to do to satisfy that market, it's reaping the rewards." 

 * Mineta Says Some U.S. Air Delays Unnecessary 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta said on Tuesday he favored greater airline competition and better airport access, but rejected any proposal that moved toward industry re-regulation. In an interview, Mineta also said he believed there was more capacity in the air traffic system than was being used, and signaled more could be done by industry and government to move traffic more efficiently without compromising safety. "I'm looking at that carefully," he said. 

 Mineta suggested that advances in aviation technology actually may unnecessarily influence operational decisions and add to delays. He stressed that safety was his top priority, but suggested there might be room to maneuver. "Maybe we're being too sensitive," Mineta said about air traffic operations that hold planes on the ground for some weather-related problems. In certain weather circumstances that now result in delays, Mineta said pilots should be allowed to fly around trouble, instead of marking time on the ground.

 UPDATE 2-Specialty chip stocks pounded after warnings.

 NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Investors pummeled shares of communications chip makers on Tuesday for the second day in a row, as the market digested an earnings warning by Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. and a series of cutbacks in analysts' profit expectations. 

 Late on Monday, Vitesse slashed its fiscal-second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook by 50 percent, the second reduction in a month. The news capped an already bad day for communications chip stocks, in which PMC-Sierra Inc. and Conexant Systems Inc. both cut jobs and profit expectations. 

 Network equipment makers such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. have lost some of their appetite for microchips in recent months as an expected boom in telecommunications and data services has failed to pan out. 

 Last year's ravenous ordering of microchips built up such a large surplus that equipment makers have had to cut back their orders drastically, if they ordered at all. 

 "The Ciscos and Lucents of the world wanted to make sure they could have enough components to serve their customers, who were ordering products hand over fist," Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Lipacis said. "As a result you got double ordering and triple ordering. 

 "When demand stops, first you get the companies canceling the double orders, then you get them canceling the single orders," he added. 

 That analysis matched the reality painted by PMC-Sierra, whose chief executive said in a conference call on Monday that "several of our customers have basically net bookings of close to zero this quarter." 

 Shares of PMC-Sierra dropped 86 cents, or 2.7 percent, to close at $31.40 after falling 5 percent on Monday. Conexant stock dropped 4 percent, falling 7/16 to $10-1/16. 

 Hardest hit were the two companies who gave profit warnings after the bell on Monday. 

 Shares of Vitesse were down $4-7/8, or 14.4 percent, at $29-1/16 after hitting a 52-week low of $27-13/16. 

 TranSwitch Corp. , which on Monday gave its second earnings warning in March, saw its stock sink $3-3/4, or 19.9 percent, to $15-1/8 after hitting a 52-week low of $14-1/2. 

 Wall Street analysts took little mercy on chip makers, with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Bros. cutting profit expectations. 

 "We believe (PMC-Sierra) stock, while likely not to go much further down, could be 'dead money' for the next several months," CSFB analyst Charlie Glavin wrote in a research note.

 Market Report - SkyePharma is in demand as US rival fetches fancy price.

 SHARES IN SkyePharma, the specialist biotech, were in demand yesterday amid talk that Johnson & Johnson is about to pay a fancy price for a rival. 

 SkyePharma jumped 8p to 79.5p as the sector joined in the wider market's strengthening rebound. But the rumoured $12bn (#8.4bn) offer for Alza of the United States makes SkyePharma look particularly cheap, analysts say. 

 SkyePharma makes its money developing techniques for delivering drugs to patients, and works for most of the global drug giants. Peter Laing of SG Securities told clients to "buy" after last week's price slump. "In addition, if the J&J bid prevails, then rival pharmaceutical companies will be unlikely to view Alza as independent. This should improve the competitive position of SkyePharma in the contract drug delivery business," he said. 

 Institutional bargain-hunters were out in force, not only in the biotech sector but across the board. The FTSE 100 soared 174.3 points to 5,576.6 - back above the level before last Wednesday's crash. The FTSE techMARK 100 was up a similar amount, by 62.1 points to 1,999.08 as both the Nasdaq and Dow Jones shrugged off bearish noises on this year's business outlook from Cisco, the networking equipment giant, in early US trading. The mid-cap FTSE 250 was back over 6,000, up 56.3 to 6,000.1. 

 Plenty sounded cautious notes, though. Deutsche Bank strategists warned: "A 10-year-old trend of falling risk premium has been broken in the recent sell-off. This clearly makes equities somewhat cheaper than they have been for quite some time, but also more unpredictable - appetite for risk can be analysed but not predicted." 

 Dealers argued that sentiment remains fragile, and bad news from an unexpected quarter could send shares back down. Fund managers have an interest in pumping the market up ahead of quarterly performance calculations at the end of the first quarter next weekend. 

 Nonetheless, Amvescap topped the FTSE 100 leaderboard with a 120p climb to 1,069p as investors bet the fund manager would benefit from less choppy markets. Invensys rose 13p to 134p as investors reckoned the reaction to last week's profit warning had been overdone, particularly if boardroom changes are back on the agenda. Cable & Wireless, the most battered of all the blue chips, bounced 49p to 493p after a little good news: it is considering a share buyback after making a gain of #3.9bn on the sale of its stake in C&W Optus. 

 Bearish stories surrounded Close Brothers, the broker whose Winterflood Securities market-making arm expanded rapidly during the retail investor boom 18 months ago. One tale suggested imminent news of an internal restructuring, and the shares bucked the market trend with a 26p fall to 776.5p. 

 Foot-and-mouth victims yesterday included Uniq, as hopes receded that it will find a buyer for its loss-making pig-meat business, Malton Foods, in the short term. Uniq shares were down 14.75p to 175.25p. Hilton fell 2.5p to 208.5p on worries for the tourism industry if the crisis persists. 

 Direct marketing specialist Real Affinity joined AIM with a placing at 8p and ended at 9.25p. Last week it won an 18-month extension to its contract with Parcelforce, a major client: too late for inclusion in the prospectus. 

 Online Travel, the Web-based travel agent, extended its relationship with BTopenworld, the internet service provider. BT (up 13p at 520p) is taking a stake in Online Travel, buying 300,000 new shares at 31.5p. On the AIM market, the stock was up a penny to 31p. Private rival Deckchair.com was bought by World Travel in a deal that served to counter disappointing figures from the quoted buyer. World Travel said it had #2.4m in the bank at the end of December, just three months after raising #11.5m. The shares were up 0.5p at 19p.

 Stocks score gains as bears hibernate Old Economy stocks boost the TSE 300; Dow big winner on Wall St.; Nasdaq slips

 The bad-news bears that had been clawing at blue-chip stocks went into hibernation Monday -- for the time being, at least -- and cleared a path for the bulls. 

 New York's Dow Jones industrial average was the big winner, carrying Friday's rally forward and claiming a triple-digit gain by the closing bell. The blue-chip index closed up 182.75 points or 1.92 per cent to 9,687.53, spurred by gains in financial service, retailing, construction and transportation stocks. 

 On Bay Street, Old Economy stocks also helped spur the Toronto Stock Exchange, although its gains were more modest. Its 300-stock composite index added 46.76 points to close at 7,686.6. 

 Last week, the Dow briefly dipped into bear market territory, hitting a two-year intraday low of 9,106.54. The grizzly classification is given when an index drops 20 per cent from its peak, which in the Dow's case is 11,723. 

 "Nobody is dancing on the casket of the bear market yet, but at least investors are trying to bury the bear market," David Sowerby, a market strategist at Detroit's Loomis Sayles & Co., told Reuters News Agency. "Investors are believing there is a greater likelihood that March will mark the bottom. Two days don't make a long-term trend, but it's certainly a more positive than a negative sign." 

 Wall Street's broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.86 points or 1.13 per cent to 1,152.69. 

 On the tech front, Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index had a relatively modest session, slipping 10.19 points to end the day at 1,918.49. 

 PMC-Sierra Corp. weighed heavily on Nasdaq. The chip maker issued a profit warning before the opening bell, saying it would post first-quarter share profit of between 2 to 3 cents, much lower than analysts' expectations of 12 cents. It also said it would be slashing its work force by 13 per cent because of the recent economic slowdown. PMC Sierra shares closed off 4.94 per cent or $1.68 to close at $32.26 (U.S.). 

 On the Canadian Venture Exchange, home to small-capitalization stocks, the CDNX index lost 9.83 points to 2,970.59.

Goldman, Lehman divided on Europe

BROKERS appear to be having a difference of opinion about the outlook for blue-chip European companies. US securities house Goldman Sachs was today telling clients it had reduced its recommendation on leading European shares from neutral to underperform and was cutting the amount of funds invested from 21% of the total portfolio to 18%.  

It sees the outlook for British shares as slightly more positive and has increased its weighting from 7.5% to 8.5%, but the real growth is expected to come from the US, which now makes up 50% of its portfolio. By contrast, rival US securities house Lehman Brothers was yesterday telling clients that Europe was the place to be and that shares were almost 30% undervalued with the telecoms, media and technology companies offering best value.  

It still expects equity markets around the world to offer the best returns and this now accounts for 70% of its weightings. Lehman has lowered its exposure to bonds and cash.  

Share prices in London ticked better today after a nervous start. The FTSE 100 index traded below its best levels with a rise of rise of 55.8 to 5632.4 as Wall Street and Nasdaq made a hesitant start to trading this afternoon in the US. There was little demand for tech stocks with investors choosing defensive issues such as BAT, up 14p at 5201/2p, and Royal Bank of Scotland, 53p stronger at 1498p.  

GKN rose 23p to 722p as broker UBS Warburg repeated its strong buy recommendation while raising its target price to 900p. Broker Merrill Lynch still likes Tesco, up 1/2p at 2511/2p, and has set a target price of 290p.  

Vodafone hardened 21/2p to 2081/2p. But only a day after the company revealed a sharp rise in the price of pay-as-you-talk mobile phone packages, US securities house Bear Stearns has slashed its target price for the shares from 371p to 275p. It said the shares remain a buy, but expected current-year earnings to be depressed by recent deals. Atlantic Telecom put on 1/4p to 40p after director Martin Beard picked up 10,000 shares at 36p. It takes his total holding to 18,750, or less than 1% of the total.  

Early gains at Serco were pared after it said it had lost its bid to run the Nats air traffic control service to a consortium of British airlines. Serco traded below its best levels with a rise of 121/2p at 4321/2p. Shares of Baltimore Technologies slumped to a new low with a fall of 6p to 99p as brokers continued to downgrade their profit projections in the wake of last week's shock profits warning. The company met selected brokers in Dublin last week and said several product launches had been delayed. Motion Media marked time at 82p as stockbroker Colin Blackbourne raised his stake in the company after buying 65,000 shares. He now owns five million, or Bob Morton's Vislink celebrated a return to the black with a rise of 21/2p to 521/2p. The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1 million against a loss of Pounds 21.7 million last time. The company's own broker Investec Henderson Crosthwaite has pencilled in Pounds 2.4 million for the current year and Pounds 4.5 million for the year after.

 HERE IS yet another Indian software company confirming fears about the setback it is likely to receive from the ongoing slowdown in the US economy. 

 Visual Soft, a second rung software services and products company, has mentioned that the slowdown in US is likely to usher in a uniform 25-30 per cent reversal for the growth of the company's topline in the next quarter or two, since its products are not finding much of a market there. 

 Given the company's focus is product-oriented and it has always kept its eyes towards the US markets, this would lead to a major reversal. 

 Not surprisingly, the company's stock has already hit two successive 16 per cent circuit break breakers on the downside following the profit warning. 

 It may be recollected that the stock, trading at around Rs 720 around the start of last month, has since slipped to less than Rs 300 at the close of the week. 

 Though the company has been marketing some services also, the slowdown in the US has spilled over to have an adverse affect on the software services demand as well. 

 It may be recollected that just about two weeks back, a well-known software services company - NIIT - had mentioned in its mid-quarter review that it foresees a slowdown in its growth over the coming one or two quarters. 

 And the management had attributed this to the longer selling cycles it was facing for its software services in the US and the delays in projects in that country, besides the economy slowdown. 

 Given that Mastek, NIIT and Visual Soft have already issued warnings regarding the slow growth they are anticipating in the near future as a backdrop to the slowdown in the US economy, all eyes are now on Q4 results, which would be due in another fortnight. 

 Well timed 

 BALLARPUR Industries is on a major expansion drive. The company has already allocated Rs 400 crore for expansion to raise the capacities to manufacture pulp and for printing and writing paper as well. 

 However, while these expansion plans have just kicked off with the help of borrowed funds and some internal accruals, the company has just closed another deal with Sinar Mas to take over its plant near Pune for over Rs 500 crore. 

 The takeover of the Sinar Mas unit shall mean an addition of 1.15 lakh tonnes per annum of capacity to the existing capacity of 2.5 lakh tonnes which Ballarpur already has. 

 This would take the company's marketshare in the domestic market to 10 per cent from around 7-8 per cent at present, very shortly. This comes as a precursor to the possible consolidation that may follow in the paper industry in the near future. 

 And since Ballarpur has said that it is open to such acquisition opportunities, the possibility that this will actually happen is high. Besides, given that the company has raised its paper production capacity via acquisition at a time when the paper industry is in good shape, it stands a good chance to make the best out of the situation. 

 Win-win situation 

 THE Tatas could not have hoped for a better deal in the case of Hi Tech Drilling. The Tata group was seeking an exit from the non-core operations as a part of their corporate strategy. 

 And offshore drilling, the mainstream business of Hi Tech Drilling, looked like a probable casualty. Rumours floated about the Tatas offloading their stake from the company about two years back too, but did not prove true. 

 However, this time, the Tatas have gone ahead and sold off their 22.5 per cent equity stake in Hi Tech Drilling at Rs 92 per share to Aban Loyd Chiles Offshores. 

 Considering that Tatas were looking for a good exit price and not all its rigs were working together over the last one or two years because of maintenance or some other problem, this should turn out to be a good deal for Tatas. 

 Even from the investors' point of view, the stock, in the rolling settlement list, is not very actively traded and prior to changing hands, was commanding a price of Rs 40-odd. 

 But now that the open offer is for Rs 92, investors could think of moving out at a healthy price. And since Aban Lyod Chiles is already into the same business, the acquisition would add economies of scale to its business. 

 Driven by rumours 

 GERMAN Remedies on a rollercoaster ride these days. And this is not surprising, considering that these days the market is becoming curious about who would pick up the 27.4 per cent equity stake of the company, that is now up for sale. 

 Two of the initial co-promoters, holding 13.7 per cent stake each in the company are now offering their stake for sale in German Remedies, for which it is expected that a few domestic pharma majors may come up with their bids. 

 And it is the rumours relating to interest shown by one major or the other, along with the price band, which is now dictating the price trend on German Remedies counter over the past one month. 

 It may be recollected that Ranbaxy officially confirmed having made a bid to acquire 27.4 per cent stake, and mentioned that the price would vary depending upon the licensing rights. 

 But since it was official and no price was mentioned, this resulted in only a marginal movement on the German Remedies counter for a day or two. 

 But it was reports of the Nicholas group getting interested and willing to pay a high price which later resulted in an uptrend in German Remedies stock, which picked up to Rs 560 from Rs 510 two weeks back. 

 But the interest again faded out when no such bids came up from the Ajay Piramal group, which is known for its proclivity for takeover/acquisitions. 

 Yet again, even though the market was dull, the stock picked up once again on similar reports. The stock may continue to move on the basis of rumours till the issue is settled.

 * Investigation Launched into Caribbean Air Crash 

 PARIS (Reuters) - French aviation experts flew to the Caribbean holiday island of St Barthelemy on Sunday to lead an investigation into a plane crash that killed 20 people. A small Twin Otter aircraft operated by Air Caraibes burst into flames on Saturday after plunging into a house during its approach to the tiny island's airstrip, which is hemmed in by hills and notoriously difficult to land on. A spokesman for Air Caraibes said all 17 passengers, mostly tourists, and the two crew members died in the crash. A man on the ground was also killed and his wife was seriously injured. 

 "The passengers were all French apart from an American woman and a Dutch woman," the spokesman told Reuters, speaking by telephone from the picturesque French territory, which is some 125 miles (200 km) east of Puerto Rico. "We do not know why the accident happened but investigators are due to arrive from mainland France later today to help us with the inquiry," he added. Forensic scientists were also due to fly in from Paris to help identify the bodies, some of which were badly burnt in the fire. The names of the victims will be released once all their families have been informed. 

 * Comair Pilots Go on Strike, Flights Canceled 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pilots for Comair Inc., a unit of Delta Air Lines Inc., went on strike at 12:01 a.m. (0501 GMT) on Monday, forcing the nation's second largest regional airline to suspend its operations. "As of 12:01 a.m. March 26, Comair pilots are on strike ... After three years of fruitless negotiations, management's team abandoned negotiations on Sunday, assuring a strike," said Captain J.C. Lawson, chairman of the pilot's Master Executive Council, a unit of the Air Line Pilots Association. "Until further notice, Comair pilots will peacefully and completely withdraw their services," said the union, which represents 1,350 Comair pilots, who are fighting for better pay and benefits. 

 The Comair pilots' strike is the first of several that could hit U.S. airline passengers, who are already disgruntled about frequent delays and cancellations. Comair, which operates 800 flights a day to 95 U.S. cities, said it was "disappointed by the decision of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) to strike, even though the company was prepared to negotiate and compromise on a fair and equitable agreement." "Comair wants to bring this situation to a resolution quickly and stands ready and willing to meet with the union leadership at any time to work out an agreement," the Kentucky-based airline said in a statement. 

 * Lufthansa, Workers Reach Pay Deal 

 FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German trade union Verdi said on Saturday it had reached a pay deal with national carrier Lufthansa AG for 55,000 ground staff and cabin crew. The deal will give Lufthansa employees a 3.5 percent salary increase and will run for 14 months, Verdi spokesman Ingo Schwob told Reuters. "This is a very satisfactory result," Schwob said. Lufthansa confirmed a deal had been reached in a statement. 

 Under the deal, workers will take part in a profit sharing deal worth 1,100 marks ($502) and receive a one-off payment of 250 marks ($114) for the months of February and March. The airline had initially offered a 2.6 percent salary increase and a profit-sharing deal in which employees would receive a one-time bonus amounting to 1.6 percent of their annual salary, but the union said the offer was too low. Lufthansa workers held warning strikes nation-wide on Friday amid ongoing salary negotiations, stopping roughly 100 flights and affecting 10,000 passengers. "A deal would not have been possible without the warning strikes," Schwob said. 

 * American Airlines Pilots List Demands on TWA Buy 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - The pilots union at American Airlines has issued a costly list of demands as conditions for insuring labor peace after American acquires Trans World Airlines, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Monday. The demands include pension enhancements and protections against furloughs, pay reduction or job-assignment change, the paper said. Earlier this month, a bankruptcy judge approved American Airlines' $742 million bid for most of bankrupt TWA. 

 John Darrah, president of the Allied Pilots Association, the union representing about 11,000 American pilots, said in a message to pilots during the weekend that the union is asking for nothing more than promises that UAL Corp.'s United Airlines made to its pilots as part of United's deal to acquire US Airways Group Inc., the paper said. American, a unit of AMR Corp. has been negotiating with its pilots for a month, with no agreement, the paper noted. "We are disappointed at this lack of results, particularly in light of the speed with which American concluded its agreement to acquire TWA," Darrah was reported as saying. 

 * New Korea Airport Admits Baggage Handling Problems 

 SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's new Incheon International Airport said on Saturday its baggage handling system (BHS) revealed glitches during Friday's rehearsal, but the problems would not affect the March 29 opening of the facility. "It is true that our BHS has still some problems. During a rehearsal with Korean Air on Friday, the system halted for about 15 minutes," said Lim Tong-myung, chief spokesman for the airport. "But the airport will open as scheduled despite the problems." He said similar problems could occur in the early stages of opening given a lack of practice with airline companies. 

 "Airline companies began testing the baggage handling system only from last week," Lim said. "Such tests should have begun two months ago." But Lim said the airport would do its best to minimize inconvenience for passengers by running the baggage handling system on a semi-automatic mode as an alternative. "If the BHS shows problems in full-automatic mode, then we can turn to semi-automatic mode, which is still as effective as the automatic mode except that it requires more human hands," he said. 

 * Korean Air Says New Airport to Hike Costs $50 Million 

 SEOUL (Reuters) - Korean Air said on Monday higher costs at South Korea's new Incheon International Airport would cost the world's second largest cargo carrier an extra 65.6 billion won, or $50.15 million, this year. Expenses are expected to rise to 270.5 billion won, up 32 percent from those at the former international airport, Kimpo, Korean Air said in a statement. Korean Air expects to make up the revenues through expanded service at Incheon, which is designed for 24-hour service versus Kimpo's 17 hours a day, an investor relations official at the airline told Reuters. 

 * Qatar Airways Signs $44.5 Million Plane Loan with QNB 

 DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar Airways signed a $44.5 million loan with Qatar National Bank (QNB) on Sunday for the purchase of two Airbus A300-600R aircraft. Akbar al-Baker, chief executive of Qatar Airways, said the loan was in addition to a $270 million facility the carrier signed last October with a group of national and international banks - co-led by QNB, Barclays group and Germany's Hypo Vereinsbank - for six Airbus A320. 

 "This (Sunday's) loan is a locally-sourced structure without recourse to external financing resources," John Finigan, general manager and chief executive of QNB, told reporters after signing the deal with Baker. Partly privately-owned Qatar Airways had signed a $550 million deal with the European consortium in 1998 to acquire 11 aircraft over 2005. The majority of the aircraft are A300-600Rs, but the airline has the option under the deal to acquire more advanced versions. 

 * Dragonair Takes Delivery of Airbus, Fleet now at 15 

 HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd (Dragonair) said on Monday it had taken delivery of an Airbus A-320 leased to Taipei-based TransAsia Airways in June 1999, raising the number of its passenger aircraft to 15. Dragonair would also take delivery of two new passenger aircraft, both Airbus A-330s, in May and June. Dragonair said it aimed to double its fleet by the end of 2005. It now operates a fleet of five Airbus 330-300s, three Airbus-321s and seven Airbus-320s in addition to a Boeing 747-300 freighter. Dragonair's passenger network covers 27 destinations across the Asia-Pacific region, and its cargo network connects markets in Europe, the Middle East and China. 

 * Raytheon Gets FAA Approval for Premier I Jet 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Defense and aerospace firm Raytheon Co. won long-awaited approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for its Premier I business jet, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Monday. The approval could ease the Lexington, Mass.-based company's difficulties in selling the aircraft-manufacturing unit that makes the plane, the paper said. Raytheon officials said the FAA declared on Friday that the company's new jet meets safety and performance requirements after overcoming a series of assembly problems, the paper said. 

 These issues caused the aircraft's certification to slip more than 28 months later than original company projections, delaying sales of aircraft and hurting Raytheon's overall cash flows and revenue for 1999 and 2000, the paper noted. Raytheon has logged 318 orders for the $5 million plane, 247 from outside buyers and 71 from Raytheon's fractional-jet-ownership plan, the paper said. Raytheon intends to deliver 36 aircraft this year and ramp up production to 60 planes annually by 2002, according to the report. 

 * Singapore Aircraft Delivers New Airbus to Sabena 

 SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise (S.A.L.E) said on Monday it delivered a new Airbus A320-200 to Belgium's Sabena Airways on a 10-year lease. The company said in a statement the A320-200, powered by two CFM56-5B4P2 engines built by CFM International, was delivered to Sabena from the Airbus plant in Toulouse, France. It gave no financial details of the deal. S.A.L.E. said the aircraft was the 11th A320-200 it had leased out. 

 * Review Says Boston Runway Won't Harm Environment 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Building a new runway at Boston's Logan International Airport, one of the nation's busiest, would not have a significant impact on the environment and would reduce flight delays, a draft review showed. An executive summary of the complex environmental report, the result of a joint effort by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Massachusetts Port Authority, was released on Friday. The FAA must sign off on environmental concerns about the project before it can move forward. Environmental review has taken more than six years. 

 The state wants to build a 5,000-foot (1,524-metre) runway to handle growing regional jet service and make overall air traffic operations at New England's biggest airport run more smoothly. The proposal is politically controversial and pits Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, a proponent of the runway, against Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and other high-profile politicians, who oppose it. Too small to handle big jets, the runway is not viewed as a major boost to capacity, a shortage of which at major airports plagues the nation's air traffic system. 

 * Cyprus Airports Get 23 Expressions of Interest 

 NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus has received 23 expressions of interest from European, American and Australian companies for the development and operation of its Larnaca and Paphos airports, transport ministry officials said on Monday. "It is a very wide of applicants with some quite serious companies and that is very encouraging," said Dr Vassos Pyrgos, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Communications and Works. The expressions of interest came from both consortia and individual companies, he added. 

 Cyprus is seeking an operator who will redevelop and run for between 15 and 20 years its two airports at Larnaca and Paphos. The government says the cost of developing both airports, based on 1998 prices, is 200 million Cyprus pounds ($309.8 million). Larnaca, the largest of the two, now handles more than 4.5 million passengers annually and the more charter-driven Paphos terminal 1.4 million passengers. Authorities want operation of the airports to be under a Build-Operate-Transfer style contract. 

 * Bangladesh Prime Minister Opens Second International Airport 

 DHAKA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina opened Bangladesh's second international airport on Saturday in the port city of Chittagong, saying it would become a gateway between the east and Far East. The airport, which was previously used only for domestic and some regional flights, has been improved at a cost of 6.41 billion taka ($118.7 million), and can now handle wide-body aircraft from all destinations. Money for the work came from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund. 

 The new M.A. Hannan International Airport, named after a veteran of Bangladesh's 1971 war of independence, will handle some 750,000 international and domestic passengers and 6,000 tonnes cargo annually, civil aviation officials said. Hasina said foreign airlines would be allowed to utilize the airport facilities without paying royalties and fuel would be cheaper than at other airports in the region. The airport would greatly ease traffic at the Dhaka's Zia International Airport, Civil Aviation and Tourism Minister Mosharraf Hossain said.

Stock market's two weeks of doom and despondency.

The market's biggest slump since the 1987 crash has had traders in despair and analysts at odds over its end, write Kirstie Hamilton and Garth Alexander.

THURSDAY afternoon at 4pm marked the low point when even traders, who have grown used to falling share prices, were reduced to head-in-hands despair.

It had been a miserable day on the London stock market. Profit warnings hit the market first thing and, combined with a Confederation of British Industrial Trends survey showing weakening manufacturing demand in March, produced a market ready to believe the worst.

Instead of just technology and telecoms stocks being kicked, traders decided to spread the misery more widely.

Invensys, the engineering group, BPB, the plasterboard maker, and Capital Radio all saw their shares dive after warning that this year's profits would not match expectations. Zurich Financial Services, the Swiss insurer with big British and American interests, also plummeted, a victim of its own fast expansion and falling stock markets hurting its investment arm.

There was good news, too - both Selfridges and Next produced performances that other retailers would die for - but for investors worried about the American economy and its possible effects here, the warnings carried twice as much weight as the cheer. The FTSE 100 index tumbled another 150 points.

But it was when Wall Street opened that the Footsie really took fright.

Procter & Gamble, the giant American consumer group, set the tone for the day by announcing job cuts of almost 10%. The Dow Jones plunged and the Footsie's fall gathered pace. At one stage it plunged 246 points, close to 5% - the worst one-day fall for more than 13 years. Even for investors used to a falling market, it was horrific.

Friday brought some reprieve in stock-market terms. Despite further bad news at home - Enodis, the catering equipment manufacturer, ejected its chief executive amid a profit warning and news of job cuts - there was some relief in share prices, with the Footsie ending the day up 94 points. But it was not enough to make up for what came before.

The past two weeks have been bloodier than any traders can remember since the crash of 1987.

Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Derivatives and a veteran of numerous market downturns, fears the rout is not over yet. "I think America has another 15% to 20% to go. That kind of fall in the US would trigger selling of British securities by American investors and that would exert enough downward pressure on UK equity prices to scare off anyone else who may be tempted to buy. Technical support levels are being smashed as if they were matchwood."

Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of Hoare Govett and one of the City's most experienced corporate brokers, believes we cannot expect a quick fix. "We are all too attuned to quick movements - I don't think we are in that sort of market. There is scope for shares to track back further but it will be over a period of months rather than days or weeks."

Gareth Williams, UK strategist at ABN Amro, is still hopeful that the London market could recover by the end of the year, but he places some caveats on the prediction. "That depends on the US pulling out of the tailspin it is in at the moment. When you have this constant drip-feed of bad profit news against a backdrop of a market that has been through a bubble it is very unsettling.

"A lot of people thought it might have shown signs of stabilising by now, but it will take some time before people are sure America will avoid an early 1990s-style recession."

Robert Buckland, UK equity strategist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, reinforces the view that the British market is no longer overvalued. "Instead of just gawping at the screens, which is a dangerous thing to do when the markets are going up or down, if you look at the valuation methods we consider, the market is now looking pretty cheap against what looks like pretty expensive bonds.

"The valuation of bonds relative to equities is now at the same levels as during the recession in the early 1990s and the Asian crisis. At both those times, you generated returns of 25% to 30% in the follow-ing year."

But being cheap is not necessarily enough to ensure a real bounce. Buckland says: "It is an infection spreading from the technology stocks into the rest of the market. Particularly in America, there is a self-fulfilling nature to it. It becomes a circular thing, always heading down."

The market was particularly unkind to any company that dared present bad news. The shares of BPB, the plasterboard maker, tumbled by almost 20% when it warned that profits this year would be #10m to #20m lower than expected. BPB's problems stemmed from Europe, the area that many investors had hoped would protect them from the worst of the storms.

Meanwhile, in America, nervous investors, fearing the markets may fall much further, continued to dump shares. The Dow Jones fell into "bear territory" during trading on Thursday for the first time in more than 10 years. It climbed out again on Friday - technically a bear market is a 20% fall - with the market showing a 19% drop from its peak of 11,723 on January 14 last year. The Nasdaq is easily in bear territory, down 62% from its peak of 5,049 last March.

Investors in America are now selling more shares than they are buying. Last month, for the first time since the Russian financial crisis in August 1998, they pulled more money out of mutual funds than they put in. The net outflow was $2.4billion, compared with a $31billion inflow in January. However, this represents only 0.3% of the $4,000billion in equity funds.

More than $4,400billion has now been wiped off portfolio values since the markets reached record levels early last year, according to Ned Davis Research.

The immediate cause of last week's sell-off was disappointment that the Federal Reserve did not cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points - as predicted by some analysts - at the federal open market committee (FOMC) meeting on Tuesday. Instead, the Fed cut the overnight rate by 0.5 points, from 5.5% to 5%.

More disappointing news came on Wednesday when stronger-than-expected consumer price figures dampened hopes of an early rate cut. The Dow fell 238 points on Tuesday and 233 points on Wednesday.

Wall Street firms have also been badly hit as mergers and acquisitions have dried up and brokerage activity has declined. In a sign of the times, Lucent Technologies postponed for one week the flotation of Agere, its semiconductor unit, and slashed the price of the offering to $6 to $7 a share instead of $12 to $14. Net income at Morgan Stanley fell 34% in the three months to the end of February, while profits were down 43% at Bear Stearns, 28% at Lehman Brothers and 13% at Goldman Sachs.

Charles Schwab, the discount broker, said it would not meet earnings expectations and plans to lay off 11% to 13% of its staff -2,750 to 3,400 people.

Despite the prospect of lean business in the months ahead, investment banks have been paying ever higher salaries to keep their best staff.

Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) was forced into agreeing a 50% salary rise for a team of 40 bankers and pay them a combined $300m over three years after a bidding war with Barclays Capital.

Although Wall Street is laying off thousands of lower-paid employees, guaranteed salaries for some mean that banks could face a tough time if the slump continues for long. About half of investment-banking revenues are eaten up by salaries.

Richard Thornburgh, the chief financial officer at CSFB, insists: "The macro trends for the business look extremely attractive for the next five to 10 years. We are comfortable with the rates we are paying."

Some analysts see a positive sign in last week's falls, particularly the switch from high-tech stocks to a more general market malaise. Marshall Acuff at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney says: "Late in the (correction) you tend to see increasing selling of the bluest of blue chips. That is what is happening now. That tells me individual investors are capitulating. It would not surprise me to see a rally as we come into the new quarter. The overall sentiment is still relatively bullish. But what is worrying is the composite of worldwide markets - they have all rolled over."

An indication of the uncertainty gripping world markets, and the flight of international capital into the relatively safe American market, is the unusual strength of the dollar which, despite the stock market's turmoil, strengthened to $1.42 to the pound.

Jeff Applegate of Lehman Brothers believes the correction in technology stocks is already over and the Nasdaq is recovering.

He says: "The correction in technology stocks looks as if it largely came to an end two weeks ago. Extreme overvaluation went to extreme under-valuation. But what is a little bothersome is that everyone and his brother is waiting for a classic climactic sell off. It may not come because the market doesn't always ring a bell when it hits bottom. I think the Fed needs to do more and it needs to do it faster."

But unrepentant bears, such as Michael Metz at CIBC World Markets, believe the market has to fall much further to shake out excess valuations. Metz, who has been predicting a big market correction for more than two years, says: "We are probably in for a one-to-two-year bear market. Consumers will not provide the engine for a quick recovery. And their love affair with shares is over."

Back in Britain, where retail investors have never played as important a role in the stock market as in America, it is certainly true that small investors have decided to stay home.

Thousands of advertisements urging consumers to buy Isas before the end of the tax year have been largely ignored; Isa sales fell by 15% in January and have deteriorated markedly since then.

Enodis gets burnt by US

THE slowing US economy has hit kitchen-equipment maker Enodis, which announced a profit warning and a cull of 900 jobs, wiping 35pc off its value.  

Enodis, which supplies numerous McDonald's outlets, blamed poor trading conditions in its key US market.  

'Several leading restaurant chains have significantly curtailed their new opening and refurbishment progammes,' it said. Sales have fallen 10pc from last year. The bulk of the job cuts will come from US operations, which have already shed 400 staff.  

Chief executive David Williams fell on his sword, leaving day-today responsibility to chairman Peter Brooks until a successor is located.  

Shares in Enodis, formerly known as Berisford, crashed 54p to 101p, its worst level since mid-1997.  

Analysts say it is now vulnerable to a bid. It also slashed its dividend to a maximum of 2p against 4.4p last year.  

Some observers believe the sudden economic downturn has forced struggling companies to own up to difficulties.  

'Companies are beginning to come clean,' said Jeremy Bat-stone at NatWest Stockbrokers.

 Modest rise in markets brings relief.

 Modest rise in markets brings relief Arthur Macdonald INVESTORS breathed a sigh of relief last night as the stock market staged a modest recovery. 

 Analysts claimed the FTSE-100 now appeared to have reached the bottom of its trough. The FTSE-100 closed up 87.5 points at 5402.3 on the back of stronger US markets. 

 The rise repaired some of the damage from Thursday's 225.9 slump which wiped #52billion off the value of shares. Yesterday's increase left the market still down 161 points - some #38billion - on the week. 

 Analysts believe the markets may now have reached a floor but no one is predicting a strong recovery in the near future. 

 There are still fears that bad news, particularly from across the Atlantic, could create pressure for further falls. 

 Mark McCue, at brokers Bell Lawrie White in Aberdeen, said: "We have seen a technical bounce on the back of Wall Street's recovery the previous night but the market is still nervous. The market is clearly oversold and the modest rise is encouraging. I think the market may have hit its floor." He said he did not see a strong recovery in the short term as sentiment was still concerned about weaker performances. 

 Baltimore, the technology stock which a year ago was a FTSE 100 constituent with a market capitalisation of about #6billion, yesterday issued a profit warning and saw its share price fall 30%, or by 46p, to close at 106p. The firm is now valued at about #500million. 

 Hilary Cook, director of investment strategy at Barclays Stockbrokers, said she did not expect the Footsie to fall much further despite the instability. "There is no solid upward trend at the moment, and there will probably be more profit warnings next week. I think we could be near the bottom. "We still believe the Footsie will be up around 6,600 in 12 months' time and it will get better in the second half of this year." She said investors might begin to creep back to the market, particularly if they could see through the turbulence likely over the next few weeks. 

 The Dow Jones was making modest gains last night but while some US analysts see the potential for growth in the market now others remain concerned about the continuing weakness of the economy and the failure of the Federal Reserve's half percentage interest rate cut at the beginning of the week to stimulate demand. 

 John Forelli, of Independent Investment Associates in New York, said: "There is a general feeling in the market place right now that the Dow Jones and the old economy names might have more downside near-term than the Nasdaq because the Nasdaq has come down far faster." 

 The bravest man in the market yesterday was Gerry Ford, who launched his Caffe Nero coffee bar chain on the London market, the only new listing in the past two weeks. The issue raised #9million for the firm's expansion plans.

Kingspan shocked by 'crazy' market move

Nearly 20 per cent was wiped off the value of building products group,  Kingspan, last week after the company conceded that the downturn in the US could affect the growth prospects of its recently acquired raised access flooring subsidiary, Tate Global.   

Analysts were amazed by the intensity of the reaction by the already jittery markets to the comments, which were made by chairman and chief executive Eugene Murtagh.  Kingspan had good reason to have been stunned by the reaction to Murtagh's statement, which accompanied a very healthy set of results for the year to the end of last December.   

Profit before tax was e67.5 million, up 15 per cent on the previous year. Earnings per share (EPS) were up 12 per cent at e0.30.  Kingspan has proposed a dividend of e0.03, up 45 per cent on 1999.   

Shares in  Kingspan fell 40 cents last Tuesday following Murtagh's remarks. The stock slumped by 65 cents on Wednesday and continued its rapid southwards progress during the rest of the week. The shares closed last Friday at e3.50, down e0.80 on the week.   

Eugene Murtagh described the market reaction as "crazy". "We are not very pleased with where the share price has gone since. We were not expecting such a dramatic drop," he told The Sunday Business Post.   

Murtagh claimed that the market response was excessive because only 15 per cent of Tate's turnover last year came from sales to the data centre market, which is highly exposed to a slowdown in the US economy. The other 85 per cent of Tate's turnover comes from the high rise office market, which  Kingspan expects will be less effected by the downturn.   

"We are not a supplier to the dotcom sector," said Murtagh. " Kingspan are a buildings material group. Everybody is running away from everything at the moment, I don't think it was necessarily  Kingspan. We were punished for making a statement that we maybe didn't need to make."   

Although it was not included in last year's accounts, Tate would have contributed 32 per cent to overall group turnover. The group's overall exposure to the data centre market in the US is less than 5 per cent.   

In addition, Murtagh said the company envisaged achieving significantly increased sales of its raised access flooring in the US, despite the economic slowdown in that market.   

Analysts downgraded their forecasts for  Kingspan on the back of smaller-than-expected turnover from Tate. Davy Stockbrokers analyst Florence O'Donoghue reduced his EPS target for the year by 3 per cent to e0.40.   

Describing the share price reaction as "way overdone", O'Donoghue said the suggestion from the market was that a profit warning would be forthcoming at the interim stage of the year. However, O'Donoghue said he thought this was unlikely.   

James Forbes, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers, described the company's decision to make the statement as "the sensible approach". Although he revised his EPS target for the current year downwards to e0.40 from e0.41, Forbes said the market reaction was totally unwarranted and the company's strategy would keep it in a very strong position.

 Stock market `carnage' as fears of recession trigger panic-selling.

 THE LONDON stock market went into freefall yesterday when a bout of panic selling triggered the largest one-day drop for more than 13 years. 

 More than #52bn was wiped off the value of the UK's 100 biggest companies, amid mounting fears that Britain will be hit hard by the looming recession in America. 

 The index of blue chip shares, the FTSE 100, plunged by 225 points, or 4.1 per cent, to close at 5,314. The drop was the steepest in percentage terms since "Black Monday" in October 1987. The index is now at its lowest level since the global financial crisis in October 1998. 

 Shares have now lost 23 per cent of their value since the market peaked at 6,930 in a pre-millennial frenzy on 30 December 1999. 

 "We have seen a day of carnage," said Nick Stamenkovic, an analyst at the investment bank Nomura International in the City. "A time of greed has turned into a time of fear. There is nothing to stop it carrying on falling." 

 Steve Russell, of HSBC, added: "We have seen widespread panic selling across the board. This is a capitulation by the markets." He warned that the FTSE 100 could fall as low as 4,700. A leading City stockbroker, who asked not to be named, said: "Bank offices may have sealed windows these days, but there will still be traders anxiously looking at the window ledge." 

 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index of US industrial giants was 329 points, or 3.5 per cent, down in morning trading, although by early afternoon it had recovered to a deficit of 260 points at 9,226. It is now more than 20 per cent off its peak. 

 The gloom over the global economy was exacerbated by a spate of profit warnings and job cut announcements on both sides of the Atlantic. In Britain, a number of companies said they were starting to feel the impact. 

 Economists said the stock market crunch could lead to a slowdown in economic growth and rising unemployment if businesses decide to cut back on investment. An economic slump would be a blow to the Government because it could prevent it from delaying the election for fear of polling day falling as a recession is felt. 

 The Confederation of British Industry said the American slowdown was hitting UK manufacturers' order books. Kate Barker, the CBI chief econo-mist, said: "The US slowdown may have a more serious impact on the UK than first predicted. The Bank of England should cut interest rates by a quarter-point to prevent this turning into anything nasty." 

 The Bank's monetary policy committee cut rates from 6 to 5.75 per cent in February, citing worries over the US economy. Earlier this month, however, it voted 7-2 to keep them on hold, saying Britain still looked "robust". The US Federal Reserve has cut rates by 1.5 percentage points since the start of the year, but this had done little to calm worries on Wall Street. 

 There were sharp falls in stock markets across the globe on growing fears that the world economy might grind to a halt. European stocks tumbled, sending benchmark indexes to one-year lows in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden. 

 The grim news for profits and jobs came from firms across the economy. Procter & Gamble, the biggest consumer products firm in America, announced 9,600 job cuts, or 9 per cent of its global workforce. It said 60 per cent of the cuts would fall outside America but did not reveal the implications for British employees. 

 Charles Schwab, an internet stockbroking giant, said it was scrapping up to 13 per cent of its US workforce, and warned that job cuts could follow here. Invensys, a British engineering group, issued its second profit warning in six months and said it would cut an extra 2,000 jobs, taking the total cull to 5,000. 

 The London broadcaster Capital Radio said its advertising revenue had fallen as clients started to cut costs. Its shares dropped 24 per cent after it warned of a 10 per cent fall in profits.

 BLACK clouds again hung over world markets yesterday, with the Australian market retreating 1 per cent to a pre-Christmas low. 

 Wall Street led the retreat, despite this week's interest rate cut. 

 The hi-tech Nasdaq slipped 27.21 points, but the blue-chip laden Dow Jones proved most vulnerable to investor whims. 

 It dropped to a two-year low. 

 And in early European trading last night, the Australian dollar slumped to a record low of US48.92 after finishing locally at US49.33. 

 On the Australian share market, there was a slight movement to defensive sectors including alcohol and tobacco, food and household and resources. 

 Nevertheless, brokers' screens were again covered in red. 

 The All Ordinaries index was down 34.6 points to 3135.8 at the close, while the ASX 200 dropped 36.5 points to 3188.8. 

 Despite widespread expectations interest rates will fall further, banks were among the heaviest hit yesterday. 

 The "big four" banks all lost between 2.5 per cent and 4.4 per cent. 

 Resources proved more resilient. 

 Topsy-turvy BHP was 44.2 better to $20.65 while Rio Tinto added 68.4 to $34.484. 

 Austock Brokers' research analyst Robert Frost said a series of profit downgrades both here and in the US was adding to the uncertainty. 

 "But sometimes people overreact," he said. 

 Mr Frost said all recent indications pointed to a slowing in the global economy. 

 "It's a global fear that economies have slowed a lot faster than expected. 

 "People are simply fleeing stocks." 

 Few stocks yesterday were hit as hard as diversified industrial Austrim, which plunged 30 per cent to its lowest point since September 1995 in response to a profit warning late on Wednesday. 

 It crawled back from its intraday low of 72 to close at 74. 

 Mr Frost said some of Austrim's businesses were vulnerable to the economic cycle. 

 "But I am a bit surprised they were treated so harshly," he said. 

 "They have been talking for some time that the outlook is bleak." 

 Mr Frost noted that Austrim would still pay an end-of-year dividend, making it a cheap buy at present prices. 

 Overseas, the Tokyo Nikkei was off 62 points and the Hang Seng lost 426 points.

 BLUE CHIPS REBOUND ON THE BACK OF WALL STREET RECOVERY...

 BY JANE PADGHAMLondon shares rebounded after yesterday's torrid session, taking heart from Wall Street's recovery last night.The FTSE 100 index shrugged off a clutch of profit warnings to leap 108.9 points to 5423.7 in the first 90 minutes of trading. But analysts branded the bounce "an unsustainable bear rally which won't last". The pound jumped two-thirds of a cent to $1.4265.Among the profit-warning casualties was Scoot.com, which said its losses had deepened to #71.5 million and it had appointed Merrill Lynch to conduct a strategic review. Interactive Investor, a financial website, said it was in talks which could lead to its sale. Pig breeder PIC International was the latest company to say it would be hit by the foot and mouth outbreak. Richard Crehan, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said: "We're getting profit warnings at a rate of about two a day at the moment, which is comparable with 1998 when we last looked to be going into recession. 

  The industrial and consumer sectors have not yet peaked in terms of profit warnings, which means there's more bad news to come."Tokyo shares also spurted higher. The Nikkei 225 index closed up 360.57 points at 13,214.54, a gain of nearly 3%.

 PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: A positive end to a negative week for the Dow. The Blue Chip Average makes a triple-digit move to the upside, gaining 115 points. The NASDAQ Index gains 31 points. Good evening, I`m Paul Kangas in Miami. 

 SUSIE GHARIB, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And I`m Susie Gharib in New York City. Our market guest tonight is bullish on certain sectors of the market. We talk with Elaine Garzarelli, portfolio manager of the Forward Funds. Then, there`s a silver lining in the cloud of California`s energy problems-at least for companies that build power plants. We`ll explain. 

 GHARIB: Good evening, everyone. Wall Street ended a horrific week with a rally. The Dow jumped 115 points, and the NASDAQ rose 31. But for the week, the Blue Chip Average plunged more than 300 points, or 3 percent. Now, while the stock market`s show of strength was encouraging today, analysts are still cautious about saying that the selling is over, and individual investors are also playing it safe. We have two reports this evening, beginning with Erika Miller in New York. 

 ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Today`s session was a glimmer of hope for shell-shocked investors-after this week`s brutal sell-off. The Dow clawed further away from the bears` den as investors snapped up financial, retail and tech names. And the NASDAQ has been showing new signs of life. It gained more than 2 percent this week. 

 MARTY CUNNINGHAM, TRADING DIR., SCHWAB CAPITAL MARKETS: You`d love to see a volume day over and above two billion, with a close above 2000. But, look, we`ve needed a shot in the arm, and I`m happy it`s here. Lets not try to get even in a given day. Let`s hope we can get some sort of sustained activity. 

 MILLER: That`s small consolation to battered investors, many of whom have watched their stocks plunge to new lows. The Dow is still down about 12 percent this year, while the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ have fallen even more. But investment strategist, Joe Battipaglia says the outlook is favorable. 

 JOSEPH BATTIPAGLIA, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, GRUNTAL & CO.: The fundamental drivers behind a bull market are now working in our favor once again, and that is: interest rates, diminishing expectations on inflation, an administration that is looking to put tax dollars back in the hands of the public. 

 MILLER: He`s recommending investors look for industry leaders, trading at bargain prices. Among his top picks are Citigroup , Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE). But other`s aren`t so quick to say stocks are poised for a sharp rebound. 

 TIMOTHY GHRISKEY, PORTFOLIO MGR., THE DREYFUS FUND: Clearly, you know, we have problems in the market-the main one being the economy. There is no visibility on the economy. We don`t know when this economic downturn is going to bottom, and when the recovery is going to start-and how sharp a recovery it is. 

 MILLER: Still, Ghriskey says he sees buying opportunities for long-term investors, including Sears (S), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Micron Technology (MU). Experts stress the market`s bottoming is a process, not a one-day event. That means investors should not be surprised if stocks continue their wild ride, and test this weeks lows, again. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 JEFF YASTINE, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: This is Jeff Yastine. It`s been a rough week for small investors at this trading house, Shochet Securities, in Hallandale Beach, Florida. Most days you`ll find men and women, mostly retirees, watching the ticker and checking stock prices. And despite the week`s declines, Ted Karegianes is still bullish. 

 TED KAREGIANES, INVESTOR: I think yesterday was a good time to buy. When everybody throws in a towel-they get disgusted, they get depressed-that`s when you got to step in and buy. 

 YASTINE: Outside the NASDAQ market site on Times Square, a different opinion. People may have some fear, and yet most say they have not sold their mutual funds. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now is the worst time to cash out. I feel like if there`s got to be-except for x-amount of money that we have to have in the next couple of weeks, we`re just going to try and wait for it to recover a little bit. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I just think it`s a cycle-you know, it will swing back up eventually. 

 YASTINE: Similar opinions in the nation`s capital. 

 HARVEY RIECKELMAN, INVESTOR: I was a genius a year ago, like everybody else-but now I`m an idiot, so. I guess I`m just not going to do anything. 

 YASTINE: But it might be wise not to wait too long. Brokerage manager, Stuart Itzkowitz has been fielding phone calls from clients all week. And some of them are waiting, too. 

 STUART ITZKOWITZ, BRANCH MGR., SHOCHET SECURITIES: The ones who haven`t sold and switched their mutual funds-the aggressive mutual funds into more conservative funds haven`t-they`re waiting for the market to come back. 

 But I think, listening to them talk, they`ve learned their lesson. And as soon as they can realize some 

 assets out of these funds, I think they`re going to re-deploy them. 

 YASTINE: Itzkowitz says those clients are realizing they can`t expect large percentage gains each year-a hard lesson taught by the bear market. Jeff Yastine, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Hallandale Beach, Florida. 

 KANGAS: Stocks on Wall Street opened moderately higher today, thanks to carryover buying from yesterday`s late rally, which cut a 380-point deficit in the Dow Industrial Average to a closing loss of only 97 points. At the outset of trading, the Dow rose 74 points, and the NASDAQ Index added 54 points to its 67-point gain yesterday. But those traders who doubted that yesterday`s blue chip rebound was a major bottom sold into the early strength, and just before 10:30 this morning, the Dow fell to a 50-point loss, putting it in bear territory again-meaning over 20 percent below its record high. Once again, however, buyers came to the rescue, and just before noontime, the Industrial Average was up 70 points. When the NASDAQ Index faded a few points into the minus column in early afternoon, so did the Dow. But the bulls charged to the rescue again and got another rally going, which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a closing gain of 115.30 points, or 1.2 percent and it now stands at 9504.78. 

 This week, the Dow rose twice and fell three times-had an overall loss of 318.63 points, or 3.2 percent. The NASDAQ Composite today rose 30.98 points, closing at 1928.68. This week, the Composite Index fell twice and rose three times-and had an average overall gain-or an overall gain of 37.77 points. 

 Big board volume today dropped well below yesterday`s which was the third highest on record. But look at the up volume over the down volume, what a switch from what we saw earlier in the week-three times as much up volume and then some. 

 The Dow Transport Index up nearly 13 points. 

 Utilities rebounding 2.82. 

 And the Closing Tick moderately bullish at +435. 

 Standard & Poor`s 500 up 22 1/4 points exactly. 

 Just over a 13-point rise in the S&P 100. 

 The MidCap 400 up nearly 11 1/4. 

 And the Bridge Futures Price Index gained 1.39. 

 An 11 1/2-point rise in the New York Composite. 

 The Value Line Index rising nearly 7. 

 The Russell2000 Small Cap Index up nearly 10 1/2 points. 

 The Broadly-Based Wilshire 5000 up just about 213 1/2 points, or 2.1 percent. 

 Profit-taking hit the bond market today after the stock market turbulence earlier in the week sent yields down to two-year lows as investors sought safe haven in the debt market. Today`s steady stock market performance was a bit undermining for bonds, as was a rise in New York oil futures. So, the result: tax free and corporates ended down 3/8s to 1/2 point on average. 

 And the Treasury market fell across the board. 

 The 5-year notes dropping 9/32. 

 The 10-year note down 18/32, bringing the yield back up to 4.81 percent. 

 And the 30-year bond down 1/2 point, with the yield at 

 5.31 percent. 

 The Lehman Brothers Long-Term Treasury Bond Index fell exactly 11 3/4 points. 

 I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Susie? 

 GHARIB: Paul, more moves for Boeing. The aerospace giant announced plans today to shift some assembly operations for its 757 jets from Seattle to Wichita, Kansas. It comes just two days after Boeing surprised Seattle with news it would move its corporate headquarters to a new city. But Boeing says it`s still committed to building planes in Washington state and that no manufacturing jobs will be lost. 

 Meanwhile, more job cuts in the news today. Motorola is slashing another 4,000 jobs. That brings the total number of cutbacks to 22,000 since December. Motorola blames the layoffs on the slowing economy. 

 3Com (COMS) cites the same reason for staff cuts at its consumer broadband operations. The network equipment maker will lay off 170 workers, or one and a half percent of its staff. 

 KANGAS: The market in another bear hug earlier today, but we pulled out once more. The Dow managed a nice 115.30 gain, 1.2 percent. The broader market nicely higher, almost a 2 to 1 advantage of advances over declines and two more new yearly highs than new lows. 

 General Electric (GE) for the fourth consecutive session topped the active list today on 33.8 million shares. Good rally there, up $2.29. 

 EMC (EMC) edged up $0.30. 

 Pfizer (PFE) was up $1.86 in a strong drug group. 

 And Citigroup led the financials into higher ground with that gain of $2.25. 

 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) up nearly $3. It was up $3.16 yesterday when the company introduced its new Athlon processors. 

 Compaq Computer (CPQ) a nice gain of $1.10. 

 Micron Technology (MU) up $2.13. 

 And then we see Nortel Networks (NT) falling $0.79, one of the few losers in the actives here. 

 Nokia (NOK) had a pretty good day, too, up $1.46. 

 Texas Instruments (TXN) rose $0.94. 

 Bristol-Myers (BMY) up $1.55. Banc of America Brokerage upgraded it from "market perform" to an outright "buy." 

 IBM (IBM) the best point gainer in the Dow, rising $4.40. Buckingham Research upgraded the stock from "accumulate" to a "strong buy" for Big Blue. 

 John Hancock Financial (JHF) up $1.51. Gene Marcial`s "Inside Wall Street" column in the new "BusinessWeek" magazine notes takeover talk about Johnson Hancock and an analyst at Alex Brown sees the stock fetching anywhere from $55 to $60 on a buyout. 

 Procter & Gamble (PG) was the biggest point loser in the Dow, dropping $2.55. Lehman Brothers cut 2002 earnings estimates from $3.36 to $3.25 a share. 

 Waters Corporation (WAT) up $4.25, a pretty good rebound from an $8.50 loss yesterday when the company said it was experiencing negative foreign exchange problems there. But today Alex Brown repeated a "strong buy" on Waters and has a $57 a share, 12 month target. 

 Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) down $2.38 on news that its Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Marketing, Fred 

 Wilkinson, is resigning, and he`s going to go over to Columbia Labs (COB). Bear Stearns downgraded Watson`s stock from "buy" to just "attractive." 

 APW Ltd. (APW), in the electronics parts business, up $2.25. That stock was sharply lower earlier this week. Dropped about $10 on Wednesday when it reported a second quarter loss of $0.15 a share. But First Boston Brokerage today repeated a "buy." 

 Infonet Services (IN) rising $1.01. The company is working with UBS Warburg and Merrill Lynch to explore alternatives, including its possible sale. 

 And Global Crossing (GX) is considered to be one of its suitors. That stock up $2.04. 

 Smithfield Foods (SFD) up $2.52. The latest "Business Week" magazine notes the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in Europe could bring this customer-new customers to this firm. 

 Reliance Steel & Aluminum (RS) up $1.55. BB&T Capital issued a "strong buy" on that one and has a $34 a share, 12 month target. 

 Enodis PLC (ENO), a London based firm, down $3.60. The company issued a first half profit warning and its CEO resigned. It`s in the food equipment business, incidentally. 

 Nasdaq trading, a gain of nearly 31 points in the Index and volume down a bit from yesterday at 2.28 billion shares, and twice as many stocks higher than lower, though. We haven`t seen that in a long time on Nasdaq. 

 Intel (INTC) edged up $0.13. 

 Microsoft (MSFT) doing well, up $2.56. 

 Cisco (CSCO), however, fell $1.06. 

 Applied Materials (AMAT) was up $0.81. The company plans to buy back up to $2 billion worth of its stock and Lehman Brothers today repeated a "strong buy." 

 CIENA (CIEN) down $2.13, fifth in volume. 

 Juniper Networks (JNPR) down $1.94. 

 Dell Computer (DELL) rose $1.19. 

 Oracle (ORCL) edging up $0.38. 

 And Immunex (IMNX) dropped $7.25. The company halted trials for its Enbrel drug to treat heart failure because of poor results there. But it still is very effective, apparently, for the treatment of arthritis. 

 And Sun Microsystems (SUNW) down $0.63, 10th in volume. 

 H.D. Vest (HDVS), look at that percentage gain, 191 percent to the good. Wells Fargo (WFC) is going to acquire this company for $21.03 in cash. H.D. Vest is into financial services. 

 PolyMedica (PLMD) was halted at that price, down $16.69, halted pending news and that news has yet to be issued. 

 And then Packeteer (PKTR) down $2.94. The company sees a $0.06 to $0.08 loss in its first quarter. 

 The American Exchange Index up 19.56 today, but for the week it dropped about 8 1/4 points. 

 Intelli-Check (IDN) up $1.65, the best percentage gainer, even though the company reported a year end loss of $0.47 a share, $0.02 bigger than the previous year`s loss. However, the company is very upbeat on the sales outlook. 

 And then IVAX (IVX) up $2.65. The company expects to exceed the $0.25 per share earnings estimate for the first quarter. 

 And finally, the indexes, well, two pluses and the Nasdaq Cubes (QQQ) stayed unchanged. 

 That`s the Wall Street Wrap Up. Susie? 

 GHARIB: Paul, hearings are underway in California into why the state has such high energy costs. Natural gas costs six times more in California than in other states. But California also faces more electricity shortages this summer, so the race is on to build new power plants. As Pat Anson reports, that`s fueling a boom in the construction industry. 

 PAT ANSON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: California has not completed a major power plant in 11 years but the state is now making up for lost time. Nine new plants are under construction and 14 others are in various stages of the approval process. 

 GARY HOLDSWORTH, ANALYST, WEDBUSH MORGAN: Demand for these kind of engineering services, to get the plants sited, permitted and built, is growing through the roof. Companies are getting lots of inquiries. 

 Building, designing, engineering service companies will do very well as we ramp up in these projects. 

 ANSON: The construction boom is not limited to California. Other states are also scrambling to bring new plants online. Demand is so strong that even the biggest engineering companies say they`re stretched to the limit. 

 JAMES MCNULTY, CEO & CHAIRMAN, PARSONS CORPORATION:  We`re in the position now where from a resource standpoint we`re running pretty close to capacity. And, in fact, for the first time in about five years in the power business we have the wherewithal now to be selective on which plants we bid and which opportunities we pursue, as well as for the first time in a long time we`re seeing our margins increase. 

 ANSON: With each new plant costing between $200 million and $500 million, a lot of money is at stake. And the stock of companies that build power plants have been rising. Since the first of the year, Foster Wheeler (FWC) and the Keith Companies (TKCI) have more than doubled in price, while EMCOR (EME), Jacobs Engineering (JEC) and Fluor Daniel (FLR) have also posted healthy gains. Fluor Daniel started laying the groundwork for the current boom five years ago when a joint venture with Duke Energy (DUK) saw a growing demand for natural gas plants. 

 MALLA REDDY, VICE PRESIDENT, DUKE/FLUOR DANIEL: Business is great right now. We have about over a third of the business in the U.S. for gas fired projects. We see ourselves very bus in the domestic market, in the U.S. domestic market at least for another two to four years from now. 

 ANSON: Almost all of the new power plants being built across the country will be fueled by natural gas. With gas prices already at record highs, many analysts are worried the nation`s increasing reliance on natural gas will drive prices even higher. But the supply and capacity problems in the natural gas industry are seen as a win-win situation by contractors. Many of the companies that build power plants also build refineries and pipelines. Pat Anson, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Los Angeles. 

 KANGAS: Monday, how are commodities faring in this volatile market? We get some answers. 

 GHARIB: The WWF has a new way to beat up on the competition-buy it. The World Wrestling Federation (WWF) is buying its rival World Championship Wrestling from AOL Time Warner`s (AOL) Turner Broadcasting Unit. No price was given. The deal brings together stars like The Rock and Goldberg. As for the stocks, the WWF shares fell a penny to $12.10 today. AOL Time Warner was up $2.75 to $39.52. 

 KANGAS: Barrett Resources (BRR) is keeping its options open. Yesterday it rejected a hostile takeover attempt by Shell Oil. Barrett`s board called Shell`s bid of $55 a share inadequate. Today Barrett says it plans to pursue other options, including a merger, sale of assets or reorganization. Barrett shares were up $0.70 to close at $61.70. 

 GHARIB: Coming up next week, our Friday market monitor guest is Paul Cherney, Chief Real-Time Market Analyst at Standard & Poor`s. Monday, the latest numbers on existing home sales. Tuesday, Fed Chairman Greenspan addresses the National Association for Business Economics. Also, durable goods orders for February come out that day. And on Friday, it`s personal income and spending. 

 KANGAS: My guest market monitor this week is Elaine Garzarelli, Portfolio Manager of the Forward Funds and Chair of Garzarelli Capital, Inc. And welcome back, Elaine. 

 ELAINE GARZARELLI, FORWARD GARZARELLI U.S. EQUITY FUND: Nice to be here. 

 KANGAS: In the past two days buyers have rescued the Dow Industrial Average a number of times from closing in bear market territory, leading a lot of investors to believe we`ve seen a major bottom to the recent blue chip bludgeoning. What do you think? 

 GARZARELLI: Well, we should be, that`s for sure, because my indicators are in bull market territory. This is the highest they`ve been since the bottom in 1998. 

 KANGAS: How high? 

 GARZARELLI: Well they`re at 81 percent and anything above 65 percent is a bull market signal. So they`re above the critical level and they were bearish last year. So this should definitely be bottoming. 

 KANGAS: What if the Dow did close maybe even just slightly in bearish ground? Would that make any difference in your investment strategy? 

 GARZARELLI: Not at all. Oh, no, not at all. 

 KANGAS: Not at all. 

 GARZARELLI: Just give you another gift to get in. 

 KANGAS: A gift, OK. What makes you so positive? 

 GARZARELLI: Oh, my goodness. Well, the Fed is easing, and every time-this is interesting. We went back to 1933 and checked, after the Fed eased three times. The Dow has always gone up over the next 12 months and the average gain is 30 percent. So It`s never failed. 

 KANGAS: So your outlook for the economy is equally as positive, even though we`re seeing signs of recession? 

 GARZARELLI: Well, the reason we had the last leg down in the stock market beginning in late January is because earnings came out and were reported at the end of January for the fourth quarter. It surprised the Street because the S&P earnings were down 22 percent and that was a shock. So the markets plummeted. But I think that in the second half of this year and into 2002 we should have a recovery. But the first half will probably see S&P earnings down 10 to 15 percent. And maybe we`re in a recession, but that doesn`t matter either because the average recession is 11 months and assuming it started last October and ends this September, the market should bottom sometime in March or April, six months before. 

 KANGAS: Right. Well, speaking of Last October 20th, you were with us then. The Dow was at 10,002 and you allowed that, you know, we were sort of bullish, not super. Your indicators were at 60. And we did get to the 11,000 area before we went down. But some of the stocks you liked, Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel (INTC), McDonald`s (MCD) sort of look like a who`s who on the new yearly low lists now. Did you lighten up when it got to 11,000 on down? 

 GARZARELLI: Well, the two stocks, Intel and Texas Instruments, dropped further, but they were-they didn`t drop as much as the NASDAQ. Actually, they outperformed the Nasdaq by two times. 

 KANGAS: Yes, true. And what do you think about those now? 

 GARZARELLI: Oh, boy, they`re really great now. If I liked them then, I sure like them now. But we were still in the bear market then. My indicators hadn`t gone to bullish. 

 KANGAS: And in all honesty, some of your recommendations did very well through this period. Occidental (OXY), Chevron (CHV) are up. Bank of America (BAC) nicely higher. Centex (CTX) is up nicely. Are you still with those? 

 GARZARELLI: Yes, I am. 

 KANGAS: OK. 

 GARZARELLI: And actually, the stocks that I mentioned to you last time, excluding the two techs, were down less than one percent, where the S&P was down over 20. 

 KANGAS: You also liked Comerica (CMA) and Chase Manhattan (JPM). 

 GARZARELLI: Right. 

 KANGAS: Both of them were bought out. 

 GARZARELLI: Right. 

 KANGAS: And I`m sure you did well. What do you like in the way of new recommendations here? 

 GARZARELLI: Well, I like a lot of them. First of all, the techs and Intel, definitely. And two more stocks that are in technology would be a Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Oracle (ORCL). They`re way down. I still like Philip Morris (MO), a good yield and has a very strong outperformance potential. Masco (MAS), which is in building materials, does very well at this stage of the cycle. I like Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Bear Stearns (BSC) and Citigroup (C) and a more cyclical type industry, in the more cyclical area, Liz Claiborne (LIZ) and Hilton Hotels (HLT). 

 KANGAS: What would you avoid here? Not much by the sound of it. 

 GARZARELLI: No, I would. I would avoid a lot. I would avoid the groups that did well last year, a lot of the defensive areas, and those would be the soft drinks, the alcoholic beverages, electric utilities. Anything that`s considered defensive and held up very well last year, there`s going to be a complete switch because the earnings for those industries will only grow maybe nine, 10 percent in 2002 and the S&P is going to recover 14 percent. So you want to get in those sectors and you`ll have earnings grow superior to 14. 

 KANGAS: Right. So here we are, very selective again, right Elaine? 

 GARZARELLI: Well, you go with consumer cyclicals and you go with financials. That`s basically it. 

 KANGAS: OK. Very good. Elaine, thanks very much for being with us again. 

 GARZARELLI: It`s my pleasure. Thanks. 

 KANGAS: My guest, Elaine Garzarelli, Portfolio Manager of the Forward Funds. 

 GHARIB: And recapping today`s market action, a relief rally. The Dow gains 115 points and the NASDAQ adds 31. 

 And please be sure to join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com. 

 GHARIB: And finally, have you ever wondered where the bear in the bear market came from? The terms bull and bear came into use in the 18th century in London when stock trading became popular. The two animals were seen as opposites-bulls toss opponents up with their horns and bears claw fruit and honey down through the trees. And, Paul, the traditional definition of a bear market, as you know, is a 20 percent drop in stock prices, but one analyst says it`s "when it hurts looking at the stock tables in the morning newspaper." 

 KANGAS: It`s true. You know, rather than knowing where the bear came from, I want to know where he`s going. 

 GHARIB: When is he going to be gone? 

 KANGAS: Right. 

 GHARIB: Go back into hibernation. 

 KANGAS: Absolutely. 

 GHARIB: That`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Friday, March 23rd. I`m Susie Gharib. Have a great weekend, everyone. And I hope you do, too, Paul. 

 KANGAS: Same to you, Susie. I`m Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.

 ASIA/PACIFIC  

 China to Consolidate  

 Cable, TV Networks  

 In State Enterprise  

 China plans to consolidate all of its cable-television and broadcast-TV networks into a single state-owned enterprise this year, the country's broadcast regulator confirmed. Separating network assets from content creators may set the stage for private-sector and eventually foreign investment in cable networks, analysts said. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television's vice director announced the plan in Beijing, state media reported. Cable and television stations in China and their associated networks are currently owned by local governments. The restructuring plan calls for the state agency essentially to buy out local owners and bring the networks under its control.  

 "Separating out the [politically sensitive] content side increases Sarft's ability to raise the necessary capital to upgrade the networks, and makes it easier for them to approve investment by outside entities," said Mark Mechem, a consultant with Claydon-Gescher Associates. Foreign investment in cable networks is illegal and is likely to remain so for now, he said.  

 Sinar Mas Plan for APP Meets Skepticism  

 Indonesian conglomerate Sinar Mas said it expects to draw up a debt-restructuring proposal in one month for its Asia Pulp & Paper unit. But foreign bondholders expressed skepticism over the move to restructure APP's $11.6 billion in debt and said they feared being sidelined in a scramble for assets. A spokesman for Sinar Mas said the government had given a one-month deadline for the restructuring proposal. His comments were the first confirmation that Sinar Mas intends to restructure APP's debts. APP is Asia's largest pulp and paper company outside Japan, and is listed in Singapore and New York. The Sinar Mas spokesman said APP would soon hold discussions on a restructuring proposal with its financial advisers, Credit Suisse First Boston. APP's creditors would then be informed of the plan, he said, without giving more details. A Sinar Mas spokeswoman said Sinar Mas would guarantee that all APP creditors receive equal treatment in the restructuring. But the statements failed to placate foreign investors, who hold the bulk of APP's debt. Many bondholders are concerned about the role of the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency, which has guaranteed $1.3 billion in Sinar Mas debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia, a bank once owned by Sinar Mas. The government in turn has demanded that Sinar Mas pledge assets, including those of APP, to cover those debts. Analysts say more than half of Sinar Mas's debt to BII comes from APP.  

 Jakarta Aims to Limit Lost Exxon Output  

 Indonesia's government has suffered $10 million in losses since Exxon Mobil's Indonesian unit shut down operations in troubled Aceh province two weeks ago, according to Baihaki Hakim, president director of state-owned oil and natural-gas company Pertamina. "The losses are set to soar to $100 million if the company can't resume production until April," he told reporters. The losses underscore the growing economic cost of rising unrest in Indonesia. The country can ill afford the shutdown of Exxon Mobil's Aceh operations, which has forced customers in the region to scramble for new sources of gas. Mr. Baihaki said Pertamina would take over the operation of Exxon Mobil's plants in Aceh if the company's local unit is still reluctant to resume operations after the security situation improves.

 U.K. Retail Sales Rise at Next, Selfridges  

 British retailers Next and Selfridges both reported strong sales early this year, bucking the trend of lackluster sales in much of the country's clothing market. The strong sales surprised analysts and pushed Next shares up 9%, while shares of Selfridges rose 4.6% in London trading. Retail sales at Next rose 18% for the first seven weeks of 2001 compared with a year earlier. Selfridges, which is reaping the rewards of the recent GBP 100 million ($143 million) refurbishment of its flagship Oxford Street store in London, reported an 11% increase in group sales for the year's first six weeks. For the 53 weeks ended Feb. 3, Selfridges reported pretax profit rose 40% to GBP 38.6 million, as sales grew 9% to GBP 392.1 million. For the year ended Jan. 28, Next's pretax profit rose 12% to GBP 218.4 million, as sales increased 11% to GBP 1.58 billion.  

 Gucci Results Stronger Than Expected  

 Italian fashion house Gucci Group, boosted by strong demand for luxury goods, posted better-than-expected results for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 and stuck with its 2001 forecasts despite the global economy's current slowdown. The world's third-largest luxury-goods company beat analysts' expectations with diluted earnings per share of $3.31, exceeding its own target of $3.10. Gucci's profit rose 2% to $337 million, weighed down by the cost of restructuring the raft of companies it has acquired since 1999 in a bid to become a multibrand company. Revenue rose 83% to $2.26 billion, while operating profit before goodwill and trademark amortization was up 49%. The core Gucci brand posted a 26% increase in sales to $1.5 billion, and accounted for a major share of the group's operating profit. French retailer Pinault Printemps Redoute holds a controlling 42% stake in Gucci that is currently the subject of a legal challenge by rival LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.  

 Elektrim Holders Seek Board Reshuffle

 Chile's Retail Sales Decline 1.7%  

 Chile's retail sales, which have lagged behind the country's broader economic recovery, fell 1.7% from a year earlier in February, the National Chamber of Commerce said. "This is not good news," said Fernando Lihn, the chamber's president. "It shows that we are far from recovery." He attributed the drop to stagnant consumer spending. Chile's economy grew by 5.4% last year, as the country pulled out of a recession, but weak consumer spending and high unemployment have persisted.  

 Castro, Former Foes Revisit Bay of Pigs  

 Cuban President Fidel Castro met former Cold War adversaries briefly in Havana, as the two sides came together in an attempt to look dispassionately at the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs landing in Cuba, which has shaped U.S.-Cuban relations since then. Mr. Castro made his appearance as former advisers to U.S. President Kennedy, ex-Central Intelligence Agency operatives, members of the invasion team made up of Cuban exiles and retired members of the Cuban military opened three days of meetings. The Havana leader made no public statement.

 United Parcel Service Inc., acknowledging a much sharper economic downturn than it anticipated only two months ago, said its profit in the first and second quarters would fall short of previous estimates. The warning is the parcel delivery giant's second in three months. UPS said growth of its U.S. deliveries slowed to about 1 per cent in January and February, down from a 2.8-per-cent increase in the fourth quarter. UPS said it now expects profit of 49 to 51 cents (U.S.) a diluted share in the first quarter. For the second quarter, it sees a range of 55 to 60 cents a share, unless the economy picks up. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected profit of about 57 cents in the first quarter and 64 cents in the second. UPS shares fell $1.81, or 4.5 per cent, to $55.89 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.

 * Icahn Pledges $400 Million to Buy or Build Airline 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn on Thursday said he would make $400 million in financing available for his Lowestfare.com Web site to buy or build an airline, after losing its profitable stream of deeply discounted Trans World Airlines Inc. tickets. "In that we have three-and-a-half million customers at Lowestfare.com, and therefore a distribution channel in place, we think it's a great opportunity for a low-cost, well-capitalized airline," Icahn told Reuters in an interview Thursday. 

 Icahn said he is thinking of going up against an "entrenched" carrier in a major city, where the new airline could court both business and leisure travelers by offering lower fares. He declined to elaborate further on his plans, but sources familiar with the situation said Icahn has no love for American Airlines, which won a court's approval to cancel Icahn's TWA agreement as part of its $742 million purchase of the troubled carrier. The sources also said Icahn is considering going up against American in its Dallas-Fort Worth hub. 

 * Planes Make Emergency Landings in New York, Denver 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Passenger planes in New York and Denver made emergency landings on Thursday after a fire was reported in the engine of one aircraft and a tire blew on the other. No injuries were reported in either case. In New York, a United Airlines Boeing 767 plane with 119 passengers and crew on board made an emergency landing at about 9 a.m. (1400 GMT) shortly after take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The pilot of United Airlines Flight 23 bound for Los Angeles safely returned the aircraft to the terminal. 

 "As it was departing the runway, there was a report of flames coming out of engine number two and as a precautionary measure the pilot brought the plane back," said spokesman Greg Trevor of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the region's major airports. "The aircraft taxied to the terminal under its own power and is being evaluated." Trevor said there were no reports of any injuries to the 110 passengers or nine crew members, who left Kennedy on another flight at 10:40 a.m. (1540 GMT) Spokeswoman Whitney Staley of United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp, said an "engine compressor stall caused a backfire in the engine." 

 In Colorado on Thursday, an American Airlines flight to San Jose, California, made an emergency landing minutes after taking off from Denver International Airport, but airport officials said all 131 on board were safe. The plane took off around 10:15 a.m. (12:15 p.m. EST/1700 GMT) and immediately blew out a tire whose parts then flew into the left engine, airport spokesman Steve Snyder said. The plane immediately returned to the airport. 

 * Court Says TWA Cannot Move Assets out of Israel 

 JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Tel Aviv District Court issued an injunction prohibiting Trans World Airways (TWA) from making any changes to its assets or moving any of its assets out of Israel, the Globes business daily reported on Thursday evening. The newspaper said the injunction would remain in force until a hearing, which is scheduled for next Sunday. The injunction petition came from TWA employees who, according to Globes, "received several telegrams from the company's management in the United States containing some unusual orders to send to the United States a series of spare parts and components worth an estimated $200,000." 

 TWA workers in Israel have been up in arms over the past month, when it became known that TWA's New York-Tel Aviv route would end after more than 54 years in service. American Airlines, which bought most of TWA's assets, has said it will not continue the route due to economic reasons. TWA workers said the route is profitable. "TWA is attempting to move its property and assets in Israel out of the reach of its creditors, especially the company's workers in Israel," Globes said, citing the injunction. The court said TWA can move any assets needed for the regular operation of flights. 

 * British Charter Makes Emergency Landing in Azores 

 LISBON (Reuters) - A British charter plane bound for the West Indies carrying 128 passengers made an emergency landing with engine trouble in Portugal's mid-Atlantic Azores islands on Thursday, airport officials said. They said the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, flying from London to Barbados, landed safely at Lajes airport on Terceira Island with the faulty engine switched off. It was not immediately known how long repairs to the three-engined plane, belonging to British West Indies airways, would take. 

 * Strikes at Lufthansa Stop 100 Flights 

 FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Workers at German national carrier Lufthansa AG held limited strikes nation-wide on Friday as a warning to the company over the progress of pay talks, stopping roughly 100 flights and affecting 10,000 passengers, the airline said. The strikes ended by midmorning and the airline said flights would be back to normal by the afternoon. The strikes occurred prior to further negotiations on Friday between workers' unions and the airline. Lufthansa has offered a 2.6 percent salary increase and a profit-sharing deal in which employees would receive a one-time bonus amounting to 1.6 percent of annual salary. Unions representing the workers say the offer is too low. 

 * Shandong Airlines to Add 10 Boeing 737s 

 SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shandong Airlines Co, one of China's leading regional carriers, said on Friday it plans to add 10 Boeing 737-800s as part of a long-term expansion plan that would double its fleet size. The Shenzhen-listed carrier would also buy 10 Bombardier CRJ-700 if China's state planning commission approved, a company official said but gave no timetable for either plan. Early this month, Shandong Airlines said in its 2000 annual results announcement it planned to add B737-800 aircraft to boost the frequency of flights and Bombardier CRJ-700 regional jets to increase feeder line capacity this year but gave few details. 

 "We are planning to add 10 B737-800s, although other details like when or how much costs have not been worked out yet," an airline spokesman told Reuters on Friday. He declined to say whether the carrier, based in Jinan city in the eastern province of Shandong, would lease or buy the Boeings. With a current fleet of 18, Shandong Airline reported net profits grew 12 percent in 2000 to 93.13 million yuan ($11.25 million) under domestic accounting standards, due to increased flight traffic despite narrower operating margins. 

 * Pacific Islands Watch Mir Blaze Final Trail 

 NADI, Fiji (Reuters) - The fiery remains of Russian space icon Mir roared over the South Pacific nation of Fiji on Friday, treating viewers to a spectacular show as the superheated fragments streaked across the sky to a watery grave. "We saw five or six fragments with a huge smoke trail that lasted for 10 to 15 seconds. Followed some time later by a couple of sonic booms," said Reuters photographer Mark Baker. "It was above our heads, below the clouds. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience." 

 Russian mission control said the 15-year-old space station had successfully completed a "triumphant mission" after splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. Australian officials said they believed all the debris ended up in the Pacific spacejunk graveyard, halfway between Chile and Australia. Emergency Management Australia managing director David Templeman put Mir's watery grave at 160 degrees West, 40 degrees South, or 5,800 km (3,600 miles) off the eastern coast of Australia and in an area far from the nearest population center. 

 * Mediators Offer Arbitration in Delta Pilot Talks 

 ATLANTA (Reuters) - The labor talks between Delta Air Lines Inc. and its pilots union entered a new phase on Thursday, when the National Mediation Board offered arbitration in the negotiations, possibly setting the stage for a strike countdown. In a news release, Delta, the No. 3 U.S. airline, said it immediately accepted the proffer. The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents about 10,000 Delta pilots in the contract talks, said in a news release late Thursday that it would consider the proffer at a meeting scheduled to begin on March 29. 

 Under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations in the airline industry, if either party rejects the proffer of arbitration, a 30-day cooling-off period prior to a strike would begin. If both parties accept, talks would continue under arbitration. Delta and its pilots union began contract talks in September 1999. The pilots, mindful of a 1996 concessionary contract, are seeking improved pay, job security and other benefits. Their current contract became amendable in May 2000. Delta's news release said it would accept binding arbitration on all unresolved issues because "it is in the best interest of the traveling public." 

 * Union Head Sees More Talks with Northwest 

 PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The head of the union that represents Northwest Airlines Corp.'s mechanics said on Thursday that contract talks may resume soon between his organization and the fourth-largest U.S. carrier. Nearly two weeks after President George W. Bush intervened to avert a threatened strike, a special presidential emergency board (PEB) ended 3-1/2 days of closed-door hearings and told the two sides that it will recommend a settlement to the president by April 11. 

 The law would allow the union to stage a walkout on May 11, and union officials vowed to strike if the PEB settlement recommendation fails to address the mechanics' demands for improved wages, pension benefits and back pay. But O.V. Delle-Femine, national director of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA), told Reuters that board chairwoman Helen Witt also urged the airline and the union to resume talks and reach their own tentative agreement before her three-member panel issues its decision next month. 

 * Analysts Downplay Strike Threat at Delta 

 ATLANTA (Reuters) - As Delta Air Lines Inc. and its pilots union continue to negotiate a labor pact, some analysts said on Thursday that the possibility of a strike at the No. 3 U.S. carrier was increasingly unlikely. Earlier this week, negotiators for Delta and the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta's about 10,000 pilots, reached tentative agreements on a few technical issues, including travel expenses and leaves of absences. 

 "We have made progress on some minor issues, but there are still major issues to be resolved," said Karen Miller, an ALPA spokeswoman. Topics still to be worked out include compensation, retirement and job security. Still, analysts played down a strike threat. "We're not close to any work stoppage," said James Higgins of Credit Suisse First Boston, who added "there's a 100 percent chance there'll be an agreement" eventually. Higgins noted that the National Mediation Board has not released the two sides from negotiations, a step that could set the stage for a strike countdown. "The two sides don't appear to be at an impasse," Higgins said. 

 * Korea Officials Meet to Avert Strike at New Airport 

 SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean transport officials summoned executives of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines on Friday to try and avert a strike that threatens to cripple plans to open Asia's newest airport next week. Union officials said some 16,500 unionized workers were ready to go out on strike, almost half the total workforce at Korean Air, Asiana Airlines and Korea Airport Service Corporation. "If the government does not accept our suggestions, we will launch a general strike on April 2," union spokesman Min Sung-ki told Reuters. 

 The workers have also threatened partial walkouts to cripple the official opening of the 5.8 trillion won ($4.46 billion) Incheon International Airport on March 29. Unionized workers are demanding an almost 50 percent cut in tolls they will be forced to pay on a new highway to get to their jobs at the airport, about 40 km (25 miles) west of Seoul. Executives from the two airlines and Korea Airport Service Corporation met Ministry of Construction and Transportation officials, a ministry spokesman said. The outcome of the meetings was not immediately available. 

 * Cyprus Might Team Up with Euro Carrier for Olympic 

 NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus Airways may team up with a European airline to bid for a controlling stake in Greece's Olympic Airways, its chairman was quoted as saying on Friday. Cyprus Airways could not exclude the possibility of a "major European airline" joining the consortium it was putting together, Haris Loizides told the Cyprus Mail. "We need the expertise of a bigger airline to come in, but the Cyprus Airways element will be instrumental," Loizides told the newspaper. 

 It is the first time Cyprus Airways have disclosed they may be talking to other carriers about Olympic. Company officials have scrupulously avoided mentioning any of their potential partners. "Right now we have four or five commitments but we are waiting for the completion of our business plan at the end of next week when certain people will give us certain answers," said Loizides. Greece is offering 51-65 percent of Olympic, which the government, banned by European Union law from giving further financial assistance, says needs to be sold to survive. 

 * Protestors Gather Against Fifth Schiphol Runway 

 AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Around 75 protestors gathered at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Friday to demonstrate against government plans to build a fifth runway. "We were trying to stop the 800 trucks per day that pass through to build a fifth landing strip at Schiphol," said Eugene van Haren, spokesman for Friends of the Earth's Dutch branch. A Reuters photographer said about 75 protestors tried to block gates and prevent wagons carrying sand and building materials from entering the site. But they failed at one of the gates, and trucks could pass through. 

 "They tried to block the five gates but they didn't succeed at one of them, so the trucks could carry on with their jobs. It was a peaceful process. There were no arrests," a Haarlem police spokesman said. The demonstrators say the government, with its proposed environmental legislation, is reneging on its environmental promises. "The government made promises in 1995 that the environmental situation around the airport would improve in terms of noise, pollution, stench, greenhouse effect," said Friends of the Earth spokesman, Kees Kodde. 

 * American to Tag Surcharge on Paper Airline Tickets 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Airlines, whose parent is AMR Corp., is going to start charging $10 per ticket to issue paper tickets to its customers beginning April 9, according to financial magazine BusinessWeek. In the April 2 issue, BusinessWeek said it obtained an internal memo stating that American Airlines decided to start charging the fee in an attempt to push travelers into using electronic tickets, or e-tickets, which save $4 to $5 per passenger in accounting and tracking costs, as well as boost American's bottom line. The world's second largest airline declined to comment on the article, citing antitrust rules against price-signaling, the magazine said.

 Calif. Paper To Drop Sunday Magazine

 SAN JOSE (AP) - The San Jose Mercury News will stop publishing its Sunday magazine as part of a recent pledge to cut costs without cutting jobs, the paper said Friday. 

 SV Magazine, which had been part of the paper's Sunday edition since July 1999, will cease production next month. It will mark the first time in nearly 32 years that the Mercury News hasn't had a Sunday magazine. 

 The paper's top editors called the decision "unavoidable" after deciding not to fire workers despite a drop in advertising revenue tied to the recent economic downturn in Silicon Valley. 

 "When we said earlier this week that there would be no newsroom layoffs, we talked about trade-offs we were making to preserve jobs," a memo from Executive Editor David Yarnold and Managing Editor Susan Goldberg said. "This is one of those trade-offs." 

 After warning layoffs were inevitable at the start of this month, the Mercury News tabled the idea after the surprise resignation of the paper's publisher, Jay T. Harris. He cited high profit expectations from the paper's parent company, Knight Ridder, as one reason for his decision. 

 San Jose-based Knight Ridder will look to the Mercury News, despite its recent financial struggles, to help the corporation fulfill a pledge to boost earnings by at least 10 percent this year. 

 After the paper closes its Sunday magazine, the Mercury News said it plans to find new assignments for the nine employees affected by the decision.

 Treasury yields dip in London, US shares seen down.

 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Yields on U.S. Treasuries were lower in London as the market remained well bid and U.S. equities looked like opening weaker on Wall Street. 

 At 1111 GMT, the two-year T-note was priced at 100-27, yielding 4.166 percent and down 5.1 basis points, compared with 100-24 in New York. At that yield is was at its lowest since November 1998. 

 The 10-year bond was at 101-30, yielding 4.75 percent, down 2.2 basis points, compared with 101-24. 

 The benchmark 10-year T-note June future was at 106-30 1/2, up 5 points, and just shy of its all-time peak of 107-01 1/2 struck midsession on Wednesday. The T-bond June future was up 7 points at 106-18. 

 "So long as equities don't find a base, we are going to see some upside in this (U.S. Treasury) market. If equities do find a base, we could fall badly," a trader said. 

 The gains were mostly in two-, five-, and 10-year Treasuries, but volumes were thin, he said. 

 The trader said equity markets were the focus, and even the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. February Consumer Prices Index data on Wednesday did not dent bonds. 

 On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index suffered its lowest close since early March 1999, as stock investors still reeled from the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to cut the Fed funds rate by only 50 basis points - at the lower end of expectations - to 5.0 percent. 

 Some analysts said U.S. Treasuries could jump a lot higher. 

 "It does depend on equity markets, but since we don't have any U.S. data out on Friday, investors are likely to be less constrained today (Thursday) and therefore bid the market well," said Stephen Lewis, chief economist at Monument Derivatives in London. The 30-year long bond could see its yield fall three basis points to 5.25 percent, he added. 

 The long bond was at 101-17, the yield at 5.27 percent, down 0.9 basis point. 

 The June Nasdaq index future pointed to a lower start for Wall Street, and was down 19 at 1,617.0. 

 One concern analysts have is whether the so far buoyant U.S. housing market is losing steam, which could offer U.S. Treasuries a further prospect of gain at the expense of equities. On Thursday, Britain's biggest plasterboard maker, BPB, issued a profit warning, and cited poor second half trading conditions in North America. 

 Another factor likely to support U.S. Treasuries on Thursday is the Treasury Department's $1.75 billion buy back programme, in effect a reverse auction, the results of which are expected around 1615 GMT. 

 "The U.S. Treasuries market is very liquid, and gains on such a day when there is a buy back tend to be transmitted across the yield curve," said Lewis. 

 Scheduled U.S. data on Thursday is not expected to have much impact on U.S. Treasuries, one trader said, now that the FOMC rate decision has passed. Weekly jobless claims is out at 1330 GMT and lead indicators at 1500 GMT. 

 U.S. Treasuries were underperforming Bunds with the 10-year spread four basis points wider at 21. The 10-year dollar swap spread narrowed a further three basis points to 88, from the Chicago close of 91.

 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Shares fell to new 17-month lows in Europe on Thursday while bonds and the U.S. dollar rallied smartly, as a wave of poor economic and company profit news stoked investors' worries about global economic conditions. 

 U.S. S&P 500 index futures were down five points, or about 0.3 percent, pointing to a potentially difficult day in New York. 

 Bond prices jumped as investors sought safety and moved to price in rising expectations of a euro zone interest rate cut, with yields on German bunds plumbing 15-month lows. 

 Pan-European indices fell as much as 3.2 percent, hurt by unexpectedly bad profit reports from Swiss insurer Zurich Financial and British automation firm Invensys Plc. 

 "The mood is extremely negative, the word capitulation does come to mind," said Jason James, European equity strategist at HSBC Securities in London. 

 "A lot of people instinctively feel that if the U.S. is in recession or going that way Europe will follow." 

 The Swiss National Bank cut its key interest rate target by a quarter point, citing increased economic uncertainty. 

 The dollar rose across the board, sending the euro to three-month lows and hitting fresh 22-month highs against the yen, traders attributing gains to safe haven flows to U.S. Treasuries. 

 European government bond yields hit two-year lows, shrugging off a mixed performance in Treasuries overnight, as comments from European central bankers raised the prospect of an earlier than expected easing of euro zone interest rates. 

 The Confederation of British Industry said manufacturing demand fell again in March while a government economist told Reuters France planned to cut its growth forecast for 2001 in light of the worsening global situation.

 Banks, insurers and drug stocks, once viewed as defensive safe havens, accounted for a third of the losses on the Eurotop 300 index of Europe's biggest companies and the blue-chip DJ Euro Stoxx 50. 

 Europe's sixth-largest insurance group, Zurich shed 16 percent to send insurers down 4.8 percent to a 13-month low, after its 2000 results missed already lowered forecasts and it predicted a rough 2001. 

 In Britain, industrial automation and control devices group Invensys plummeted 14 percent after issuing its second profit warning in six months and saying it would cut an extra 2,000 jobs as it battles weakening in key U.S. markets. 

 The news follows a series of warnings from European companies whose business relies on a healthy U.S. economy. U.S. stock index futures signalled yet more losses on Wall Street. 

 The FTSE 100 fell 164 points, or three percent, to hit lows not seen since November 1998. 

 Most Asian markets fell on Thursday with Japan's Nikkei 225, which managed a rise of seven percent on Wednesday, going into reverse to end 1.91 percent lower. 

 U.S stocks were expected to start weak, shoving the blue-chip Dow nearly 20 percent below historic highs, as Corporate America keeps up its steady drip of profit warnings and fuels concern that interest-rate cuts will not revive the economy soon enough. 

 BONDS RALLY, ECB CUTS EYED 

 Euro zone interest rate futures rallied to discount cuts of 25 basis points by mid-year and 75 by year-end as government bond yields on both sides of the Atlantic fell to their lowest for two years. 

 Driven by tumbling stock markets, weak data and comments by top monetary officials, Euribor three-month interest rate futures rallied to new contract highs, indicating firming expectations that the European Central Bank will soon follow the Federal Reserve's lead and cut interest rates. 

 Austrian Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser said he thought the time was ripe for an ECB cut, downplaying inflation risks. 

 The June Euribor future, a key indicator of rate expectations, was 0.065 higher at 95.740 while the September contract hit a new high at 96.000. A rise in price implies the market is discounting lower rates. 

 "This is clearly indicating that markets are getting more optimistic about monetary policy at the ECB, that they are going to cut rates soon," said Peter Fertig, fixed income strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in Frankfurt. 

 With expectations of more U.S. rate cuts, short-dated Treasury yields fell to their lowest since late 1998, just after a Russian debt default sparked fears of global economic crisis. 

 European government bond futures rose to fresh contract highs while cash yields dropped. The German 10-year Bund yield was down 6.3 basis pioints to its lowest since July 1999. Two-year yields, which fell 8.7 basis piints to 4.081 percnet, were at their lowest since December 1999. 

 The dollar hit 22-month highs against the yen and three-month highs against European currencies as investors sought safety in secure and liquid U.S. Treasuries. 

 Worries about euro zone growth were reignited by a weak reading in the key German Ifo survey on Wednesday. 

 The yen was weighed down by low Japanese interest rates after the Bank of Japan reverted to its zero-rate policy this week. 

 "There are big question marks over the cyclical performance of the U.S. economy, but that also feeds into the European outlook, and while the U.S. has taken action, we are still waiting for the ECB to do so," said Teis Knuthsen, chief strategist at SEB Merchant Banking in Copenhagen. 

 "In Japan, the economy and the financial and political outlook suggest a continued uptrend in dollar/yen." 

 The dollar broke a strong resistance level at 124 yen in European trade to hit 22-month peaks of 124.19 , within one yen of the 1999 peak of 124.79, according to Reuters data. 

 The euro fell below $0.89 for the first time this year, hitting three-month lows of $0.8869. The dollar had edged off its highs against the yen and the euro by 1245 GMT. 

 The Swiss franc and the pound also hit three-month lows against the dollar, while the Australian dollar and the rand plumbed record lows against the U.S. currency. 

 The Swiss franc recovered ground after the Swiss National Bank cut its Libor target by 25 basis points to 2.75-3.75 percent.

 China's Rise and Challenges for U.S. Security Policy 

 Since the early 1990s, American scholars and strategists have debated whether the People's Republic of China (PRC) will pose a security threat to the United States and its regional interests in East Asia in the next few decades. Although many have focused on intentions as well as capabilities, the most prevalent component of the debate is the assessment of China's overall future military power compared with that of the United States and other East Asian regional powers. So conferences have been held and papers written discussing whether China would become a "peer competitor" or "near peer competitor" of the United States in the military arena, or a "regional hegemon" towering over its cowed neighbors and threatening American interests in a region of increasing importance to the United States. [1] 

 The debate was hottest in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War era. In the early 1990s, the American economy was suffering and the American military downsizing, while China's economy was growing quickly following the brief post-Tiananmen slump. Moreover, in those years China began increasing its military spending significantly for the first time since 1978. As a result, concerns were expressed about America's ability to maintain its global military presence and supremacy, particularly in East Asia. However, despite a turnaround in the American economy, a slowdown in defense cuts, and the clear persistence of American alliances and internationalism, the question of whether China will become a peer competitor or near peer competitor of the United States in the next few decades still motivates the thinking of many American strategists today. [2] 

 The debate about China as a peer competitor revolves around simple realist notions of how international politics work: Power is what matters; and what matters in power is one's relative capabilities compared with those of others, especially other great powers. For the pessimists, the Chinese military of the twenty-first century is replacing the Soviet military of the pre-Gorbachev years and the Japanese economy of the 1970s as the next big purported threat to American global leadership. The optimists disagree, arguing that the United States is safe from the largely hyped "China threat." The same underlying logic of the peer competitor debate is often found in discussions of future security relations across the Taiwan Strait. These discussions frequently focus on the overall balance of power across the strait and the prospect of mainland China closing the gap with the technologically more sophisticated military of Taiwan (or Republic of China [ROC]). An oft-discussed scenario in these discussions is the mainl and's future ability or inability to conquer and occupy Taiwan in a traditional D-Day style invasion. [3] 

 There is little doubt that it is useful to determine whether China is catching up with the United States or other states in overall military power or whether the mainland will be able to invade and occupy Taiwan effectively and with ease. The world would be a fundamentally different place if the answer to either question were affirmative, just as it would if America's global lead were declining and multipolarity were just around the corner. [4] But although realist analysis raises important questions, the answers to those questions often have only limited utility. In this article I discuss why such debates miss many of the important questions regarding a China with increasing, but still limited, military capabilities. My thesis is that with certain new equipment and certain strategies, China can pose major problems for American security interests, and especially for Taiwan, without the slightest pretense of catching up with the United States by an overall measure of national military power or technology. I f irmly agree with those who are skeptical about China's prospects in significantly closing the gap with the United States. I believe, however, that certain Chinese military capabilities combined with the political geography of East Asia, the domestic politics of mainland China, and the perceptual biases of Chinese elites can pose significant challenges for American security strategy in the region--the basic elements of which are deterring attacks on allies and friends; maintaining East Asian bases for global power projection; and preventing spirals of tension among regional actors whose relations are plagued by both historical legacies of mistrust and contemporary sovereignty disputes. [5] This holds particularly true in the case of maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait, an issue on which I focus below. 

 China does not appear poised to become a peer competitor of the United States. If it were to do so, China's economic growth and increasing technological sophistication must allow China to close the gap with the American military, create power projection capabilities that would threaten the American position in East Asia, and replace the former Soviet Union as a global security threat. Given the great leaps in economic and military power that this would entail, it seems incredible to many, including this author, that China might achieve such an outcome anytime in the next few decades. Of course, it is possible that China might accelerate its progress greatly by enjoying the "advantage of backwardness" in a quickly changing world of high technology: That is, by being more innovative than the United States by necessity, China might then skip levels of technological development in the ongoing revolution in military affairs (RMA) and quickly close the gap with a United States that is perceived as too self-confide nt and too bureaucratically hidebound to maintain a healthy lead against such a newcomer. Those who reject this scenario point to the low starting point for China's military modernization; China's own impressive institutional and bureaucratic obstacles to innovation; and its continuing reliance on outsiders to develop new defense technologies that, themselves, are of late-Cold War vintage. In fact, the common argument among this group is not only that China is not likely to close the gap quickly between itself and the United States, but that the American technological lead will likely expand in the next few decades. As Robert Ross puts it persuasively, it appears so far that if there is going to be a revolution in military affairs in East Asia, "it will be a largely American revolution." [6] 

 Such conclusions should not be cause for excessive optimism, however. Chinese strategists seem to recognize the reality of China's persistent relative fweakness, but they do not therefore throw up their hands in defeat, considering great power conflict unthinkable. No matter how much Beijing might wish it could develop capabilities that could match or defeat American military power, China's strategy for the next twenty to thirty years appears more realistic: to develop the capabilities to dominate most regional actors, to become a regional peer competitor or near peer competitor of the other great powers in the region (including Russia, Japan, and perhaps a future unified Korea), and to develop politically useful capabilities to punish American forces if they were to intervene in a conflict of great interest to China. As leading military officers argue in one recent internally circulated Chinese military education book (which is analyzed in detail below): "Our weaponry has improved greatly in comparison to t he past, but in comparison to the militaries of the advanced countries [fada guojia], there will still be a large gap not only now but long into the future. Therefore we not only must accelerate our development of advanced weapons, thus shrinking the gap to the fullest extent possible, but also [we must] use our current weapons to defeat enemies. . . . [We must] explore the art of the inferior defeating the superior under high-tech conditions." [7] In the near term, China seems devoted to developing new coercive options to exert more control over Taiwan's diplomatic policies, and to threaten or carry out punishment of any third parties that might intervene militarily on Taiwan's behalf, including both the United States and Japan. [8] 

 If Beijing elites become convinced that relatively limited military capabilities and coercive tactics might allow for the politically effective use of force against Taiwan and, if necessary, American forces, then war between the United States and China becomes a very real possibility. This is true regardless of whether China's military force is generally backward compared with those of the United States and its allies, whether China still would be defeated in a toe-to-toe full-scale war with the United States, or whether the overall balance of power across the Taiwan Strait has changed enough to allow a successful amphibious invasion by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). 

 This article first focuses on some basic theoretical problems with the peer competitor debate. I review various reasons why stronger powers have failed to deter weaker ones in strategic history, even in cases where the weaker powers' leaders understood the overall military superiority of their enemies. The next section presents general reasons why a relatively weak China might use force against Taiwan and, perhaps, American forces in the region. The focus of this section is on Beijing's coercive diplomacy, perceptions about the resolve of the United States and of its friends and allies, and the dangerous potential for political desperation in Beijing if Taiwan appears to be sliding toward independence. The following section offers some potential military strategies that China might adopt in the next several years to coerce Taiwan and the United States into a cross-strait political settlement. In this section I discuss how politics, geography, and perceptions can combine to encourage PRC belligerence even if nobody in Beijing believes that successful occupation of Taiwan is possible or even desirable. The final section focuses on the implications of this analysis for U.S. national security policy. Rather than considering how to maintain U.S. strategic superiority, this section concentrates on how the United States can adopt relatively simple and inexpensive military and diplomatic measures to better dissuade China from using force against Taiwan. 

 General Problems with the Peer Competitor Logic 

 Most debates about China's alleged future peer competitor status neglect to consider three central issues. The first is that U.S. forces are spread thin in more than one theater. America's difficulty in covering the globe is particularly acute in times of major operations in other parts of the world. In the past several years, Washington has all but abandoned in name its initial post-Cold War hope of being able to prevail in two simultaneous regional wars in different parts of the globe. American difficulties on this score are noted in China. In 1993 Chinese military officers made two observations about American military power: first, that it was unrivaled and likely to remain so for a long time; and second, that during the Gulf War, the United States moved many of its most important assets, especially logistics assets, out of East Asia. This would have made it difficult to fight simultaneously in Korea, for example. [9] So even if we were to focus exclusively on relative military power in East Asia, we shoul d start with the understanding that overall American national assets are often not a useful basis of comparison to judge whether Beijing will perceive itself as able to use force effectively against American interests in East Asia. 

 A second related factor is the geography of potential conflicts with China. With the exception of the seas near the southernmost Spratly Islands, most potential points of conflict are very close to China geographically, and all are very far from the United States. American bases in Okinawa and other parts of Japan make areas of potential dispute such as Taiwan, the Senkaku Islands, and the northeastern Spratlys (near the Philippines) much more accessible to American forces than they otherwise would be. But even under politically optimal circumstances, an American response from these areas would take time. Moreover, tight political coordination and intellectual consensus between the United States and Japan on whether and how the alliance should respond to such crises cannot be assumed. In the future, China might attempt a fait accompli strategy to gain political or military control of the situation before the United States can respond effectively. In a more protracted struggle, Beijing might employ a mixture of carrots and sticks to attempt to separate the United States from its important regional allies. 

 A third and more abstract failing of the peer competitor debate is the often implicit and invalid assumption that relative material strength means security because significantly weaker powers would not openly challenge the security interests of the stronger states. As T.V. Paul points out in his excellent book on asymmetric conflict, this questionable assumption runs through most of the realist approaches to war causation and deterrence, and even through approaches that otherwise disagree with each other about what fosters and threatens stability. [10] But diplomatic and military history shows that this assumption is often invalid. A study by John Arquilla at the Rand Corporation suggests that much more often than not, the loser of a great power war is the initiator. Even in the standard version of realist power transition theory, it is the rising challenger that generally initiates conflict to change the status quo. The still superior but declining hegemon does not generally start the conflict preventively. Other research helps to explain why small states often initiate and even sometimes win wars against much greater powers. [11] 

 All of these works imply either that real-world actors simply misperceive the actual international distribution of power and behave in ways consistent with that misperception or that they simply discount the importance of that distribution and, for a combination of political and psychological reasons, decide to fight stronger powers anyway. Famous examples of the misperception of relative fighting capacity include widespread European predictions that Austria would defeat Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and that France would defeat Prussia at least in the early phases of the Franco-Prussian War four years later. [12] But as Paul points out, leaders sometimes decide to attack even when they know that their nations are not nearly as strong militarily as their opponents. [13] Given China's widely accepted military weakness compared with the United States, this phenomenon should interest us more than the miscalculations of the balance of power by actual near peer competitors. [14] Examples of conscious decisions to fight despite perceived national weakness should be seared into American strategic thinking: Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and China's crossing of the Yalu in October 1950. By almost any measure, Japan had only a small fraction of the national power assets of the United States in 1941. [15] Moreover, Japanese elites seemed to have understood the hopelessness of a long war against the United States. Yet out of a combination of wishful thinking about American lack of resolve and largely self-imposed desperation about the implications of not fighting the United States as soon as possible, they ordered an attack anyway. [16] One can only assume that, regardless of the metric used, China in late 1950 was much worse off compared with the United States than was Japan in 1941. Yet Chinese forces too attacked American forces in Korea when Chinese leaders convinced themselves that war was inevitable and that a bold stroke on land might drive the United States entirely off the peninsula, thus improving Ch ina's long-term prospects. In these real-world examples some combination of geography, assessments of American distraction elsewhere, beliefs about American resolve, the enemy's own risk acceptance, and the enemy's strategic desperation--however justified--led to the use of force. [17] 

 This analysis is not to suggest that Sino-American war is inevitable or that American power cannot deter Chinese use of force under many or even most circumstances. It is rather to say that what will determine whether China takes actions that will lead to Sino-American conflict will likely be politics, perceptions, and coercive diplomacy involving specific military capabilities in specific geographic and political contexts, not the overall balance of military power across the Pacific or across the Taiwan Strait. Especially if the goal is to prevent conflicts with China, not just design ways to win them on the battlefield, then it is important to study why politics, perceptions, and new capabilities might encourage China to use force against a stronger United States and its friends and allies. This should hold true even if one assumes optimistically that the more powerful United States will certainly prevail against China in an armed conflict, regardless of the political and geographic context (a very dangero us assumption in my opinion). 

 Perceptions and Politics: Why a Weaker China Might Challenge the United States 

 Four related beliefs or perceptions in some combination could cause the leaders of a relatively weak China to use its military power to challenge American interests and, if deemed necessary; to attack American forces in East Asia: (1) if Chinese leaders believe that they are backed into a corner and that refraining from force is prohibitively costly to the regime; in such an instance, Beijing's high degree of concern about a particular issue (such as Taiwan) and its perception (probably correct) that it cares much more about the issue than does Washington might lead Beijing elites to decide to use force despite the risk of American intervention; (2) if Chinese leaders believe that they can deter effective U.S. intervention or compel U.S. withdrawal by raising the prospect of casualties or by actually killing or wounding American service personnel, as happened in Somalia in 1994; (3) if Chinese leaders perceive the U.S. military as sufficiently distracted or tied down in other parts of the world that the Unite d States could not or would not take on a belligerent China effectively; or (4) if Chinese leaders believe that the United States can be separated from its regional allies by political persuasion or military coercion targeted at those allies. 

 CHINA AS BACKED INTO A CORNER 

 Nothing suggests that the contemporary Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is as aggressive as Tojo's Japan or even as internationally ambitious as the highly ideological founder of the PRC, Mao Zedong. In fact, it may be precisely because Beijing, rightly or wrongly, might feel so defensive and view the prospects of forgoing the use of force as so dismal that CCP elites might decide to launch an attack, particularly against Taiwan. Americans might not understand the psychological and political reasons for desperation in Beijing over the prospect of Taiwan's permanent independence from the Chinese nation, but it would be dangerous and naive to project U.S. values and sense of security onto the PRC and then deem war unlikely. Especially if one considers not only Chinese national security more broadly, but regime security more specifically, then the CCP's use of force to attempt to dissuade a real or perceived move by Taiwan toward formal independence and to get Taiwan back "into the box" seems much more likely. 

 Given the near gutting of any other ideological justification for their rule during the capitalistic reform program initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, besides economic performance the Chinese Communists have little else to bolster their mandate for power than nationalism and the maintenance of national stability and integrity. So from the perspective of state-society relations, the Chinese Communist Party must demonstrate effectiveness and resolve on the Taiwan issue. The loss of Taiwan as war booty to a previously inferior Japan in 1895 stands alongside the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in which many tens of thousands of Chinese citizens were killed by Japanese occupiers, as perhaps the greatest humiliation in Chinese history. As a result, individual leaders must appear tough on Taiwan independence not only to protect their current positions against potential rivals within the party, but also to protect their historical legacies as patriots and to avoid the opprobrium cast on historical figures, such as Li Hongzh ang, accused of negotiating away Chinese sovereign territory in the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki. [18] 

 According to interlocutors in Beijing on my two trips in 2000, the Chinese government is extremely sensitive to criticism and the possibility of social unrest, despite frequent public displays of great confidence and achievement by the Chinese Communists. They say that not all of the complaints about the government relate to economic change, layoffs in the state sector, and the lack of a developed social safety net for displaced and retired workers. They argue that, increasingly, popular criticism is focused on the government's inability or unwillingness to stand up to foreigners and to Taipei. One prominent government analyst said that the Communist Party has grown accustomed to hearing criticism about the economy. But never before in the history of the CCP, he argued, had members of the public routinely accused party elites of being "traitors" (maiguo zei: a term that literally means criminal who sells out his country). He suggested that especially after Premier Zhu Rongji's failure to gain Washington's ac quiescence to China's terms for entry into the World Trade Organization during his April 1999 U.S. visit, the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999, and Lee Teng-hui's enunciation of his "two-state theory" in July of the same year, there is a growing popular perception that the CCP is more interested in making money in international business deals than in defending China's national honor against slights from China's trade and investment partners. This trend is of great concern to the CCP elite, he continued, partially because nationalist themes would be easy ones around which currently disparate opposition forces could quickly come together and perhaps join disaffected hard-line nationalists in the party, including military personnel. For this reason alone, he believes, the Chinese leadership will likely launch a war against Taiwan if Taipei continues to stonewall on reunification talks, regardless of the economic damage that would follow or the likelihood of U.S. military intervention. He stated that the time was not yet right on the military side, but that he views a cross-strait war and a Sino-American military confrontation as not only possible, but as nearly inevitable in the next several years. Most other interlocutors, including current and retired military officers, appeared only somewhat more sanguine than this analyst about the probability of peace with Taiwan and the United States. Although few Chinese security analysts saw war as likely in the next few years, true words of optimism regarding peace over the longer term appeared rare in Beijing in the first half of 2000. That said, few of my interlocutors seemed to have many illusions about the ease with which the mainland could effectively defeat Taiwan, about the incredibly large gap between the PLA and the U.S. military in overall fighting capacity, or about the potential damage to China's economy of a cross-strait conflict. [19] 

 In January 2001, the outlook in Beijing for long-term cross-strait relations appeared more optimistic. Only months after his May 2000 inauguration, Taiwan's new president, Chen Shui-bian, of the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, faced severe economic difficulties, low approval ratings, and opposition criticism of his inability to improve relations with the mainland. As a result, Beijing elites seemed more confident than they were in 2000 about the prospects for a long-term peaceful settlement of cross-strait relations on the mainland's terms. But much of that confidence seems built on the questionable assumption of ongong difficulties in Taiwan, continuing economic strength and stability of the mainland, and the eventual voluntary acceptance in Taiwan of Beijing's terms for meaningful negotiations about unification (discussed below). If those conditions change in the next few years and if Taipei's policies toward the mainland continue to disappoint and frustrate mainland elites, da ngerous levels of pessimism might return to Beijing at a time when the PLA will likely have more coercive military options than it did in 2000. [20] 

 THE SOMALIA ANALOGY 

 Among the most dangerous elements in U.S.-China relations is the fairly widespread belief in America's limited national willpower. If leaders believe that their enemy lacks the willingness to fight once a situation gets very dangerous for that enemy's personnel, then those leaders need not acquire weapons that can defeat that enemy militarily before deciding to use force. They need only to cross the much lower technological and numerical threshold of being able to hurt the enemy or at least convincing themselves that they can. 

 Just what costs do Beijing elites believe that the United States is willing to pay to support Taiwan in a shooting war? It is difficult to assess Chinese perceptions on this score, especially from open sources, but it is clear that at least one important strand of thinking in Beijing elite circles suggests that the United States cannot withstand many casualties. In fact, several of my interlocutors and the colleagues to whom they refer in my interviews seem to differ not on whether the United States can be compelled to back down over Taiwan, but how quickly and at what cost to China. A minority seem to believe that the United States can be deterred from entering such a conflict at all; others believe that a small number of American casualties would lead the Americans to withdraw; still others believe that it would require hundreds and perhaps as many as 10,000 American casualties to drive the United States out. [21] 

 Recent Chinese strategic writings have often emphasized America's unwillingness to fight in a protracted fashion against foes that can fight back even in rudimentary ways. So one National Defense University professor, Zhang Zhaozhong, states: "Americans usually give the impression that they are chivalrous and generous [people] who want to help when they see something unjust, [but] underneath this superficial image, they are in fact extremely selfish.... Americans can never afford to take a beating, not even a light one." He concludes that "the United States is unlikely... to fight a large-scale war for the sake of Taiwan. [22] 

 The most common analogy raised in print and in my interviews in China over the past several years is the U.S. withdrawal from the humanitarian intervention in Somalia. A September 1999 article in the PLA daily, Jiefangjun Bao, argues that "hegemonists fear, first of all, personnel casualties... The strong reaction of the American public to the death of 16 Rangers during the U.S. invasion of Somalia forced the U.S. Army to withdraw its troops from Somalia. .... The defensive side should make good use of the dread of the enemy, and choose the right methods of operation...including distant air attacks, long-range raids, concealed sabotage by secret service personnel, network break-in, and sneak attacks against enemy warships." The same author faults Saddam Hussein for not striking American and Saudi bases in the multiweek staging process prior to Desert Storm. [23] Fu Liqun, a colonel at the prestigious Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing, argued in a February 1997 article: "After a war has started, [Americ an strategy tries] every means to escape, regardless of any effects on the nation's face.... The United States was aggressive and arrogant at the start of the military intervention in Somalia.... However, after the body of a killed U.S. serviceman was paraded through the streets, things became unbearable for the government as well as people outside the government in the United States, and the government could not but declare the withdrawal of U.S. forces. This incident can be regarded as a typical example in recent years. The reason for all that is closely related to the U.S. society's humanist cultural tradition centered around the human person." [24] 

 Because there were few American casualties in the Gulf War--and some Chinese strategists blame Saddam's passive strategy for this fact--that encounter does not seem to mitigate some analysts' disrespect for U.S. resolve. Neither does the 1999 NATO war in Kosovo, which is read in two ways in China, neither of which serves U.S. interests. First, the United States is seen as a bully, willing to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries; but it is seen as a weak bully, only willing to attack the weak from a safe distance. [25] One Shanghai researcher points out that when one compares U.S. belligerence toward Belgrade in putting down Kosovo separatism with American acquiescence to Russia's resolute attack on Chechnya, one sees that "the essence" of the United States and Western powers is "bullying the weak and fearing the strong." [26] In an article in a leading Chinese political newspaper, one prominent CCP America watcher, Niu Jun. opines that a condition that would prevent American intervention in a Taiwan conflict is the ability to raise casualties to an unacceptable level. He points to the "zero casualty" (ling shangwang) war fought in Kosovo as demonstrating that America's "ability to bear cost" (chengshou li) is "extremely frail" (jidu cuiruo). [27] 

 On core sovereignty issues for China such as Taiwan, then, the perceived balance of interests may be much more important than the balance of power, to use Richard Betts's termino1ogy. [28] Even for those who expect American intervention over issues such as Taiwan--and it seems that the majority do--the most important issue is not how to become as strong as the United States, but how to become strong enough to hurt the United States. For example, Chu Shulong of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (one of China's intelligence agencies) adopts the gross national power measures often found in the peer competitor debate. He first recognizes that "now and for quite a long time from now, China has no interest, no necessity, and no capability" to compete with the United States and its Western allies in a direct confrontation and power struggle (zhengmian dui kang he jiacliang). But because he believes in the advantages of geography and resolve favoring China as a defensive actor fighting on w hat it perceives to be its own turf, he argues: "If China's strategic power [zhanliie liliang] and advanced conventional weaponry [xian]in changgui wuqi] reaches 1/10th of the enemy's, we then can fairly effectively contain [ezhil] enemy armed intervention." [29] 

 AMERICAN FORCES TIED DOWN IN OTHER THEATERS 

 Chinese analysts sometimes emphasize the political geography not only of East Asia, but also of the globe as another advantage that China has in settling problems such as Taiwan by force. The United States as the sole superpower often finds its military assets tied down elsewhere. So one strategy for addressing the Taiwan problem would be to wait until the United States is politically and militarily distracted in another part of the world. This, some Chinese analysts believe, would reduce both America's capability and willingness to intervene against China in a meaningful way. In the early 1990s, Chinese military analysts recognized this weakness when they observed that many Asia-based assets were used to defeat Saddam Hussein in the distant Persian Gulf. In June 2000, two civilian analysts made a similar argument to me, stating that the United States cannot handle the burden of two simultaneous military engagements in separate parts of the world. [30] Niu Jun argues that if the United States is in an intense conflict elsewhere and a war breaks out across the strait, it might then "give up on implementing military intervention in Taiwan. ... Though American power is great, its power has limits." He describes American "strategic lines" as "too long" and its power as "scattered" (fensan). [31] 

 AMERICA'S UNCERTAIN ALLIANCES 

 Since the era of Mao, Chinese security analysts have understood and have even exaggerated the dependence of the United States on its regional allies to achieve U.S. strategic goals. [32] While recognizing American power, one military analysis of the United States that was written shortly after the Gulf War stated that the United States was so dependent on allied assistance that it had become "the beggar policeman" (jiaohuazi fin gcha). [33] One major strategy of a weaker China would likely be to lessen America's ability to intervene militarily by isolating the United States from its key regional allies, especially Japan. This could be done by political persuasion or by putting at risk American and local personnel at American bases in the Western Pacific with missiles targeting those bases. [34] Such strike capabilities might be designed to deter allied cooperation. If deterrence failed, attacks on U.S. bases might be designed to slow America's military response or, by raising casualties, to compel the United States and its allies to back down after their initial intervention. [35] Attacking military bases effectively with missiles, especially conventionally tipped ones, is a very difficult task. But for deterrence to fail and for there to be severe risks of escalation, Chinese elites might need to believe only that such attacks would damage American willpower or the willingness of Japanese citizens to support American war efforts. 

 China's Developing Capabilities: A Counterrevolution in Military Affairs? 

 Through foreign purchases and domestic developments, China seems to be acquiring capabilities to better attack Taiwan and to complicate any American effort to enter a cross-strait conflict. Many of these acquisitions are last-generation weaponry. But they are still significant if Taiwan or the United States lacks the means to counter such systems effectively, or if the methods of countering them are politically unpalatable or overly risky to American forces or American alliances, and therefore are or seem unlikely to be employed. It is not enough to ask whether the United States can sink a new Chinese battleship or submarine or whether the United States can preempt against missile sites with strike weapons. In an actual crisis, the president might avoid taking such provocative actions in order to maintain crisis stability, to avoid escalation of an armed conflict with a nuclear power capable of striking the United States, or to avoid a rupture in regional alliances in the face of nervousness in Tokyo, Canberr a, Seoul, or Manila. If in the absence of American preemption these systems posed real risks to American service personnel, then China might have political leverage in a crisis or conflict without the slightest capacity of defeating American forces in a toe-to-toe war. Of equal importance, and perhaps much more likely, Chinese elites might perceive that they have such leverage even when they do not. This alone could lead to a tragic escalation of conflict. 

 If Beijing chooses to use force, China will likely attempt to use old and new technologies to coerce Taiwan into a minimally acceptable political compromise (discussed further below) and to complicate America's attempts to respond to PRC belligerence. Some of these methods (such as laser blinding of American satellites) might be high-tech, while others (such as laying mines near ports and in sea-lanes) will be neither new nor high-tech. By developing such methods, China seems bent not so much on winning the revolution in military affairs, but on launching a counterrevolution in military affairs to weaken and coerce more advanced powers that are increasingly dependent on high-tech command and control and information-gathering systems to project their power. [36] None of the high-tech or low-tech methods discussed below will allow China to close the overall gap with the United States in military power to any significant degree, nor will they necessarily enable the PRC to invade and occupy Taiwan, but they migh t achieve certain political goals regarding Taiwan at acceptable costs. At a minimum, and perhaps more important, they might prove extremely dangerous if Chinese elites believe them to be effective even when they are not. 

 In the following sections, I discuss coercive military options other than amphibious assault against Taiwan. Coercive operations seem more likely to be adopted by China and might actually serve Beijing's political purposes better than an invasion would. [37] Those political purposes have more to do with halting and reversing Taiwan's perceived drift toward independence than with expanding the CCP's administrative control to Taiwan. In fact, in my experience, no one in Beijing shows any desire to run Taiwan's day-to-day affairs, nor do they have any pretenses that they would know how. Rather, to reverse the perceived trends toward Taiwan independence, my interlocutors argue that Beijing merely needs Taiwan's return to an abstract "one China" policy, such as the one Taipei espoused during the reign of Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, and a return to cross-strait negotiations on that basis. Recent statements by Chinese elites in public and private suggest that "one China" can be vaguely conceived and does not need to equate with the People's Republic of China. Moreover, the two sides can agree to disagree on what "one China" means (as many believe Beijing and Taipei did in 1992 in preparation for cross-strait talks in Singapore), as long as they consider some version of the abstract concept an existing reality that underpins those negotiations. Finally, mainland elites claim that in such "reunification" talks, Taiwan need not negotiate away its de facto political autonomy, its economic system, its democracy, or even its own military. It only must permanently forgo legal independence as a nation-state separate from China. [38] So from the perspective of many elites on the mainland, Taiwan does not need to be moved far to blunt or reverse what they perceive to be negative trends toward a declaration of formal independence. 

 Although Beijing's apparently accommodating stance on this score might seem reassuring, from the perspective of deterrence, that moderation is troubling. The limited nature of their political goals might convince Beijing elites that a coercion campaign far short of an amphibious invasion will likely succeed in convincing Taiwan and its potential international supporters that fighting a prolonged battle to avoid such an outcome simply is not worth it. As Paul argues, one of the key issues that leads weaker powers to take on stronger ones is precisely the pursuit of limited aims in war. [39] In this sense, mainland "moderation" on cross-strait relations can be seen as alarming, rather than reassuring, because such moderation makes limited Chinese military capabilities appear much more likely to be used. It is much more difficult for Taiwan to demonstrate the requisite combination of native military might, economic staying power, and political resolve to withstand a mainland coercive campaign if the PRC's goals are limited than if they are expansive (e.g., the goal of occupation). Of course, even under circumstances where the PRC has limited aims, any use of force by Beijing might prove terribly misguided either because PRC elites overestimate the PLA's coercive capacity, underestimate Taiwan's staying power, or ignore the potentially transformative power of warfare. Military conflict might very well spark a dedicated and resolute Taiwan independence movement that otherwise would not have existed. But by that point deterrence already would have failed in the Taiwan Strait, and the United States and China might also have started down the road to war. 

 The analysis below draws in part on a lengthy internally circulated PLA text, Zhanyi Xue [Military campaign studies], which was edited by two top-ranking officers at China's premier military academy, Wang Houqing and Zhang Xingye, and is apparently used in national-level training courses for high-ranking CCP cadres. Because of the intended limited circulation of the source, the opinions expressed in it likely carry more weight than do the dramatic, much discussed, but probably less authoritative, Chao Xian Zhan [Unrestricted warfare], penned for a much wider audience by two lesser-known colonels. [40] 

 Even if the plans outlined in the more cautious work examined here are themselves sometimes still too optimistic given current and likely future Chinese capabilities, they are a concern if Chinese military officers reading such assessments and the civilians they advise come to believe them to be efficacious as Chinese capabilities improve over the coming years. Moreover, they are especially concerning because the notion that China must strike hard, early, and by surprise if its plans are to be effective might make crises extremely volatile and hard to contain in the future. In this limited sense, China's weakness and inability to become a peer competitor may make it a more dangerous opponent in a future crisis than a more secure and powerful China might be. This is particularly true if Chinese elites feel desperate and are banking on opponents with limited resolve and willingness to bear costs. 

 THE CHALLENGE TO TAIWAN'S MR SUPERIORITY AND THE THREAT TO U.S. BASES 

 Among the high-profile systems that China is acquiring are Russian Su-27 and Su-30 fighter jets with medium-range air-to-air missiles and Russian advanced warning aircraft technology. If employed effectively in sufficient numbers-and that is always an important qualifier in regards to the Chinese military-these systems could pose major problems for Taiwan in its efforts to maintain air superiority over the Taiwan Strait, a critical asset not only in preventing an invasion but in breaking blockades and limiting the general costs of war to the society. The problem of maintaining air superiority might be particularly nettlesome if China is able to damage Taiwan's air defense assets through dedicated and massive attack on command-and-control nodes and airstrips with special forces or with land attack cruise missiles and accurate ballistic missiles--capabilities that the Chinese military is striving to develop. In an excellent 1999 study that cites numerous open-source Chinese publications, Mark Stokes first raise d the hypothesis that China was working hard to move beyond the use of missiles as inaccurate terror weapons and to obtain such a militarily useful, accurate missile force. [41] 

 The Wang and Zhang volume cited above strongly suggests that Stokes's study accurately reflects high-level PLA thinking about missile strikes. In almost every type of war-fighting scenario--from blockade to invasion (always against unnamed foes that usually have superior technology)--the authors view as essential concentrated attacks on enemy military assets by the PLA's missile forces, the Second Artillery. Moreover, the current conventional missile force, though limited in number, is portrayed as having sufficient range and accuracy for attacks on such critically important enemy assets as regional naval bases, airstrips, and command-and-control centers, if the targets are well selected and the missile firings are sufficiently concentrated. [42] The text argues that a concerted deep strike attack on important enemy assets can "seize battlefield initiative [zhanyi zhudongquan] and establish the conditions for victory; moreover, in politics it can frighten his [the enemy's] psychology, shaking his will to fig ht a war [dongyao qi zhanzheng yizhi], and accelerating the progress of the battle [Jiasu zhanyi jincheng]." [43] The authors are not contending that the PLA has an upper hand, or that it is closing the gap significantly with the West in any of these areas in the near term. Rather they are suggesting that through some improved capabilities, a higher level of morale and resolve than the enemy, careful targeting, and innovative methods of early strike, China might be able to use accurate missiles to fight and prevail politically in a regional war over issues related to Chinese sovereignty, such as Taiwan. [44] 

 From the point of view of crisis management, one of the most disturbing aspects of discussions of missile attack on enemy bases are the lessons that some Chinese have drawn from recent American military conflicts. A common argument about both the Gulf War and the Kosovo war is that if Baghdad or Belgrade had attacked American bases early in the conflict, while the United States was assembling forces for war, the Americans might not have prevailed. These analyses criticize Baghdad for not attacking with assets in its possession, including Scud missiles, until after the Americans had launched Desert Storm, and pity Belgrade for lacking the capacity to do so. [45] Such logic might make crisis management very difficult if the United States begins to assemble forces in Japan in the face of a mainland coercion campaign against Taiwan. 

 INFORMATION AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE 

 Another concerning aspect of China's hope for an effective asymmetric strategy against a more powerful foe is information and electronic warfare. Here is the clearest example of Chinese military elites accepting the PLA's inferior overall capabilities, but trying to create problems for others with more advanced command-and-control systems and surveillance assets. [46] The Wang and Zhang volume argues that, to fight more advanced foes, China needs to develop the following capabilities and tactics, all of which fit well with my notion of a counterrevolution in military affairs: special forces operations against enemy command and control; precision-guided missiles, including antiradiation missiles (fan fushe daodan); electromagnetic pulse weapons (dianci maichong wuqi); lasers (jiguang); electronic jamming (dianzi ganrao); and computer viruses and computer hackers (hei ke) to attack information networks. [47] 

 Again, nowhere do the authors suggest that China will somehow catch up to or surpass the United States or other advanced powers in information systems or in the ability to attack them. Rather the argument is that more advanced countries might be vulnerable precisely because they depend on more advanced, high-tech systems than do less advanced countries such as China. [48] As with the notion of missile strikes, the target of Chinese information warfare (IW) is as much the enemy's resolve as it is its military might. [49] Zhanyi Xue includes psychological operations as part of IW. These can harm "the enemy's 'psychological conviction' [xinnian xinli], and can achieve the goal of breaking the enemy military's willingness to fight [dou zhi] and [its] ambition [zhi qi] and of reducing its combat effectiveness [zhandouli]." [50] Moreover, the authors place a premium on attacking the enemy's information net before the enemy attacks one's own. They write that although both offense and defense in information warfare are indispensable, "offense is dominant" (jingong zhan you zhudao di wei). Without an effective offense, China will be unable to defend its information networks efficiently from attack by enemies, who, the authors imply, will likely be more technologically advanced and powerful than China. [51] 

 The combination of an emphasis on early attack, the danger of being struck first, and the potential effect of an early concerted strike on the enemy's resolve and fighting spirit, rather than just its capabilities, all suggest that a moderate increase in Chinese IW capabilities may pose a major challenge in the context of a Taiwan crisis. Chinese elites will likely view such a crisis primarily as a battle of wills. Moreover, if they accept the logic above, they might convince themselves that an early, concerted attack--however risky--is less risky than the alternatives. In such circumstances, again, China's overall inferiority could actually encourage, rather than discourage, escalation. 

 We cannot be certain from open-source data how developed China's IW capabilities really are. Unlike those relating to missile warfare, the Chinese writings on information warfare do not betray a high degree of confidence in China's current capabilities. But as James Mulvenon argues in an excellent study: "Behind all the rhetoric and hype, IW presents the Chinese with a potentially potent, if circumscribed, asymmetric weapon. Defined carefully, it could give the PLA a longer-range power projection capability against U.S. forces that its conventional forces cannot currently hope to match." [52] Two Chinese officers at the Academy of Military Science point out that the most sophisticated systems might be the most vulnerable, writing that "striking evidence of this is the case of the U.S. Defense Department network being paralyzed by a physically weak high-school student." [53] Even if China currently lacks key capabilities to render such attacks, it might develop more impressive capabilities over the next decad e. Moreover, Beijing elites might overestimate China's IW attack capabilities as it develops or exaggerates Taiwanese and American vulnerabilities. Such miscalculations might have important implications for crisis management and conflict escalation. 

 BLOCKADE STRATEGIES 

 One of the options for coercing Taiwan that geography affords the PRC is blockade of Taiwan's trade through the destruction of ports and shipping or deterrence of civilian shipping companies. Sea blockade provides a wide range of options for the PLA, including direct attacks on shipping with ship-to-ship missiles, air-launched missiles, land-based cruise missiles, and submarine-launched torpedoes. In addition, key ports such as those in Kaohsiung and Keelung are subject to missile attack or "missile blockade" if fear for physical safety or soaring insurance rates keep merchant ships out of harbor. In addition, China might be able to use a variety of methods to lay sea mines, including surface ships, aircraft, and submarines. Always nettlesome to even the most powerful navies, sea mines are more sophisticated and harder to detect than ever. They can be prepositioned and remotely controlled, or they can lie on the ocean floor until activated by the motion of ships. The proximity of Taiwan to the mainland (rough ly 100 nautical miles across the strait), Taiwan's massive trade dependence (more than half of Taiwan's gross national product), the inherent difficulty in clearing mines, and the extreme weakness of American mine-clearing capacity, particularly in the theater (the United States has only two mine-clearing ships deployed in the Seventh Fleet) all make blockade a tempting and potentially effective strategy for a China that does not close the gap with either Taiwan or the United States in technology or overall military power. [54] 

 New PLA Navy capabilities that should soon be integrated into the active forces and that increase the threat of blockade to Taiwan include four Kiloclass submarines with guided torpedoes and two Sovremennyi destroyers with supersonic Sunburn SS-N-22 missiles. These assets will supplement a larger but more technologically backward PLA Navy with dozens of louder, slower submarines with more backward offensive systems that are either still active or mothballed for future use. The more modem ships might greatly complicate the ROC Navy's ability to keep shipping safe. The PRC might also use Kilos and Sovremennyi destroyers along with sea mines and cruise missiles as coercive tools designed to deter the intervention of, or limit the nature and geographical deployment of, American forces. 

 American naval experts and officers have underscored the difficulty in defending against the Sunburn missile, designed by the Russians to attack U.S. carrier battle groups protected by Aegis air defense systems. But they also claim that the U.S. Navy can easily destroy a Sovremennyi long before American surface ships come into range of the Sunburn. [55] However, as in the case of long-distance strikes on mainland missile sites, one must question whether, in a political and military crisis over Taiwan, U.S. naval commanders in the theater would be allowed to operate under such politically provocative rules of engagement. If not, then the Sunburn becomes a potentially useful coercive tool to make Americans think twice about the possible costs of loitering in waters near Taiwan. Again, even if Beijing falsely concluded that it could deny or complicate access to certain waters through such coercive measures involving Kilos and Sovremennyis, the risk of crisis escalation and the security problems posed by these C old War-era systems are still real. 

 Military and civilian elites in Beijing acknowledge both the advantages and the disadvantages of blockade scenarios, recognizing in particular American and Taiwan vulnerability to sea mines. This provides a potentially very useful asymmetric tool to coerce technologically superior foes. As Zhanyi Xue points out, sea mines are economically damaging, last a long time, are hard to detect, and are "viewed with seriousness by every country's military" (this appears to be a veiled reference to advanced countries such as the United States). [56] The text notes that there have been major advances in sea mines, particularly in their stealthiness, and that a great advantage of mine warfare is that one can supplement mines as they are cleared by the enemy, thus further complicating the enemy's challenge and extending the duration of the blockade. PLA mine-laying assets in the air, on the surface, and under the sea are all vulnerable to attack by a technologically superior enemy's defensive forces. Methods of deception, timing, and joint operations, however, are being designed to reduce this risk. In clear but still only implicit references to Taiwan, the authors discuss using forces in one area to distract the attention of the enemy while PLA submarines lay mines in other areas. Another tactic is to lay mines with submarines in periods of extreme weather, so that enemy antisubmarine warfare (ASW) patrol craft on the surface and in the air cannot be effectively deployed against PLA submarines (the discussion is almost certainly about Taiwan because blockades are seen as a way to "maintain national sovereignty"). [57] In more general weather conditions, the authors argue, mine laying and attacks on surface shipping might be combined in joint operations with information warfare and missile strikes on air and naval assets to complicate the enemy's ability to conduct effective ASW and mine-clearing operations. [58] 

 Blockade scenarios have obvious downsides in addition to the danger that they will simply fail on military grounds because of Taiwan's antisubmarine, mine-clearing, surface warfare, and air defense capabilities combined with the limited punch of the PLA's conventionally tipped missiles. The biggest additional danger, and the one most cited by my interlocutors and in military writings, is the protracted (chi jiu) nature of blockade warfare, which allows time for "third country" assistance and military intervention. [59] Moreover, because the authors of Zhanyi Xue envision blockade as a form of joint warfare with complex challenges, there is great concern that enemy counterattacks will reduce the sustainability of a blockade. Again, in a fashion that does not bode well either for crisis stability or for controlling wartime escalation, the authors' suggested solution is early, large-scale attack using missile strikes and submarines at the high end, and, if needed, large numbers of civilian ships for mine laying at the low end to achieve battlefield superiority relatively quickly. [60] 

 Although they do recognize many difficulties in creating effective blockades, the PLA elites might still be overreaching their current and near-term future capabilities in designing some of the tactics addressed above. In discussions with this author, American naval experts have stated that accurate and safe deployment of sea mines near harbors with submarines is no easy task even in good weather and that it is extremely dangerous to plan to do so during or just after foul weather, especially with submarines that must snorkel periodically, as do most in the PLA Navy. Moreover, supplementing minefields after the initial mines are laid is very tricky. This is true not only because mine-laying submarines or surface ships are working against a fully alerted enemy, but because the submarines and ships themselves are endangered by mines laid in the initial round. Finally, complex joint operations that might reduce the exposure of mine-laying vessels, involving simultaneous mine laying, missile strikes, and informa tion warfare attacks, are hardly the forte of the PLA. [61] 

 All that being said, if Chinese elites are willing to risk casualties and setbacks and believe their limited goals to be achievable, then a blockade strategy involving missiles, submarines, and mines might seem attractive. This is particularly true if those elites assess negatively the willingness of merchant shippers to travel in harm's way, the economic and political staying power of Taiwan under blockade conditions, and the willingness of third parties to intervene in a concerted and protracted way to protect Taiwan's sea-lanes. This point is particularly important when one notes the stated goals of blockade, which have more to do with disrupting "normal" economic activity and influencing enemy morale (shiqi) and domestic support for the war than they do with strangulation or damaging of military assets. [62] 

 DEFENSIVE STRATEGIES: LIMITING DAMAGE FROM ATTACK 

 One final aspect worthy of consideration is the PLA's growing air defense capabilities. Again, the issue is not whether China can develop a system that can defeat American air power or counter all American cruise missiles. The key issue is whether the PLA might be developing the active and passive air defenses that its generals believe are necessary to limit the offensive punch of China's potential enemies while raising the costs to the attacking nation of air assault. Stokes argues that China has an impressive program of passive defense, including a military communication network that relies increasingly on underground fiber-optic cables. These are difficult to destroy and relatively hard to tap for intelligence-gathering purposes. [63] Encouraged by the survival experience of Yugoslav forces in Kosovo, in particular the survivability of high-value targets such as mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) launchers, the PLA also apparently is working to improve concealment and increased survivability of its offens ive forces and air defense assets through the use of mobility, dummy targets, camouflage, smoke and water screens, and so on. Some attention apparently is also being paid to improving damage assessment, repair, and recovery operations to get sites up and running again after successful enemy strikes. [64] Finally, the sheer size and large number of potential targets might constitute China's greatest passive air defense asset. As one U.S. naval officer put it, China is a "cruise missile sponge" capable of exhausting even America's large arsenal of strike weapons. [65] 

 On the active defense side, it appears that China is attempting to import and to build indigenously a fairly impressive layered air defense system to counter cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. In addition to reported clandestine acquisition of Patriot technology, China has purchased and is seeking to purchase from Russia an undisclosed number of SA-10 (S-300) and SA-15 (TOR-1) SAM systems. Some of this Russian technology might be successfully integrated into China's own domestically produced SAM systems, such as the HQ-9. [66] China is also working to develop antistealth and antisatellite capabilities. [67] 

 Even if the Chinese programs have only limited effect against more technologically advanced foes, they may still pose a future security challenge to Taiwan and the United States. If Beijing elites believe that they are in a protracted war of wills over an issue that they care about much more than do the Americans, such as Taiwan, those elites might still be emboldened by the perceived capability--however limited--to increase costs to American and Taiwanese forces and to reduce costs to mainland assets in such a struggle. This problem is only exacerbated by any perceptions that Chinese elites might have about America's supposed limited willingness to fight such protracted wars and to suffer casualties. 

 Implications and Prescriptions for U.S. Strategy 

 If the analysis above is correct, preventing war across the Taiwan Strait and between the United States and China is much more difficult than a straightforward net assessment of relative military power in the region might suggest. To deter China from launching attacks against Taiwan and escalating crises and conflicts by attacking American assets in the region, the United States must do more than demonstrate an ability to prevail militarily in a conflict; it must also demonstrate American resolve and, perhaps, the ability to protect its forces not only from defeat but also from significant harm. On the other hand, if Beijing believes that Taiwan is moving toward independence, it might be impossible to deter, regardless of the degree and nature of American military superiority. So the United States must take actions not only to deter China but also to reassure it that Washington has no intention of backing Beijing into a corner by supporting Taiwan's legal independence now or in the future. [68] 

 On the deterrence side, it might be helpful whenever possible to develop more military capabilities that can blunt Chinese coercive capacities in credible ways that do not require provocative measures such as preemption and massive attacks on the mainland. Future upper-tier theater missile defenses to protect American bases and forward-deployed forces are a good concept when the alternative might be provocative preemptive strike warfare attacks against missile sites on the mainland. The United States has never unleashed anything so aggressive against the homeland of a nuclear-armed state in the past, and it is doubtful that an American president will be eager to become the first to do so. For similar reasons, it would be extremely helpful if better active fleet defenses could be created against systems such as the Sunburn missile, so that preemption against Chinese surface ships would not be necessary to improve the safety of the U.S. Navy near Taiwan. The alternative of a preemptive strike against the Chine se navy risks not only escalation with a nuclear power but Washington's alienation of allied and world opinion. 

 Another good investment would be more minesweepers and other mine-clearing assets stationed in the Seventh Fleet to better counter mainland mine warfare tactics in a timely fashion without relying on Japan's more extensive mine-clearing assets. Reliance on Japanese forces for either mine clearing or missile defense near Taiwan would be extremely provocative and more likely to lead to short-term escalation and long-term instability in the region than would the deployment of Taiwanese and American operations alone. This is due to the high-degree of mistrust and animosity felt in China toward Japan and the emotional historical legacy regarding Japanese imperialism in the Taiwan case in particular. Also damaging would be a Japanese refusal of an American request to provide such military services in a crisis. Such an outcome would severely undermine domestic support for what arguably is America's most important alliance. [69] Finally, to enhance deterrence, the United States should transfer to Taiwan the defensiv e capabilities it needs to withstand a Chinese fait accompli strategy and to afford the United States time to intervene on Taiwan's behalf if it so chooses. Those capabilities include limited point defense from ballistic and cruise missiles--such as lower-tier theater missile defense systems--much more robust mine-clearing assets, and more advanced antisubmarine warfare assets, especially P-3 aircraft. At the same time, the Pentagon should continue to encourage Taiwan's military authorities to implement cheaper and arguably more effective methods such as hardening key military assets, securing military lines of communication, and strengthening defenses against information warfare attacks. 

 Such enhanced American and Taiwanese capabilities should help on the margins first in reducing the chance of war and then in limiting the dangers of escalation if war did occur. Beijing elites must consider the difficulties that they would face in using force to coerce Taiwan to the negotiating table if the United States had more robust, politically usable military options to protect American forces from PLA coercion. Beijing elites are debating their chances of deterring American intervention or coercing early American withdrawal. Therefore America's ability to defend its forces against PLA attack reduces China's ability to achieve those critical goals easily and thus should make China, all things being equal, less likely to choose the risky option of force. 

 At the same time, the United States should work hard to disabuse Chinese elites of any belief they might have about American unwillingness to suffer casualties and pay economic costs in war. This goal is difficult, but not impossible to achieve. It would be helpful if American officials, scholars, and businesspeople pointed out to their Chinese counterparts the stark differences between Somalia and China in American strategic thinking. Increased military-to-military contacts can expose more Chinese military elites not only to America's awe-inspiring military equipment, but also to a very dedicated and professional U.S. military rank and file and officer corps. Visits by Chinese leadership delegations to war memorials at Pearl Harbor and Gettysburg should help in driving home the anomalous nature of the Somalia experience and the dangers of questioning American resolve and staying power. Finally, getting Chinese visitors out of cities such as Washington, D.C., New York, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, and into small towns in rural America with their many American flags and hometown war memorials should reduce Chinese perceptions of an apathetic and indifferent American public interested in only money and comfort. Any subsequent reduction in Chinese beliefs about the PLA's ability to coerce an early American withdrawal from the Taiwan theater should, all things being equal, increase deterrence and reduce the likelihood of war. 

 But all things are not always equal. Under certain conditions Beijing will likely be fully undeterrable. If, for example, Taiwan were to declare independence, it is hard to imagine that China would forgo the use of force against Taiwan, regardless of the perceived economic or military costs, the likely duration or intensity of American intervention, or the balance of forces in the region. But even if it only appears to elites in Beijing that Taiwan is moving in the direction of such a declaration--with increasingly clear and powerful American and Japanese military backing--then Beijing might perceive itself as faced with a closing window of opportunity to reverse that trend before the military and political conditions are even less favorable to the mainland. Under these conditions, deterrence of Chinese military action might be increasingly difficult. [70] 

 Therefore, on the reassurance side of the equation, the United States should attempt to avoid, as much as possible, backing China into a corner on the Taiwan issue. If the above argument is correct, then what would make Beijing so hard to deter--despite its relative military weakness--would be a sense of political desperation, however justified, not aggressive intent or expansionism. It would therefore be constructive for the United States to draw a line in the sand not only for the mainland, but also for Taiwan, in advance of hostilities, letting Taiwan know publicly that a move on its part from de facto to legal independence is not worth a war that it might lose and, in the process, drag American forces into an otherwise avoidable war with China. Such a war would not only set back the prospects for healthy U.S.-China and Chinese-Japanese relations, but would also likely hinder any long-term progress toward democratization on the mainland by hardening Chinese nationalism and anti-Western thinking. Advocates of democratic reform inside and outside of the Chinese Communist Party might be repressed even further as dupes, or even agents, of the United States, Japan, and the Taiwan traitors. Conflict would also severely damage Taiwan's economy and probably its fledgling democracy as well, as civil liberties and freedoms would likely be curtailed or abolished in the setting of war mobilization and an extended emergency. 

 Thus the United States should publicly reassure China by warning Taiwan that American soldiers will not be asked to defend Taiwan if it declares independence. At the same time, Washington should warn Beijing and reassure Taipei that an attack on a Taiwan that remains legally Chinese and holds out the prospect of eventual unification under mutually acceptable conditions will meet an American military response. [71] Some critics will certainly find this formula overly accommodating to Beijing, especially given American military superiority. But they should ask themselves, How long would the United States be willing to fight, even if it were winning all the battles and losing few personnel, to prevent a Taiwan that had declared independence from accepting negotiations with the mainland under conditions where Taiwan's democracy and de facto autonomy were guaranteed, but it had to surrender legal independence? Before answering, they should remember that the United States thoroughly trounced Yugoslav forces in the Kosovo operation, but supported only autonomy, not independence, for the Kosovar Albanians. 

 The United States should also avoid whenever possible transferring systems to Taiwan that are fundamentally offensive or that appear to link the American and Taiwanese militaries in a quasi affiance in peacetime. For example, a decision in the near term to include Taiwan in future upper-tier theater missile defense systems in the region could lead to an assumption in Taipei or in Beijing that the United States and Taiwan were informally restoring their alliance and that Taipei could be certain of American military support regardless of its diplomatic behavior. Unlike lower-tier systems, the upper-tier system currently under development might require Taiwan's military to be linked in advance to American (and perhaps Japanese) intelligence-gathering systems, sensors, and so on, and therefore carry fundamentally different political implications than systems such as the PAC-2 plus or PAC-3 Patriot systems. Taiwan's potential inclusion in the future upper-tier system could contribute to Beijing's sense that it is facing a closing window of vulnerability or opportunity to settle the Taiwan problem before it becomes more intractable. [72] 

 Conclusions 

 A June 2000 news article exemplifies the problem that this article seeks to address. In it, the journalist discloses an internally circulated Chinese military report from the president of the PLA National Defense University stating that China is decades behind the advanced militaries of the world and requires a long-term, arduous military modernization program to close the gap. Given the works I cite above, this is not surprising. What is disturbing, however, is the journalist's conclusion from these data. He states, "The Taiwan authorities can take a breath in the face of military threats from across the strait, and rest a little easier for at least 10 years." [73] Such a conclusion fully disregards the potential for military conflict despite PLA inferiority if the factors discussed above combine to make military action appear to Beijing elites as more prudent than inaction. By way of emphasis, these factors are rising political concern on the mainland about trends in cross-strait relations; geography; the d istraction of the United States in other theaters; Beijing's perceptions and misperceptions about enemy military vulnerabilities and enemy resolve; and any related belief in Beijing, false or real, about the ability to reach an acceptable political conclusion to an armed conflict without dominating all of one's enemies militarily. 

 Under almost all political circumstances, the PLA will likely go to great lengths to avoid the use of force until at least the middle of this decade, because it has not yet fully developed many of the capabilities necessary even to carry out some of the limited coercive campaigns discussed above. This does not mean, however, that once China has sufficient force to initiate some of these campaigns with more assurance that it will be eager to do so--to the contrary, judging from the military writings cited above. Even though they do appear dangerously overconfident at times, in general the Chinese military authors writing the various chapters of Zhanyi Xue recognize the high degree of difficulty and uncertainty involved not only in invasion, but in blockades, information warfare, and so on. And this is not to mention the huge economic costs that China would suffer if it attacked Taiwan and, in the process, alienates its other two biggest trade partners-Japan and the United States. Although they do not see any operations as easy, these PLA authors do not conclude that force is not an option. Instead they say that China must design asymmetric strategies for when they are absolutely necessary. [74] 

 The most dangerous period in cross-strait relations may be between the years 2005 and 2010. During that period many important political and military events might come to pass that could destabilize cross-strait relations. President Jiang Zemin will almost certainly not serve in any high party office past 2007. so if he wants progress on unification as part of his legacy and seeks to avoid being tarred in the history books as a leader who lost China's grip on Taiwan, then Beijing might take dangerous actions to coerce Taiwan to the negotiating table before then. By the second half of this decade, China may have many more of the tools necessary to attempt a campaign of coercion against Taiwan, the United States, and U.S. regional allies, even if such an attempt might still appear incredibly imprudent on purely military grounds. Moreover, my Chinese interlocutors have stated that for both political and military reasons, Beijing sees this decade as a closing window of opportunity for China on the Taiwan issue. A combination of social and political trends on the island could lead Taiwan further away from the mainland, while some regional and global military developments seem to be working against China. These include the development of American and Japanese upper-tier theater missile defense capabilities (slated for completion around 2007), the building of an American national missile defense system, the transfer of more sophisticated weapons to Taiwan, the potential for inclusion of Taiwan in the U.S.-Japan regional upper-tier system, and the political implications this involvement would carry for Taiwan's ability to rely on those quasi allies in a fight. [75] The weakness of the Taiwanese economy in 2000, Taiwan's increasing contacts and economic dependence on the mainland, and the domestic political weakness of Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian--whose party has long advocated independence--appear to have rendered some mainland elites more confident about China's long-term leverage over Taiwan. But it remains to be seen how sturdy that newfound confidence is, particularly as it seems to be partially based on extremely questionable assumptions about the increasing attractiveness of mainland China to Taiwan. Disappointment over the inability to persuade Taipei to accept the "one China principle" and to return to meaningful negotiations over the next few years could easily revive the pessimism about long-term trends evident in the first half of 2000. [76] 

 It would be folly for Taipei to believe itself safe for ten years because of PLA weakness in comparison to either ROC forces or U.S. forces in the region. This is especially true if this conclusion is drawn for all projected political scenarios, including ones in which Taipei has taken diplomatic steps that aggravate Chinese nationalism, threaten CCP legitimacy, and augur near-term or eventual Taiwanese independence if PRC action is not taken. For the same reasons, it would also be folly for Washington elites to use balance-of-power analysis to draw similar conclusions about the low likelihood of war across the Taiwan Strait, the ability of Taiwan to prevail quickly and easily in such a war either with or without American help, or the ability of the United States to avoid dangerous degrees of escalation in a military conflict with China over Taiwan. Washington should take seriously both China's political concerns and military modernization, and attempt to find the best possible balance of deterrence and reas surance so that war can better be avoided and the likelihood and costs of escalation of any war that should occur can be limited.

A few recent analyses, including a June 2000 Pentagon report to Congress on the military power of the PRC, are big improvements over the arguments made in the peer competitor debate.

 (19.) Author's not-for-attribution interview with a civilian security analyst in the Chinese government, in Beijing, June 2000.

He seemed to be implying that this was regrettable but preferable perhaps to fighting an even larger war in the more distant future. 

 (20.) Author interviews with Chinese officials, government analysts, and scholars, in Beijing, January 2001. 

 (21.) Author interviews with civilian and military government experts in Beijing and Shanghai, 1995-2000. In a June 2000 interview in Beijing, one government analyst pointed out that belief in the high likelihood of war with the United States over Taiwan in the next ten years has become so widespread that strange fault lines have emerged in the party. He claims that now the soft-line elements in the party are the ones who believe that the United States will likely not get involved militarily in Taiwan scenarios or will leave quickly if it does, whereas hard-liners are preaching for more strike capacity against U.S. forces and U.S. bases. His point was that under normal conditions, where war is not considered inevitable, one would expect only hard-liners to be stating that war could be won cheaply, and soft-liners to be arguing for the hopelessness of the use of force for securing political goals. For an article in a pro-Beijing Hong Kong journal that says the United States might fight hard for awhile before e ventually backing down, see Tsiao Hsia, "U.S. Constraints on China's Use of Force in Resolving the Taiwan Issue," Kuang Chiao China's [Wide angle], February 16, 2000, pp. 43-45, in FBIS-China, February 16, 2000. Tsao writes: "China's use of force in achieving reunification with Taiwan is extremely unfavorable to the United States. If the war is indefinitely stalled or extended, it will be no different from another 'Vietnam War.' The United States will do its utmost to contain the war within a limited spatial or time frame. This will be favorable to China. However, this does not preclude the fact that the United States and Taiwan may resort to extreme measures."

 (34.) One military strategy book emphasizes the political means to separate attackers from their alliances. See Huang Yuzhang, chief ed., Junshi Zhanlue Gailun [Introduction to military strategy] (Beijing: National Defense University Press, December 1991), pp. 264-265 (military circulation only). You Ji similarly discusses China's need to be able to attack Japan if Tokyo decides to give assistance to U.S. efforts in Taiwan. See You, "Chinese Military Security/Foreign Policy Challenge in the New Century"; and You, The Armed Forces of China, p. 204. Several of my interlocutors in China in 1999 and 2000 also argued that Japanese assistance to U.S. forces in a Taiwan scenario would amount to a Japanese declaration of war on China and that China is developing its capability to attack U.S. bases in Japan. 

 (35.) Over the past few years, Chinese interlocutors have emphasized that the PLA is developing better means to strike Japan and U.S. bases in Japan with conventional missiles. Without direct reference to Japan, an internally circulated military text discusses the conventional arm of the Second Artillery, the PLA's rocket force, in the following terms: "The surface-to-surface missile weapons of the Second Artillery's conventional missile battle groups [changgui daodan junyi juntuan] have the special characteristics of being long range, highly accurate, high speed, powerful [weili da], and so on. This is an extremely abundant [jifu] high-tech deterrent capability." Wang and Zhang, Zhanyi Xue, p. 379.0 

 (36.) Along these lines, Chief of the General Staff Gen. Fu Quanyou argues that "there is inferiority within superiority and weakness within strength" and that high-tech advancements in weaponry have left "a vast leeway for the weaker side, giving free rein to man's courage and superior intelligence." See Fu, "Deepen the Study of the Characteristics and Laws of High-Technology Local War and Raise the Standard of Guidance for Winning High-Technology Local War of the Future," Zhongguo Junshi Kexue, February 20, 1999, pp. 6-14, in FBIS-China, July 1, 1999. 

 (37.) Amphibious assault using conventional and unconventional assets, such as an armada of fishing and merchant vessels, has been discussed in my interviews and in PLA writings. See, for example, Wang and Zhang, Zhanyi Xue, chap. 17, on amphibious landing. But because a direct successful amphibious assault would likely require a great deal of military might that China lacks, for the purpose of this article, I focus on other scenarios that might be alternatives to a direct amphibious assault. 

 (38.) A consistent argument by Chinese elites in private over the past two years is that Beijing does not demand that Taiwan simply become part of an expanded People's Republic of China in the unification process. Author interviews with Chinese government analysts in Beijing, Shanghai, and the United States, 1999-2001. For a public statement to this effect to a visiting Taiwan delegation by Vice Premier Qian Qichen, see Maubo Chang, "Qian Qichen Continues 'One China' Pitch to Taiwan Legislators," Central News Agency (Taipei), July 18, 2000, in FBIS-China, July 18, 2000. The article reports: "Qian on Tuesday continued his pitch for Beijing's 'one-China principle' after telling a group of Taiwan media executives in Beijing on July 14 that 'one-China' does not have to mean 'either this or the other,' referring to the two sides of the Taiwan Straits." A Chinese television report quoted Qian Qichen similarly as saying, "There is only one China in the world and both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China. This formulation is very inclusive." See "CCTV [Chinese Central Television] Reports Qian Qichen Interview on PRC-Taiwan Ties," September 11, 2000, in FBIS--China, September 11, 2000. For a more recent formula, see John Pomfret, "Beijing Signals New flexibility on Taiwan," Washington Post, January 5, 2001, p. 1.

 (44.) It might take most of this decade or longer for China to develop a ballistic missile and cruise missile force of sufficient size and accuracy to convince Beijing elites that such an attack could be politically effective. But because the targets of such a campaign would not only be military but psychological, Beijing's standards for sufficiency might be lower than what an objective military assessment based on brute-force capabilities alone might prescribe. Moreover, any combination of Chinese overestimation of the power of PLA missiles or underestimation of Taiwanese, American, or Japanese resolve could make such a missile attack much more likely than we would otherwise expect.

Commenting on the Kosovo war, Yan Xuetong of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations argues that the Yugoslavs drew the lesson that the war would have been impossible for NATO to pursue if Yugoslavia had possessed medium-range ballistic missiles, presumably because Yugoslavian forces could have struck NATO bases in Italy.

As with missile strikes, almost all forms of military activity call for some information warfare, from blinding enemies during all-out invasions to incapacitating the enemy's ability to track mine-laying submarines and to clear mines in blockade scenarios.

A recent naval pl an, "the fleet engagement strategy," backed by Secretary of Defense William Cohen, calls for increased "organic" mine-hunting and minesweeping capabilities within battle groups that would involve airborne (helicopters), surface, and submarine-based capabilities. It is unclear how effective these initiatives will be in providing U.S. forces in East Asia with readily available capability in a crisis. See Capt. Buzz Broughton and Comdr.

 (68.) Recently, a few American Taiwan experts have argued to this author that Taiwan leaders are extremely unlikely to declare formal independence and that therefore this issue is a red herring. For the purposes of war prevention, however, it might not be enough to convince Taiwanese and Americans of that reality. Beijing elites must also be convinced, and many of them do not appear to be so confident that a Taiwan declaration of independence is impossible long into the future.

 (70.) This is another reason why more explicit efforts by Taipei to demonstrate Taiwan's political and economic resolve against mainland coercion campaigns are potentially problematic. Not only are they unlikely to convince mainland elites that Beijing could not obtain the limited concessions from Taiwan that are discussed above, but they are also likely to fuel conspiracy theories in Beijing that Taiwan is gearing up for a declaration of independence. Such expressions by Taiwan elites might make conflict more likely rather than less likely.

 Invensys axes 2000 more jobs worldwide biz - p8 lead

 ENGINEERING group Invensys today said it was axing a further 2000 jobs from its global workforce as a result of the slowdown in the US economy. 

 But a spokesman for the group, which makes automation systems and controls, said he expected job losses in the United Kingdom "to be minimal". 

 Invensys has 80,000 staff across the UK, US, Europe and Asia. 

 It said today that falling industrial and consumer confidence in the US meant there was a lower demand for appliance and climate controls. 

 Workforce 

 The group was also warned it was suffering from the slowdown in the telecoms and IT sector. It said profit over the second half of its financial year would be marginally below that of the first six months. 

 Invensys announced plans to cut 5000 jobs - or six per cent of the workforce - by the end of this year when it reported its first-half results in November. 

 Invensys was the fourth-worst performing stock on the FTSE-100 Index last year. The factory controls firm warned today that the slowing demand in the US would also hurt fiscal second-half profit before exceptional items. 

 The company, which makes about half of its sales in the US, saw its shares decline 36 per cent in September after it unexpectedly warned the City first-half earnings would drop due to the US slowdown and higher energy prices. 

 "In common with the whole industry, we have seen these conditions exacerbated in our second half by the deteriorating economic environment in the US," the company said in a statement. 

 The statement added that in November fiscal first-half profit fell 85 per cent due to a slowing of US demand and the pounds 515.2 million purchase of Baan NV, an unprofitable Dutch software maker. 

 Invensys shares - which have gained as much as 13 per cent in value this year - fell 15.5 pence, or 12 per cent, on early morning trading today, to 113.5p. 

 BPB, Europe's largest plasterboard maker, also issued a profitwarning today. 

 "North American trading conditions are the predominant cause of the reduction in group operating profit, with the non-repetition of last year's opportunistic sales to the US," the company said. 

 It added that lower selling prices and higher energy costs in the US, a wet winter in Europe and a severe recession in the German construction industry meant underlying pre-tax profit for the year to March 31, 2000 would not exceed GBP 160m. This was against analyst forecasts of GBP 170 to GBP 180m and well down from last year's profit of GBP 224m.

San Jacinto to get its own newspaper

A company is leasing the former Hemet/San Jacinto Chamber of Commerce building and plans to start a newspaper in the San Jacinto Valley.

The Valley Chronicle signed a two-year, $900-a-month lease with Hemet for the 2,400-square-foot building at 395 E. Latham Ave. The company plans to publish a twice-weekly newspaper starting in May, said Hemet City Manager Steve Temple.

The newspaper is headed by Jim Fredericks, former publisher of The Hemet News and its successor, the Hemet News edition of The Press-Enterprise. The city paid $183,000 for the building in January and eventually plans to raze the structure to make room for a city-center park.

Tribune Co. issues profit warning

Tribune Co., a major newspaper publisher and television broadcaster that owns the Los Angeles Times, warned investors that its first quarter profits would be lower than previously forecast.

Citing a decline in advertising revenues, the Chicago-based Tribune said it now expected to post earnings of between 18 and 20 cents per share in the first quarter, compared to the 25 cents analysts had been expecting, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.

Wall Street slithers as Footsie slumps

WALL Street was engulfed by a sea of red again today following another torrid session on London's stock market.  

A string of profit warnings and jobs-cut announcements in the US sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding 228.52 points to 9258.48.  

In the City, the FTSE 100 index neared the end of trading nursing a loss of 231.2 points at 5309.5. Sterling lost a cent at $1.4195.  

Among a clutch of American companies spreading grim news was technology giant Motorola, which said it was pessimistic about prospects for a quick turnaround for its hard-pressed semiconductor business.  

Motorola, also struggling to cope with slack demand for its mobile phones, said its main concern was a downturn in the US telecoms market, but there were growing signs of a slowdown in Europe. Broker Charles Schwab said it was axing about 3000 jobs to cut costs in reaction to declining trading volumes.  

Procter & Gamble said it was to shed another 10,000 jobs worldwide as the Crest toothpaste and Pampers nappies maker expanded plans to cut 15,000 jobs announced last year.  

Britain's two-speed economy was in the spotlight as bad news from industry contrasted sharply with buoyant High Street sales. Industrial controls group Invensys issued its second profit warning in six months, while engineer Laird suffered a near-30% drop in its share price after saying profit expectations would not be met.  

Plasterboard manufacturer BPB added to the gloom, blaming its profit warning on the US slowdown. The grim mood was reflected in the latest survey of almost 900 manufacturers by the Confederation of British Industry, which found order books last month slumped to their lowest since July 1999.  

Meanwhile, fashion chain Next unveiled an 11.8% leap in profits, while Oxford Street store Selfridges reported a whopping 40% jump. Supermarkets group Morrison said its figures were up 15.8%.  

The two-speed economy creates a dilemma for the Bank of England, which sets interest rates for the economy as a whole. Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: "You could clearly make a case for further rate cuts to help manufacturing.  

But the problem is that the consumer remains upbeat and rapid rate reductions risk fuelling inflation."

German uncertainty lights up Powergen

POWERGEN lit up the City today with a rise of 49p to 737p as it emerged that German utilities giant E.ON is poised to take a holding in the company rather than make a full bid.  

Reports in the German Press claim a final decision by the board of E.ON will be made next week, but it is expected that it will offer a 30% premium above Powergen's current share price. Powergen emphasised that it was still in talks with the Germans about a possible offer, but warned: "There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in an offer being made." Talks began in January, but brokers say it is likely the Germans will decide against making a full bid which would run into antitrust problems in the US.  

Powergen now accrues a lot of its revenues from America and is looking to expand further there.  

E.ON may prefer to lend its support to Powergen, rather than control it.  

The rest of the market plunged through the 5500 support level as share prices tumbled to their lowest level since 29 October 1998. Another 235-point fall for the Dow Jones overnight in New York set the pace for the London market and left the FTSE 100 index down 147.5 at 5393.2. That stretches its fall on the week, so far, to 175 points, or 3%.  

Among the hardest hit today was Energis down 231/2p at 256p, Celltech, off 83p at 1029p, and Nycomed 341/2p lower at 433p.  

The market had to contend with another clutch of profit warnings. Foremost among these was blue-chip Invensys, down 163/4p at 1121/4p. This is the industrial controls group's second warning in six months. BPB Industries, down 341/2p at 2191/2p, also saw profits for the current year tumbling from Pounds 224 million to Pounds 160 million. The building products group puts the blame firmly on the downturn in trading in the US, where the economy has slowed considerably. Avon Rubber, down 35p at 136p, said profits in the first five months of the year from its US division have come in substantially below the previous year.  

Former high-flyer Capital Radio also hit the markets with a warning, leaving it nursing a fall of 21212p at 665p. That compares with the peak last year at 1937p.  

Publisher Emap fell 29p to 721p after denying it had been approached by US venture capitalist Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, which wanted to bid up to Pounds 600 million for its portfolio of magazine titles.  

Pearson was another publisher coming under the hammer with the price falling 106p to 1225p. Broker UBS Warburg has lowered its target price for the shares from 1650p to 1500p after downgrading its earnings estimates by 2%.  

The broker has also cut its price target for Dimension Data, down 133/4p at 2891/4p, from 415p to 375p but is bullish about prospects for Scottish & Newcastle, 31/2p easier at 527p, and has raised its target price 50p to 550p.  

Martha Lane Fox's hapless Lastminute.com clawed back some of yesterday's losses with a rise of 11/2p at 41p. The directors moved into the market yesterday, buying more shares in the hope of restoring confidence about the online retailer's future.  

Chief executive Brent Hoberman bought 127,273 at 39.3p, or Pounds 50,000, lifting his total holding to 15.8 million, or 9.3%. Lane Fox spent Pounds 10,000 on 25,454, taking her holding to 10.2 million, or 5.9% and chairman Allan Leighton bought 127,273, bumping his total holding up to 197,273.

 United Parcel Service warns of lower first-quarter earnings

 ATLANTA (AP) - United Parcel Service Inc. warned investors Thursday that its first-quarter earnings will fall as much as 12 percent below last year as its U.S. package hauling business continues to struggle through a weak economy. 

 The express-shipping giant also cautioned that its second-quarter prospects appear bleaker than it had expected. It was the second consecutive quarterly profit warning from Atlanta-based UPS. 

 UPS said it expects first-quarter per-share earnings to total 49 to 51 cents, compared with 56 cents a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected first-quarter earnings of 57 cents per share. 

 "We anticipated the first quarter would be difficult and thought we could achieve earnings per share slightly above last year," said Scott Davis, UPS' chief financial officer. But "the economy has proven to be even more challenging, and therefore we do not believe we will attain that target." 

 UPS shares fell more than 3 percent, or $1.81, to close at $55.89 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Lazard Freres analyst Gregory Burns said investors were displeased to see profit margins "have contracted quite a bit" in UPS' core U.S. delivery business. The company also has been hurt by higher utility costs during the quarter, he said. 

 "We feel pretty comfortable that the slowdown is sharper and quicker than expected, but the larger issue has been the predictability of earnings at UPS and the ability of their cost structure to quickly adjust," Burns said. 

 "In general, we're telling people to buy the stock." 

 UPS said its first-quarter volume is up overall, and international export package volume rose 15 percent. But domestic volume has increased only about 1 percent during the last two months, the company said. 

 If current economic conditions persist, UPS expects its second-quarter earnings to be 55 to 60 cents per share, Davis said. In the second quarter last year, per-share earnings were 60 cents. Before the warning, analysts had predicted UPS would post earnings of 64 cents per share in the second quarter. 

 The shipping giant cautioned in January that 2001 would be a sluggish year for growth, especially during the first half. 

 UPS plans to release its first-quarter results April 19.

 Goldman Sachs earnings fall 13% amid sluggish markets 

 New York, March 20 (BridgeNews) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS), among Wall Street's top arrangers of stock and bond sales and mergers, said first-quarter earnings fell 13% as slumping markets undermined investment banking and underwriting income. However, the company beat analyst expectations as asset management fees and the acquisition of market-maker Spear Leeds Kellogg last year fueled securities services revenue. ( Story .5971 ) 

 US stocks higher; Dow breaks above 10,000 

 New York, March 20 (BridgeNews) - U.S. stocks turned higher, with strength in retail and cyclical stocks lifting the Dow above the 10,000 level. Volume was light ahead of the Fed's interest rate decision around 1415 ET. Traders expect at least a 50 basis point rate cut, but many are hoping for a 75 basis point adjustment. The Dow Jones industrial average was last up 39 points at 9997 while the Nasdaq composite index was up 14 points at 1965. ( Story .1300 ) 

 US trade deficit widened 0.2% in January 

 Washington, March 20 (BridgeNews) - The U.S. trade deficit widened 0.2% in January to $33.3 billion, just above expectations, which matched the revised December trade gap of $33.2 billion. Exports of capital and consumer goods rose, and imports of consumer goods, automobiles and industrial supplies also increased. The January deficit, the highest since the record shortfall in September, reflected a $39.5-billion deficit in goods anda $6.2-billion surplus in services. ( Story .4764 ) 

 Brazilian oil rig sinks after rescue efforts fail 

 Sao Paulo, March 20 (BridgeNews) - A 40-story-tall oil platform operating off the coast of Rio de Janeiro sank around 0830 ET, a spokesman for state-owned oil giant Petrobras said. The platform was hit by an explosion and fire Thursday. Prior to the accident, the platform was pumping 80,000 barrels per day of crude oil. Television reports said some 1.5 million liters of crude oil and diesel fuel may have spilled into the ocean during the sinking. ( Story .15891 ) 

 Argentina's Cavallo replaces Lopez Murphy as economy minister 

 Buenos Aires, March 20 (BridgeNews) - Domingo Cavallo, who took over as Argentina's economy minister earlier Tuesday after Ricardo Lopez Murphy resigned, said he will attack the nation's fiscal problems by spurring economic growth. He proposed cutting government deficit by $3 billion this year, and said he would ask Congress to enact laws to fight contraband, corruption and tax evasion, problems that cost the government billions in lost tax revenue each year. ( Story .13533 ) 

 Tyson Foods warns on Q2 earnings, moves closer to IBP merger 

 New York, March 20 (BridgeNews) - Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) told investors that severe winter weather and higher grain and energy costs would wipe out its second-quarter profits, leaving it to just break even. Analysts had expected the company to earn 6 to 10 cents per share. At the same, meatpacking giant IBP (IBP) took a significant step toward completing its planned sale to Tyson by finally releasing its fourth-quarter fiiancial results, essentially resolving an accounting inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ( Story .5972 ) 

 US Federal Reserve seen cutting rates by at least 50 basis points 

 New York, March 20 (BridgeNews) - Given the weakness of the U.S. economy and growing trouble in Japan, the Fed is broadly expected to cut the federal funds rate by at least half a percentage point. That would put the key rate at 5.00%. But more and more investors expect the Fed to cut rates by 75 basis points, in part because of the plunge in U.S. equities in recent weeks. A March 16 BrindgeNews poll of 22 analysts, found the odds of a 50-basis-point cut at 63%, while the probability of a 75-basis-point cut was pegged at 43%. ( Story .213 ) 

 ArvinMeritor lowers second-quarter earnings outlook 

 Detroit, March 20 (BridgeNews) - Auto parts supplier ArvinMeritor Inc. (ARM) said lower vehicle production and a softening U.S. economy would hurt its second quarter and fiscal 2001 earnings. The company now expects sales for the second quarter to be about $1.8 billion, down 13% from the previous year, and earnings per share to be between 40 cents and 45 cents, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of 51 cents.

The company said its components and consumer electronics division is likely to repo2t negative income from operations because of continued weakness in the U.S. economy and in the telecommunications and personal computer sectors.

Abreast of the Market
 Fed's in Focus as Stocks Swoon --- Industrial Average Posts 7.7% Drop for Week, Sheds Record Points --- Some Investors Say Rate Cut of `Only' One-Half Point Won't Do the Trick

 A week that started bad ended worse, with continued sharp declines of all major stock indexes leaving investors unnerved in advance of a pivotal meeting Tuesday of the U.S. Federal Reserve.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a cumulative 821.21 points, or 7.7%, its biggest one-week point drop ever and its worst percentage drop in nearly 12 years, as the tech-stock wreck continued to spread to other parts of the market.   

 On Friday, the industrial average shed 2.1%, or 207.87 points, to 9823.41. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 992 issues advancing, 2,056 declining and 227 unchanged. Big Board volume rose to 1,543,558,930 shares from 1,220,106,870 shares Thursday.   

 Now, wary investors are hoping that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his economy cops at the Fed will cut interest rates sufficiently to halt what has been a wrenching decline. In fact, the prospect of such a Fed easing of rates by another one-half percentage point or perhaps even three-fourths is about the only positive thing on the horizon for stocks.   

 Dreadful earnings news. Margin calls. Turmoil in the Japanese economy. Still-high valuations on many stocks. All of these elements combined last week to keep the once-cocky Nasdaq Composite Index on its slide -- now at 1890.91, down nearly 63% from last year's record 5048.62 -- and to push the Dow industrials toward bear-market territory.   

 The selling sent some technology stocks, which traded at ludicrously high prices a year ago, even lower. Shares of beleaguered Lucent Technologies finished Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $9.99 (11.15 euros), sounding like a markdown price at a convenience store. The stock is down 85% from its past year's high of $66.61.   

 The relentless sell-off of tech stocks is more and more spilling over to other sectors in part because margin calls, in which individual investors have to sell stocks or otherwise come up with cash to pay off loans from their brokers, have grown enormously in recent days. And many investors appear to be dumping easy-to-trade blue-chip stocks, such as Walt Disney, which shed 1.7% Friday, to meet a margin call, rather than selling just their beaten-down tech stocks.   

 This has contributed to the recent weakness in the industrial average, which includes Disney. In fact, all 30 components of the industrial average were down for the week, which rarely happens even on bad weeks. While the industrial average's week wasn't one of the worst on a percentage basis, because the index is still at historically high levels, it still was bad -- the weakest since a decline of nearly 7.8% for the week that ended Oct. 13, 1989.   

 As a result, the industrial average, which was the one major U.S. index to avoid the "bear market" label triggered by a 20% drop from a high, is getting closer to that dubious distinction now. At 9823.41, it stands 16% off last year's record 11722.98.   

 All of which has investors anxiously looking to the Fed as central-bank policy makers meet Tuesday to chart the economy's course. It is considered a given that the Fed will cut its key short-term rate, the federal-funds rate, by a half-percentage-point to 5%. It made similar cuts -- two in January -- and only the first one spurred a stock-market rally, which has long since evaporated.   

 Some traders and investors now are hoping for three-quarters-point cut, figuring that a cut of "only" one-half point -- which traditionally is a healthy cut, given that the Fed often moves rates in quarter-point increments -- won't be enough to steady stocks.   

 "The Fed doesn't like its decisions made for it by (market and media) commentators" and other outsiders, says veteran market strategist Robert Stovall, of Prudential Securities. But some traders worry that, barring unexpected good news for the market, a cut of just a half-point could even spark a sell-off in stocks and bonds.   

 The Fed "is not in the business of bailing out the stock market," agrees Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "But the Fed is now between a rock and a hard place," Mr. Steinberg said in a report to clients Friday. "Alan Greenspan identified confidence as crucial in keeping the economy from recession. Relentless stock declines put both consumer and business confidence at risk."   

 The question is, can the Fed really turn around the stock market with a flick of the basis-point pen? The answer: sort of. A series of rate cuts almost always leads to higher stock prices. But it doesn't always happen immediately. In 1990, for example, the Fed started cutting rates in July, but the stock market didn't bottom until October. The economy didn't stop contracting until the following March.   

 The industrial average hasn't been in a bear market since that October 1990 low point. It got oh-so-close to falling into one in 1998. But then it pulled out.   

 And that is exactly what many individual investors seem to be banking on now. Mindful of the advice that investors should rise out of stock-market storms and not panic, many individual investors have been remarkably stoic during the current pullback. They are confident that the market must surely be close to a bottom by now.   

 That may or may not be a good thing. Many analysts say the market won't be washed out enough to rally again until investors "capitulate" and allow shares to fall even more to even-lower valuations, relieving downward pressure.   

 "Just because a stock goes from $80 to $18, like Cisco, doesn't mean it's cheap. It's only cheap when no one wants to own it," says Mr. Stovall. Cisco recently dropped to a 52-week low of $18.38, down 78% from its past year's high of $82.   

 Mr. Stovall says he can't believe what happens at investment seminars, like the one he recently appeared at in Miami, at which some investors continue to cling to the notion that their tech-stock highfliers must be ready to turn around. He tries to talk about water utilities and railroad stocks and other ways to conservatively invest in this market, "and they say, `How about JDS Uniphase and EMC and Sun Microsystems?' (Investors) haven't changed. They still think they're gonna get even in Oracle," which is down 70% from its high. (It would take a 230% gain for the stock to rebound to that high.)   

 What happened to the industrial-average stocks last week, says Tony Cecin, head of stock trading at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, is that "people got a little nervous about how badly the Nasdaq had been performing, and looked to raise funds in a market that hadn't done so badly yet . . . It's been eerily calm as it's going down."   

 Some big-name stocks are trading at prices "that people never thought they would get to," said Robert McCooey, president of Griswold Co., a Big Board floor brokerage. He cited not only Lucent but Ariba at $10.19, down from its $173.50 high on Nasdaq. The highlight of the day on the Big Board Friday "was the closing bell," he added.   

 Theodore Weisberg, a floor trader for Seaport Securities, said buyers "seem to have taken a vacation." This is "in an environment where the focus is on the negative rather than the positive, which is the opposite of a year ago, at least as far as tech stocks are concerned."   

 The Nasdaq, with last week's 7.9% drop of its own, suffered its 13th-worst weekly percentage decline. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, whose largest stocks include scores of Nasdaq tech issues, suffered its third-worst week in point terms, dropping 82.89 points, or 6.7%, to 1150.53. The index, which dropped into bear-market territory a week ago today by tumbling below the 20% threshold, is now nearly 25% off its high.   

 Among other notable market movers in the March Madness that descended upon the stock market Friday:   

 International Business Machines lost $5.46 to $90.10, while Hewlett-Packard gave up $2.60 to $28.10, after another personal-computer manufacturer, Compaq Computer, served up a profit warning. Compaq shares lost 50 cents to $18.   

 The shortcomings for the industrial average weren't limited to the technology sector. A host of economically sensitive stocks declined, as investors continued to debate what action the Fed might take. United Technologies fell $4.32 to $71.43, while Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing lost $3.23 to $106.01 and Boeing tumbled $2.35 to $53.75.   

 Shares of Adobe managed to post a gain, rising $3.63 to $28.63 on Nasdaq. The San Jose, California, computer software developer reported fiscal first-quarter profit late Thursday that beat expectations, though it lowered its revenue projections for the current quarter. Analysts responded affirmatively to the results, with Credit Suisse First Boston raising its rating, saying that the risk/reward prospects are favorable.   

 ASM Lithography fell $2.75 to $20.25 on Nasdaq. The Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker warned that weakness in demand for its lithography tools will hurt its 2001 results. Andrx gained $4.20 to $43.52 on Nasdaq. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pharmaceuticals maker, which fell 21% Thursday on worries about delays in the approval of its generic version of a popular ulcer drug, recovered on some upbeat comments from Merrill Lynch. The firm said the stock's price presumed a worst-case scenario for delay of the necessary approvals.   

 Williams-Sonoma fell $1.64 to $27.87. The San Francisco specialty retailer said Gary Friedman, its president and chief operating officer, resigned to pursue other opportunities.

 US downturn hits Compaq and Oracle

 The slowing US economy is continuing to take its toll on vendors as Compaqyesterday announced plans to slash 5,000 jobs, while Oracle drew caution aboutits future business predictions. 

 Compaq's announcement that it would cut seven per cent of its workforce came as it warned that its first quarter earnings would barely be above those of the same quarter last year. 

 It expects earnings per sharefor its first quarter to be flat at between 12 and 14 cents, while revenue would be four per cent lower than last year, dropping to between $9bn and $9.2bn. 

 Most of the job cuts would be as a result of the merger between its commercial and consumer personal computer operations into a single Access Business Group. Staff in the company's access, supply chain and marketing groups would be affected, said Compaq. 

 Compaq chief executive, Michael Capellas, said: "We see continued weakness in the US economy, and resultant pricing pressures. Despite the slowdown, we are pleased with market acceptance of our enterprise products driven byour ability to offer end-to-end solutions and services." 

 The company expects the move to result in a restructuring charge of between $125m and $150m in the first quarter. 

 Meanwhile, Oracle met lowered expectations for its third quarterresults as earnings per share came in at a sixth lower than Wall Street's original estimates. The company issued a profit warning earlier this month, which resulted in its stock falling by more than a fifth on the day of the announcement. 

 Revenue for the period ended 28 February increased to $2.7bn, compared with $2.4bn last year, while net profit jumped 16 per cent to $583m, or 10 cents a share. Net income last year was $503m, or eight cents a share. 

 Oracle chief financial officer, Jeff Henley, said: "The US economic downturn over the past several months clearly affected our revenue and profit growth more than we anticipated, due to a sharp downturn in completed transactions in the last few days of the quarter, and the current economic uncertainty continues to limit our visibility going forward." 

 The company said it saw strong growth in its application software business, which increased 25 per cent to $249m. Sales of its database softwareand services grew six per cent and 12 per cent, to $823m and $1.5bn respectively.

 WALL Street's worst week in 10 years has local investors on edge. 

 The pessimism that pummelled "The Street" on Friday leaving the US market with its biggest weekly losses in a decade is expected to batter the local bourse in early trade today. 

 The steep sell-off wiped $US772 billion ($A1.6 trillion) off the value of US stocks and came despite high hopes of an up to 75 basis point cut in rates when the Federal Reserve meets overnight tomorrow. 

 Blue chip stocks in the United States capped off their worst-ever weekly point drop on Friday with a 2.1 per cent nose dive. 

 Wall Street investors, wracked with doubts about the economic and corporate profit outlook, drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average 207.87 points lower to 9823.41. 

 The bluechip barometer plunged 821.21 or 7.71 per cent in the week, its biggest weekly loss since the dark days of October, 1989. 

 Australian stocks will start on the back foot but could claw back some ground on the back of bargain hunters. 

 "Our market shouldn't be falling by anywhere near the same extent," said Commonwealth Securities chief economist Craig James. 

 "It is likely we'll start down 10 to 15 points but I expect the market will hold up reasonably well." 

 He said the low Australian dollar should kick along resource stocks as well as exporters and companies with overseas earnings, and the prospect of an interest rate cut should help sentiment. 

 "A lot of astute investors who have been sitting on the sidelines are seeing good buying opportunities in the current environment," Mr James said, noting that the Australian market had been near record territory a week ago. 

 Friday's slide was triggered by the latest profit warning from Compaq Computers and further disheartening news from the US Fed about the ongoing slide in industrial production. 

 Compaq, a tech sector bellwether, announced it would fall-short of Wall St's first-quarter forecast and cut 7 per cent of its workforce. 

 Australian investors, with little in the way of domestic data out this week, will look to the Fed decision as a signpost to what action the Reserve Bank will take at its next meeting on April 3. 

 Westpac's Don Hamson yesterday flagged a likely 50 point cut in Australian rates, while acknowledging that many economists were starting to lean towards the 75 point mark. 

 Of US rates, he said anything less than a 50 point cut this week would spark a sell-off on Wall St, which would flow on to Australia. 

 "If they get the 75 then it may also be perceived to be bad because people will think that the Fed believes it's bad or worse than what most people expect," Mr Hamson said. 

 Macquarie Bank said continued aggressive easing by the Fed would create room for the RBA board to contemplate a larger reduction. 

 The outlook for the Aussie dollar, which hit a record low of US49.06 in New York trading last week, remains bleak. 

 The dollar closed in London on Friday at US49.38 and in New York at US49.45, after ending local trading at US49.30. 

 Mr James said the outlook for the Aussie this week would depend on the US dollar, with no major domestic economic news to drive it.

 THE pessimism that pummelled Wall Street on Friday, leaving the US market with its biggest weekly losses in a decade, will batter the local bourse in early trade today. The steep sell-off wiped $US772 billion off the value of US stocks and came despite high hopes of an up to 75 basis point cut in interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets overnight tomorrow (Australian time). The outlook for the Aussie dollar, which hit a record low of US49.06 in New York trading last week, also remained bleak. The dollar closed in London on Friday at US49.38 and in New York at US49.45, after ending local trading at US49.30.

In the US it has been a different story, with the Nasdaq technology composite index tumbling 49.80 points or 2.57 per cent to 1890.91 on Friday, its lowest point since November, 1998. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 sagged 23.03 points or 2 per cent to 1150.53, having lost a quarter of its value from its high of 1527.46 a year ago.

 As U.S. Stocks Crumble, All Eyes Turn to the Fed --- Industrial Average Posts 7.7% Drop for Week --- Some Investors Say Rate Cut of `Only' One-Half Point Won't Do the Trick

 A week that started bad ended worse, with continued sharp declines of all major stock indexes leaving investors unnerved in advance of a pivotal meeting Tuesday of the U.S. Federal Reserve.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell a cumulative 821.21 points, or 7.7%, its biggest one-week point drop ever and its worst percentage drop in nearly 12 years, as the tech-stock wreck continued to spread to other parts of the market.   

 On Friday, the industrial average shed 2.1%, or 207.87 points, to 9823.41. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 992 issues advancing, 2,056 declining and 227 unchanged. Big Board volume rose to 1,543,558,930 shares from 1,220,106,870 shares Thursday.   

 Now, wary investors are hoping that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his economy cops at the Fed will cut interest rates sufficiently to halt what has been a wrenching decline. In fact, the prospect of such a Fed easing of rates by another one-half percentage point or perhaps even three-fourths is about the only positive thing on the horizon for stocks.   

 Dreadful earnings news. Margin calls. Turmoil in the Japanese economy. Still-high valuations on many stocks. All of these elements combined last week to keep the once-cocky Nasdaq Composite Index on its slide -- now at 1890.91, down nearly 63% from last year's record 5048.62 -- and to push the Dow industrials toward bear-market territory.

 Silicon Valley Down 11% On 2001  Profit Warning

 Silicon Valley Bankshares, the Santa Clara, Calif., company whose lending is closely tied to the technology sector, saw its shares fall 10.9% Friday after it had issued a profit warning for the year. 

 Late Thursday, John H. Dean, the bank's president and chief executive, cut his earnings estimate for the year to a range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share, from $3, and well below the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of $2.84. The share price fell to $23 Friday, down $2.8125. 

 Though Mr. Dean said that the company expects earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents per share this quarter (68 cents would match the consensus), some on Wall Street expressed concern, and one analyst downgraded the stock. 

 Silicon Valley's announcement came during one of the worst weeks in the stock market in some time as the selloff in technology stocks spread throughout the market. 

 Citing a slowdown in cash flow from the venture capital sector, coupled with the expiration of certificates of deposit, Silicon Valley reported a 6% decline in average deposits during the first two months of the year. 

 The company also said it has identified three loans with a combined value of $8.8 million that could become nonperformers, and it said nonperforming assets could rise to 1.5% of total loans in the first quarter, from 1.07% in the preceding quarter. 

 However, Mr. Dean said that average loans grew 5% in the first two months and earnings should increase 6% to 14% this year. 

 "Other aspects of our financial performance remain quite strong," Mr. Dean said in the statement Thursday, "in particular our net interest margin and efficiency ratio." 

 But though Mr. Dean's statement calmed some analysts, Jordan Hymowitz of Robertson Stephens in San Francisco was less convinced and cut his rating to "long-term attractive," from "buy." 

 "Individually, we do not feel that these two issues would justify a downgrade at this point," he wrote in his research note about credit quality and deposit deterioration. "However, these factors, combined with Silicon Valley's lending franchise being so closely tied to the technology and life sciences industries, leads us to conclude that downside risk to Silicon Valley's earnings outweighs the upside potential throughout 2001." 

 Rosalind Looby of Credit Suisse First Boston expressed disappointment at the bank's performance but said she was surprised that margins had improved to 7.2% for January and February. She had expected 6.8% and subsequently kept her rating at "buy," and Joseph K. Morford of Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis saw no reason to back off his "strong buy." 

 Also bullish on the stock is Frank J. Barkocy, director of research at Keefe Managers, who said that concerns about the dot-com situation and the technology industry are overblown. "I had a close look at the bank for several weeks and anticipated the announcement," he said. "The remarks are not nearly as bad as suggested by some investors." 

 Keefe Managers increased its position in Silicon Valley on Friday. The company did not want to disclose how many shares it bought, but according to Bloomberg the firm had owned 63,500 shares as of Thursday. 

 Meanwhile, in another messy day for the broad market, the American Banker index of 225 banks fell 2.33%, and its index of top 50 banks 1.71%. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.96%, and the Nasdaq composite index 2.57%.

Tech shares can still give investors another bruising - Tempus.

LIKE a punch-drunk fighter, London's techMARK index of battered high-tech stocks dragged itself off the canvas on Thursday to stage a half-hearted rally. It could not last. Larry Ellison, the mercurial head of Oracle, stepped into the ring after the close of UK trading and sent the index back to the floor with a profit warning that ended any illusion of a sustained recovery by the world's tech stocks.

The techMARK, which just 12 months ago peaked at 5,743.3, yesterday fell 4.7 per cent to a record low of 2,068.93. In the year that it has taken techMARK to fall 64 per cent, Nasdaq has lost 62 per cent but the FTSE all-share has shed just 14 per cent.

Fears of a hard landing by the US economy and growing evidence of a fall in corporate spending on technology and telecoms, starting in the US and perhaps spreading to Europe, have sapped all confidence in tech stocks.

A year ago the City was comfortable with prospective p/e ratios in the sector of 70 to 100 times - if, indeed, companies were even making profits. Now a p/e of 30 to 35 raises eyebrows.

The entire climate is reminiscent of the Y2K-related depression - first the "slowdown" in IT spending and then the "hangover" - that persisted through most of 2000. And there are disturbing similarities between company reactions to both events.

The Y2K issue undoubtedly hurt many companies. But it is equally clear that it presented a neat opportunity for some companies to cover up poor management or investment decisions.

As Y2K recedes from the headlines, companies, and their shareholders, find themselves facing a new enemy in the weak US economy. Few of the tech sector profit statements issued in recent weeks have failed to mention it.

The slowdown in the US economy, which will see corporate America tighten its purse strings, is cause for serious concern. Is it possible, however, that some of the biggest names - think of Cisco and Nortel - have used evidence of a slowing US economy to trim over-enthusiastic Wall Street expectations that companies themselves have fuelled over the past five years? If the big guys are hurting, smaller companies on this side of the Pond can point to the impact of the US economy with impunity. Investors should be vigilant for UK companies that appear just too eager to blame the US for problems closer to home.

There is no doubt that the fall in the entire tech sector has opened up some extraordinary value for long-term investors. But the feedback received from fund managers by companies in recent weeks is clear: why buy now when I can buy cheaper later?

The consensus is that the June quarter will see more bad news in the form of earnings disappointments. It may not be until late summer or autumn that conditions stabilise, a clearer picture of the US malaise emerges and investors remember that tech and telecoms are the economy's fastest-growing sectors.

For several months at least, the prospect of short-term outperformance in all but a minority of tech stocks is remote. The travails that have befallen behemoths such as Oracle prove the fragility of the sector. Investors assessing tech stocks should exercise extreme caution.

Stockmarkets around the world tumbled. America's high-tech Nasdaq Composite index fell below 2,000 for the first time since December 1998 as profit warnings and other bad news pushed down shares in high-tech companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered too-a disturbing new development. Europe's and Japan's stockmarkets also crumbled.

America's slowing economy claimed victims at Cisco Systems, a vast communications-equipment company. The firm announced the lay-off of up to 5,000 full-time and 3,000 temporary workers from its staff of 44,000.

See article: The technology slump

Ericsson, a giant telecoms-equipment maker, issued a profits warning, causing its shares to plummet 20%. Flagging handset demand also hit Motorola, America's mobile-equipment leader. It said that 7,000 jobs would go in addition to the 11,000 announced since December.

Siemens, a huge German engineering and telecoms-equipment maker, issued a profit warning. It blamed falling demand for memory chips, a big earner. The European company's news followed similar bad tidings from America's big chip makers.

See article: The technology slump

Razorfish, a once high-flying American Internet consultancy, was said to be planning more job cuts. It recently shed 20% of its staff of 1,800. MarchFirst, another web consultancy, lost three leading executives.

Cable & Wireless, a formerly somnolent British telecoms company, said that it would cut 11% of its workforce-some 4,000 employees-over the next year and that profits would be below its own forecasts. The company's shares fell 20%.

Warren Buffett, dubbed the sage of Omaha for his stock-picking acumen, reclaimed his title after two bad years. The oracle's reputation suffered when he declined to jump on the tech-stock bandwagon; it was restored with the news that his Berkshire Hathaway investment company had made profits of $3.3 billion in 2000, more than double the previous year's earnings.

See article: Face value: Warren Buffett, an oracle back in form

Prudential, a British life insurer, agreed to acquire an American counterpart, American General, for $20 billion-plus. Prudential described the purchase as "transformational". Investors thought the cost too high, transformed holdings into cash and wiped 14% off Prudential's shares.

Derek Bonham, chairman of Imperial Tobacco, will step down from the board of GlaxoSmithKline, the world's third-largest drug company, after pressure from executives at the company. They sensed a conflict of interest between his role at a cigarette company and his non-executive directorship at a firm that makes anti-smoking aids and drugs.

Antitrust regulators and private-sector lawyers agreed in principle to establish a "global competition committee". The idea is to improve co-ordination among national competition authorities.

An American bankruptcy court dismissed rival offers for Trans World Airlines leaving the way open for a $742m bid for the bankrupt airline from American Airlines. American will become the world's largest airline and control a large slice of the home market.

BFGoodrich, an American aerospace and engineering company, won a contract worth up to $3 billion to design and make the main landing gear for Airbus Industrie's new A380 "superjumbo". European rivals did not lose out completely; Messier Dowty, a French firm, landed a less lucrative contract to supply the nose wheel.

BAE Systems, a British defence and aerospace company, made its latest attempt to sidestep competing for valuable defence contracts. The government reportedly rejected a suggestion that it hand straight to BAE a contract for a #13 billion ($19 billion) in-flight refuelling system. BAE has also tried to avoid competing with Thales, a French company, to supply aircraft carriers, and Vosper Thornycroft, a British shipbuilder, for destroyers.

EM.TV, a debt-ridden German TV company, admitted that it was thinking about selling the Jim Henson Company, creator of the Muppet Show. The sale was said to be a condition of a rescue deal by Kirch Group, another German TV outfit. It is unlikely that Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest will fetch anything like the $680m that they cost.

Deutsche Telekom's Ron Sommer and Klaus Esser, former boss of Mannesmann, joined the ranks of managers undergoing investigation by German prosecutors. Mr Esser is accused of warming to the sale of his firm to Vodafone to secure handsome payoffs for his board and himself; Mr Sommer of undervaluing his company to ensure the success of a recent share offering.

Japan avoided slipping into recession. Its economy grew by a sluggish 0.8% at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, giving growth of 1.7% for the year to the end of December. Despite this, bankruptcy figures for the year to the end of February set a record, the current-account surplus fell 64% in January and the Nikkei 225 hit a 16-year low.

Turkey announced an economic-recovery plan. The collapse of its exchange-rate policy had forced it to drop an earlier IMF-backed programme. The new package includes privatisations and banking reforms. The authorities showed they meant business next day, seizing control of Iktisat, a medium-sized bank.

With one profit warning after another, the technology giants are falling to earth. Most blame a short-term downturn, but the truth is more worrying - some of their earlier growth was illusory.

With one profit warning after another, the technology giants are falling to earth. Most blame a short-term downturn, but the truth is more worrying: some of their earlier growth was illusory

LIKE all good cartoon characters, the world's biggest technology companies kept running obliviously in mid-air long after the economic ground fell away beneath them. Technology was different, they explained, somehow insulated from the worst of business cycles; there was no need for them to lower profit estimates dramatically, as so many other firms had done. The likes of Cisco and Intel were not frothy dotcoms; they were the engines of the "new economy", turning to the beat of a technological revolution, not consumer whim. Sun Microsystems even argued that people would buy more of its pricey servers in bad times because they made companies more efficient and would be seen as a cost-cutting investment. But eventually, even in cartoons, gravity wins.

Over the past few weeks, most of the leading technology firms have conceded that they cannot fight the forces pulling them down. On March 9th Cisco shocked the market with news that it was laying off up to 8,000 workers, the first big reduction in its history. "There's no question-we got knocked on our tails," said John Chambers, its chief executive. The day before, Intel had announced 5,000 job cuts of its own and said that revenues for the present quarter would be down by 25% from the previous one.

Since then, the clamour of tech giants confessing that they were more exposed than they thought has grown louder. On March 12th Ericsson gave a warning that it would suffer a pre-tax loss of as much as $513m in the quarter, and not break even as it had thought. The next day, Motorola said it would post its first quarterly loss for 16 years and cut 7,000 jobs in one of its mobile-phone units. Meanwhile, slow sales in a semiconductor subsidiary caused Siemens to issue a warning just a day after it listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange; it claimed that it was as surprised by the chip slowdown as anyone. Oracle and Sun have chimed in with their own bad news.

With each warning, the stockmarket has reacted by slashing the price not only of the company with the bad news but also of its main rivals-a sign that investors suspect companies across the technology industry have been unrealistic in their assurances that they could weather the storm. Worse, there is reason to think that this is not just a short squall. The frantic revenue growth of the past few years-as much as 500% a year for optical firms such as JDS Uniphase-now looks less like a new paradigm than another side-effect of the stockmarket bubble. This suggests that, when growth returns, it will be at far lower rates than in the past.

The notion that the technology industry has a natural growth rate far above that of other businesses is an entrenched one, and not groundless. For more than a decade, PC sales have been growing at double-digit rates, at times as high as 40% a year. The number of Internet users has doubled every 18 months almost since the medium's creation. Moreover, e-business is an opportunity of vast scope, just starting to be explored, as is the mobile-data industry. The underlying tenets of technology, such as Moore's Law (which states that chip power doubles every 18 months), all seem to imply heady growth for everything they touch.

This (and a bit of Y2K panic) helped explain how technology spending in the United States could grow by 42% in 1998 and 37% (to $820 billion) in 1999, according to META Group's MetricNet. This was a natural response to an unprecedented opportunity: technology had created its own business cycle. Spending on other kinds of capital might trudge higher at single-digit rates as always, but the tech sector was on a steeper curve.

This argument was often heard as the Nasdaq steamed ahead, justifying giddy earnings multiples. When a company as big as Cisco can grow by more than 60% a year, it is hard not to get excited. What could be a safer bet than the continuing growth of Internet traffic and the infrastructure it needed? After all, Cisco was selling real goods, such as routers, not dotcom vapour and banner ads. Surely its growth reflected real demand.

Sadly not. Much of the growth in technology spending turns out to have been a product of the stockmarket bubble, a circular flow of money that put speculative cash into the pockets of technology blue-chips.

This worked in many ways. First, eager venture capitalists and unquestioning IPO markets poured billions of dollars into companies that would otherwise not have been funded at all; much of that money was spent on technology infrastructure, from Sun servers to Oracle databases. This was not just a dotcom phenomenon: by far the biggest excesses came in telecoms, where young companies such as WorldCom were rewarded handsomely by the stockmarket for building new networks almost without regard to underlying demand. Big traditional firms caught the bug too. Spooked by the frantic spending of Nasdaq's darlings, they stepped up their own technology investments to keep pace.

At the same time, investors were financing more competitors in each sector than the market could support. In industries such as telecoms, this led to the creation of overlapping, redundant infrastructure. City streets were torn up again and again as yet another IPO star came through to lay its own fibre. And because the technology vendors themselves had virtually unlimited access to capital, they poured fuel on this fire by offering operators generous loans, which encouraged them to build networks even faster.

On top of this, technology companies often took equity stakes in their customers, or even took shares and options as payment. As the customers' share prices soared, the big vendors saw their earnings boosted by huge capital gains. Last year, Intel alone had investments in more than 450 firms, which were worth more than $10 billion combined at their peak. The tech-stock boom had another effect. The vendors' own rising share prices allowed them to pay employees with stock options rather than cash, creating payroll savings and further boosting profits.

All this grossly inflated the sales and profits of the technology bellwethers. Between April 1999 and June 2000, the average revenue growth of eight of the largest technology firms almost tripled, from 30% year-on-year to nearly 90%; over the same period, the Nasdaq almost doubled (see chart). This created a temporarily virtuous circle: a rising stockmarket boosted the profits of big tech firms, creating the impression of higher sustainable growth. In investors' minds, that in turn justified higher multiples for firms across the board, which sent the stockmarket even higher, and so on.

Now that the bubble has burst, the big firms are learning that real growth in technology spending will probably be far lower than they have been used to. Dotcom customers have gone away or cut their spending radically. In America, at least, the telecoms upstarts are also on the ropes: Cisco estimates that capital spending by new local-access competitors, which were among its best customers in recent years, is down by more than half. Many technology vendors have had to write off their loans; second-hand equipment from bankrupt customers is flooding the market. And bricks-and-mortar companies have turned conservative again. A recent survey by Merrill Lynch found that big corporations planned to increase their tech budgets by only 5-6% this year, half last year's figure.

Some of the present slump is cyclical-an ugly combination of stockmarket crash and economic slowdown, with a lingering Y2K hangover thrown in. But when some sort of equilibrium returns, the former growth will not. Howard Rubin, an analyst at META Group, predicts that post-bubble growth in tech spending will be around 8-10% a year, compared with around 20% for most of the past decade. That is nothing to sneeze at, to be sure, but it is no new paradigm either. Given what happened to the old new paradigm, this may be a good thing.

 The slowing US economy is continuing to take its toll on vendors as Compaqyesterday announced plans to slash 500 jobs, while Oracle drew caution aboutits future business predictions. 

 Compaq's announcement that it would cut seven per centof its workforce cameas it warned that its first quarter earnings would barely be above those ofthe same quarter last year. 

 It expects earnings per share forits first quarter to be flat at between 12and 14 cents, while revenue would be four per cent lower than last year,dropping to between $9bn and $9.2bn. 

 Most of the job cuts would be as a result of the merger between itscommercial and consumer personal computer operations into a single AccessBusiness Group. Staff in the company's access, supply chain and marketinggroups would be affected, said Compaq. 

 Compaq chief executive, Michael Capellas, said: "We see continued weaknessin the US economy, and resultant pricing pressures. Despite the slowdown, weare pleased with market acceptance of our enterprise products driven by ourabilityto offer end-to-end solutions and services." 

 The company expects the move to result in a restructuring charge of between$125m and $150m in the first quarter. 

 Meanwhile, Oracle met lowered expectations for its third quarter results asearnings per share came in at a sixth lower than Wall Street's originalestimates. The company issued a profit warning earlier this month, whichresulted in its stock falling by more than a fifth on the day of theannouncement. 

 Revenue for theperiod ended 28 February increased to $2.7bn, compared with$2.4bn last year, while net profit jumped 16 per cent to $583m, or 10 centsa share. Net income last year was $503m, or eight cents a share. 

 Oracle chief financial officer, Jeff Henley, said: "The US economicdownturn over the past several months clearly affected our revenue andprofit growth more than we anticipated, due to a sharp downturn in completedtransactions in the last few days of the quarter, and the currenteconomicuncertainty continues to limit our visibility going forward." 

 The company said it saw strong growth in its application software business,which increased 25 per cent to $249m. Sales of its database software andservices grew six per cent and 12 per cent, to $823m and $1.5bn respectively.

 Sage leads UK techs lower after Oracle.

 LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Accounting software company Sage Group led UK software companies lower on Friday as the sector reacted to statements overnight from U.S. firms Oracle Corp and Intuit Inc . 

 "We've had a profit warning from Intuit and the Oracle statement wasn't great," said a market maker. 

 By 0900 GMT,Sage was the biggest FTSE 100 loser, down 9.5 percent or 28-1/2 pence to 281-1/2p. Misys , which provides software for the financial and healthcare sectors, traded 28p or 4.6 percent down at 585p, while Logica lost 51p or 4.2 percent to 1,270p. 

 Oracle, the world's second biggest software maker said on Thursday that the slowing U.S. economy had hit database and application software sales in the last quarter and predicted a flat performance in its traditionally strong fourth quarter. 

 Personal finance software products company Intuit warned of slower than expected 2001 revenue growth but added it was still comfortable about earnings forecasts because of strong performance in its financial software units. 

 "This is on the Oracle figures last night. They're pretty similar businesses and they're competitors. If Oracle are having problems, people are putting two and two together and pretty much coming up with four," said another market maker.

 Nasdaq trading firm seeks Dublin manager who enjoys late shift.

 Current Account was intrigued by an advertisement in The Irish Times this week by an unnamed "Nasdaq trading firm" looking for a branch manager to head up a new Dublin branch. 

 Needless to say, the job advertisement - which unusually appeared in a Monday edition rather than the usual Friday Business This Week recruitment advertising pages - has sparked some intense interest as to who this new entrant to the Irish market is. Irish brokers, of course, have been trading increasingly on the Nasdaq market for their clients, but a specialist Nasdaq trader could divert some business away from the domestic players. But with Nasdaq stocks going increasingly pear-shaped as profit warning follows profit warning, it might not be the ideal time for any Nasdaq trader to expand its empire. 

 Still if you've got more than five years experience in "financial industry management" and have "entrepreneurial drive", this could be the job for you. You'll need to like working well into the evening, however, as the job will be based on US stock market hours. That means no knocking off before 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.

 Smaller Company Annual Reports: UNIDARE - Distributor And Water Heater Maker

 From the table below Unidare's shares look extremely cheap. But that was before a profit warning at its AGM earlier this month - and timely news for any American-dominated business. Unidare claims to be the largest pure US wholesaler of industrial products, ranging from welding and hand power tools to paper towels. It likes to acquire regional distribution businesses and turn them into national ones. Unidare operates from 19 US depots and they account for around 80 per cent of sales. The other outlets are in the UK and Eire (three each) and two on the continent. 

 In November, Unidare forecast further sales and profits growth in 2000-01 based on first two months' figures. But demand fell sharply in December as uncertainty "has led many customers to reduce, or delay, their purchasing". That's been particularly evident in the welding market and means that Unidare now has too big a US cost base to handle current order levels. At the same time, it does not want to cut back too much if recession only lasts one or two quarters. Costs of moving to a new warehouse in the north of England have also been higher than expected. So Unidare forecasts that this half year's profits will slump from E5m to E1.5m.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

A profit warning from  Compaq Computer and a less-than-cheery outlook from  Oracle could make for a bumpy end to a wild week on Wall Street. After the closing bell,  Compaq Computer stole the spotlight. Compaq said it will cut 5,000 jobs and get a new chief financial officer. Compaq also expects first-quarter profit of 12 to 14 cents a share, but that's shy of the 18 cents the Street was expecting.

IN THE SPOTLIGHT   

COMPAQ (CPQ)   

CHRISTOFOROUS: Also after the bell,  Oracle unleashed profit of 10 cents a share. That was right in line with estimates. It said that the future looks a little cloudy because of the economy. Also after the bell,  Adobe Systems comes out with earnings that beat the Street by five cents a share.   

Meantime, it was a split decision on Wall Street. A rebound in overseas markets gave a modest boost to US stocks. Bargain hunters scooped up those beaten-down financial stocks, and that sent the Dow back above the 10,000 level but a NASDAQ rally fizzled by the close.

 US STOCK OUTLOOK - NEW SELLOFF PREDICTED - TECH ESTIMATES DROP.

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - The worst may not be behind the stock market as prospects for a second half recovery, especially in the technology sector, grow dimmer each week. 

 A surge of earnings warnings over the past month has lowered economic expectations and share prices along with them. Sharp trading swings marked by turns of violent selling are raising the suspicion of heavier losses to follow. 

 "We are not yet at the extreme bottom. We can expect a bounce up, but it will be followed by extreme selling late in the second quarter when the next warning season unfolds," said Larry Rice, Chief Investment Officer at Josephthal & Co. 

 The first quarter warning season has been the worst on record. Joe Kalinowski, analyst at data firm IBES, calculates that 545 of about 4,500 tracked companies have issued warnings so far this quarter vs. 85 this time last year. "Estimates are in freefall," he said. 

 The outlook for third quarter S&P 500 profits is 3.7 percent, with the fourth quarter seen at 14.7 percent. Though declining, these numbers would be supportive if not for the severe drop underway in the technology sector. Without technologies, S&P 500 profits would be 7.7 percent in the third quarter and 16 percent in the fourth. In either case, first and second quarter profits, long considered a loss in the market, are expected to contract modestly. 

 But technologies can't be excluded. The group is the market's leading sector, the area most sensitive to turns in capital equipment investment. Producers and service providers invest in new equipment in anticipation of future demand. When that demand is not expected, investment declines and, in turn, technology share prices as well. 

 Warnings from Oracle and Compaq hit the headlines on Friday while a warning from Cisco echoed all week along. According to Kalinowski, profit growth for the S&P 500's technology sector (83 companies) is seen at a negative 15.5 percent in third quarter and, thanks to easy comparisons, at a positive 8.7 percent in the fourth. Losses are seen at 30 percent and 28 percent for the first and second quarters. 

 "There will be more warnings before the earnings season begins next month, but I think the worst of the bad news, the deepest of the discounting, is behind," Kalinowski said. 

 But Rice says an earnings bottom is still too early to call, warning that valuations will fall sharply on first signs that the economic downturn will last through the second half. He warns that forced liquidations may return, deepening the market's fall and leading to public "revulsion" against the stock market. 

 A source of closer disappointment is likely to be the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday. A 50 basis point rate cut is the likely outcome, one that will disappoint stock market dealers and analysts who have been calling loudly for 75 points or more.

 US stocks slid in early trade on Wednesday, with the Dow industrials tumbling 325 points, or 3.15 percent, to 9,967 and the Nasdaq falling 56 points, or 2.8 percent, to 1,959. 

 US markets recovered some of Monday's losses on Tuesday in a technical rebound, but many traders expect them to slump again as investors fret about the US economic slowdown and falling corporate earnings. 

 European stocks were earlier Wednesday hammered to their lowest levels since the start of November 1999 as Wall Street's gloom spread around the globe. 

 Investors' nerves were further jangled after a major international rating agency expressed concern about the financial health of more than a dozen Japanese banks. 

 For the sixth consecutive session, investors continued to sell their technology holdings amid a steady flow of bad news from the sector, including a profit warning from conglomerate Siemens and additional job cuts at Motorola. 

 Trading on the Amsterdam stock exchange was suspended briefly on Wednesday afternoon because of a heavy fall on the AEX index. 

 Trading was suspended for 15 minutes at 1330 GMT because the AEX index had fallen by more than 21.45 points to 555.87 points, representing a fall of 3.7 percent from the closing value of 577.32 points on Tuesday when prices fell by one percent. 

 Over in Brazil, shares dived three percent in thin trade on Wednesday morning on the back of fears the US market was set for another day of steep losses. 

 Traders said Argentina was also a worry as players waited to hear what measures newly appointed economy minister Ricardo Lopez Murphy would prescribe to get the neighbouring economy out of its two-and-a-half years of stagnation.All rights reserved.

 UK Stocks Review - Post-close settlement kicks FTSE above 5,700.

 Mar 15, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - By Marie Maitre 

 London, March 15 (BridgeNews) - Still sore from the carnage that hit stock markets around the world Wednesday, the FTSE-100 spent most of Thursday licking it wounds and building a tentative rally. However, an unexpected gain of around 50 points in the auction to settle trade after the close sent the main index up a convincing 103.3 points to 5,729.2. Investors seem to have been momentarily reassured by Japan's surprisingly robust session and have cautiously returned to heavily weighted telecom and banking stocks. 


			 *			 *			  *




The catalyst for Thursday's performance was mainly a lack of any bad news from Japan. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average closed above 12,000 for the first time in three sessions on short-covering, following news that the UFJ group-due to be created April 1 by Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Toyo Trust & Banking Co.-will write down bad loans totaling more than 1 trillion Japanese yen.



As Akira Nakamura, who is the general manager of equity department at Chuo Securities, pointed out that "there were growing hopes other banks may follow the UFJ group move to accelerate to clean up their bad loans problems."



This turnaround in Asia created a global chain reaction as European markets, which promptly followed Tokyo and Hong Kong into positive territory, which in turn buoyed Wall Street's bid to snap back from Wednesday's sharp sell-off.



That said, it would be truly presumptuous to say that the U.K. market has turned around for good. Analysts in London seemed to think so as Lehman Brothers commented it was "still not safe. We are still short of the levels of value that would prompt us to move overweight in equities."



In the telecom sector, news that Nokia Corp. was standing by its fir1t quarter earnings and a general feeling among investors that selling in the sector has been overdone helped trigger an impressive recovery in U.K. telecom stocks.



As always, the sector's performance was almost entirely determined by the performance of heavyweight stocks Vodafone, which added 2.8% at 208 pence, and British Telecom, which ended the session 3.3% higher at 532 pence.



The two stocks added 20.7 points to the FTSE. Cable & Wireless also finally seemed to shake off the recent harsh punishment that followed its profit warning, adding 4 pence to 482.



Solid performances by alternative telecom carriers also took a part in the sector's rally. Bullish notes by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on Energis' and Colt Telecom's price attractiveness provided a welcome boost to the stocks. Energis surged 10.8% at 360 pence while Colt added 6.2% at 996 pence.



Banking stocks also made a positive contribution. Heavyweight HSBC, which is largely involved in Asia, was probably one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Nikkei's robust performance and lack of further bad news in Japan's banking sector. Shares closed up 4.6% at 860 pence, adding another 15 points to the main index. Elsewhere in the sector, Barclays was up 96 pence to 20.5 sterling while Royal Bank of Scotland stepped up 44 pence to 15.50 sterling.



On the recently much battered technology front, stocks bounced back Thursday as investors tentatively started to pick up stocks again. Bank of America issued a globally positive note on the sector, initiating coverage with what they termed as "an upbeat assessment of its long-term

 ADVERTISING & MARKETING 

 *U.S. Lawmakers to Press for Bill to Regulate Tobacco 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Renewing their offensive against the tobacco industry, anti-smoking lawmakers planned to introduce legislation on Thursday that would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and curb marketing to youths. 

 The push in the House of Representatives by Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Republican Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa follows the release of two reports detailing the tobacco industry's lobbying efforts and advertising. A similar measure has already been introduced in the Senate. 

 Still, big tobacco's critics on Capitol Hill conceded it was far from certain Congress would act this year. Republican leaders have in the past been reluctant to take up tobacco legislation and some have been openly critical of the FDA. 

 The Supreme Court ruled last year that the FDA had overstepped its authority in 1996 when it issued unprecedented, sweeping curbs on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. 

 *Enron to Create Marketplace for Advertising Space 

 HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy and trading giant Enron Corp. wants a piece of Madison Avenue. The Houston-based company's latest venture is Enron Media Services, a seven-month old outfit that aims to bring Enron's expertise in trading natural gas and electricity to buyers and sellers of advertising space. In the process, Enron wants to tap into a $500 billion-a-year global advertising arena. 

 "What we've identified is that this business is very analogous to what we do in gas and power," Enron Media Services vice president Edward Ondarza told Reuters this week. 

 Enron's risk management business model, which it developed and refined in the natural gas, oil and power markets, is easily replicated in other arenas, Ondarza said. 

 Advertising's natural fit with the Enron model, Ondarza said, is that ad space represents a large part of a buyer's expense and a seller's revenues and is subject to price volatility that can hurt a company's bottom line. Ondarza said one only has to look at the drop in ad revenues for media companies during the current economic downturn to see the point. 

 *Lamar Advertising Sees 2001 Cash Flow Shortfall 

 BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - Billboard and outdoor advertising company Lamar Advertising Co. said on Wednesday its 2001 cash flow would fall short of analysts' expectations, as a result of softer poster sales in the first half of the year. 

 The company expects after-tax cash flow to be in a range of $2.55 to $2.60 a share, compared with the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.68, as compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial. The company's 2000 cash flow totaled $2.36 a share. The company defines cash flow as diluted net income before one-time items, plus deprecation and amortization. 

 "Soft poster sales for the first and second quarter lead us to believe that our ad revenue growth will be less than previously expected," the company said in a statement. Posters represent approximately 30 percent of the company's net revenue. 

 The company expects revenue to be in a range of $753 million to $761 million in 2001, compared with $736 million in 2000, on a pro forma basis assuming all acquisitions in 2000 and 2001 were completed Jan. 1. It predicts first quarter cash flow to be in a range of 50 to 51 cents a share, on revenue of $169 million to $171 million. 

 *Merrill Lynch Sees 2001 Ad Spending Growth of Only 2.5% 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Advertising spending in the United States will grow by just 2.5 percent this year, Merrill Lynch said in a report released on Wednesday, lowering its previous estimate of 4 to 4.5 percent growth. 

 Total U.S. ad spending grew by an estimated 9.1 percent in 2000, according to the Merrill Lynch report. It said advertising spending was growing at a slower rate than nominal gross domestic product, something that has not happened since between 1989 and 1992. 

 "Advertising will grow at a slower pace than nominal GDP in 2001 due to two factors - the absence of dot-com spending in traditional media and the fact that ad expenditures have outpaced nominal GDP growth for the last eight years, setting the stage for payback time," the report said. 

 *Court Upholds Sweden's Right to Limit Alcohol Ads 

 LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Court of Justice upheld Sweden?s right to prohibit alcohol advertisements to protect public health, but left the door open for alcohol sellers to prove Sweden could take protective measures less restrictive to trade in the 15-nation European Union. 

 This issue arose when the Swedish company Gourmet International Products (GIP) published three pages of advertisements for alcoholic beverages, one for red wine and two for whisky in a magazine entitled Gourmet. 

 The advertisements were only seen by traders, manufacturers or retailers, and did not appear in the editions sold to individuals in shops. Of the magazines 9,300 subscribers only 10% are private individuals. 

 When Sweden?s Consumer Ombudsman tried to stop the adverts under the national rule which prohibits the marketing of alcohol to the public, GIP argued that the law violates Europe?s free trade rules and the freedom to provide services because sales of imported liquors were more likely to be affected by the ban on advertising than alcohol produced in Sweden.

 MEDIA & THE INTERNET 

 *UPN Adopts Regional Meetings for Affiliates 

 LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The UPN television network said on Wednesday it will end its annual meeting for local stations and replace it with a series of regional gatherings in a bid to improve relations with its affiliates. 

 The move by the network, whose shows include "Star Trek: Voyager" and "WWF Smackdown!," comes amid an atmosphere of increasingly tense relations between the major networks and their affiliates, as both sides grapple with dwindling ad revenues in an increasingly fragmented market. 

 UPN, a unit of Viacom Inc., said it will hold its regional meetings this year starting June 5 in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco. Affiliates who cannot attend will be able to dial in via conference call. 

 "After careful consultation with our Affiliate Board of Governors, we concluded that this plan better addresses the changing times in the broadcast business," said Steve Carlston, executive vice president in charge of affiliate relations. 

 *AOL Adds Digital City, Moviefone to Voice Portal 

 LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - AOL Time Warner Inc. on Wednesday said it had added its online guide Digital City and Moviefone brands to its AOLbyPhone service that lets users access AOL features by phone. 

 AOL members will be able to access Moviefone's film listings and Digital City's restaurant and nightlife guide via spoken commands from any telephone, the company said. Members can also be connected to restaurants to make reservations. 

 The move, announced at the spring Internet World conference, is part of the AOL Anywhere strategy to expand the reach of AOL's services beyond the personal computer. 

 AOLbyPhone, launched last year, is free to AOL members for 30-day trial and is then offered as a premium service. As advertising spending declines, Internet media companies are increasingly turning to premium, subscription services. 

 *C&W to Slash Spending in Japan, U.K. 

 LONDON (Reuters) - Cable & Wireless Plc is postponing a $1.4 billion assault on the Japanese market and abandoning a planned high-speed Internet service in the U.K. following this week's profit warning, an analyst said on Thursday. 

 The two projects are victims of the UK-based telecoms company's decision to slash capital expenditure next year as part of cost cutting measures announced with the warning on Tuesday, said Daiwa analyst James Enck. 

 Enck said C&W had told him the cut would push back its five-year plan to spend $1.4 billion building a fibre-optic network throughout Japan. It had also suggested to him that it would shelve plans to offer DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) Internet connections in the UK. C&W did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

 *Vivendi, Bertelsmann in Talks on Sport, Music 

 LONDON (Reuters) - Media group Vivendi Universal said on Wednesday it was in talks with German rival Bertelsmann about merging their sports rights interests to create a leading pan-European player. 

 Vivendi Universal, the French/Canadian giant created last year from the trans-Atlantic merger of Vivendi and Seagram, said it had also agreed to sell its 50 percent in France's top mail-order book club France Loisirs to Bertelsmann and is in talks about buying the German group's half of music site GetMusic. 

 The negotiations between Europe's two biggest media groups came after Bertelsmann said on Tuesday its Chief Executive Thomas Middelhoff was vacating his post on Vivendi's board to avoid possible conflict of interest between the groups. 

 The Paris-based media group said talks on sports rights were focusing on building a European company specializing in the acquisition of broadcasting rights for sporting events.

 *U.S. Women Outnumber Men in Latest Census 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American women outnumbered their menfolk by nearly 8 million last year, the U.S. Census Bureau reported on Thursday, and because women tend to outlive men, there were two women for every man over the age of 85. 

 In early life, there were 105 boys under the age of 20 for every 100 girls in the same age group in the United States, but that ratio reversed itself quickly: For ages 20-44, there were 98 men for every 100 women. 

 By old age, there are only 50 men for every 100 women, the Census Bureau estimated, using data compiled in the year 2000 count. U.S. women have a projected life expectancy of 80 years, compared to men's expected lifespan of 74. 

 There were an estimated 106.7 million women over age 18 last year in the United States, while there were 98.9 million men in the same age group. 

 Released to coincide with the March commemoration of Women's History Month, the Census reported that most women were civilian workers but most made less money than their male counterparts. Sixty-one percent of women were civilian workers, compared to 74 percent of men; women's median earnings were $26,300 or about 72 percent of men's median earnings of $36,500. 

 *Coca-Cola Moves to Curb U.S. School Contracts 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Responding to health concerns and criticism about commercialization in U.S. schools, the Coca Cola Co., was expected to announce a new policy Wednesday to discourage bottlers from making exclusive deals with schools, the Washington Post reported. 

 Acknowledging the growing criticism, Jeffrey Dunn, president of Coca-Cola's North American group, said Tuesday that soft drink companies have become too aggressive in marketing soda to secondary school students, according to the Post. 

 "As we looked at this situation, we could see the pendulum had swung too far in one way," Dunn was quoted as saying. "We have to bring it back and get more balance and respond to the issues from parents and educators out there. We plan to change the flow of this river," he said. 

 Dunn said the company will encourage its bottlers to avoid the contracts that sparked "cola wars" in school districts across the country, the report said. 

 *McDonald's Japan Unit to Debut on OTC Market in July 

 TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese unit of U.S. fast-food chain McDonald's Corp said on Wednesday it had chosen the over-the-counter (OTC) market instead of Nasdaq Japan for its July listing. McDonald's Co (Japan) President Den Fujita gave the timing of the listing last month but said the company was still weighing up both the OTC market and the eight-month-old Nasdaq Japan. 

 "The OTC is more secure given the size of our company and the needs of our staff," the Nihon Keizai Shimbun evening edition quoted him as saying to explain the OTC decision. A spokesman said the company had been leaning towards the OTC market since 1998. 

 "After studying the merits of listing on Nasdaq Japan for several months, we decided to go with our original plan - to list our shares on the OTC market first and then climb up to the first section (of the Tokyo Stock Exchange)," he said. 

 McDonald's planned stock market debut - the first among global units of the world's biggest fast-food chain - is viewed as one of the year's hottest initial public offerings (IPOs) in Japan, along with that of Dentsu Inc, the world's largest advertising agency.

 Dell bullish on Asia Pacific operations

 (Copyright 2001) 

 BANGALORE, India, March 14 (AFP) - US computer-maker Dell said Wednesday its Asia-Pacific operations were capable of weathering the slowdown in the United States economy. 

 "It has not affected the Dell's operations in Asia Pacific," Ron Goh, vice president Dell Asia, told reporters here. 

 "There is a lot of room outside the US to grow. We see the Asia- Pacific region as an area of expansion and are aggressively looking at every industry and businesses," Goh said. 

 Despite the economic challenges being faced by the industry, Dell clocked year-on-year revenue growth of 28 percent to 8.7 billion dollars during the fourth quarter to January. 

 Company revenue in the Asia-Pacific and Japan was up 51 percent in the same period. 

 "We achieved this because of our focus on three key areas --- geographical expansion, opportunities in the enterprise space and our direct selling model," Goh said. 

 "I am bullish about continuing business growth, especially in India," he said. 

 K.S. Viswanathan, chief of Dell Computer India Private Limited said "sustained sales growth" was expected in enterprise servers, applications and solutions in India. 

 "This is due to the availability of a larger pool of software vendors in India. In this year we have been ramping our focus on partnering software solutions providers to address the insurance, banking and finance segments of the country," he said. 

 Dell, the largest direct seller of computer systems, issued a profit warning in January and last month announced plans to eliminate 1,700 full-time administrative, marketing and product support jobs.

That follows a much calmer day Tuesday, when bargain hunters lifted the Dow 82 points; still, though, not recouping even a quarter of Monday's losses.

The question today, can Wall Street build on Tuesday's rally or was it a one-day wonder? Bargain hunters snapped up those beaten-down tech stocks, pushing the NASDAQ back above the 2,000 mark. We even saw strength in the blue chips. The Dow industrials rose 82 points after a choppy day to 10,290.

 * Bush Called Ready to Act against Airline Strikes 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President George W. Bush is prepared to act to prevent a strike at any of the major U.S. airlines, the White House said on Tuesday amid controversy over Bush's move to block a strike at Northwest Airlines Corp. A senior administration official, however, expressed caution over prospects for a settlement in the most pressing dispute, between Northwest and its mechanics union. The official said the bar for a deal appeared high after the company sweetened its proposal just before an impasse in talks was declared on Monday. 

 Another official, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, told reporters that the president was prepared to act in other disputes if formally given the authority to do so through a recommendation by federal mediators. "The president's concern is that the traveling public not be disrupted and that the economy, particularly in this fragile time, not be given any additional setbacks," Fleischer said. An order requested by the National Mediation Board and signed by Bush on Friday prevented a threatened walkout by 10,000 Northwest mechanics, aircraft cleaners and other workers that had been scheduled for Monday. 

 * Delta Expects to Post First-Quarter Loss 

 ATLANTA (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc., which is in tough labor talks with its pilots, expects to report a first-quarter loss due to flight reductions, a weakening economy and consumer avoidance over a possible strike. The No. 3 U.S. airline said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it expects to post a net loss of $85 million to $110 million, or 70 cents to 90 cents a diluted share, for the quarter ending in March. Analysts on average were expecting Delta to post a profit of 46 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks such data. 

 Analysts said the profit warning was expected, as estimates headed south for many airlines amid U.S. economic weakness and labor problems with certain unions. But they were surprised at the amount of Delta's shortfall. "The magnitude of Delta's profit warning is substantially larger than we would have originally forecast," said Samuel Buttrick of UBS Warburg in a research note. "We would have guessed that a more probable guidance range would be zero to 20 cents profit." 

 * Air Traffic Control Helps Airlines Dodge Mir Debris 

 SYDNEY (Reuters) - Air traffic controllers in Australia and New Zealand are in contact with the Russian space agency to ensure safe routes for aircraft when the Mir space station splashes down in the Pacific next week. "The Russian space agency is responsible for the re-entry of this spacecraft back into the earth's atmosphere. Our responsibility is to inform airlines exactly what that means in terms of flight arrangements for that day," Richard Dudley, Air Services Australia spokesman, said on Wednesday. 

 Airlines say its too early to tweak schedules but they are tracking the progress of the aging spacecraft which is likely to crash into the ocean about 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) east of New Zealand around March 21. "We still don't have definite dates and coordinates for the splashdown but we're constantly updated with information as it comes to hand," a spokeswoman for Australia's biggest carrier Qantas Airways Ltd said. Russia estimates around two thirds of 140-tonne space station should burn up in a controlled descent through the earth's atmosphere, but an estimated 1,500 fragments could still plunge into the Pacific. 

 * Royal Tongan Airlines Says Planes Grounded 

 WELLINGTON (Reuters) - The planes of Tonga national carrier Royal Tongan Airlines have been grounded, an airline spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The state-owned airline operates two domestic aircraft - an DHC6-300 Otter and Shorts 360 aircraft - as well as a leased Boeing 737-200 on limited international routes. The aircraft have been grounded by the aviation authorities in Tonga, the spokeswoman told Reuters. "Our aircraft operations certificate is expired," she added. 

 Air New Zealand said in a statement that Royal Tongan had returned the Boeing-737 to the lessor. Air NZ said it was doubling the number of services it flies between Auckland and Tonga to four per week, code-shared with Royal Tongan Airlines. Royal Tongan Airlines, which began as Friendly Islands Airways in 1985. has undergone a series of management and board changes since mid-2000. Tonga, a tiny South Pacific monarchy made up of 170 islands, is located 20 degrees south of the equator near Fiji and Samoa. 

 * Human Error Blamed for Mongolia Helicopter Crash 

 ULAN BATOR (Reuters) - Human error was the main cause of a helicopter crash in western Mongolia two months ago which killed nine people, among them a United Nations team and a Japanese television crew, investigators said on Wednesday. "The main factor of the crash was human error," chief investigator M. Byambasuren told reporters. "There were no technical reasons affecting the crash." The Mongolian Airlines (MIAT) helicopter was overloaded by nearly 900 kg (1,984 lbs) when it crashed on January 14 as its pilots tried to land on a steep snowy slope in a mountainous area, he said. 

 The pilots became disoriented after the helicopter stirred up a cloud of snow, he added. The helicopter, with 23 people on board, crashed only a few meters (yards) away from a nomad encampment and immediately caught fire after its propellers hit the ground. Three of the crew escaped unharmed, and pulled out eleven passengers via a rear exit. Nine people died in the fire including four U.N. workers from Britain, the United States, Germany and Mongolia, two reporters from the Japanese public broadcaster NHK, a Mongolian parliament member, a photo-journalist and a crew member. 

 * U.S. Congress Asked to Overturn Pilot Retirement Rule 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With proponents claiming age discrimination, the U.S. Congress was pressed on Tuesday to pass legislation that would let commercial pilots continue to fly after age 60. "I think this bill is in the public interest at this time to keep experience in the cockpit and end this age discrimination once and for all," Republican Sen. Frank Murkowski, the legislation's sponsor, told a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Murkowski's bill would bump up the retirement age to 65 for commercial pilots in good health. 

 The Federal Aviation Administration rule mandating commercial pilots give up the controls at 60 was imposed more than 40 years ago at the dawn of the commercial jet age when equipment was less sophisticated and flying was more physically demanding. Proponents claim that advances in aviation and medical technology, as well as longer life spans, make the current rule obsolete. The bill seeks to stem a commercial pilot shortage, particularly in rural areas. Murkowski is from Alaska where he said the pilot shortage is acute. Congressional figures show that the number of certified pilots has fallen by nearly 80,000 to 613,342 nationally in the past 10 years. 

 * U.S. Watchdog in Mixed Review of U.S. Airline Bill 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An official with the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) said the agency supports the idea of giving the Department of Transportation (DOT) a bigger role in overseeing airline competition. But GAO's JayEtta Z. Hecker also testified at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that the audit arm of Congress has some reservations about legislation that would give DOT power to reallocate gates and other airport assets among carriers. The bill sponsored by committee chairman and Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, is one of several bills introduced this year in response to proposed airline mergers. 

 "Competition is a necessary, integral piece of our aviation system," McCain said at the hearing. "This bill will take steps to improve this situation." UAL Corp.'s United Airlines has proposed buying US Airways Group Inc. American Airlines, owned by AMR Corp. would get some of the assets the merged company would have to divest to meet competitive concerns and also would buy struggling Trans World Airlines Inc. The deals would create two giant airlines splitting 50 percent of the U.S. air travel market between them. 

 * Pricing, Economy Could Cut U.S. Air Delays, Exec Says 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Selective pricing and a slowing U.S. economy could ease congestion at the nation's airports this summer, an executive said Tuesday. "A 70 percent load factor, which is about as high as you could (practically) get, will continue to place stress on the airline system," said Rich Golaszewski, executive vice president of GRA Inc, a transportation consultancy. He addressed the 26th annual FAA Commercial Aviation Forecast Conference. "Every summer we have a shower of delays," Golaszewski said. "I don't know about (the summer) of 2001, but if the economy slows that will improve the delay situation." 

 The U.S. economy, while not in a recession, has slowed for about three months, with growth at a minimum. If people worry about the economy, they'll cancel their vacation plans during the heavy summer months, which would ease the delay problem. To further ease delays, Golaszewski recommended "allocating efficient consumption." That means providing the "right amount of service for people who are willing to pay." For instance, the most popular flying times like 9 a.m. from a heavily-crowded airport such as Newark International might cost more than a flight at 9 p.m. "You have to balance supply and demand," Golaszewski said. 

 * Threat to U.S. Export Aid Worries Boeing 

 SEATTLE (Reuters) - For Boeing Co., the world's largest plane-maker, a recent White House proposal to cut a key federal export assistance program could not have come at a less opportune time. Already facing a stiff challenge from its only serious rival in the commercial jet market - hard-charging Airbus Industrie - Boeing could lose billions of dollars in airplane sales if federal aid were reduced. Calling its loan guarantees "corporate welfare," President George W. Bush wants to cut the U.S. Export-Import Bank's $865 million annual operating budget by 25 percent, though it helped Boeing snare $11.2 billion in jet sales in the last two years. 

 "The bank is important to us and it has been for many years," said Boeing government affairs spokesman Tim Neale. Airbus has steadily eaten away at Boeing's once commanding market share and is keeping the pressure on with a proposed 555-seat aircraft, the A380, which will supplant Boeing's 416-seat 747 as the biggest plane in the commercial fleet. "Some of our customers have trouble arranging loans from commercial banks. If they have a hard time financing a Boeing purchase but they don't have a hard time financing an Airbus purchase, they are going to go to Airbus," Neale said. 

 * Air Afrique to Talk with World Bank over Lay-offs 

 ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ailing multinational airline Air Afrique is to send a team to Washington on March 19-20 to seek help from the World Bank with a restructuring program, which caused a strike last month and threatens further unrest. The 11 governments that own Air Afrique see it as worth supporting if it can be restructured, which entails lay-offs. The World Bank has offered technical and other unspecified help, which could include a loan. Kabrah Appiah, transport minister for Ivory Coast, one of the airline's shareholders, said at a news conference on Tuesday that the World Bank is committed to supporting the program. 

 "When we get back, we'll be in a position to tell you the extent of the World Bank's commitments as regards this social plan," Appiah said. The government shareholders agreed on February 13 to a crisis plan under which 2,000 of the airline's 4,126 employees were to be laid off for two months. The plan was drawn up by new boss Jeffrey Erickson, a former TWA chief executive who was appointed temporary administrator at the end of January with a remit to stem the airline's alarming operating losses and prepare it for privatization. 

 * S. African Perishables Squeezed by SAA's New Boeings 

 JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African Airways' (SAA) decision to replace Airbus-A320 and A300 series aircraft with Boeing 737-800s has left the country's vital Western Cape perishables industry feeling squeezed, executives said. Already hit by a cargo capacity crunch as cash-strapped international carriers exit the competitive South African airline market, SAA's new domestic and regional fleet carries less cargo than in the past, and no containers. Adding to industry woes is the steadily declining rand currency on the back of volatile world oil prices. 

 Marius Smal, manager at large perishables forwarder Rohlig-PCA, said SAA's decision to introduce 737-800s was a cost-saving exercise taken without regard for cargo needs. "We were contacted long after the decision was taken," he said. The Western Cape region is a primary producer of cut flowers for international markets, and exports large quantities of live seafood to the Far East and frozen fish to Spain. The local flower industry is growing at 15 percent annually, and new markets have opened up in Portugal, Spain and eastern Europe. 

 * Pilots Say Lack of Equipment Caused Barcelona Fog Chaos 

 MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish pilots have called for low visibility approach systems to be installed at Barcelona airport after more than 200 flights were cancelled there on Monday because of fog. "It is lamentable that Barcelona, as one of the most important airports in Europe and a major air traffic distribution center, has still not been equipped with approach systems for low visibility," said pilots' union SEPLA in a statement released on Tuesday. The union said it had made "numerous" calls for the equipment to be installed, as well as a change in procedures, which would ease take-offs in foggy conditions. Spanish airports' authority AENA said the airport was back to "operating normally" on Tuesday morning. It said that 216 flights had been cancelled on Monday and a further 39 diverted to other airports. 

 * HeavyLift Seeks Approval for 3 Wet-leased An124s 

 LONDON (Reuters) - UK-based HeavyLift Cargo Airlines applied to operate three Ukrainian registered Antonov 124-100s for 12 months, the Civil Aviation Authority said in its latest bulletin. "The reason for the application is to maintain HeavyLift's position in the outsize cargo market, since no suitable aircraft are available from EU sources," the CAA said. Last month, HeavyLift ended a 10 year cooperation and marketing agreement with Russia's Volga-Dnepr Airlines, which operates 10 An124s. 

 After the break between the two firms, HeavyLift and its UK competitor in the outsize cargo market, Air Foyle, announced a plan for a joint venture to market charters operated by Kiev-based Antonov Airlines, the partnership between Air Foyle and Antonov Design Bureau. HeavyLift last month withdrew its request to the CAA to extend the wet-lease of six Russian registered AN124-100s and one Ilyushin IL76, which it used in the joint venture with Volga-Dnepr. The CAA said this month's application from HeavyLift was to wet-lease the three aircraft from April 1. 

 * Experts Say All Types Travel Can Spark Thrombosis 

 GENEVA (Reuters) - A leading specialist on deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which has recently caused alarm among airline passengers, said on Tuesday the sometimes fatal blood-clotting ailment could be caused by most means of travel. Dr. John Scurr, a British surgeon, told a news conference after a two-day meeting of health experts and airline officials that evidence suggested DVT could affect all plane travelers, not just those in cheap seats, and even on short flights. He said participants in the meeting - attended by medical staff from 16 airlines and the industry body IATA - had agreed to launch wide-ranging studies on the extent of the problem and how it could be combatted. 

 Scurr, who has carried out his own research on "economy class syndrome", said it could also hit first-class passengers, travelers on short flights, on long-distance buses, and possibly even truck drivers. "Travel-related thrombosis is a better name. Studies have shown it is a common travel problem," said the surgeon, from London's Middlesex and University College Hospital. Scurr and Dr Derek Yach of the World Health Organization (WHO) told the news conference the Geneva gathering - the first international meeting on DVT - had agreed it was probably a bigger issue than it appeared. 

 * New U.S. Pilot Hires Predicted to Slip in 2001 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of new U.S. pilots hired this year, in both commercial and cargo transportation, will drop from recent record levels, a pilot career specialist said Tuesday. In 2000, airlines hired a record 19,027 pilots, but this year the total will drop to 14,500, said Kit Darby, president of Air Inc, an Atlanta-based firm that helps pilots prepare for jobs. Darby, a former pilot, addressed the 26th Annual FAA Commercial Aviation Forecast Conference. 

 "There isn't a shortage of pilots," Darby said. But if airlines are worried about the slowing US economy, then hiring will drop. Overall, there are 90,000 pilots in the United States and about 10 percent of these are freighter pilots, Darby said. Also, 10 percent of the new pilots hired will be for cargo airlines, he said. It is more difficult to recruit freighter pilots because they fly at night while most passenger pilots fly during the day, Darby said. At the same time, pilots do not switch from passenger to cargo airlines, Darby said. In both passenger and freight airlines, the demand for pilots will continue to grow, Darby said. He forecast 50,000 new jobs by 2010. 

 * Air France Sees Europe Consolidating to 3 Airlines 

 PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's three biggest airlines will absorb the other major carriers in the region in the next few years the head of Air France said. U.S. consolidation to perhaps three giant carriers would force Europe to follow suit, boiling its own industry down to a handful of groupings based on Air France, British Airways Plc and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, the French airline's Chairman Jean-Cyrill Spinetta said. Regulatory obstacles to consolidation could be broken down within 10 years, with a U.S.-European air services trade treaty leading the way, he told reporters. "In the United States you may very rapidly have maybe three or four airlines," he said. "So I think that the consolidation (in Europe) will probably be organized around these three European airlines (Air France, Lufthansa and British Airways)," he said.

 Wall St.'s Pain Worsens and Spreads Economic Fears Hammer Stocks on Bourses Worldwide

 Monday's U.S. stock market sell-off began hours earlier in Asia and then gathered momentum around the globe, time zone by time zone, before hitting Wall Street like a snowball rolling down a hill. 

 On almost every bourse, the worry was the same: The world economy is increasingly at risk because of the slowdowns in the United States and Japan. 

 "This is death by a thousand paper cuts. Every day, most sectors of the equity market are off 1 to 3 to 5%," said Gary Pzegeo, bond fund manager at Evergreen Investment Management Co. in Boston. "The market is coming to grips with poor [corporate] earnings and a horrible fundamental environment." 

 In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei average plunged 3.6% on Monday to a 16-year closing low after skepticism over the ruling coalition's economic package and Friday's U.S. market swoon overwhelmed better-than-expected gross domestic product data. 

 The Nikkei closed down 456.53 points at 12,171.37--its lowest close since April 1985--and markets in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia followed suit. 

 The sell-off in Tokyo was continuing in early trading today, with the Nikkei down 283 points to 11,889. 

 When markets opened in Europe on Monday morning, a profit scare from telecom equipment titan Ericsson combined with Friday's bad news from U.S. tech bellwether Cisco Systems, feeding deep unease about a global tech-sector meltdown. 

 Stockholm-based Ericsson slid 21% after saying it expected a pretax loss in the first quarter instead of a result close to break-even. That sent European technology stocks plummeting. 

 So far, Europe has not suffered the same torrent of tech earnings warnings that has slammed the U.S. market, but Ericsson's announcement lighted fears that the worst is yet to come. 

 "We're in for a difficult month. There are going to be more earnings downgrades of this type as Euro techs see the kind of announcements which have been coming through in the U.S.," said Simon Thorpe, senior technology analyst at UBS Warburg. 

 Also hurting European stocks was a 14% decline in the shares of London-based financial services company Prudential after it announced a $26.5-billion offer for American General Corp. in what would be the largest takeover in the sector. Investors took fright at the price tag, slashing $4.3 billion off the notional cost of the deal. 

 Among major European markets, German stocks fell 2.5% on Monday while the French market slid 2.4%. 

 On Wall Street, meanwhile, the day's most important news was still last week's profit warning from computer chip giant Intel Corp. as well as Cisco's announcement that the company would slash as much as 11% of its work force. 

 The news, analysts said, underscored how sharp the reversal of fortune in the tech sector has been and raised questions about the U.S. economy's ability to act as the engine for world growth. 

 Tech stocks were hammered anew. The Nasdaq composite index fell 129.40 points, or 6.3%, to 1,923.38. It handily sliced through the psychologically key 2,000 level on its way to its lowest close since late 1998. 

 But the selling went far beyond the tech sector. The Dow industrials plunged 436.37 points, or 4.1%, to 10,208.25, the lowest close since late October as all 30 stocks making up the blue-chip index fell. 

 Losers included Boeing, down $4.50 to $61; General Electric, down $4.21 to $39.60; 3M, down $4.61 to $111.80; and even Philip Morris, a recent market star. It fell $2.15 to $49.60. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 53.26 points, or 4.3%, to 1,180.16. The S&P is officially in bear territory, down 22.7% from its closing high of 1,527.46 reached March 24. 

 Declining stocks led advancers by 4 to 1 on both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. But although trading was heavy, it was far from record levels. 

 "What we are seeing today is a lot more anxiety and capitulation in some respects," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddel & Reed. "People are starting to get really worried. They are just selling. 

 More than 320 stocks hit new lows on Nasdaq, including Cisco, the top maker of networking equipment for the Internet, which dropped $1.81 to $18.81 in heavy trading. The stock slid to $18.38 earlier to its lowest level in more than two years, and the weakness hit the shares of rivals. Large Cisco supplier Jabil Circuit shed $2.70 to $20.80 after UBS Warburg cut its rating on the weakness in Cisco. 

 Adding to the sour mood, Ed Kerschner, UBS Warburg's chief portfolio strategist, cut his 2001 earnings outlook for companies in the S&P 500 by 3.5% because of a drop in manufacturing activity and cuts in corporate spending. 

 Investors also fretted about the economic problems in Japan, which could have a ripple effect on global markets, said Waddell & Reed's Herrmann. 

 And there were lingering worries the Federal Reserve may not be aggressive in cutting interest rates after recent economic data, such as Friday's jobs and payroll figures, came in somewhat stronger than expected. 

 Financial stocks, which would benefit from lower rates, suffered Monday. J.P. Morgan Chase slid $3.46 to $45.49, and Citigroup lost $2.03 to $47.10. 

 In the tech sector, Intel was down $1.69 to $27.75, Microsoft plunged $4.75 to $51.94, Juniper Networks fell $5.19 to $49.69, and IBM fell $3.80 to $95.49. 

 Meanwhile, plunging stock prices buoyed the bond market, helping Treasuries recoup the losses suffered Friday after the surprising jobs data. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.91% from 4.93% Friday. 

 But gold, usually a safe haven in times of crisis, got only a small lift. Near-term gold futures in New York added $1.50 to $272.30 an ounce.

 Market Roundup, C12-13 

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) 

 The Bear Roams Worldwide 

 Stocks tumbled worldwide Monday as investors fled for safety amid U.S. stocks' continuing losses and deepening woes in Japan's economy and market. Most major markets now are officially in "bear" territory, meaning a decline of 20% or more from their peaks. However, a large segment of the U.S. market-especially small- and mid-size stocks-has held up far better than the tech-dominated Nasdaq composite so far.

 It has been a glum year for the companies quoted on the US Nasdaq stockmarket and for those who have invested in them. Most of the major international technology companies trade on this index and the sharp fall in values so far this year reflect the bursting of the bubble which had seen any company connected with the Internet valued at extraordinary levels on the market. Nasdaq shares had another bumpy day yesterday; overall the index is now trading 60 per cent below the peak reached in March of last year. Many questioned the inflated level share prices reached early last year. But few foresaw the extent of the fall. The Nasdaq market has had a dreadful few months and this in turn has dragged down technology shares internationally. Irish companies have not escaped, with the share prices of many of the leading indigenous technology companies collapsing. 

  And many of the big US technology multinationals which have significant operations here have also been amongst the biggest losers, contributing to the uncertainty about the outlook for economic growth here. 

 The latest upheaval in the market was sparked by a profit-warning late last week from Intel, the semiconductor company which is one of the Republic's largest employers. This was followed by an announcement of jobs cuts by Cisco Systems, the computer networking company, which added its view that the US slowdown was spreading and could last longer than anticipated. These were just the latest in a string of similar warnings from major US companies. It is now clear that in late 1999 and early last year the financial markets very seriously overvalued technology companies, based on a mistaken view about the possibilities offered by the internet. Is the pessimism, in turn, being overdone? Certainly a shake-out of technology and internet companies was inevitable; many were never going to make any money. Even Yahoo! - one of the biggest names of the dot.com era - has suffered in the shake-out and investors are steering clear of any Internet-related investment. This will slow development in many areas. 

 The difficulties for the technology sector look set to last for some time. It is still not evident, for example, whether many Internet companies will make a decent profit, or even which technologies will drive the profitable operations. Digital technologies are going to be a major part of the future of business and a key to profitability for many firms. But such have been the losses experienced by investors over recent months that the crisis of confidence in the sector - which is affecting the outlook for the US economy - still has some way to run.

 THE sharemarket plunge decimating hi-tech stocks overseas continued last night. 

 America's Nasdaq listing fell to its lowest level since December 1998. 

 The market, home to most of America's best known technology and telecommunication companies, saw its composite index slip below 2000 in the first few minutes of trading and continued to head lower during trading. 

 It has lost more than 60 per cent of its value since the peak of the hi-tech "bubble" of almost one year ago, when the Nasdaq composite index topped 5000. 

 About $4000 billion has been wiped off the combined value of companies listed on the Nasdaq market in the past year. 

 The slide was made worse by announcements from world techno-giants Intel and Ericsson that their latest quarterly figures were expected to slip into massive losses. 

 Ericsson released a statement claiming mobile phone demand had slumped, costing the company several billion dollars last year. 

 Six weeks ago the company said it would subcontract production of its mobiles to a US manufacturer so Ericsson could concentrate on developing new mobile systems. 

 Ericsson, which had expected to break even in the first quarter this year, said it now expected to post a pre-tax loss of $807 million to $1.01 billion. 

 On Friday, Wall Street was rocked by a profit warning from tech heavyweight Intel and job cuts by Cisco. 

 Warren Buffett, one of the most influential US investors and a champion of the "old economy", has told shareholders that investors who rushed into Internet stocks two years ago may have suffered from "hallucinations". 

 Buffett, 70, refused to invest in "new economy" stocks at their height in 1999. 

 "It was as if some virus, racing wildly among investment professionals as well as amateurs, induced hallucinations in which the values of stocks in certain sectors became decoupled from the values of the business that underlie them," he said. 

 "Nothing sedates rationality like a large dose of effortless money."

Wall Street's massive sell-off engulfed every stock sector, from technology to blue chip, spurred in part by poor earnings reports. Our MarketWatch reporter Alexis Christoforous has more.   

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

After a brutal Monday, investors were greeted with more profit warnings after the closing bell.  Cabot Microelectronics and Stanford Microdevices each sounded profit warnings, citing the slowing economy. Both are much lower in after-hours trading. That's expected to put further pressure on an already beaten-down market and keep the buyers in hibernation.   

The Dow industrials plunged 436 points or 4 percent, its biggest sell-off in 11 months.

Mr. ALAN SKRAINKA (Edward Jones & Company): Winners stay focused on their long-term goals, they stay calm, they look for opportunities. And losers either panic sell or they load the boat with very speculative issues, so I think if you stay focused on your goals, you'll weather this very difficult market.   

CHRISTOFOROUS: Alan Skrainka says you should have no more than 20 percent of your stock portfolio in technology.   

We also had, of course, shares of Cisco Systems down about 9 percent, adding to the bloodshed; Ericsson, the mobile phone giant, down 25 percent after sounding a profit warning.   

But on a bleak Monday, there were some bright spots. Ford closed higher; the automaker is set to announce a bond offering later this week. And American General rallied after the insurer agreed to be bought out by Britain's largest life insurance company, Prudential.

 Falling U.S. equities intensified the global stock market selloff. The Nasdaq sank below the key 2,000 mark. 

 By Svea Herbst-Bayliss 

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks tumbled, with the key Nasdaq technology index losing nearly 5 percent, deepening a global stock market sell-off that was already being blamed on American companies' profit warnings. 

 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index sank below the psychologically key 2,000 level for the first time in two years and the broader S&P 500 index lost nearly 3 percent in value after the opening bell. 

 Already hurt by a string of corporate profit warnings, the market's mood soured on Friday when tech giant Intel issued a profit warning and rival Cisco Systems announced job cuts and hopes for more aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts faded. 

 "The buyers have just stepped away from the market, they are not ready to put up the dough yet, said Lance Zipper, managing director of equity trading at Brean Murray & Co. 

 Computer networking giant Cisco Systems Inc also on Friday sent an explosive charge into global financial markets by saying America's economic slowdown appears to be spreading and may last longer than many expected. 

 To cut expenses, Cisco said it would reduce its workforce by as much as 11 percent and this morning its stock tumbled $1-7/8 to $18-3/4, leading the Nasdaq lower. 

 Adding to Wall Street's sour mood, UBS Warburg's chief portfolio strategist, Ed Kerschner, cut his 2001 earnings outlook for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by 3.5 percent because of a drop in manufacturing activity and cuts in corporate spending. 

 As Wall Street's sell-off gained speed, low-risk U.S. government debt gained favor and Treasuries recouped most of the losses suffered on Friday after Washington reported stronger-than-expected jobs data for February. 

 News that the jobs market remained relatively robust reduced Wall Street's hopes for more sizable three-quarters of a percentage point interest rate cuts aimed at shoring up the economy. 

 The Fed already cut the federal funds rate a full percentage point in January, moving the federal funds rate to 5.50 percent in two separate steps. 

 Even now, with the stock market down more sharply, the chances for a bigger interest rate have risen only to a one-in-four chance on Monday up from a one-in-six chance on Friday. 

 Meanwhile European and Asian shares, also worried about the U.S. economy's slowdown, joined in the selling overnight. 

 The FTSE Eurotop 300 fell 2.15 percent by 12:15 p.m. (1715 GMT) with technology stocks singled out for extra punishment. 

 Japan's Nikkei index lost 3.62 and set a new 16-year low amid political uncertainty. 

 The yen set fresh 20-month lows against the dollar after the Nikkei fell as Japan's Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori denied reports that he planned an early resignation. 

 "We don't see this as overdone as fundamentals look so bad and keep on getting worse. Everyone has a negative view at the moment and it's not a market where people are able to think to make clear decisions. You are either in or out," said Eureffect asset manager Lex Werkheim in Amsterdam. 

 "Professionals are not afraid to go short - no one dares to buy but they dare to sell - and where there is bad news they jump on it like flies," he said. 

 LESS HELP EXPECTED FROM FED 

 Investors have been depressed by decreasing expectations of further interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the wake of February's still robust jobs data. 

 "The Fed has been easing and it will continue to ease but given that it is already March 12, I expect the Fed will wait until March 20 to announce another half point rate cut," said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 The Federal Reserve's rate-setting FOMC meets on March 20 and a cut of 50 basis points, or a half percentage point, is already discounted by the market. 

 Even as the stock market was falling, the dollar remained relatively resilient with the yen falling to troughs around 120.65 yen, its lowest level since July 1999 and over 3 percent below the peaks around 117 scaled at the beginning of March, according to Reuters data. 

 The euro was changing hands at 92.80 cents, off half a percent against the dollar. 

 Japan's murky political outlook appeared to clear over the weekend when local media reported that Mori had agreed to bring forward an election for the presidency of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 

 But the unpopular Mori told parliament he had no intention of resigning, leaving the market no wiser about who will replace him, or when. 

 "It looks as if the political situation is in a limbo and it has increased the negative sentiment for the yen," said Neil MacKinnon, senior currency strategist at Merrill Lynch.

 WRAPUP 4-Wall St stocks tumbles - U.S. Treasuries fare well.

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq composite index on Monday tumbled over 6 percent, hurtling through the key 2,000 level to two-year lows and kicking the broader market into bear market territory as investors worried about America's economic health. 

 Stock market selling wound its way around the globe and picked up speed in the United States like a snowball rolling down a hill turning low-risk U.S. government Treasury bonds and bills into the day's most attractive asset. 

 Despite the dramatic headline declines, traders said the sell-off was relatively orderly and unemotional, driven more by the constant dribble of poor earnings and growth warnings from high tech companies rather than one new blowout event. 

 "People are whimpering as they see several years of wealth destroyed but there isn't the great emotion we saw after the Russian debt default or the Long Term Capital Management crisis in 1998," when stocks tumbled as the hedge fund nearly collapsed said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Banc One Capital Markets in Chicago. 

 Monday's steep sell off followed on Japan's Nikkei Index's 3.62 percent drop to 16-year lows and the pan-European FTSE 300 index 2.2 percent fall. 

 "This is death by a thousand paper cuts. Everyday most sectors of the equity market are off 1 to 3 to 5 percent. The market is coming to grips with poor earnings and a horrible fundamental environment," said Gary Pzegeo, bond fund manager at Evergreen Investment Management Co. in Boston. 

 The Nasdaq index closed at 1923.38 after seeing no resistance when it handily sliced through the psychologically key 2,000 level already off about 60 percent from last March's all-time high above 5,000. 

 The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slumped 4.1 percent to 10208.25 and the broader S&P 500 sank 4.33 percent to 1180.02, closing in bear-territory, defined as a 20 percent drop, for the first time in 13 years. 

 CISCO AND INTEL STILL MOVING THE MARKET 

 The day's most important news was still last week's profit warning from high tech giant Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems' announcement that the company would slash up to 11 percent of its workforce. 

 The news, analysts said, underscored how much steam America's once robust economy had lost in the last few months and that the world's biggest economy no longer had the strength to act as the engine for world growth. The stock market's decline sparked new speculation about how the Federal Reserve may react in the coming weeks. 

 To help breathe new life into the economy, the Fed has already cut rates twice this year by half a percentage point, lowering the federal funds rate to 5.50 percent in January. There is little doubt the Fed will keep cutting rates but last week's stronger than expected economic data suggested the pace of interest rate cuts may not be as aggressive going forward. 

 Now the Fed may need to take another look, analysts said. 

 "One could make the case that what is happening on the stock market is the kind of breach in confidence that (Fed chief) Alan Greenspan was talking about," and that policy makers are worried by this latest, sharp drop, Johnson said. 

 On Monday, the market said chances for a three-quarters of a percent rate cut were now one-in-four, up from one-in-six late last week after a stronger than expected jobs report for February showed the economy still had pockets of strength. 

 "We should make no doubt about it that growth is soft and the stock market is quite rightly reacting to this," said Josh Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management Americas. 

 However Feinman, echoing other analysts, said "I still expect the Federal Reserve to cut half a percentage point at its March 20 meeting." 

 BONDS LOVE BAD NEWS 

 Meanwhile plunging stock prices buoyed the bond market helping Treasuries recoup the losses suffered on Friday after Friday's stronger jobs data. 

 Two-year Treasury notes, which are sensitive to the near-term outlook for Fed policy, were trading unchanged at 4.40 percent, still above a two-year low of 4.39 percent set on Feb. 28. Benchmark 10-year notes also pared gains to close unchanged at 100-25/32, yielding 4.89 percent. 

 The dollar remained firm but pared some of its gains against the euro and the yen, which had dropped to troughs around 120.65 yen, its lowest level since July 1999 and over 3 percent below the peaks around 117 scaled at the beginning of March, according to Reuters data. 

 The yen set fresh 20-month lows against the dollar after the Nikkei fell as Japan's Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori denied reports that he planned an early resignation. 

 Comex gold rose 80 cents, climbing to $272.30 an ounce as gold attracted interest in the wake of tumbling stocks. NYMEX crude oil futures closed off one penny at $28 a barrel. 

 LOOKING AHEAD ASIA'S MOVES 

 Analysts are now especially worried about what may happen in Asia overnight, saying that any further weakness there could become a linchpin for even deeper losses here. "We are concerned about what happens there and hope those stocks can find a bottom," Johnson said.

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - "Global slowdown" was a phrase often repeated by traders of the shares of non-U.S. companies bought and sold in the United States on Monday, as the Nasdaq hit a two-year low and high-tech company warnings around the world continued to scare off investors. 

 "The weakness at the end of last week set the tone for a continued sell-off in Asia. Add to that a sell-off in Europe this morning on Ericsson's warning and a lack of any institutional buying, and we see the global ball rolling to the downside," said James Joyce, head of international trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 "It does appear to be a global slowdown, not just a U.S. problem," Joyce added. 

 The Nasdaq Composite index fell below 2,000, to its lowest level since December 1998, after computer networking titan Cisco Systems Inc. , which outsources its manufacturing to Europe and Asia, said late on Friday that it would cut 11 percent of its work force, or up to 5,000 jobs. 

 The tech-laden index had already plunged Friday, a day after No. 1 computer chip maker Intel Corp. said it would cut 6 percent of its work force. 

 The Bank of New York's index of leading American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) fell 3.20 percent to 115.25, crushed mostly by a 3.42 percent drop in the BONY index of leading European companies to 123.46. 

 The Nasdaq Composite, which peaked at more that 5,000 points a year ago, crumbled 128.28 points, or 6.25 percent, to 1,924.50. The Nasdaq is now down more than 60 percent from its March 10, 2000 record high of 5,048.62. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 403.85 points, or 3.80 percent, to 10,240, extending Friday's losses and reaching a low unseen since late October 2000. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 34.34 points, or 2.81 percent, at 1,198.73. 

 Before the Nasdaq opened on Monday, Sweden's telecommunications equipment maker Ericsson , the world's third-largest, issued a profit warning, sparking another round of sell-off in European technology stocks. All day the company's ADR joined the stock market's top 10 loss leaders, falling 25.37 percent to $6-7/32. 

 "Ericsson got the ball rolling with their profit warning, which basically covered handset sales, as well as infrastructure sales, so consumer spending and corporate spending kind of both come into question." said Joyce. 

 From French telecoms equipment maker Alcatel , which last week said its handset business was deteriorating, and whose ADR lost 6.1 to $36.45 percent of its value on Monday, to German telecoms carrier, Deutsche Telekom , down 4.37 percent to $23.62, the whole sector whirlpooled. 

 Britain's blue-chip index closed at the lowest level in two years on Monday, slammed on the tech side, then pounded in finance stocks as investors took fright at the $26.5 billion price tag UK insurer Prudential will pay for American General Corp . Prudential shares tumbled 15 percent to $22.40. 

 Siemens AG , one of Europe's biggest technology suppliers, listed an ADR on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time on Monday, opening under the ticker "SI" at an initial public offering price of $112.25. 

 Though Siemens ordinary shares traded down over 4 percent in Europe, its ADR saw little volume and never moved higher than $113.20. By late afternoon Siemens ADR was at $110.90. 

 "Frankly, I think a lot of the fund managers playing the ADR aren't really that plugged into the status of Siemens in Europe, which is much more focused on the technology side," said Charles Gushee, international equities trader at SG Cowen. 

 The BONY index of leading Asian firms was down 2.23 percent to 101.19, largely on the U.S. high-tech slump, traders said. 

 Mainland China's two leading telecommunications firms with ADRs, China Mobile , the No. 1 mobile company, and the nation's No 2 mobile company and only "fully licensed" telecommunications company, China Unicom , both fell after Ericsson warned. 

 Unable to hold themselves apart from their debt-ridden European counterparts any longer, the Chinese telecoms extended days of losses. 

 "Until we get more visibility on the macroeconomic themes in Asia, it's getting harder for large global companies to differentiate themselves just because they happen to be domiciled in Asia, Europe, or the U.S.," said Joyce. 

 China Unicom was off 2.62 percent to $13.01, and China Mobile was off 2.13 percent to $23.02. 

 Meanwhile in Japan, where the Nikkei Industrial average dropped to a 16-year low in trading over night, Japanese market bellwether electronics and entertainment giant, Sony Corp. , fell 3.81 percent to trade at $67.96. 

 The BONY index of leading Latin American companies was down 1.16 percent, with Mexico's leading broadcaster, Grupo Televisa off 6.98 percent at $38.09. 

 "People are selling companies that have high price-earnings ratios, and Televisa fits that description. What's more, traders are saying 'Hey, they met their numbers last quarter and still their P-E is high, so let's sell," said Hugo Rubio, international equities trader at Lazard Freres. 

 The only bright side Rubio saw in the stocks he trades in Latin America were the Chilean energy companies. 

 "They don't have much technology, so they're less of a risk," he said. 

 Still, both oil company Endesa-Chile , off 2.09 percent to $10.80, and its sister company, Enersis was down 0.35 percent to $17.30.

 WRAPUP 3-Wall St stocks tumbles - U.S. Treasuries fare well.

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks lurched lower on Monday as the Nasdaq technology index tumbled to two year lows, deepening a global stock sell-off that was already being blamed on America's slower growth rates and lower corporate profits. 

 The stock market's losses made U.S. Treasuries more attractive to investors looking for less risk, and the dollar, which often takes its cues from the stock market, remained largely immune to the day's activity, rising around half a percent against the euro and the yen. 

 Already off more than 60 percent from its all-time high, the Nasdaq composite index on Monday tumbled as much as 5 percent after last week's warnings from tech giants Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems. 

 Intel issued a profit warning while Cisco said it would cut to 11 percent of its workforce. Cisco also sent an explosive charge into the market when it underscored concerns about America's sluggish growth rates by saying the current slowdown appears to be spreading and may last longer than many expected. 

 Overnight, the news already punished global technology stocks, forcing the pan-European FTSE 300 index down 2.2 percent and Japan's Nikkei index off 3.62 percent to a 16-year low. 

 By midafternoon, the Nasdaq index had trimmed some of its losses to trade down 4.43 percent at 1962.85. Its decline had a negative knock-on effect for the broader indices. The Dow Jones industrials average dropped 2.6 percent to 10270.74. The broader S&P 500 index was meanwhile off 3 percent at 1196.24 flirting with so-called bear territory marked by a drop of 20 percent, and not seen in 13 years. 

 "There is certainly fear out there - fear and disappointment," said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at PanAgora Asset Management, which manages $17 billion. 

 "So many people believed in the New Economy story to such an extent and to see all those dreams completely dashed in front of you is demoralizing," he added. 

 Adding to Wall Street's sour mood, UBS Warburg's chief portfolio strategist, Ed Kerschner, cut his 2001 earnings outlook for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by 3.5 percent because of a drop in manufacturing activity and cuts in corporate spending. 

 STOCK MARKET'S LOSS IS BOND MARKET'S GAIN 

 Plunging stock prices buoyed the bond market however, helping Treasuries recoup losses suffered on Friday when a report showing stronger-than-expected payroll data scaled back expectations for more aggressive future interest rate cuts. 

 Two-year Treasury notes, which are sensitive to the near-term outlook for Fed policy, were trading at 4.45 percent, up two basis points (0.02 percent) on the day but still above a two-year low of 4.39 set on Feb. 28. 

 Benchmark 10-year notes climbed 5/32 to 100-20/32, yielding 4.91 percent. 

 News that 135,000 new jobs were added outside the farm sector last month plus stronger than expected car sales data and still buoyant home sales and construction spending figures suggested the economy still has pockets of strength. 

 While there is little doubt the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its March 20 meeting, Wall Street was disappointed when the recent data lowered the chances for a three-quarters of a percentage point rate cut and more rate-cutting moves in the months ahead. 

 "We are not seeing an economic contraction but we should make no doubt about it that growth is soft and the stock market is quite rightly reacting to this," said Josh Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Asset Management Americas. 

 Echoing many analysts' forecasts, Feinman said: "I still expect the Federal Reserve to cut half a percentage point at its March 20 meeting." 

 The Fed already cut the federal funds rate a full percentage point in January, moving the federal funds rate to 5.50 percent in two separate steps. 

 Even now, with the stock market down more sharply, the chances for a bigger interest rate have risen only to a one-in-four chance on Monday up from a one-in-six chance on Friday. 

 DOLLAR RESILIENT AS STOCKS FALL 

 Even as the stock market was falling, the dollar remained relatively resilient with the yen falling to troughs around 120.65 yen, its lowest level since July 1999 and over 3 percent below the peaks around 117 scaled at the beginning of March, according to Reuters data. 

 The yen set fresh 20-month lows against the dollar after the Nikkei fell as Japan's Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori denied reports that he planned an early resignation. 

 The euro was changing hands at 92.74 cents, off half a percent against the dollar. 

 Japan's murky political outlook appeared to clear over the weekend when local media reported that Mori had agreed to bring forward an election for the presidency of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 

 But the unpopular Mori told parliament he had no intention of resigning, leaving the market no wiser about who will replace him, or when. 

 "It looks as if the political situation is in a limbo and it has increased the negative sentiment for the yen," said Neil MacKinnon, senior currency strategist at Merrill Lynch.

Intraday
NEW YORK STOCKS:


 Another collision with pessimistic earnings prospects sent a reeling market skidding sharply lower in what proved to be, for some market averages, the worst day yet in what has been a disastrous year for equity investors. 

 Blue-chip technology issues sagged to fresh 52-week lows in fairly routine fashion. Cisco Systems, the networking products giant, could be had for a price that hasn't been seen since the waning days of 1998. The stock lost $1.81 to $18.81 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, as analysts interpreted the company's late Friday announcement of job cuts as a signal to further rein in earnings forecasts. 

 Shares of Ciena slid 11.81 to 53.31 on Nasdaq, after Salomon Smith Barney, in a bow to the weakness in the global economy and the impact that could have on sales of telecommunications products, cut its price target on the communications equipment maker. 

 Salomon also made some downbeat comments about Applied Micro Circuits, and shares of that stock lost 2.81 to 23.63 on Nasdaq. 

 Just about everything in technology with an exposure to the slowing economy - and that means everything in technology - struggled in Monday's trading session. News that Japan's equity market had sagged to a 15-year low amid broad economic difficulty there only heaped more bad news on the market. 

 "As Japan took a new leg down with regard to their economic problems, anybody who thought we could help grow our way out of this disaster through the foreign purchase of goods or services or securities had to rethink their position," said Philip Orlando, chief investment strategist at Value Line Asset Management, adding of the selloff that's lately devastated U.S. equities, "This is as brutal, and as ugly as what we saw in '98, or in '87, for that matter." 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 128.87 points, dropping 6.28%, to close at 1923.91. The loss, in percentage terms, marked the eleventh-worst one-day selloff ever. The index last finished south of 2000 points on Dec. 14, 1998, and hadn't closed this low since Nov. 19 that year. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average also endured a brush with history, finishing down 436.37 points, the fifth-worst one-day selloff in history, though its loss on a percentage basis, which amounted to 4.10%, didn't number among the 20 worst percentage losses. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 699 issues advancing, 2,415 declining and 170 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,218,701,980 shares, compared with 1,078,952,190 Friday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 605.97, down 23.02. The average price per share fell 1.37 cents. 


NEW YORK PRECIOUS METALS:



Precious metals were trading mostly lower late Monday, with gold
futures unable to attract much follow-through buying and capped by
lending that eased tightness in the short-term lease rates, traders
said.



"There was a little lending overnight. Lease rates dropped ever so
slightly. Some professionals took that as a cue to go short," said the
manager of precious metals trading for a Canadian bank.

Commodity funds, whose short covering has been driving the rally,
continued to buy, he said. Some may even have reversed to the long side
by now and were able to squeeze the very short-term shorts in Europe -
bullion dealers - forcing them to buy back positions, he added.



April gold on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange
finished trading 80 cents higher at $272.30 a troy ounce.



NYMEX:



Crude and products futures rebounded from early losses at the New York
Mercantile Exchange Monday and market players were kept guessing about
the size of upcoming production cuts.



Traders with vulnerable short positions covered ahead of an
Organization of Petroleum Countries oil ministers meeting Friday and
Saturday where an output cut is expected between 500,000 and 1 million
barrels a day, analysts said. Most traders are staying on the sidelines
before the meeting.



"A lot of people don't want to trade it right now unless they see an
indication of how much they'll cut," said Mike Busby, trader at
Northville Trading Corp. "



Nearby crude oil futures bounced after Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi
said Monday that Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela supported the
importance of an output cut by OPEC members. Naimi reaffirmed the
group's commitment to a $25 price target for the cartel's reference
basket of crudes. But crude futures closed flat as the OPEC price basket
stood near the target at $24.59 last Friday.



Naimi said members of the OPEC will decide to cut production by an
amount relative to the current supply-and-demand situation, and to
current and forecast oil inventories over the next few months. Naimi
said the cut would be decided upon Friday.



"The best estimate now is 700,000 b/d," Busby said. "That is likely to
keep prices stabilized."



Mexican Oil Minister Ernesto Martens met with Saudi Oil Minister Ali
Naimi Sunday and said that Mexico would agree to an output cut only if
there is a surplus in the market.



Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico engineered a series of output cuts
in 1998 and 1999 that lifted crude oil prices to 10-year highs last
year.



The petroleum complex traded narrowly Friday, caught between
inventories running at 25-year lows, an expected second-quarter surplus,
and the likely cut in crude oil production.



Crude is expected to continue to trade between $27.50 and $28.50 a
barrel until Friday's meeting in Vienna, barring any surprises.



Monday, Saudi Arabia cut crude April term volumes to Japan by 12.5%,
the same rate as in March, Dow Jones Newswires reported.



After four production increases last year to knock down prices, OPEC
agreed to cut its output ceiling by 1.5 million barrels a day from Feb.
1 to stave off a price slump ahead of an expected 2.6 million barrel
surplus in the second quarter.



As OPEC members consider a second output cut, they must balance their
desire to prop up prices without hurting global economic growth,
analysts said. While an ouput cut may be needed in response to a drop in
demand in the second quarter, reducing supply could hurt global economic
growth by keeping prices high and stocks low, analysts say.



Robert Priddle, the executive director of the International Energy
Agency, said Monday that OPEC must weigh inventories, as well as demand,
before agreeing to a cut.



"The level of stocks is a concern to us" and "ought to be a concern
for OPEC," Priddle said.



Crude oil stocks hit a 25-year low last week, according to industry
and government data, ahead of the peak summer driving season. Analysts
will be monitoring U.S. inventory data to be released late Tuesday and
early Wednesday for any more drawdowns.



"If you take a little more stock away from 25-year-low levels there's
some upside potential," said Tim Evans, analyst at IFR Pegasus. "That's
a critical enough situation. (Short-term) it may not matter what OPEC
announces on Friday."



Whether the IEA influences OPEC's decision remains to be seen. The IEA
is due to release its March oil report Wednesday, and sources say a
further downward revision in the 2001 oil demand forecast is likely.



OPEC observers say such a revision will make another output cut more
likely.



The IEA has lowered its 2001 demand forecast three times in
consecutive months: by 80,000 b/d in December, 280,000 b/d in January
and 240,000 b/d in February, to 77.53 million b/d, 77.25 million b/d and
77.01 million b/d respectively.



Prices for crude oil are in dollars a barrel and changes are in cents;
prices for products are in cents a gallon and changes are in points.

LONDON METALS EXCHANGE:



London Metal Exchange three-month base metals ended the late kerb
mostly lower Monday on resurfacing global economic concerns, analysts
said.



Indicators point to difficult conditions ahead in the Japanese
economy, as stronger-than-expected economic growth in October to
December was overshadowed by falling external demand, implying that
slowing world growth is already weighing on the economy. Also, the
German Banking Federation Monday downgraded its forecast of German gross
domestic product growth in 2001 to 2.2% from 2.75%, following growth of
3.0% in 2000.



"The U.S. equity market has been falling with the Dow and the NASDAQ
both down - it's all a case of equity led weakness (on the LME today),"
said Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar.



(Comex prices in cents a pound at 1245 GMT). LME midday price in

However, both copper and aluminum held onto support levels, which are
$1,790/ton and $1,540/ton respectively, therefore the shorts did not
want to hold on to their positions overnight, Bhar said.



"LME selling was not that aggressive (this afternoon), there was a
modest rally at the close as the shorts went in and covered their
positions," he said.



UK SHARES:



U.K. shares ended sharply lower Monday as the bearish influence of the
Nasdaq Stock Market's 5.4% plunge Friday was exacerbated by fresh
negative corporate news, with technology and life assurance sectors
being hit hardest.



The FTSE 100 closed down 90.8 points, or 1.5%, at 5826.5, its lowest
closing level in more than two years. The index had a provisional market
volume of 1.6 billion shares.



The market didn't get into positive territory all day as the Nasdaq's
weak close Friday, followed by news of job losses at Cisco and negative
developments from Ericsson, kept investors in the technology sectors
reeling all session.



Cisco's announcement led to a bevy of analyst downgrades which ripped
through the technology sectors, and a profit warning from Ericsson ahead
of the U.S. open added to the bearish sentiment.



In addition, the Swedish tech bellwether Ericsson announced that it
wouldn't meet their first quarter earnings estimates, citing reduced
sales due to economic concerns, increased capital expenditure and margin
pressures.



The news knocked points off the FTSE 100, particularly as the
heavyweight Vodafone fell sharply after the announcement.



Within the technology sectors, ARM Holdings fell 29.5 pence, or 8.9%,
to 302 pence, Autonomy dropped 104 pence, or 7.9% to 1205 pence, Colt
Telecom fell 84 pence, or 6.9% to 1140 pence and Vodafone lost 4.5
pence, or 2.2%, to 197 pence.



Marconi was off 34 pence, or 7.1%, to 447 pence, despite signing a
five year supply deal with British Telecom



However, the day's major decliner was Prudential after it announced a
deal to acquire American General.



The GBP18.1 billion deal makes Prudential the sixth largest insurance
firm in the world, will allow $130 million in cost savings by the end of
2002 - particularly important in a consolidating sector - and gives
Prudential access to the ageing U.S population.



But investors are concerned that the price for American is too high
and that holders of American may sell their stock, said analysts.



Prudential fell 125 pence, or 14%, to 772 pence, leading the FTSE life
assurance sector to a fall of 5.3% on the day.



Also posting severe losses was Celltech Group, mainly due to
profit-taking ahead of its annual results announcement Wednesday - where
analysts are looking for news of product licensing and mergers. The
share plunged 130 pence, or 10%, to 1170 pence.



The weakness in global equity markets took its toll on financial
stocks too. HSBC dropped 42 pence, or 4.7%, to 862 pence after being
downgraded to market perform from outperform by Goldman Sachs. AMVESCAP
also dropped 113 pence, or 9.0%, to 1134 pence.



Defensive stocks made slight gains, with Centrica climbing 10 pence,
or 4.3%, to 245 pence, Safeway gaining 5.5 pence, or 1.9%, to 294 pence
and Sainsbury up 5.5 pence, or 1.5%, to 376 pence.



The FTSE 100's closing level is its lowest since Feb. 10, 1999, but is
higher than J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Glydon's first support level at
5800. Glydon put the next support at 5700 and then 5000. Another
technical analyst said he didn't have any support levels for the FTSE
and he could only see a freefall.

 Nasdaq to begin phasing in decimal trading.

 The Nasdaq stock market will begin its transistion to decimal-based stock quotes on Monday, following similar moves by main rivals, the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange. 

 Nasdaq's move was delayed last year when the exchange cited the need for more time to prepare its computer systems for the switch. 

 The market is testing waters this week with 15 counters trading in the decimal system. 

 In two weeks' time, another 177 companies, including Amazon.com, Apple Computers and Sun Microsystem will join in the new system. 

 Analysts said the shift from the use of fractions to plain dollars and cents should benefit private investors by making pricing easier and cutting trading costs. 

 Meanwhile, looming over this transitional phase is the recent trading shutdowns in the exchange's system. 

 Nasdaq has been criticised for its poor handling of trading halts. 

 Nasdaq's trading systems were shut down three times over the past two weeks, the most recent one involving Yahoo shares. 

 The counter was halted shortly after it began trading, following announcements of a profit warning and its chief executive stepping down. 

 The changeover will be conducted in three stages for all 4,700 companies, with the transistion targeted for completion by April 9.

On the CBS MarketWatch, warnings on cyber crime and more bad news on the profit front. Renay San Miguel has details.   

RENAY SAN MIGUEL reporting:   

Wall Street is coming off a week of warnings, warnings from companies about their profits and warnings from the FBI about online credit card theft. Security officials are calling it the largest criminal attack on the Internet yet. The FBI said it was looking at more than one million credit card numbers stolen from some 40 e-commerce and financial Web sites over the past few months. The government isn't saying which companies were hacked, but did say some are large Internet companies that didn't fix well-known flaws in software.   

Mr. RON DICK (FBI): There are a whole range of reasons why companies sometimes are delayed in getting these done. The point is, is there needs to be a--a greater awareness and due diligence in making sure that these measures are taking place.   

SAN MIGUEL: Investors engaged in some due diligence last Friday, and after that decided it was time to sell their tech stocks. That helped send the Dow reeling Friday to the tune of 213 points down...   

(Graphic on screen)   

Dow Jones Industrials   

down 213.69   

to 10,644.56   

SAN MIGUEL: ...brokerages, retailers, oil service and airlines among those selling off. One year ago, the NASDAQ hit its all-time high, 5,132. Now it's down about, oh, only about 60 percent, ending Friday down 115 points to 2,052.   

(Graphic on screen)   

NASDAQ Composite

SAN MIGUEL: Here is one big reason why-- Intel issuing another profit warning, saying it wasn't selling enough of its computer chips and would also have to lay off 5,000 people.

Profit Warning

Intel (INTC)   

down 3.81

SAN MIGUEL: Cisco Systems, along with  Intel, one of the four horseman of the NASDAQ, saying it would also have to cut jobs, 8,000 of them, and it would cost the company $300 million to $400 million to do so.

Job Cuts   

Cisco Systems (CSCO)   

down 2.19

 ADVERTISING & MARKETING 

 *Audit Bureau of Circulations Proposes New Method 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Audit Bureau of Circulations has proposed radically altering the way magazines count their circulation, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Monday. 

 At its board meeting this weekend, the Audit Bureau, the industry's official number-crunching body, proposed allowing magazines to count copies sold at any price, even as low as a penny, the paper reported the trade group's President, Michael Lavery, as saying. 

 Previously, publishers could only count copies sold for more than 50 percent of the magazine's basic price, the paper noted. The move that could give a short-term boost to the ailing industry but one that could tilt the balance of power in favor of the advertising community, the paper said. 

 But under the proposed guidelines, publishers would also have to report their title's average sale price, excluding certain expenses such as the cost of promotions, the paper said, adding that this wasn't required before. 

 *Time Warner to Pay $72,000 for Booting ABC Off Air 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable, now part of mega-media giant AOL Time Warner Inc., has agreed to pay $72,000 for kicking the ABC network off the air last May in a contract dispute during a critical ratings period, the Federal Communications Commission said on Friday. 

 Time Warner had blocked ABC's signal in 11 cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Houston, after the two sides could not reach an agreement on a contract to carry the broadcast network, preventing some 3.5 million viewers from seeing their favorite shows during the critical sweeps period. 

 Time Warner apologized for the action and turned back on the Walt Disney Co.-owned network after 39 hours and a deluge of complaints flowed in from irate cable customers. 

 The FCC ruled at the time that Time Warner had violated certain agency rules for terminating ABC's signal during the ratings period when networks air their best programs as advertising rates are set for the months ahead. 

 *Schroders Enters Partnership with China Galaxy 

 LONDON (Reuters) - British fund manager Schroders Plc on Monday said it entered a strategic partnership with one of China's biggest brokerages it a bid to develop its fund management activities in the country. 

 London-based Schroders said it signed a memorandum of understanding with state-owned China Galaxy Securities, which was launched last August after the merger of several smaller brokerages. 

 The companies will co-operate in areas including staff training, design and research of financial products, client services, marketing and sales, investment management, risk management and information technology support.

 MEDIA & THE INTERNET 

 *MarketWatch.com to Unveil New Look for Site 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online financial news provider MarketWatch.com Inc. is expected to announce a new look on Monday for its CBS MarketWatch.com site with expanded content and new ad formats. 

 The news comes at a time online media companies try to find ways to counter the slowdown in ad spending that has caused many of the companies to temper their outlooks, look for new sources of revenue and fight harder for market share. 

 "CBS MarketWatch.com has always been a powerhouse content provider," said Larry Kramer, Chairman & CEO of MarketWatch.com in a statement. "But our new site will let us offer more content and tools than ever to our readers, to advertisers, as well as to our licensing and distribution partners. Very simply, we've improved CBS MarketWatch.com from the ground up." 

 The new site has simpler and quicker navigation through five basic channels, or categories and sub-channels. It offers more mutual funds coverage and new sections on areas such as real estate and retirement, as well as breaking European news and commentary from sister site, FTMarketWatch.com. 

 *Costs of Hacker Intrusions Grew to $378 Million 

 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Financial losses attributed to computer hacking and other security breaches at businesses and government departments grew 42 percent from the previous year to nearly $378 million in 2000, according to the sixth annual survey put out by a San Francisco-based security policy group. 

 Eighty-five percent of respondents detected computer security breaches in the past year, with 64 percent admitting financial losses, according to the survey, put out by the Computer Security Institute and the FBI. 

 That compares with $265 million in losses reported by 42 percent of survey respondents last year. Experts say a large number of attacks go unrecognized, and that the total is hard to assess, with companies reluctant to admit that they've been attacked unless they are widely publicized. 

 High-profile attacks in 2000 included the coordinated denial of service of attacks against Yahoo!, eBay, Buy.com and several other Web sites in February. 

 *Music Labels Send List of Copyrighted Songs to Napster 

 LOS ANGELES(Reuters) - The trade group representing major record labels has sent a list of 135,000 songs to Napster that the company must block from being swapped over its wildly popular Internet service by Wednesday, a group spokeswoman said on Sunday. 

 Amy Weiss, spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), said the list was e-mailed to Napster late Friday. 

 Under a court injunction issued on March 5, Napster is required to bar the transfer of songs specified within three days of notification by the copyright holders. 

 A Napster spokesperson confirmed that the company had received "a list." 

 *U.S. Leads in Global Web Usage 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States leads the world in logging on to the Internet from home, Internet audience measurement firm Nielsen//NetRatings said on Friday. 

 More than 98 million people at home logged online during December in the U.S. Japan ranked second with nearly 15 million Web surfers, followed by Germany with 13 million, the United Kingdom with 10 million, and Canada with 9 million users. 

 Internet users in Hong Kong, however, spent more time connected online than any other country. Surfers there logged on for an average of more than 9 hours and 43 minutes per month. 

 Canadians followed with usage of 9 hours and 24 minutes, while Americans ranked third at 8 hours and 41 minutes. Germans spent 8 hours and 15 minutes online, while the Japanese rounded out the top five rankings at 7 hours and 41 minutes. Nielsen/NetRatings reports on Web usage via a PC in 21 countries. 

 *Sina.com Says Great Potential in China Online Ads 

 BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Internet portal Sina.com faces difficulties in online advertising but there is potential in China's underdeveloped online advertising market, a top company official said on Monday. 

 Daniel Mao, chief operating officer of the Internet portal, said one of the reasons top U.S. portal Yahoo issued a second profit warning last week was the weak online advertising market in the United States. 

 "But in China, the increase in online advertising was 100 percent, even if the amount was actually quite small," Mao told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. 

 "There was an increase of $40 million last year to $80 million this year, an increase that reflects China's market still has the potential to grow larger," he said in response to a question. 

 *Dead Shipping E-Venture Warns Industry of Folly 

 LONDON (Reuters) - Shipping e-commerce venture Maritimedirect has shut, using its last day in operation to post a warning to the industry that shipping and the Internet do not mix. 

 "We have certainly learnt, for sure, that maritime e-procurement does not work in its existing format," reads a parting message on its website, www.maritimedirect.com. The business model relied upon an information service attracting potential buyers to a site where shipping supplies and services were on offer. 

 On March 1, Maritimedirect CEO Connor O'Brien told Reuters the company was undergoing a period of restructuring, and this was why its information service had not been updated for three days. 

 In January, the company shed 20 employees, around half its workforce, to focus on its most profitable area - news and market information. That followed an earlier round of redundancies in autumn 2000. The closure comes during a period of severe contraction in shipping e-commerce and Internet ventures generally.

 BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS & CONSUMER TRENDS 

 *Web-Savvy Americans a Powerful Consumer Force in U.S. 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans are still flocking to the Internet in droves and a recent study found that those who use the Internet in their daily lives are also proving to be influential consumers, rapidly outdistancing their offline counterparts. 

 The report - a joint project of global marketing research and consultant firm Roper Starch Worldwide and Yahoo! Internet Life, a lifestyle magazine about Internet culture published by Ziff-Davis Media Inc. under a licensing agreement with Yahoo! Inc. - determined that not only are Web-savvy Americans far younger and more affluent than those who are not familiar with the Web, but they also lead more active lives and are more likely to spend offline. 

 "Integrating the Internet into their lives has changed the way these consumers live, work and buy," said Scott Crystal, executive vice president and publishing director of Ziff-Davis Media's consumer magazine group. "That's why we've dubbed them the 'New American Consumer.'" 

 They use the Internet to research their purchases," Crystal said. "They're not only active buyers online but more active buyers at retail stores." 

 *Reckitt Buys Korean Oxy for 162.5 Billion Won 

 LONDON (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch consumer products group Reckitt Benckiser Plc said on Monday it was buying South Korean Oxy Co Ltd for 162.5 billion won ($127 million). Reckitt said in a statement Oxy had net sales of 125 billion won in 1999, with over 50 percent of those sales from brands with number one or number two market positions. 

 *United Biscuits to Sell Frozen Fish Stake 

 LONDON (Reuters) - Snack maker United Biscuits is to sell its stake in Young's Bluecrest, the frozen fish business, to the venture capital division of insurance group Legal & General, the Financial Times reported on Monday. 

 The paper said the firm, owned by the Finalrealm consortium, was expected to announce the deal to sell its 44 per cent sahre as part of a refocusing on its core biscuits and savoury snacks ranges. 

 The sale would raise Legal & General Ventures' stake to 79 percent, with management and other finance providers holding the balance. The Bluecrest brand had a turnover of some 300 million pounds ($440.5 million) and about 30 percent of the frozen and chilled seafood market, the paper said.

 US stocks slump, but jobs jump.

 US technology shares had their biggest fall this year yesterday, as computer giant Intel became the latest in a string of technology companies to warn of lower sales. 

 The high-tech Nasdaq index slumped 115 points, or 5.4 per cent, while the wider Dow Jones index shed 213 points, or 2 per cent, to close at 10,644.6. 

 The Nasdaq is now 59 per cent below its highest close - hit exactly a year ago today after almost doubling in 1999 and early 2000. 

 Following Intel's profit warning, the release of a strong US jobs report sparked speculation that America's Federal Reserve may not have to cut interest rates as soon or as far as had been expected. 

 The Labor Department report found that 135,000 jobs were created in February, almost double some analysts' expectations. 

 Locally, the US jobs news put the Australian dollar back on the ropes, sending it down to within US0.12c of its all-time low last week. The dollar closed in New York at US50.90c. 

 Earlier in the week, the currency touched a low of US50.61c after the Reserve Bank lowered interest rates and Australia moved a step closer to recession by recording negative economic growth in the December quarter. 

 Many analysts are tipping interest rates to fall further in the next month or two. 

 The prospect of further rate cuts locally helped dampen the bad economic news for share investors, who kept the All Ordinaries index reasonably steady during the week. 

 After a 12.5 point fall on Friday, the All Ords ended the week at 3276, down just under 4 points. 

 Given Saturday morning's fall on Wall Street, however, the local market could come under some pressure early next week. 

 On a more positive note, the gold price continued its three week rally in overnight trade on Friday, taking its gains over the past month to more than 5 per cent. 

 It was trading yesterday at US$271.50 an ounce, up more than $5 for the week 

 The return to favour of the precious metal is already having its impact on the local markets. 

 On Friday, Lihir Gold rose 4c to 68c, Goldfields rose 7c to $1.55, Anglogold gained $2.70 to $65.50 and Delta finished 5c higher at $1.32. Analysts are predicting more gains next week.

 KC wheat closes higher

 Kansas City wheat futures closed higher Thursday after the government lowered its projections for ending stocks of wheat. Chicago wheat futures finished mixed, while corn was higher and soybeans mostly lower. 

 Kansas City Value Line stock index futures and Isdex Internet stock index futures fell. 

 The U.S. Department of Agriculture projected 2000-01 U.S. wheat ending stocks at 834 million bushels, down from the previous estimate of 839 million bushels. 

 Corn futures were boosted by better-than-expected exports. The Agriculture Department said that for the week that ended March 1, net export sales of corn were 875,900 metric tons, above estimates of 500,000 to 850,000 metric tons. 

 Soybeans rose after a government forecast in Brazil pegged that country's soybean production at a smaller-than-expected 34.8 million metric tons. Brazil and the United States are the world's top soybean producers. 

 However, production from Argentina was raised to 25 million metric tons from the previous estimate of 24 million metric tons. 

 The Kansas City Value Line and Isdex finished lower as traders squared positions ahead of today's government report on employment. 

 "Everyone's got their eye on that," said Kansas City trader  Paul Dow. 

 The number could show the economy is slowing more than expected and could prompt an interest rate cut before the Federal Reserve's meeting later this month. 

 Meanwhile, a profit warning from Yahoo hung over the technology sector, with investors putting their money into safer stocks. 

 "The tech sector is not the place to be," Dow said.

As tech stocks try to recover from yesterday's Internet sell-off, Wall Street will be focused on the February jobs report. Investors will be looking for more clues about the direction of the economy. And some market watchers say if that jobs report comes in much weaker than expected, it could force the Fed to cut interest rates before its March 20th meeting.   

On Wall Street, it was a tale of two markets as  Yahoo!'s management shake-up and profit warning took its toll on Internet-related stocks. But investors went on a blue chip buying spree, making the Dow rise for the fifth straight day, climbing 128 points to 10,858.

It will layoff 25 percent of its work force and it's looking for a new CFO. But retail stocks helped to offset the weakness we saw in techs.  Wal-Mart, Kmart and  Costco all moved higher after reporting better-than-expected February same-store sales.   

And look for a new kid on the block today.

 US CREDIT MKTS - TSYS STEADY AFTER STRONG US EMPLOYMENT REPORT.

 WASHINGTON (MktNews) - Prices of U.S. Treasury securities quieted after stronger-than-expected February U.S. employment data sparked early selling. 

 The U.S. employment data show no evidence of loss of white collar jobs, said MSDW economist David Greenlaw, but the unemployment rate should rise in coming months. 

 The Feb report was mixed but it also showed cost pressures in wages, which are "finally responding" to tight labor markets, he said. 

 Economists suggested the employment data indicate the U.S. is not in recession and is recovering from winter weakness. As for the Fed, most say a 50 BP rate cut is still possible at the March 20 FOMC meeting, but cuts beyond March now are in question. 

 Sources reported two-way flows in Treasuries as market participants also reacted to stock market moves. The DJIA was off 196 points at 11:10 a.m., still reacting to Intel's profit warning, giving support to short Treasuries. 

 There was also bargain hunting that lifted Treasuries off the lows. The 2/30-year curve got close to +83 basis points but re-steepened to +87.4 BPs as of 11:10 a.m. 

 A hedge fund was said to be exiting a squash trade in Eurodollar options. Two weeks ago they sold as-much-as 20,000 short Jun 94.50 puts and bought equal amount of short Jun 95.00 calls. There was profit-taking reported Friday. 

 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency reported 4Q total notional derivatives were up $2.2 trillion to $40.5 trillion, with almost all the gain in interest rate derivatives due to the sudden interest rate drop starting in November. The top seven banks upped their credit exposure to 254% of capital. OCC said bank revenue from interest rate derivatives trading was off 7% in 4Q, but revenue from foreign exchange derivatives was up 16%. 

 In corporate bonds, Japan Finance was said to have priced $1 billion 10-year globals at T+108 via BNP and Merrill. 

 In swaps, JP Morgan suggested in a research report moving 2s/10s swap yield curve steepeners into 1s/10s. The 1s/2s tend to steepen significantly on Fed ease, Morgan's analysts said. 

 At 11:10 a.m. EST, the Treasury 30-year bond yield was at 5.314%, compared with 5.297% at 3:00 p.m. Monday.

 Miyazawa says his Thur comments on fiscal situation inappropriate 

 Tokyo, March 9 (BridgeNews) - Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said comments he made in parliament that Japan's fiscal structure "is near total breakdown" were inappropriate and do not mean that he has changed his opinion about the nation's debt. The yen fell to a 20-month low against the U.S. dollar after Miyazawa's comments Thursday. ( Story .24547 )

 Washington, March 8 (BridgeNews) - The Japanese Finance Ministry would be quite happy if the euro strengthened against the yen and the dollar, Japanese Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda said.

 Intel issues another revenue warning, to eliminate 5,000 jobs 

 New York, March 8 (BridgeNews) - Intel Corp. (INTC) said it will eliminate 5,000 jobs, mostly by attrition, as the economic slowdown continues to hurt its profits. The semiconductor maker had said in mid-January that first-quarter revenues will fall by 15% from the fourth quarter, but it now expects a 25% decline. ( Story .5975 ) 

 US stocks end mixed as Yahoo! warning weighs on Nasdaq

 US House OKs $958 bln in tax-rate cuts; changes expected 

 Washington, March 8 (BridgeNews) - The House of Representatives approved cuts in individual tax rates of $958 billion, the core of President Bush's tax plan. However, the rate cuts and other pieces of the Bush plan will likely be re-worked during months of congressional negotiations before a final version emerges. The battle is likely to last through late summer or early autumn. House Republican leaders insisted on quick action on the bill, which was approved mostly along party lines. ( Story .23055) 

 US retailers face tough times as February sales mostly disappoint

But the nation's merchants continued to face drastically different conditions from the boom times of years past as the economy slowed and consumers became more cautious. The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/UBS Warburg index of sales at 75 retailers rose an estimated 2.8%, with a few big winners but a lot of disappointments. ( Story .5970 )

 FBI warns e-commerce companies about organized Russian hackers 

 Washington, March 8 (AP) - Organized hacker groups, primarily from former Soviet countries, are responsible for recent increases in credit card thefts and extortion attempts, the FBI said. It said e-commerce companies should be more vigilant in protecting their customers' credit card numbers. Investigators at the National Infrastructure Protection Center, the FBI's cyber crimes arm, said investigations "have disclosed several organized hacker groups in eastern Europe, specifically Russia and the Ukraine, that have penetrated U.S. e-commerce computer systems".

 Hong Kong Stocks - Hang Seng set to flounder in narrow trading.

 Mar 08, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - By Dan Slater 

 Hong Kong, March 9 (BridgeNews) - Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) is Friday expected to continue its feeble trading pattern of earlier in the week within a narrow range due to major doubts about the direction of the world economy. Brokers expect a strong improvement on Thursday's weak turnover. 

 "There is just not much good news for the market to get its teeth into," commented Alex Wong, head of research at KGI Asia, saying he expected another dull day's trading within 200 points of the 14,000 level. 

 "On the bright side, the low turnover also means that selling pressure is easing off following a lackluster budget (on Wednesday) from the market's point of view", he noted. 

 Jeff Galbraith, sales manager at China Everbright Securities agreed. 

 "I can't see any news out there which might change the pattern set yesterday," he opined. 

 In the U.S. market overnight, the Nasdaq closed down for the first day in four, shedding 55.19 points, or 2.48%, to 2168.73 following a profit warning from Internet bellwether stock Yahoo! 

 The Dow was, however, up 128.65, or 1.20%, at 10,858.25. 

 Brokers said although the HSI has no pure Internet players, the profit warning from Yahoo! will further sour sentiment on Hong Kong's New Economy stocks, including telecommunications stocks. 

 In addition, U.S. chip maker Intel Corp. warned overnight that revenue in the current quarter will fall short of already lowered expectations. 

 The company also disclosed plans to cut 5,000 jobs, or about 6% of its work force. 

 Further, ports-to-telecoms conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. suffered a downgrade in its earnings forecast Thursday by investment bank JP Morgan. 

 These development are expected to stifle a mini-rally in index-heavyweight mainland telecommunications company China Mobile (HK) Ltd., which edged up to close at HK $37.40 Thursday from $37.10 the preceding day. 

 Certain property stocks bought ahead of Wednesday's budget in anticipation of market-boosting measures are expected to continue under pressure. 

 "However, overall the property market looks fairly solid as we are expecting a cut in interest rates very soon in the U.S", added Wong. 

 A reasonable outlook for the property market is expected to partially support banking stocks, which are currently heavily dependent on the mortgage business. 

 The market has, however, eyed banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC with caution by since its disappointing earnings announcement early in the month, and is not expected to help pull up the index Friday, brokers said.

 Hong Kong Stocks Review: Market wobbles around 14,200, turnover low - 

 By Michael Gulyaev 

 Hong Kong, March 8 (BridgeNews) - Hong Kong stocks were range-bound most of the day Thursday with turnover hitting one of the lowest levels for the year as investors stayed sidelined, ignoring all news, uncertain of which direction the market will take. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 14,208.95, up 31.59 points or 0.22%. Market turnover was only H.K. $6.2 billion, less than half of what the amount was just two weeks ago. 

 "The market has ignored the bad news, looking for some excuse to go up," Ross Cheung with Tanrich Securities. 

 "Market turnover figures have been falling for about a week now, signaling that selling pressure is fading away," he added. 

 Cheung said the market needed more positive news to move up but instead only negative news was pouring in. 

 "Maybe U.S. unemployment data on Monday oeill be positive and help the market," he said. 

 Earlier Thursday, investment bank JP Morgan lowered its earnings forecasts on Hong Kong's conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. by 15.4% for 2000, 11.3% for 2001 and 29.7% for 2002. (Story .10959) 

 The change was due to adjustments to the restructuring profit estimate for the company's Canadian subsidiary, Husky Oil, and British telecommunication operator Vodafone's market performance. 

 Hutchison holds 3% of Vodafone. 

 Hutchison's stock was down 0.84% to $88.75 but brokers said it could have gone lower had the market not already been trading at depressed levels. 

 The market also ignored talk about Hong Kong's 2001-2002 budget, revealed Wednesday, as being too conservative and not good for the economy. 

 "We believe there will be some pressure on share prices in the short term as the market expected more of a boost to the property sector," Salomon Smith Barney commented in the morning. 

 Property counters ended the day mixed. Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. added 0.27% to $92.75 while Amoy Properties was down 0.53% to $9.40. 

 The broad market was boring and stagnant Thursday with interest focused on blue chips, brokers said. 

 Only a few people are interested in buying China-related stocks at the moment, brokers noted. 

 "Chinese authorities said the yuan-and dollar-denominated stock markets will not be merged for another 5 years, I don't think it is good news for that Hong Kong market," Cheung said. 

 "Interest in China-related stocks is low now," he added. 

 FRIDAY TIPS 

 Brokers said the market would Friday continue stagnating with invest.rs looking at the blue-chip sector as a safe heaven amid market volatility. 

 Brokers recommend investors stay on the sidelines at least until Monday, awaiting cues from the U.S. market.

 ADVERTISING & MARKETING 

 *Cordiant Open to Takeover Offers From Rivals 

 LONDON (Reuters) - British advertising and media group Cordiant Communications has said it is open to takeover offers from rivals and suggests they move quickly before the price rises, the Financial Times reported on Friday. 

 Chief executive Michael Bungey was quoted as saying Cordiant was becoming a rarer commodity as the advertising industry consolidated and that as such prices tended to go "only in one direction". 

 "We have a very good shaped business strategically and we are strong financially, so that would make us interesting to a number of people," Bungey told the paper. Bungey said the company was not in formal merger talks but had had "informal chats" and would continue to do so. 

 The group won a further $150 million of new business in the first two months of 2001, after posting revenue growth of 53 percent to 513 million pounds last year, lifted by its acquisition of marketing business Lighthouse Global Network and healthcare marketing group Healthworld Corp. 

 *General Mills to Launch Media Account Review 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. food comglomerate General Mills Inc., the largest cereal maker in the country, was reported by Adweek Online on Thursday to have launched a consolidation review for its media account, estimated at $450 million. 

 General Mills did not have any comment on the report. The Minneapolis-based company, whose brands include Cheerios cereal, Hamburger Helper and Gold Medal Flour, works with a number of advertising agencies. 

 In the United States, General Mills works with Omnicommedia's OMD network and Publicis unit Zenith Media, in Canada with Publicis' Optimedia, and has a relationship in Europe with Universal McCann through its Cereal Partners joint venture with Nestle. 

 *French Ad Market to Rise Over 5% in 2001 

 PARIS (Reuters) - Promotional spending in France is likely to grow by more than five percent this year from 190.63 billion francs ($27.06 billion) in 2000 despite a recent slowdown, according to a study published on Thursday. 

 The study, by ad market researcher IREP and France Pub, researcher for Vivendi Universal's French free newspaper unit Comareg, said overall promotional spending in France had risen 7.9 percent in 2000 compared with 1999 levels. 

 It noted that "below-the-line" spending, including all kinds of marketing outside traditional media, grew less than advertising spending in the media in France last year, defying a global trend to stronger growth in marketing services. 

 "Despite a slowdown in advertising activity at the end of the year, which was more marked at the start of 2001, and in the context of a less favourable economic situation, advertisers' intentions allow us to expect advertising market growth of over five percent in 2001," a summary of the study said.

 MEDIA & THE INTERNET 

 *Movie Convention Ends With Tales of Things to Come 

 LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Several Hollywood movie studios gave theaterowners a sneak peek at their lineup of upcoming films - like computer-animated "Shrek" and highly anticipated "A.I." from Steven Spielberg - to wrap up the ShoWest convention here on Thursday. 

 ShoWest annually draws over 3,000 theater owners from around the world, and while this year's gathering was dominated by talk of putting new digital projection systems in cinemas, the studios also showed up to tout new films. 

 Warner Bros. flew in stars like John Travolta, Halle Berry, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hilary Swank and Chris Rock to wow theater owners, but by far their biggest surprise was the full cast of the highly anticipated "Ocean's 11" that includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon. "Ocean's" is a remake of the classic Vegas caper that starred Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr., to name a few of the so-called "rat-pack." 

 *Reader's Digest to Pay $8.2 Million Sweepstakes Settlement 

 SEATTLE (Reuters) - Reader's Digest Association Inc. will pay $8.2 million to settle charges that its sweepstakes campaigns misled consumers, Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire said on Thursday. 

 The Pleasantville, N.Y.-based publishing and direct marketing company reached the settlement deal with 32 states and Washington, D.C., which will split the proceeds, Gregoire said in a statement. 

 Reader's Digest did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Under the agreement, similar to deals struck with other publishers that market products via sweepstakes, Reader's Digest will spell out more clearly the odds of winning and that making a purchase will not increase those odds, Gregoire said. 

 In addition, the company can no longer send advertisements claiming a person has won or is close to winning and must offer standard means of entering its sweepstakes for free. 

 *Europe's Online Advertising Still Far From Sickly 

 LONDON (Reuters) - The woes of Internet titan Yahoo have revealed a sickly U.S. online advertising industry with frail prospects for this year, but the picture is somewhat different in Europe where solid growth is still expected. 

 Executives and analysts predict growth of at least 20 percent in European online advertising in 2001 and say Internet service providers (ISPs) and Web sites in Europe should feel the pain of any downturn less severely than their U.S. counterparts. 

 "In the last six months, we've seen strong growth in online advertising spending in Europe. I think the key is that European advertisers have been able to learn from the mistakes and successes in the U.S.," said Jason Dooris, the head of Media Com, the new media arm of advertising group Grey Communications. 

 Nevertheless, European Internet companies, which rely heavily on advertising revenues, caught a touch of the jitters on Thursday following Yahoo's profit warning. Europe's largest ISP, T-Online, fell nearly six percent, while Spain's Terra Lycos was 10 percent lower, and France's Wanadoo was seven percent softer. 

 *AOL Time Warner Sticks to 2001 Estimates Despite Ad Climate 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - AOL Time Warner Inc. Co-Chief Operating Officer Bob Pittman said Thursday the media giant was "sticking with" its previous guidance for its 2001 results even as Internet rival Yahoo Inc. issued an earnings warning, citing a deteriorating advertising climate. 

 "I want to tell you - no matter what others say - all businesses are not suffering. Let me speak for AOL Time Warner: Our businesses are doing great, "Pittman said at a Merrill Lynch Internet conference in New York. "Nothing's changed, and we're excited about our business. The company is in good position no matter what happens in the business cycle." 

 At an investors' day on Jan. 31 after the merger that created AOL Time Warner was completed, the world's largest Internet and media company said it expected to see 12 to 15 percent top-line growth and 30 percent earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) growth to $11 billion in 2001. 

 Its subscriptions business, which the media giant has touted as one of its greatest assets, is recession-proof, Pittman said, noting that its flagship AOL Internet service has surpassed 28 million members worldwide and members are averaging about 70 minutes on the service daily, up from 63 minutes a year ago. 

 *Internet.com Sees Higher 2001 Revenues, Buys Consulting Group 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - Online trade publisher Internet.com Corp. on Thursday forecast 2001 revenues of $70 million to $78 million, up from $52 million in 2000, and said it was well prepared for the current slowdown in advertising spending. 

 The company also announced the acquisition of Intermedia Group Inc., a consulting and event-management group. Terms were not disclosed, but Internet.com said it expects the acquisition to add to its earnings by the 2001 second quarter. 

 The company said it is projecting revenues of $13-$15 million in the first quarter, $17-$19 million in the second quarter, $19-$21 million in the third quarter, and $21-$23 million in the fourth quarter. 

 "We have seen a continued slowdown in advertising revenues during the month of February and into early March as advertising decisions are being deferred," Chairman and Chief Executive Alan Meckler said in a statement. "We believe that Internet.com is prepared to handle this slowdown better than almost any other trade publisher because of the diversity of our other business lines, including our seminar operations." 

 *Local TV Stations Ask FCC to Probe Big Networks 

 NEW YORK (Reuters) - A coalition of local television stations wants the government to investigate whether top networks ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox engaged in anti-competitive behaviour and violated Federal Communications Commission regulations, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Friday. 

 The move will increase tensions between the big networks and their affiliates and could hamper the networks' efforts to deregulate the television industry further, the paper said. 

 Viacom Inc.'s CBS, General Electric Co.'s NBC and Walt Disney Co.'s ABC have made concerted efforts to eliminate so-called affiliate compensation payments to stations that carry their programming and advertising, the paper said. 

 For many television stations, those payments are crucial and the networks' effort to cut them has put a major strain on the network-affiliate partnership, the paper noted. 

 *FBI Warns European Hackers Targeting E-Commerce 

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A series of organized hacker attacks targeting U.S. Web companies continues, despite previous warnings, because many companies are not taking the necessary security measures to prevent them, according to the FBI. 

 More than 40 e-commerce sites in 20 states have been identified as victims and notified of an ongoing investigation that points to several organized hacker groups from Eastern Europe, the FBI said in a statement released on Thursday. 

 The hackers, from Russia and the Ukraine, have penetrated U.S. e-commerce computer systems by exploiting vulnerabilities in unpatched Microsoft Corp. Windows NT operating systems, the statement said. Microsoft discovered the problem as early as 1998 and developed and publicized patches to fix the vulnerabilities, the statement said. 

 Once the hackers gain access to a company's computer system, they download credit card information, customer databases and proprietary information, the statement said. It said the hackers attempt to extort money from the targeted companies or try to convince them to hire the group to provide Internet security services. 

 *i2 Technologies to Pay $114 Million for RightWorks 

 SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Software maker i2 Technologies Inc. on Thursday said it struck an all-stock deal worth $114 million to buy closely held RightWorks Corp., in a move that ends its rocky partnership with Ariba Inc. 

 I2 is the No. 1 seller of so-called "e-procurement" software that enables companies manage and automate purchasing and inventory. The acquisition will round out i2's e-business product suite and position it against its former partner since RightWorks sells software that helps companies set up business-to-business online exchanges and buy finished goods and raw materials over the Internet - Ariba's forte. 

 "It means that we truly will be able to compete on our own," Jennifer Tejada, i2's vice president of marketing, said.

 BRAND-NAME PRODUCTS & CONSUMER TRENDS 

 *Canal Plus Sees Falling New Subscribers 

 PARIS (Reuters) - New subscribers at French pay-TV station Canal Plus are tailing off and the company expects to see a bigger pre-exceptional net loss this year as a result, French daily Le Figaro said on Friday. 

 Citing figures given at a February board meeting, Le Figaro said Canal Plus - a unit of media giant Vivendi Universal - expects subscriber numbers to rise by just 30,000 this year to 4.65 million, compared with 2000 and 1999 when it added 43,000 and 110,000 new users respectively. 

 Coming amid higher operating costs, the levelling off in subscriber fees is expected to jack up the group's pre-exceptional net attributable loss to 412 million euros this year from 391 million euros in 2000, the newspaper said. 

 Canal Plus was not immediately available for comment, although new subscriber numbers are widely expected to tail off in the coming years as its client base reaches saturation. 

 *Wrigley Launches Antacid Gum, Exploring New Growth Areas 

 CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. has begun rolling out a new antacid gum, the first product launch by its new healthcare unit, as the world's largest chewing gum company looks for new ways to spur growth. 

 The company is also looking at the candy business for possible expansion and had considered buying Nabisco's gum and mint business when it was for sale last year, William Wrigley Jr., president and chief executive officer, said during the company's annual meeting Wednesday. 

 "We're evaluating different options there," Wrigley said of the candy business, adding that the company has placed advertisements seeking researchers with a candy background. 

 Facing a U.S. gum market that is relatively flat, as well as increasing competition, Wrigley is counting on new products to help drive growth. The company is also considering raising prices in the United States, officials said.

 Yahoo Issues Earnings Warning --- Internet Giant Opens Search for New CEO --- Surprised Investors Send Shares Plunging 21%

 Yahoo! Inc. shares plunged 21% after the U.S. Internet giant warned that its first-quarter results will fall significantly below analysts' expectations and said Chief Executive Timothy Koogle plans to step down.   

 Yahoo said after the close of trading Wednesday that, excluding goodwill amortization and other items, it would post about break-even first-quarter results. The Internet portal concern was expected to earn five cents a share by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Yahoo also said its first-quarter revenue will be about $170 million to $180 million, well below the $232.6 million in revenue analysts expected, according to First Call.   

 The bigger surprise was Yahoo's announcement that its directors have launched an external search for a new CEO. Mr. Koogle said in a conference call that he would remain as chairman. Mr. Koogle joined the Santa Clara, California, company in August 1995 as employee No. 7, and has been closely identified with Yahoo's leading role as a Web portal, an Internet location that serves as a jumping-off site to other Web addresses.   

 The search "is an extension of a drive we've had under way to add senior talent and increase our bench strength," Mr. Koogle said.   

 In midmorning trading Thursday, Yahoo's shares were down $4.38 at $16.56 each on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Trading in Yahoo had been halted early Wednesday at $20.94, down $1.44, pending the release of company news.   

 Mr. Koogle said in a CNBC television interview that the company had planned to put out a news release Wednesday afternoon detailing a conference call for Thursday. "Nasdaq's unilateral decision to halt trading, based on speculation in an analyst report," forced the company to change its plans, he said.   

 Yahoo attributed the profit warning to a "weakening macroeconomic climate and the resulting shortfall in marketing spending by customers due to the economic uncertainty." The announcement is further acknowledgment that the online-advertising market has deteriorated. In January, the company cut its revenue and earnings guidance for 2001, citing an ad slowdown.   

 "You should think of 2001 as a transition year for Yahoo," Chief Financial Officer Sue Decker said in a conference call.   

 The move to find a successor to Mr. Koogle as CEO apparently gained momentum last week. At an emergency board meeting, Yahoo directors reached "a difficult decision" to look for an outside leader whose fresh thinking could revive the company's stalled share price, said one person familiar with Yahoo's actions.   

 Mr. Koogle "definitely was the one who initiated this" hunt, the person said. According to this individual, the Yahoo CEO gave this rationale: "We are now a significant company with $1.2 billion in revenue. We think we can be $5 billion (in) revenue or more. But we don't have the skills resident in house to get from here to there."   

 One potential conundrum for Yahoo: The search may cast a shadow over Jeffrey Mallett, the company's 36-year-old president and chief operating officer. The executive, well regarded in the industry, has run the company's day-to-day operations for several years. While Yahoo rarely has reached outside its ranks -- with the exception of Ms. Decker, the CFO -- it has several other external executive searches under way, including one for a new head of sales. Mr. Mallett didn't return phone calls seeking comment.   

 In an interview, Mr. Koogle acknowledged Mr. Mallett isn't a candidate for the CEO post. "We are focusing the search to bring in fresh new talent from the outside," he said, noting Mr. Mallett is chief operating officer. Mr. Koogle said the CEO recruit would be someone with a strong intellect and the expertise to run a large, growing global business. Spencer Stuart & Associates leads the search, Yahoo said.   

 Among candidates Yahoo may pursue is AOL Time Warner Inc.'s co-chief operating officer, Robert W. Pittman. An AOL spokeswoman said, "Bob couldn't be happier at AOL Time Warner."   

 Another possible contender is Gary Dai-chendt, former executive vice president of world-wide operations for Cisco Systems Inc. He was the highest-ranking executive under Cisco CEO John Chambers until he resigned in December. He didn't return a phone message left at his California home.

 Our Editorial 

 The profit warning signalled by NIIT, due largely to pessimism about its business in the USA, is fresh warning about how bad things could be in the American economy. The precipitous decline of stock prices, particularly on the NASDAQ, has already had a significant impact on India. ICE stocks on Indian exchanges are crashing, a trend that has contributed to the current problems at the Bombay Stock Exchange. Those on medium-term (H1B) visas are being retrenched in large numbers, and those on the threshold of departure for the US are being asked not to come. After a glorious three years, India's star sector is beginning to look somewhat shaky at the knees. 

 Until now, there has been a high level of confidence across the globe about Mr Greenspan's ability to navigate a "soft landing" for the US economy and prevent a full-blown recession. Two interest rate cuts in quick succession reinforced that confidence, and markets are hopeful of a further cut when the Federal Reserve Board meets later this month. However, the recent behaviour of some key indicators gives rise to suspicions about the adequacy of the interest rate cuts. If these suspicions are well-founded, a recession could precipitate despite Mr Greenspan's reputation and actions. 

 The major source of discomfort flows from what appears to be a sharp reduction in investment spending across the board. As in the case of India's own growth spurt during the mid-nineties, money spent by US companies on capacity expansion and technology upgradation played an important part in the eight-year economic boom. Investment in information technology, particularly, was seen as essential to survival in an intensively competitive marketplace. The Indian IT sector was, of course, a great beneficiary. As the slowdown unfolds, those same companies are taking a hard look at the capacities they created during the boom years. 

 What do they see? Like Indian companies in the late 1990s, they see unmistakable signs of excess capacity and underutilised assets. Not just in production capacity, but also in the hardware and software that they had binged on. The natural response to this is to try and get the best out of existing assets before thinking about acquiring new ones. What is in store, therefore, is a phase of consolidation, rationalisation, cost-cutting and other defensive measures. This might do these companies good in the long run. 

 But from the macro-economic point of view, it weakens prospects for new spending on equipment, not to mention hardware and software. In short, interest rates may be coming down, but US companies may not bite, because they have other plans.The effects of a full-scale recession in the US will not just be confined to the Indian IT sector. The US is the largest single market for India's manufactured exports, most of which will be expected to generate large numbers of low-skilled jobs in the coming years. In that sense, the recession will be a setback to India's efforts to transit from the unhappy situation of jobless growth to one of employment-intensive growth. It underscores the importance of quickly developing our most important buffer against global economic turbulence - the domestic market.

 Yahoo Issues  Profit Warning , Begins Search for New CEO --- First-Quarter Revenue Is Projected to Fall About $60 Million Short --- Slumping U.S. Economy Forces Changes

 Yahoo! Inc., acknowledging the need for major changes in the face of a slumping U.S. economy, warned that it expects first-quarter results to fall drastically below analysts' expectations and said it has begun a search for a new chief executive to succeed current CEO Timothy Koogle.   

 Yahoo said that first-quarter earnings, on the basis of pro forma earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be about break-even. That's below the five cents (5.4 European cents) a share in earnings that analysts had expected, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Yahoo also said its first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. That's a huge shortfall from the $232.6 million in revenue that analysts expected, according to First Call/Thomson Financial said.   

 Yahoo's shares, in which trading had been halted most of the day by the Nasdaq Stock Market, last traded at $20.94, down 6.4%.   

 In a statement, the company attributed the earnings warning to a "weakening macroeconomic climate and the resulting shortfall in marketing spending by customers due to the economic uncertainty." But the announcement is also further acknowledgment that the online-advertising market has deteriorated even more drastically than the Internet bellwether expected. In January, the company had lowered its revenue and earnings guidance for 2001, citing the slowdown in the online-ad market.   

 "You should think of 2001 as a transition year for Yahoo," said Chief Financial Officer Sue Decker in a conference call.   

 The bigger surprise was Yahoo's announcement that its Yahoo directors have launched an external search for a new CEO. Mr. Koogle, who also holds the post of chairman and has been with the company since before its initial public offering of shares, has been highly regarded in the industry until recently and has been closely identified with Yahoo's leading role on the Web. Mr. Koogle said in a conference call that he would remain chairman of the company once the newcomer arrived.   

 The search "is an extension of a drive we've had under way to add senior talent and increase our bench strength," said Mr. Koogle in the conference call.   

 The move to replace Mr. Koogle apparently gained momentum last week. At an emergency board meeting, Yahoo directors reached "a difficult decision" to start looking for an outside leader whose fresh thinking could revive the company's stalled share price, said one person familiar with Yahoo's actions.   

 Mr. Koogle "definitely was the one who initiated this" hunt, the person said. According to this individual, the Yahoo CEO gave this rationale: "We are now a significant company with $1.2 billion in revenue. We think we can be $5 billion (in) revenue or more. But we don't have the skills resident in house to get from here to there."   

 Yahoo's ideal candidate, said the person familiar with its move, would be a proven leader who easily adapts to a strong corporate culture and has innovation expertise. "They want someone who has successfully run a business of scale," this person suggested. Among the candidates Yahoo may pursue are AOL Time Warner Inc.'s co-chief operating officer Robert W. Pittman.   

 An AOL Time Warner spokeswoman said, "Bob couldn't be happier at AOL Time Warner."   

 Another possible contender for the top Yahoo spot is Gary Daichendt, former executive vice president of world-wide operations for Cisco Systems Inc. Mr. Daichendt was the highest-ranking executive under CEO John Chambers until he resigned the San Jose, California, network-hardware company in December.   

 Mr. Daichendt didn't return a call seeking comment Wednesday.   

 One potential conundrum for Yahoo: The search may prompt the departure of Jeffrey Mallett, its 36-year-old president and chief operating officer. The executive has run the company day-to-day for several years.

 US remarks reverse early losses.

 STOCK-FRIENDLY remarks from a closely watched US strategist helped stem a European tech exodus. Skittish markets struggled to find traction amid talk of trouble at mobile phone giant Nokia. 

 Goldman Sachs' chief investment strategist advised clients to use their cash to buy stocks, reversing a call she made in March 2000 - the now notorious month when markets started a stomach-churning slide from record highs. 

 The pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300 was up just 0.05 per cent, reversing morning losses, while the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 managed to add 0.04 per cent. 

 Europe spent much of the day grappling with its own profit warning rumours surrounding Nokia, which ended the session down 2.8 per cent. 

 It had lost as much as six per cent on the resurfacing profit warning rumours - on which the company declined to comment - and a downgrade by Lehman Brothers. 

 Lehman cut its handset margin forecast, its price target and its rating on Nokia, based on bearish comment from rivals Samsung and Texas Instruments about Nokia cutting its prices aggressively. 

 The brokerage firm also said that inventories were higher than it had previously supposed. 

 Stuart O'Gorman, director of technology investment at Henderson Global Investors said: "If people believe [Nokia's current sales growth] numbers they are mad because demand is going to be a lot lower than that." 

 French bank BNP Paribas topped Europe's list of blue-chip gainers, climbing 4.9 per cent after it reported a 26 per cent rise in 2000 profit. 

 FRANKFURT: Europe's biggest software maker SAP rose over three per cent, the comments from Abby Joseph Cohen fired tentative hopes of a tech revival. By mid-afternoon, the DAX index was up 0.1 per cent at 6,290.61, with a 2.7 gain in SAP tacking 10 points onto the blue-chip index. 

 AMSTERDAM: Dutch shares clawed back some losses amid a late technology surge but feeble performances in key index heavyweights meant the AEX ended the day a whisker lower. 

 The blue-chip index closed at 598.34, down 2.61. 

 VIENNA: Shares in Telekom Austria firmed in high volume on strong demand which traders said was fuelled by renewed speculation that it could become a takeover target. The ATX blue-chip index was up 1.3 per cent at 1,214. Telekom Austria, which has languished well below its 9 issue price since last autumn's disappointing IPO, was the day's most active stock. 

 STOCKHOLM: Shares closed down, but off earlier lows, after a sell-off in telecoms equipment majors Nokia and Ericsson abated. The benchmark Stoxx Nordic index dropped 1.2 per cent as the region's markets closed, underperforming the FTSE Eurotop 300 index by 1.3 percent, recovering earlier losses that saw the Nordic index dip as much as three per cent.

 Dollar Finishes Lower Against Euro and Yen

 Dow Jones Newswires 

 NEW YORK -- The dollar lost ground against the euro and yen Thursday after unexpected comments from a Japanese official -- quickly followed by damage control -- had initially sent the yen reeling. 

 The dollar saw a high in Asia at 120.38 yen but then lost momentum and fell back in New York trading. The euro remained pretty much on the sidelines, although the euro/yen cross moved in a range of more than 1% as the yen's fortunes fluctuated. 

 In Tokyo trading, the dollar jumped to its new 15-month high against the yen after Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's remarks in parliament that the nation's financial system is "very close to collapsing" and that Japan needs "fundamental fiscal restructuring aimed at rebuilding our finances in the 21st century." 

 The currency managed to regain some stability, however, after comments from Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami that a strong yen is good for Japan causing long dollar/yen position holders to bail out. Mr. Hayami's comments that a strong yen wasn't against the nation's interest, as well as his assertion that his remarks Wednesday on intervention were misinterpreted, served to boost the yen through European trading. 

 But the trend is still in place for the dollar to gain against the yen. Traders expect the dollar to establish itself above 120 yen in the near term but are nervous of getting caught by the market's volatility. 

 "I'm looking to buy dollar/yen at good levels," said Scott Shultz, yen trader at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. 

 "There's a lot of selling and profit-taking [on long dollar positions] above 120," said Mr. Shultz, "But I think eventually we will see a breakthrough -- sooner or later we'll go through," he predicted. 

 Trading is "a little jittery," said Timothy O'Sullivan, trading manager at GAIN Capital in Warren, N.J, because "the dollar has broken through 120 yen a couple times and people are nervous it's not following through." Much of the volatility in dollar/yen is from "short-termers getting out of positions," he said. 

 The euro has found a range between 92.50 cents and 93.50 cents, with traders buying on the dips, Mr. O'Sullivan said. 

 The dollar was undermined in New York as the closely-watched Nasdaq stock index slipped following a profit warning from Yahoo! Inc. and the resignation of its chief executive officer late Wednesday. Weekly U.S. jobless claims were lower than expected but the data had little effect on currency pairs. 

 Sterling was higher, though dealers attributed the pound's strength to buying from a major bank and said the currency had little reaction to either Wednesday's United Kingdom budget or the Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates on hold at 5.75%. 

 Chile's peso slipped to a new record low Thursday, ending the session at 589.80 pesos to the dollar compared with Wednesday's 586.90-peso close. Strong dollar demand from both foreign banks and corporate players put pressure on the local currency, traders said. 

 The Australian dollar hit a new all-time low in Asian trading at 50.67 U.S. cents before recovering slightly to trade at 51.08 U.S. cents at the end of the day in New York. Sentiment toward the currency has been negative since Wednesday when the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that it was cutting the overnight cash rate by one-quarter percentage point to 5.50%. 

 In late trading Thursday, the euro was at 93.14 U.S. cents, down from 93.20 U.S. cents in London but up from 92.92 U.S. cents in New York late Wednesday. The dollar was at 119.65 yen, up from 119.50 yen in London but down from 119.92 yen late Wednesday in New York. The dollar fetched 1.6536 Swiss francs, down from 1.6566 francs Wednesday, while sterling was at $1.4685, up from $1.4602 late Wednesday.

It was the news Wall Street waited for all day. After the closing bell,  Yahoo! announced it's looking for a new chief executive officer. The most popular Web search service also warned that first-quarter profits will miss the mark because of a weak advertising market. Now chairman and CEO Tim Koogle will stay on as chairman once a new CEO is found.  Yahoo! threw the markets a curve ball after shares were halted just seven minutes after the opening bell pending that news. But in after-hours trading,  Yahoo! stock down nearly $2.   

Well, you can call it a hat-trick on Wall Street. Stocks rallied for a third straight day, thanks in part to bullish comments from  Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen. She thinks the market has fallen enough and advised her clients to buy stocks.

 US CLOUDS HAVE SILVER LINING FOR THE FOOTSIE BY MICHAEL CLARKShare prices on the London stock market were marked higher for choice at the outset of trading today. But dealers were quick to dispel the theory that this was an appreciation of Chancellor Gordon Brown's efforts yesterday. They say it was more a reflection on the sad state of the US economy.The latest report from the Federal Reserve says the American economy is now static. This will increase pressure on the Fed to make further cuts in interest rates, which will be good news for world stock markets. The Dow got the message overnight in New York, climbing almost 140 points as investors caught a whiff of cheaper money. In the City, share prices traded in narrow limits as punters gave further thought to the Chancellor's package. 

  The FTSE 100 index rose 7.8 points to 6009.6.GKN was by far and away the biggest faller among the top 100 companies, losing 75p, or 9%, to 735p after issuing what was tantamount to a veiled profits warning. Brokers are not happy about the group's heavy exposure to a knackered American economy and say the shares probably have further to fall.Reuters was another big faller, dropping 34p to 1036p after its US-quoted offshoot Tibco Software issued a profits warning overnight. Tech stocks generally struggled to make headway in the wake of the profits warning from internet service provider Yahoo! and a clutch of other companies. Vodafone sported a rise of 51/2p to 2073/4p, spurred on by chief executive Chris Gent's presentation in the City yesterday. US securities house Goldman Sachs has retained the shares on its recommended list, with a target price of 420p.British Regional Airways firmed 1/2p to 118p on confirmation of the bid from rival British Airways, up 33/4p at 3653/4p, as highlighted in Business Day yesterday. The terms value British Regional at 120p, or #78 million. Business Day also got its timing right with the bid for Mid Kent Holdings, 81/2p better at 595p. But it is the management that has decided to make an offer for the shares rather than the water supplier's 24% shareholder French utilities giant Vivendi. The terms value Mid Kent at 605p, or #106 million.The speculators were continuing to nibble away at Aggregate Industries as the price firmed 1p to 75p on turnover of more than two million shares. Broker Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein was yesterday telling clients not to expect a bid for the company. But others in the City are not so sure. A big rights issue this week from Irish building products group CRH has convinced the boys in dark glasses that a bid is being lined up. CRH was four cents higher at e18.AIM-listed publisher Profile Media, which used to trade under the name of London & Edinburgh Publishing, firmed 11/2p to 403/4p, buoyed by upbeat comments about strong trading in the second half. Prospects were described by chairman John Webber as "extremely positive" with advanced orders for the second half already totalling #8.5 million and a big acquisition planned. In the first six months, the group reported a pre-tax loss of #440,000 but brokers are forecasting a profit of #5.5 million for the current year which compares with an adjusted #2.2 million last time.Shareholders of BSS Group suffered a double whammy, the price falling 621/2p to 2671/2p on news that second-half results are now expected to come in below forecasts and that bid talks have been abandoned.

 Yahoo! Expects Big 1st-Quarter Shortfall --- Internet Bellwether Begins CEO Search as Koogle Will Remain Chairman

 Yahoo! Inc. warned that its first-quarter results will fall significantly below analysts' expectations and said it has begun a search for a new chief executive officer to succeed Timothy Koogle, who will remain chairman.   

 Yahoo said that, excluding goodwill amortization and other items, it would post about break-even first-quarter results. The Internet portal concern was expected to earn five cents a share by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Yahoo also said its first-quarter revenue will be in the range of $170 million to $180 million, a huge shortfall from the $232.6 million in revenue analysts expected, according to First Call.   

 The bigger surprise was Yahoo's announcement that its directors have launched an external search for a new CEO. Mr. Koogle, who has been with the Santa Clara, Calif., company since August 1995 as employee No. 7, has been closely identified with Yahoo's leading role on a Web portal, an Internet location that serves as a jumping-off site to other Web addresses. Mr. Koogle said in a conference call that he would remain chairman of the company once the newcomer arrived.   

 The search "is an extension of a drive we've had under way to add senior talent and increase our bench strength," Mr. Koogle said.   

 Trading in Yahoo was halted on the Nasdaq Stock Market at 9:37 a.m. at $20.94, down $1.44, and never resumed there. In after-hours trading, Yahoo fell to $18.69. Mr. Koogle said in a CNBC interview that the company had planned to put out a news release yesterday afternoon detailing a conference call for this morning. "Nasdaq's unilateral decision to halt trading based on speculation in an analyst report," he said, forced the company to change its plans.   

 Yahoo attributed the profit warning to a "weakening macroeconomic climate and the resulting shortfall in marketing spending by customers due to the economic uncertainty." The announcement is further acknowledgment that the online-advertising market has deteriorated. In January, the company cut its revenue and earnings guidance for 2001, citing an ad slowdown.   

 "You should think of 2001 as a transition year for Yahoo," Chief Financial Officer Sue Decker said in a conference call.   

 The move to find a successor to Mr. Koogle as CEO apparently gained momentum last week. At an emergency board meeting, Yahoo directors reached "a difficult decision" to look for an outside leader whose fresh thinking could revive the company's stalled share price, said one person familiar with Yahoo's actions.   

 Mr. Koogle "definitely was the one who initiated this" hunt, the person said. According to this individual, the Yahoo CEO gave this rationale: "We are now a significant company with $1.2 billion in revenue. We think we can be $5 billion [in] revenue or more. But we don't have the skills resident in house to get from here to there."   

 One potential conundrum for Yahoo: The search may cast a shadow over Jeffrey Mallett, the company's 36-year-old president and chief operating officer. The executive, well regarded in the industry, has run the company's day-to-day operations for several years. While Yahoo rarely has reached outside its ranks -- with the exception of Ms. Decker, the CFO -- it has several other external executive searches under way, including one for a new head of sales. Mr. Mallett didn't return phone calls seeking comment.   

 In an interview, Mr. Koogle acknowledged Mr. Mallett isn't a candidate for the CEO post. "We are focusing the search to bring in fresh new talent from the outside," he said, noting Mr. Mallett is chief operating officer. Mr. Koogle said the CEO recruit would be someone with a strong intellect and the expertise to run a large, growing global business. Spencer Stuart & Associates leads the search, Yahoo said.   

 Among candidates Yahoo may pursue is AOL Time Warner Inc.'s co-chief operating officer, Robert W. Pittman. An AOL spokeswoman said, "Bob couldn't be happier at AOL Time Warner."   

 Another possible contender is Gary Dai-chendt, former executive vice president of world-wide operations for Cisco Systems Inc. He was the highest-ranking executive under Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers until he resigned in December. He didn't return a phone call to his Los Altos Hills, Calif., home.   

 The company said it will begin a stock-buyback program, acquiring as much as $500 million of its shares outstanding in the open market over two years. Yahoo has 565.3 million shares outstanding.

 Japan's Kuroda says would be quite happy if euro strengthened vs yen 

 Washington, March 8 (BridgeNews) - The Japanese Finance Ministry would be quite happy if the euro strengthened against the yen and the dollar, Japanese Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs Haruhiko Kuroda said. While there has been no change in Japanese exchange rate policy, the euro is undervalued against the yen, Kuroda said in an exclusive interview with BridgeNews. He also said that exchange rates should move "smoothly" in line with economic fundamentals. ( Story .23404 )

NEW YORK -- Stocks moved higher Monday as investors took advantage of cheaper prices and momentarily put aside their fears about the slowing economy.

Wall Street managed the advance despite warnings from more companies that future profits will be weak. Analysts are split over whether that means the market is poised to rally or whether investors are just temporarily bargain hunting.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.99 to 10,562.30. Volume was the lightest so far this year as many traders stayed home due to the winter storm in the Northeast.

Broader market indicators also posted gains. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 25.29 to 2,142.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.23 to 1,241.41.

Much of the tech advance came from the semiconductor sector, where Altera gained $1.25 to $27.13 and Vitesse Semiconductor rose $1.25 to $39.06. Semiconductors traded higher although several companies including Vitesse curtailed their earnings expectations. The sector also overcame downgrades of 15 stocks including Altera by Prudential Securities, which believes the shares will bottom out in the second or third quarter.

Software maker Oracle, which issued a profit warning on Thursday and fell 21 percent on Friday, made a slight advance, up 13 cents at $17.

As companies are able to withstand lowered expectations, the chances of a longer market rally increase, said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Co.

``We have finally come to the point where we have a price-news divergence, meaning stocks don't go down on bad news,'' Hogan said. ``That is typical of a (market) bottom.''

Not all stocks, however, were able to shake off negative announcements. Coca-Cola, the Dow's biggest loser on Monday, tumbled $2.35 to $50.20 after the company disclosed a management reorganization plan that included the elimination of the president's post.

 Euro chip stocks sizzle despite US, Epcos warnings.

 FRANKFURT, March 6 (Reuters) - Shares in European chipmakers surged on Tuesday, after an overnight Wall Street rally by their peers - despite six U.S. profit warnings in one session - revived hope the battered sector had found a bottom. 

 An early sales and profit warning from Germany's Epcos , a major supplier of mobile phone components, also fell on deaf ears, with analysts and investors saying it merely confirmed bad news already priced in by the market. 

 "A lot of people expected those profit warnings, they knew that first quarter trading was poor, and bad news was no longer bad news," said Russ Mould, semiconductor analyst at UBS Warburg in London. 

 "Whether the market is aware of just how bad the second quarter will be is another matter entirely," he added. 

 British chip designer ARM was one of the top performing European chip stocks, up 8.5 percent, while shares in German semiconducor machinery maker Aixtron gained 6.9 percent. 

 Shares in Epcos surged 4.5 percent to 71.35 euros, despite it cutting its sales growth forecast for this year to 20 from 25 percent and saying orders from handset manufacturers had been weak in the last eight weeks. 

 "It's not much of a surprise that the whole handset segment is looking pretty weak," WestLB Panmure analyst Karsten Iltgen said. "The official statement was a kind of profit warning but it was expected by the market and priced in." 

 The pan-European DJ Stoxx technology index was up 4.3 percent overall after U.S. peers rose overnight despite profit warnings from six semiconductor firms - Cypress , LSI , Vitesse , Fairchild , Xilinx and Varian 

 SHORT-TERM RALLY 

 Europe's biggest chipmaker STMicroelectronics also rose sharply, adding 5.8 percent, while Philips , climbed 3.7 percent and German chip maker Infineon jumped 5.2 percent. 

 Infineon's parent Siemens , a major force in mobile telephony equipment and handsets, rose four percent. Both still trade at less than half their 52-week highs. 

 Epcos reiterated an earlier forecast that it expects no recovery in the mobile phone market until the summer and analysts said the chip market would remain depressed virtually until the end of this year. 

 "It's going to stay pretty tight for the next six months," said Titus Menzies, hardware analyst at BNP-Paribas. 

 "I think any turnaround should come by the start of the fourth quarter at the earliest, maybe the first quarter of next year." 

 He said he favoured STM over Infineon because the French company made flash memory chips used in personal digital assistants (PDAs), a booming area, while Infineon supplied DRAM chips, used in personal computers, where sales are slowing. 

 Dutch ASML , up 5.85 percent, was also a key buy, Menzies added. The lithography firm will be a prime mover in chip production as they get smaller. 

 The chip enthusiasm spread to mobile handset makers. Nokia , the world's number one producer, surged 4.7 percent to 28.88 euros, still well shy of its June 2000 high of 65 euros. Ericsson also jumped as well while Alcatel added 10 percent. 

 But analysts warned the market should expect more bad news for the sector in the second and third quarters. 

 "We are sceptical that this is going to be a base for the stocks, at least in the near term, and we expect further negative industry news in the next few months," said Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Griffin. 

 "Although short-term one could argue that the stocks have fallen too far and there might be a rebound, I'm not sure this is the last time we'll see these levels," he said.

 NEW YORK - Stocks moved higher Monday in light trading as investors took advantage of cheaper prices and momentarily put aside their fears about the slowing economy. 

 Wall Street managed the advance despite warnings from more companies that future profits will be weak. Analysts are split over whether the day's rise means the market is poised to rally or whether investors are just temporarily bargain hunting. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 95.99 to 10,562.30. Volume was the lightest so far this year as many traders stayed home due to the winter storm in the Northeast. 

 Broader market indicators also posted gains. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 25.29 to 2,142.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.23 to 1,241.41. 

 Much of the tech advance came from the semiconductor sector, where Altera gained $1.25 to $27.13 and Vitesse Semiconductor rose $1.25 to $39.06. 

 Semiconductors traded higher although several companies including Vitesse curtailed their earnings expectations. The sector also overcame downgrades of 15 stocks including Altera by Prudential Securities, which believes the shares will bottom out in the second or third quarter. 

 Some companies outside the semiconductor sector were able to overcome a poor earnings outlook. Software maker Oracle, which issued a profitwarning on Thursday and fell 21 percent on Friday, made a slight advance, up 13 cents at $17. 

 As companies are able to withstand lowered expectations, the chances of a longer-lasting market rally increase, said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst for Jefferies & Co. 

 "We have finally come to the point where we have a price-news divergence, meaning stocks don't go down on bad news," Hogan said. "That is typical of a (market) bottom." 

 Not all stocks were able to shake off negative announcements. Coca-Cola, the Dow's biggest loser on Monday, tumbled $2.35 to $50.20 after the company disclosed a management reorganization plan that included the elimination of the president's post. 

 Still, a bit of optimism about the economy could be seen in other blue-chip dealings. Investors bid down the safer stocks like drug issues, which had rallied in recent months while riskier tech sectors fell out of favor. Merck slipped 62 cents to $79.53. 

 Meanwhile, the market sent more economically sensitive blue chips higher. Consumer cyclical stocks, called by that name because they suffer when the economy slows down, led the Dow's move up. Caterpillar climbed $1.65 to $44.33, and General Motors gained $1.08 to $55.38. 

 However, some analysts don't expect prices to keep going higher. They say investors are cautious and call market advances "trading rallies" spurred only by cheaper prices. The consensus on Wall Street is that selloffs will continue to be the dominant trading pattern as the market faces more earnings and economic disappointments. 

 "It's a rally in the Dow and in (consumer) cyclicals. That's about it though," said Gary Kaltbaum, a technical analyst for First Union Securities. "I don't count it as much as anything. Volume is light because of the snowstorm."

 Oracle's  Profit Warning  Sends Its Stock Down 21% on Nasdaq --- Analysts Pummel the Bellwether, Other Tech Shares, With Downgrades

 NEW YORK -- A profit warning from Oracle Corp. caused its stock to plunge 21%, or $4.50 (4.82 euros), to close at $16.88 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday. At one stage during the session, share prices sank to a 52-week low of $15.75 before edging up again.   

 Wall Street analysts reacted with a mercilessness that isn't often displayed when one of the market's bellwethers stumbles. At least 10 analysts hit the stock with downgrades, and then plastered a host of other technology names with downgrades and estimate cuts.   

 Shares of Microsoft Corp. fell 4.5%, or $2.67, to $56.69 on Nasdaq, while Siebel Systems plunged 19%, or $8.52, to close at $36.11, also on Nasdaq, following critical comments from Goldman Sachs.   

 Lehman Brothers raised questions about the outlook for software names such as BEA Systems, which dived 16%, or $6.23, to $32.69; Mercury Interactive, which sank almost 18%, or $10.50, to $48.50; and Veritas Software, which fell 10%, or $7.06, to $63.63, all on Nasdaq.   

 Oracle said a sputtering economy slowed sales of two important product lines, cutting fiscal third-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations.   

 The Redwood Shores, California, company is the latest big high-tech concern to predict an earnings shortfall. Oracle's announcement fuels additional worries by reducing the prospect that companies with new Internet-oriented products might be immune to a slowdown. Earlier, Oracle executives had hoped their next-generation products, which are designed for use on the Web to make businesses more efficient, might still be in strong demand even during slow times.   

 Oracle's third quarter ended Feb. 28, and the company is to release complete financial results for the period March 15. In Thursday's announcement, made after 4 p.m., the software maker put earnings at about 10 cents a share, two cents below the low end of Wall Street's expectations.   

 The reasons for the shortfall were at least as troubling to analysts as its magnitude. Oracle's database software, a mainstay product line used as the foundation for many other business programs, had flat to negative growth over the year-earlier period. While database sales have been slowing at Oracle for many quarters, analysts were surprised by the abruptness of the latest downturn.   

 Oracle also said its line of application software probably grew 50% in the quarter, well below earlier predictions that the business might grow by 75% to 100%. These products are used mainly by large companies to manage their books, but Oracle is banking on a broadened line of Web-based applications to maintain the rapid growth the company has seen in recent years.   

 In fact, a few weeks ago in New Orleans, the company was host to thousands of customers for a trade show that highlighted its application business. At the show, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison gave a bullish assessment of the application business, saying it was "really starting to take off."   

 Oracle executives said they were blindsided by the sudden negative shift in the mood of customers over the past several days. On Feb. 28, the final day of the quarter, "we just had a significant number of deals that were deferred," said Jeffrey Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, in a conference call.   

 In many cases, Mr. Ellison added, the deals for software purchases had been approved at a vice-president level by Oracle's corporate customers. However, CEOs and chief financial officers of those companies at the last minute decided to delay making commitments.   

 Oracle had already been hurt by a falloff in orders from dot-com start-ups, many of which used Oracle databases to build Web services. The company had been counting on conventional companies taking up the slack, using Oracle software to develop new electronic-business applications and improve their efficiency.   

 Still, the CEOs held off signing the purchase orders. "That was true, even where it was acknowledged that this deal would save the company money," Mr. Ellison said. "We have a lot of nervous senior executives looking at this economy and being very cautious."   

 Bob Austrian, a Banc of America Securities analyst who had recently cut his numbers for Oracle, said the announcement showed "the economic downturn has become severe enough that it has become a shock. And shocks always impair purchasing decisions."

 Budget blues and the IT sector.

 It's a pitiable situation. The finance minister announces a budget that is tailor made for the market and contains generous dollops of incentives for the information technology sector. The first day the market swings upward, on the second day it oscillates but still ends higher. But on the third day the technology stocks hit 52-week lows. What is more, analysts are not sure that tech stocks will appreciate on a sustained basis till April at least. Till then poor Yashwant Sinha, tech stock holders and tech companies can continue to live on tenterhooks. 

 Everybody knows why tech stocks nosedived. The perception is that US economy is slowing down and when this happens there will be a negative impact on profits of IT companies in the US. Late last week there was a profit warning about Oracle. When that happens these IT companies might cut their budgets and since Indian IT companies depend for work on these corporates their incomes and profits will also fall. That justifies the fall of technology stocks, so goes the thinking in market circles. 

 But there is a contra thinking too. The thinking is presently however a minority view and goes something like this: If the US economy is slowing down then there is no doubt that corporates in that country will cut back in house operations and in order to reduce costs will go for more outsourcing work. In the IT sector that will help Indian IT companies because they are anyway involved in executing outsourced work for US technology corporates. They will, in this scenario of US slowdown, get more contracts to execute. 

 But will this actually happen ? Analysts believe that concrete proof of this or otherwise will be available in April, because it is then that Indian IT companies will start announcing Q4 results. The financial year ends on March 31. 

 If the showing by Indian IT companies is excellent - that is most of them show 100 per cent growth in Q4 results - then tech stocks will start going up on a sustained basis. In the first three quarters most of these companies have put up a good showing. And if the results are not good, then tech stocks will have to look for other props to stand up. 

 Till, such time as Q4 results are in, there will be a 'tussle' in the marketplace between the two lines of thinking. Tech stocks can go up and down depending on which line of thinking would seem to prevail at that point of time. 

 This means that tech stocks will be subject to see saw movements over the next few weeks. And in this uncertain scenario, as is to be expected, wild rumours will have a field day and all sort of lies will be purveyed as unalloyed truth. In fact, the rumour mill has already started becoming active. On Friday night a rumour that one of the top Indian IT companies is on the verge of a split started doing the rounds very strongly.

 Mr. Ellison noted that the company's earnings are still expected to grow 20% over the year-earlier period, with operating-profit margins rising to 33% of sales from 31%. And Oracle hopes to keep improving its own efficiency, in part by more widely using its own software to run internal operations.   

 "We think we are better equipped to deal with this slowdown than any company in the world," Mr. Ellison said.

 Is Managed Care Ill Managed?

 ANTHONY CAPASSO remembers the day he got two new knees because it was his 60th birthday: Oct. 29, 1998.  

 J. Kevin Lynch, a New Haven orthopedic surgeon, performed the procedure, called a bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty. Dr. Lynch had a letter from Mr. Capasso's health maintenance organization, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, that approved the surgery and gave Mr. Capasso four days in the hospital and eight to 10 days of inpatient rehabilitation.  

 But Mr. Capasso, who is legally blind, did not get the rehabilitation. Instead, Dr. Lynch said, Mr. Capasso was sent home after the surgery.  

 Dr. Lynch remembered his reaction to the H.M.O.'s decision: ''I said, 'What the hell are you doing?' A more unlikely candidate for immediate discharge you could not find.'' Mr. Capasso appealed the decision , but lost.  

 Meanwhile, Mr. Capasso could barely walk and kept falling on the stairs of his North Haven home. His legs swelled. ''Finally, they sent a physical therapist here, to my house,'' Mr. Capasso said. ''But they kept getting worse.'' After a few sessions, the therapist sent Mr. Capasso back to Dr. Lynch, who removed fluid from Mr. Capasso's knees.  

 ''He still has some swelling,'' Dr. Lynch said of Mr. Capasso. ''He didn't achieve the level of independence he should have after the operation. With appropriate treatment, he would not have sustained such consequences.''  

 Dr. Lynch is one of five Connecticut doctors who have brought lawsuits against six of the state's H.M.O.'s. Another set of lawsuits, against the same six companies, has been filed by the Connecticut State Medical Society. It is a class-action suit on behalf of the society's 7,000 doctors.  

 Stories like Mr. Capasso's dramatize the doctors' complaints: inflexible protocol, arbitrary decisions, and lengthy, futile appeals. Not only did Anthem's actions permanently harm Mr. Capasso, Dr. Lynch claimed, but they also cost the H.M.O. more money than if the doctor had been allowed to make the decisions.  

 Anthem declined to comment on Mr. Capasso's case or the policies and issues behind it, citing legal reasons. While medical officers from other H.M.O.'s agreed to discuss their policies, none would talk about specific cases. The six companies involved in the suits are: Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Oxford Health Plans, Cigna HealthCare, ConnectiCare, Anthem and Physician Health Services  

 The lawsuits are trying to force the H.M.O.'s to change the way they operate. State medical societies have sued H.M.O.'s in Georgia, Missouri and New York, and in January Georgia's Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Medical Association of Georgia. But the Connecticut suits are unique in the sweeping changes they seek.  

 Doctors said nothing short of an overhaul can make the managed care system satisfactory. For Stephen R. Levinson, an ear, nose and throat doctor with practices in Fairfield and Trumbull, cases like that of Mr. Capasso's knees aren't the point. Rather, it's the daily frustration of working under what he called unreasonable rules.  

 ''Yes, there are spectacular incidents that hurt patients dramatically, but every minute of every day they are destroying us,'' Dr. Levinson said. ''It's not the atomic weapon that might blow up the city that's the problem. It's the fact that you have termites eating away at every building in the city at once.''  

 Dr. Levinson, who is one of the plaintiffs suing for damages, described an impenetrable bureaucracy of Orwellian proportions that drowns doctors in paperwork and wastes their time.  

 ''For example, we have a specialized X-ray machine for sinus radiographs, but three H.M.O.'s won't let us use it,'' he said referring to ConnectiCare, Cigna and Oxford. ''So we can't use it to check whether people have sinusitis; we have to send them to a radiologist to get a CAT scan. That means I have to spend 20 minutes on the phone getting the CAT scan approved, and the patient has to make two extra visits.''  

 Paul Bluestein, ConnectiCare's chief medical officer, said the company's policy against such X-rays was created six or seven years ago. While he would not discuss the reasoning behind it, he noted that a similar policy, which prohibited X-rays by primary care physicians, was recently repealed. ''Perhaps, in time, we will change other policies,'' he said. ''For the moment, we have taken a step toward reducing hassles where it seemed appropriate.''  

 Dr. Levinson said he once asked a group of Connecticut ear, nose and throat doctors how much time they spend dealing with H.M.O. procedures. They estimated it took 30 percent of their time.  

 Brian Van Linda, a gastroenterologist in Avon, said the four gastroenterologists in his practice employed two full-time staffers just to deal with the H.M.O.'s.  

 ''A colonoscopy is a fairly routine procedure, but every managed care company requires precertification for it,'' Dr. Van Linda said. ''So we have to call them for every colonoscopy -- and they've never once turned us down. It's a total waste of time and money.''  

 The frustration is not limited to Connecticut. In a national poll of more than 1,000 doctors conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 1999, 58 percent said they were concerned about being forced to spend too much time on administration and too little on their patients, and 47 percent said they were worried about not having enough autonomy in their medical decisions. The survey also asked doctors about their incomes -- H.M.O.'s often claim that doctors' complaints are really motivated by personal greed. In the survey, 26 percent of the doctors said they were concerned that they were not making enough money.  

 Adjusted for inflation, median doctors' salaries decreased from 1988 to 1998, from $120,000 to $116,100 in 1988 dollars, according to an American Medical Association survey. ''Physicians' offices are essentially small businesses, and they're having trouble staying in business,'' said Dr. D. Ted Lewers, the A.M.A.'s chairman.  

 Even as doctors are earning less, Americans are paying more for health care. Average employer-sponsored health insurance premiums have risen sharply since 1996, outpacing both inflation and increases in workers' earnings, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey last year. The biggest jump occurred between 1999 and 2000, when premiums rose 8.3 percent.  

 ''I'm a consumer as well as a provider of health care,'' Dr. Lynch, the orthopedic surgeon, said. ''My health insurance rates have gone up every year; meanwhile, my reimbursements from the H.M.O.'s are down about 80 percent in the last four years. Who's got that money? The insurance companies.''  

 Keith Stover, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, said increased costs were the problem.  

 ''Premiums are rising because costs are rising, particularly the cost of prescription drugs,'' Mr. Stover said. ''A lot of managed care companies are struggling under the increase in health care costs as well. The idea that managed care companies are reaching into doctors' pockets to pad the salary of some insurance executive is nonsense.''  

 H.M.O.'s said they are getting better every day. ''There is less requirement now for so-called bureaucratic hassles than in the history of managed care,'' said Dr. Bluestein of ConnectiCare.  

 He noted that ConnectiCare's list of procedures that require prior authorization from the company has gotten steadily shorter for the last 10 years, giving doctors more discretion. When the company finds a procedure that is always approved, it is taken off the list, he said.  

 And Victor Villagra, Cigna's national medical director, said that last year Cigna's list of procedures requiring authorization shrunk by 40 percent. ''We are constantly reviewing all of our practices to come up with ways of making patient care easier, simpler and faster while maintaining quality,'' he said.  

 Dr. Van Linda said he believed the system is still too rigid. He has his own horror stories. One of his patients, Margaret Shea Aleia, a 37-year-old nurse from Glastonbury, has Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that is sometimes fatal. After one surgery last year, Ms. Aleia's H.M.O., ConnectiCare, retroactively denied her two of the days she had spent in the hospital before the surgery.  

 As Ms. Aleia's disease worsened, Dr. Van Linda thought of a drug that had only recently been used on Crohn's patients, but he didn't know enough about it to prescribe it. Dr. Van Linda thought she should see a Crohn's expert in Boston who has written books on the disease.  

 ConnectiCare refused and suggested a surgeon instead, a referral Dr. Van Linda called ''inappropriate and bizarre'' because Ms. Aleia's problems were not surgical in nature.  

 Dr. Bluestein of ConnectiCare questioned Dr. Van Linda's characterization of the situation.  

 ''The view of 'expert' and the view of 'inappropriate' are subjective,'' he said. ''They are judgments, opinions. There's no ruler by which to measure a physician's expertise.'' He said the H.M.O. can usually find an appropriate doctor within its network, and if not, the company is always glad to send the patient elsewhere.  

 Indeed, six weeks after Ms. Aleia paid $312 out of her own pocket for a consultation with the Boston doctor, ConnectiCare did approve the referral.  

 But Ms. Aleia said she would not have been able to go through with the appeal if Dr. Van Linda hadn't helped her, and not everyone is lucky enough to have such a concerned doctor.  

 ''I was recovering from surgery and caring for a 2-year-old,'' she said. ''The unbelievably cumbersome appeals process was not something I could go through at that time.''  

 Dr. Van Linda added: ''The managed care system works as long as you don't get sick. But it doesn't work if you're ill, which is supposed to be the point of health insurance.'' He said that patients have to confront the greatest bureaucratic obstacles when they are least able to deal with them: when they are physically and emotionally weak.  

 Dr. Bluestein said doctors often don't give ConnectiCare enough information to make the decision.  

 ''We can be chasing around after the information for days or weeks,'' he said. ''In many cases, doctors don't facilitate our work to make sure we have the resources to make the decision.''  

 Karen Laugel, a pediatrician in Stratford who is suing some H.M.O.'s, agreed with Dr. Van Linda that the H.M.O.'s are too rigid. Their protocols for how long patients can stay in the hospital are composed by actuaries, she said. Also, they are based on the assumption that the patient is young and otherwise healthy.  

 Dr. Laugel complained that the companies' profit motive disregards medical necessities. For example, she remembered referring six children with Cigna insurance to different specialists. Cigna sent her a letter warning that she was referring too many patients and threatening to stop sending patients to her if she didn't keep her referrals down.  

 ''Two of them had neck lumps, and I'm not a surgeon,'' Dr. Laugel recalled. ''Two of them had hearing deficits; they absolutely needed an audiologist. And two of them had chronic ear infections, and you have to see an ear, nose and throat doctor for that. If I don't refer these patients to specialists, I'm not doing my job, but they're trying to punish me for it.''  

 Dr. Villagra of Cigna would not comment on the particular incident with Dr. Laugel, but he said Cigna is constantly working to improve its customers' access to specialists. Under a new policy, he said, patients with chronic conditions have unlimited access to their specialists for a year.  

 ''For example, a cancer patient receiving chemotherapy can see an oncologist for a whole year,'' he said. He added that the quality of care, not the cost, is always the company's basis for decision-making.  

 Dr. Lewers, the A.M.A.'s chairman, said managed care companies across the country have talked about making improvements, but they have done little.  

 ''Physicians feel like they have hit a brick wall,'' Dr. Lewers said. ''The insurance companies have not made significant changes.''

 Kansas City Value Line stock-index futures finished modestly higher; Isdex Internet stock-index futures closed lower. 

 Wheat futures rose partly on hopes that exports of U.S. wheat would increase as fear spread about foot-and-mouth disease in Britain. Denmark on Friday recommended that importers avoid buying British grains because of the risk of contamination from the disease. 

 Experts say foot-and-mouth disease affects cloven-hoofed animals and is not a danger to humans. The virus can be spread by anything it touches. 

 Meanwhile, corn's two-day rally began fading late in Thursday's session amid lingering questions over whether China's export tender on Monday succeeded. The slump carried over into Friday and was extended on a lack of supportive news. 

 Soybean futures were pressured partly by expectations that the government would raise its estimate for the January soy oil stocks number. Analysts expect the number to be revised to 2.467 billion pounds, above the 2.430 billion-pound number the government released earlier this week. 

 The Kansas City Value Line managed to close higher after a  short- lived rally during Friday's trading, but the Isdex finished  lower following some profit warnings late Thursday. 

 "The market rallied for a while, then resumed its downward trend," said Kansas City trader Paul Dow. "Any rally we get meets overhead resistance. The selling is pretty relentless." 

 Oracle late Thursday issued a profit warning, and technology stocks in particular appeared to suffer in Friday's selling.

 Wall Street shares staged a comeback yesterday after the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, reawakened hopes of an early cut in interest rates. 

 But Mr Greenspan's comments came too late to rally sentiment in London, where the FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell 50 points to close at 5,858.6, a two-year low, after string of profit warnings from US companies overnight. 

 Gloom had gripped traders on both sides of the Atlantic in the wake of Mr Greenspan's appearance before the Senate banking committee earlier this week, when he appeared to rule out the Fed cutting rates ahead of its next meeting, despite a raft of weak economic data. 

 In early trading, the Dow Jones index of leading shares lost 130 points, more than one percent of its value. A profit warning from software maker Oracle hurt technology stocks, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down 3%. 

 The markets cheered up after Mr Greenspan signalled that an inter-meeting rate cut was not off the agenda. By the close, the Dow had pared its losses and was up 16 points.

 FOREX-Yen falls to five-week lows against dollar, euro.

 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The yen fell to five-week lows against the dollar and the euro on Friday, hurt by the latest dizzying fall in Japanese stocks to their worst levels in 15 years, weak economic data and renewed political uncertainty. 

 The Japanese government was pushed into a corner by opposition parties' agreement to present a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori even as his own party haggles on how to best replace the deeply unpopular leader. 

 The stock market seemed to have already launched its own no-confidence motion, with the Nikkei marking one of the largest single-day losses in recent sessions on a day when the Liberal Democratic Party, which dominates the ruling coalition, announced a plan to compile a stock rescue package. 

 Against this backdrop, the euro fared the best out of the major currencies, hitting three-week highs against the dollar, amid expectations of a weak opening of the U.S. Nasdaq index following an after-hours profit warning from Oracle Corp , the world's second largest software company. 

 "It's a whole host of factors that are negative for the yen," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. 

 "The Nikkei fell sharply, the data was bad and obviously political uncertainty is nothing new but when you have so many other negative factors kicking in, these things come back to haunt the yen." 

 The dollar rose as far as 118.37 yen by 0815 GMT, its highest since January 24, according to Reuters data. 

 The euro hit peaks above 110.10 yen , up almost one percent from New York's levels on Thursday. It hit three-week highs above $0.9320 with the Nasdaq futures contract trading more than 30 points lower. 

 THIRD-DAY LOSS IN NIKKEI 

 The Japanese stock market's benchmark Nikkei average crumpled for the third day in a row, closing at 12,261.80, down 3.31 percent from Thursday. 

 The Japanese jobless rate hit an all-time high of 4.9 percent in January and Tokyo-area consumer prices had their largest annual fall on record, highlighting the dangers of deflation. 

 "The overnight news was very bad for the yen and this break of 118 could see the dollar go to 119, and even 120," said Tony Norfield, head of global treasury research at ABN AMRO in London." 

 The yen also faced the spectre of a radical easing in monetary policy in coming weeks. 

 The BOJ's next meeting is on March 19, while the April meeting has attracted much speculation since it will follow the release of the BOJ's "tankan" survey of business sentiment on April 2. 

 Dealers suspect the influential tankan report will show a marked deterioration in sentiment, particularly on capital spending plans. 

 Central bank chief Masaru Hayami said on Friday the bank needed to study a wide range of policy options including zero rates. He said that zero rates were abnormal and that setting an inflation target was difficult. 

 He also said the bank needed to mull both the efficacy and side effects of unusual monetary policy steps such as outright buying of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), in contrast with his frank rejection of taking such measures until recently. 

 Meanwhile, the euro took in its stride data showing the French consumer confidence index fell to five in February from January's record of seven. Italian consumer prices index rose 0.3 percent in February and rose 3.0 percent year-on-year. 

 Traders said they remained optimistic that the euro zone economy was likely to slow at a gentler pace than the United States.

 (Updates with six-week highs for euro/yen, dollar/yen, adds Italian PMI data, fresh quotes, changes byline) 

 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro shone on Friday, rising to six-week highs against the Japanese currency and hitting three-week highs against the dollar as concerns hung over Japanese and U.S. stocks. 

 The euro's rapid ascent above the psychological 110 yen level, a gain of five yen in the past three days, pushed the dollar in turn to six-week highs against the Japanese currency. 

 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average crumpled to 15-year lows for the third day in a row on Friday. Nasdaq 100 futures, meanwhile, pointed to a lower open for the Nasdaq index following an after-hours profit warning on Thursday from Oracle Corp, the world's second largest software company. 

 "The euro is looking like a safe haven, as both the U.S. and Japan are underperforming," said Steven Englander, global currency strategist at Citibank in London. 

 "Markets are beginning to worry whether this is more than a normal cyclical downturn." 

 The euro rose to peaks of 111.10 yen, up more than 1.5 percent on the day, and $0.9368 by 1035 GMT, according to Reuters data. The dollar rose to highs of 118.69 yen. 

 YEN WOES 

 Economic data compounded gloom over the yen, with the Japanese jobless rate hitting an all-time high of 4.9 percent in January and Tokyo-area consumer prices posting their largest annual fall on record. 

 Japan's opposition, meanwhile, agreed to submit a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday. 

 "It's a whole host of factors that are negative for the yen," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in London. 

 "The Nikkei fell sharply, the data was bad and obviously political uncertainty is nothing new, but when you have so many other negative factors kicking in, these things come back to haunt the yen." 

 The yen also faced further easing in monetary policy in coming weeks. 

 Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami said on Friday the bank needed to study a wide range of policy options including zero rates. He said zero rates were abnormal and that setting an inflation target was difficult. 

 He also said the bank needed to mull both the efficacy and side effects of unusual monetary policy steps such as outright buying of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), in contrast with his frank rejection of such measures until recently. 

 "Hayami was considered a hawk for a long time, and the fact that he is now coming out with these sorts of comments twice a week suggests he is beginning to reconsider his thinking," said Englander. 

 Meanwhile, the euro took in its stride data showing the French consumer confidence index fell to five in February from January's record of seven. 

 Italian consumer inflation stood at a provisional 3.0 percent for the second month running in February, while the Italian adjusted services purchasing managers' index showed the lowest rate of growth for over two years, dipping to 55.3 in February from 56.1 in January. 

 Traders said they remained optimistic that the euro zone economy was likely to slow at a gentler pace than the United States. 

 "In general, in the euro zone, things still look okay from an economic point of view," said Tony Norfield, head of global treasury research at ABN AMRO in London.

 HONG KONG, March 2 (AFP) - The cloud over Asian share markets darkened Friday as Tokyo stocks dived to a new 15-year closing low amid growing concern over the local and US economies. 

 A profit warning issued by US computer giant Oracle after the US market closed Thursday also prevented Asian markets taking any comfort from a higher close by the Nasdaq, brokers said. 

 The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index tumbled 419.86 points or 3.3 percent to finish at 12,261.80, the lowest close since July 31, 1985. 

 "Despite gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq yesterday, investors turned sellers due to the profit warning by Oracle," said Tatsuo Kurokawa, senior market analyst at Nomura Securities. 

 "The warning by one of the major US computer giants spooked investors, wiping out any positive impact from the Nasdaq rise," Kurokawa said. 

 US software giant Oracle Corp. warned Thursday that profits would be lower than its previous estimate for the third quarter, blaming the sluggish US economy. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday broke out of its slump with a late rally, closing up 31.54 points or 1.47 percent at 2,183.37, as a positive outlook from IBM temporarily sparked optimism in the tech sector.  The blue-chip Dow Jones industrials ended with a modest loss of 45.14 points or 0.43 percent at 10,450.14. 

 Aside from the Oracle shock, investors sold shares on concerns about the future of Japan's fragile economic recovery following the release of more depressing data. 

 The government said Friday the jobless rate stood at a post-war record high of 4.9 percent in January with 3.17 million people out of work. 

 Heavy Tokyo falls and Oracle's profit warning also had Hong Kong investors rushing to offload stocks, especially technology counters. The Hang Seng index shed 2.7 percent Friday to close at 13,966.43. 

 The Korea Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.2 percent to close down 18.66 points at 559.44. 

 With hopes of an early US rate cut gone, the unstable US and Japanese markets emerged as a serious drag on local shares, said Kim In-Soo, an analyst of Shinyoung Securities. 

 The Australian All Ordinaries index fell 14.7 points to 3,280.20 while the SP/ASX200 eased 16.7 points to 3,333.40 after gains in the banking and financial sector failed to offset losses in other blue chip stocks. 

 In Singapore, the Straits Times Index lost 4.53 points to 1,907.24 due to a lack of leads following Wall Street's mixed performance. 

 The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index ended up 1.07 points at 703.07 on late support for blue chips. 

 Taiwan's key index also slipped 0.32 points to 5,499.54 to close marginally lower. 

 New Zealand shares rose 0.8 percent with interest in takeover target Fletcher Energy dominating the market. 

 Shares in Manila bucked the downward trend to close 1.7 percent higher at 1,596.97 on a a technical rebound following falls earlier in the week.

 TOKYO, March 2 (AFP) - Share prices in Tokyo fell to a new 15- year intraday low Friday morning amid growing concern over the US and Japanese economies, a broker said. 

 The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index lost 178.10 points or 1.4 percent to finish the morning session at 12,503.56. Earlier the index fell to a new 15-year intraday low of 12,428.48. 

 On Thursday, the Nikkei closed at 12,681.66, its lowest level since November 20, 1985, when it ended at 12,642.89. 

 "Despite gains in the tech-heavy Nasdaq yesterday, investors turned sellers due to the profit warning by Oracle," said Tatsuo Kurokawa, senior market analyst at Nomura Securities. 

 "The warning by one of the major US computer giants spooked investors, wiping out any positive impact from the Nasdaq rise," Kurokawa said. 

 US software giant Oracle Corp. warned Thursday that profits would be lower than its previous estimate for the coming third quarter, blaming the sluggish US economy for the earnings slump. 

 Aside from the Oracle shock, investors sold shares on concerns about the future of Japan's fragile recovery as a raft of data highlighted the gloomy economic picture. 

 The latest bad news to be announced by the government Friday was the jobless rate, which rose to a post-war record high of 4.9 percent in January with 3.17 million people out of work. 

 "Strong concerns about the US and Japanese economies are pressuring buying sentiment," Kurokawa said. 

 Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa brushed aside concerns about the tumble in the Nikkei index, saying the stock market would recover soon. 

 "Share prices will be stabilized soon," Miyazawa told reporters. 

 Hi-tech bluechips were among the biggest losers. Semiconductor testing firm Advantest Corp. fell 650 yen or 5.0 percent to 12,430 yen and Japan's top computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. lost 55 yen or 3.5 percent to 1,530 yen. 

 Electronics giant NEC Corp. fell 61 yen or 3.3 percent to 1,768 yen.

Steel heads for meltdown

STRATEGY

RISING PRODUCTION, FALLING PRICES AND INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OTHER METALS MAKE A DEADLY COMBINATION FOR STEEL MAKERS

Clive Palmer's grand plan to build a $2.8 billion steel mill near Newcastle, New South Wales, has seduced some people. Converting his Austeel venture to reality will not be easy. Palmer, and many other true believers in steel, are not looking closely at the sickly condition of the world steel industry, made worse by the growing use of aluminium in the car industry.

In the past 10 years, vehicle makers in the United States, urged on by the demand for lighter and more fuel-efficient cars, have doubled their use of aluminium generally, and trebled it in bulky sports utility vehicles. The trend is accelerating. Last year, the average amount of aluminium in an American car reached 116 kilograms and it is tipped to reach 172 kilograms by 2005.

That simple snapshot of a single industry is one reason that steel makers around the world, including Australia, are facing extremely poor trading conditions. Peter Marcus, the managing partner of the US consultancy World Steel Dynamics, says: "The industry is facing meltdown. It's the toughest time for 50 years."

His comments, reported by London's Financial Times, were directed mainly at the US industry, which has been hit hard by the high value of the US dollar, cheap imports and a severe downturn in the domestic economy. In the past six months, all US steel makers have plunged into losses. Two of the biggest, LTV Corporation and Wheeling Pittsburgh, have filed for bankruptcy. US Steel, once a bellwether of the US economy, shocked investors when it lost $US57 million in the three months to December 31.

US Steel and other American steel makers have launched an unfair-trading action against 11 steel-exporting countries, alleging that steel is being dumped on the US market, destroying the local industry.

Australia's biggest steel maker, BHP, is not as despondent as its US counterparts. However, warning bells are ringing because international trading is the nature of the modern steel industry. In the six months to June 30 last year, BHP exported 47% of its total steel production, a key factor in BHP Steel's operating profit of $212 million, up 57% on the previous corresponding period.

That result is unlikely to be repeated for some time. In the past six months, the price of traded steel, generally sold as slabs, has plunged. The Wall Street Journal reported on January 26 that Japanese steel exporters are selling hot-rolled steel for about $US200 a tonne, the lowest for 15 years and at a production cost of $US250 a tonne.

It is against this gloomy outlook that Palmer's Austeel venture has launched its courageous vision for a new steel industry near Newcastle, Kingstream Steel is persevering with plans for a $2 billion steel mill near Geraldton in Western Australia, and BHP is knuckling down for a few tough years when steel profits will be hard to earn.

BHP's chief executive, Paul Anderson, gave a hint on the outlook for steel when discussing his company's financial results with analysts on February 11. He sees BHP, which is developing a strategy of working very closely with customers, as somewhat immune from global pressures, particularly the deep difficulties in the US.

Asked whether the US steel industry was likely to "migrate" to faster-growing regions, Anderson said: "Having worked in the steel industry in the US about 10 years ago, I guess the one observation that I would make is that I couldn't get out of it fast enough. The North American steel industry has been suffering from basically a decline in quality of inputs and an increase in cost of energy and ageing plant and equipment. You put all those things together and you are basically swimming upstream against the rest of the world. Obviously, the place to produce steel is where you are close to the inputs, to iron ore and coking coal, and where you have a good energy position, and that is not the US right now."

Everything Anderson says checks out. The worst of the world steel crisis is confined to the US. But that position ignores the fact that steel has become a globally traded commodity. The lowest-cost producer (even if government-subsidised) is able to make deliveries, virtually unimpeded, to any market.

That is why the US industry is suffering, and why the big European steel producer Corus announced on February 2 that it was slashing its workforce in Britain by 6000 (about 20%) and closing a factory in Wales. Corus said it was likely to report a loss of more than $2.5 billion in the year to March 31, largely as a result of restructuring costs. Corus is one of the partners named by Palmer in his vision for a steel mill near Newcastle. Corus, a merger of British Steel and the Dutch steel maker Hoogovens in 1999, makes steel in 17 countries and produces 21 million tonnes of steel a year.

Corus is an example of the modern steel maker, which will transfer production to the cheapest site. The question for Australia's steel industry is whether it can provide such a low-cost venue for an industry that is capital and labor-intensive, and increasingly dominated by Third World countries that have low-cost structures and governments keen to

attract foreign investment.

The three biggest steel-making countries are China (126 million tonnes last year of a total world production of 843 million), Japan (106 million) and the US (101 million). Asia, including Korea, accounted for 319 million tonnes. About 30% of the total production is traded, and the percentage is rising as steel goes increasingly global.

In a report produced in January, the stockbroker JBWere described the steel outlook as "very tough, again". It said that although the strength of the US dollar is allowing some competitive advantage (for non-US producers), higher freight rates are partially offsetting that benefit. The report says: "BHP Steel, which exports about 45% of production, will be significantly affected and we would expect earnings to be very soft in the third and fourth quarters."

In a written response to questions from BRW, BHP says its export of 1.2 million tonnes of steel in the six months to December 31 last year was an outstanding achievement. True, but times are changing. A question on whether BHP's Northstar business in the US was losing money met with a non-answer: "As is evident from recent steel industry headlines, the US steel industry is undergoing severe financial difficulty at present."

Steel has never been an easy industry. But low-cost Asian mills, falling global prices and rising competition from rival metals, including aluminium, are making it even tougher, particularly for Australian producers, which must export to survive, given the modest level of domestic demand.

Austeel's plan to produce 1.9 million tonnes of hot-rolled coil steel and other products, such as slab steel and cold-rolled coil, depends almost totally on exports, an implied assumption that consumption of steel will continue to rise, and that the "old" steel industry inefficiencies will remain.

This final point overlooks changes that have started and that point to steel entering a period of dramatic change. BHP has already made substantial alterations to its steel division. It has closed its Newcastle steelworks (which cut output by 20%) and floated its "long products" and distribution assets into a new company, OneSteel. There is persistent speculation, denied by BHP, that it will soon quit all of its steel assets.

Whether BHP does make a total break remains to be seen. What is certain is that steel is entering a period of consolidation, merging and contraction leading to fewer producers. This may not be a bad thing. The global steel industry is highly fragmented, a reflection of its history within nation-state borders.

Vendors of inputs, such as iron ore and coal, have contracted to a handful of global traders (including BHP, CVRD and Rio Tinto), but the 30 biggest steel companies account for less than half of global steel production. And, as Anderson noted in an address to a steel conference in Melbourne in October last year, there are now 95 companies that produce less than two million tonnes a year.

The next few years will be very difficult for all steel producers, with profits unlikely to come anywhere near satisfying required investment returns, including those of BHP, which still has $3.5 billion tied up in flat and coated steel products. It will be even harder for anyone to launch a new Australian steel producer.

HARD TIMES

World steel production rose 7% last year to a record 843 million tonnes, and prices crashed to a 15-year low.

All North American and most Asian steel producers are losing money. BHP's profits from steel are expected to fall sharply in the next six months.

Plans for launching new steel-making ventures in Australia face an extremely difficult climate, with the high capital cost unlikely to be matched by the necessary profits.

 Oracle Issues  Profit Warning  As Sales Slow

 Oracle Corp. said a sputtering economy slowed sales of two important product lines, cutting fiscal third-quarter profit below Wall Street expectations.   

 The Redwood Shores, Calif., company thus became the latest big high-tech concern to estimate an earnings shortfall, with slowing purchases by recession-wary business customers getting the blame.   

 Oracle's announcement fuels additional worries, however, by reducing the prospect that companies with new Internet-oriented product lines might be immune to a slowdown. Earlier, Oracle executives had hoped that their next-generation products, which are designed use the Web to make businesses more efficient, might still be in strong demand even during slow times.   

 Oracle's third quarter ended Wednesday, and the company is scheduled to release complete financial results for the period on March 15. In yesterday's preannouncement, it put earnings at about 10 cents a share, two cents below the low end of Wall Street's expectations.   

 The company made the announcement after 4 p.m. Oracle's shares, reflecting a modest rebound in most technology issues, were up by that time $2.38, or 13%, at $21.38 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. But the stock tumbled following the news in after-hours trading to $16.88 a share, on heavy trading volume.   

 The reasons for the shortfall were at least as troubling to analysts as its magnitude. Oracle's database software, a mainstay product line used as the foundation for many other business programs, had flat to negative growth over the year-earlier period. While database sales have been slowing at Oracle for many quarters, analysts were surprised by the abruptness of the latest downturn.   

 Oracle also said its line of application software likely grew 50% in the quarter, well below earlier predictions that the business might grow by 75%-100%. These products are now mainly used by large companies to manage their books, but Oracle is banking on a broadened line of Web-based applications to maintain the rapid growth rates the company has seen in recent years.   

 Last week in New Orleans, in fact, the company hosted thousands of customers for a trade show that highlighted its application business. At the show, Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison gave a bullish assessment of the application business, saying it was "really starting to take off."   

 Oracle executives said they were blindsided by the sudden negative shift in the mood of customers over the past several days. On Wednesday, the final day of the quarter, "we just had a significant number of deals that were deferred," said Jeffrey Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, in a conference call.   

 In many cases, Mr. Ellison added, the deals for software purchases had been approved at a vice-president level by Oracle's corporate customers, but CEOs and chief financial officers of those companies at the last minute decided to delay making a commitment.   

 Oracle had already been hurt by a falloff in orders from dot-com start-ups, many of which used Oracle databases to build new Web services. The company had been counting on conventional companies taking up the slack, using Oracle software to develop new electronic-business applications and improve their internal efficiency.   

 Still, the CEOs held off signing the purchase orders. "That was true, even where it was acknowledged that this deal would save the company money," Mr. Ellison said. "We have a lot of nervous senior executives looking at this economy and being very cautious."   

 Bob Austrian, a Banc of America Securities analyst who had cut his numbers for Oracle earlier this week, said the announcement showed that "the economic downturn has become severe enough that it has become a shock. And shocks always impair purchasing decisions."   

 Mr. Austrian said that the slower sales at Oracle are likely to extend well past the current quarter, saying they could last well into next year.   

 Mr. Ellison noted that the company's earnings are still expected to grow 20% over the year-earlier period, with operating-profit margins rising to 33% of sales from 31%. And Oracle hopes to keep improving its own efficiency, in part by more widely using its own software to run internal operations.   

 "We think we are better equipped to deal with this slowdown than any company in the world," Mr. Ellison said.   

 However, Mr. Ellison and Mr. Henley acknowledged that they couldn't predict when sales growth would improve, because of the continuing uncertainty among customers about the economy.

 BOSTON (AP) - Sapient Corp. became the latest e-consultant forced into major cutbacks by the dot-com downturn Friday, announcing it would cut 720 jobs, or 20 percent of its work force, and warning it won't make its expected first quarter profit. 

 The news sent Sapient shares down more than 13 percent to $11.25 per share Friday, up somewhat after plunging $4, or nearly 31 percent, in the morning. 

 The company, citing a sharp and swift decline in business just since the beginning of February, said it now expects first-quarter 2001 revenues to be about 20 percent below the consensus estimate of $136 million, with a pro forma loss, excluding one-time items such as restructuring costs, of 3 to 5 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected a profit of 9 cents per share. 

 Cambridge-based Sapient said it would close its 70-person Sydney, Australia, office and would consolidate, but not end, its presence in several U.S. cities. A company spokeswoman declined to provide further details about where the layoffs would come. 

 Sapient reported a sharp and swift downturn in February, which bodes ill for the rest of the embattled E-consulting sector. 

 "The economy has gotten much tougher, and it has gotten tougher than we had expected even five weeks ago," said CEO Jerry Greenberg. 

 Sapient, with 2,600 employees, has been considered a relatively strong E-consultant because of its technology expertise and comparatively diverse client base. 

 Greg Gore, an analyst at WR Hambrecht in San Francisco, said the announcement is the first indication of how badly the sector floundered in February, and said the news likely signaled the start of "a dismal earnings season." 

 "Sapient's a premier company," he said. "If their earnings are down ... that bodes poorly for the rest of the industry." 

 Gore said the company's utilization rate - a measurement of how busy it's keeping its consultants - was low in December but that it held off on layoffs in order to make sure the slowdown was real. 

 Now, it clearly is. In a conference call following the announcement, Sapient officials frankly acknowledged that clients were pulling back dramatically on the kind of consulting projects Sapient specializes in. 

 "We didn't get off to start we hoped for in January," said Chief Financial Officer Ed Goldfinger. "As you can imagine, from the actions we're taking today, February was even worse than January, and we are certainly not at this point counting on seeing any improvement in March." 

 Sapient, which said it wouldn't provide further guidance for the rest of 2001, will take a $35 million to $40 million restructuring charge in the first quarter of 2001. It said it expects the layoffs to save $5 million in the first quarter, and $60 million to $65 million annually. 

 Gore said Sapient is still well positioned to recover when the sector picks up. 

 "They're a survivor and they'll flourish when the economy turns," he said. 

 Sapient has U.S. offices in Atlanta, Austin, Texas; Cambridge, Mass.; Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and abroad in Dusseldorf and Munich, Germany; Milan, Italy; New Delhi, India; London and Tokyo.

 ANNOUNCER: From coast to coast, this is MONEYLINE. 

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Welcome to MONEYLINE, I`m Willow Bay in Los Angeles. 

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE:  Good evening Willow, and good evening, everyone. I`m Stuart Varney in New York. 

 The scandal over former President Bill Clinton`s 11th hour pardons once again took center stage on Capitol Hill, as some of Clinton`s closest advisers and friends appeared before a House committee. Some of them made headlines for what they said, another for what she did not say. 

 Greg Clarkin attended the hearings and he joins us now from Capitol Hill -- Greg. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: And Stuart, this was the third hearing into that controversial last-minute pardon of Marc Rich. Now the main attraction today really was the appearance of a high-profile fund-raiser for the Democrats. But Congressmen learned very early on that they wouldn`t be learning much from this witness. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) 

 BETH DOZORETZ, FORMER FINANCE CHAIR, DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Upon the advice of my counsel, I respectfully decline to answer that question, based on the protection afforded me under the United States constitution. 

 CLARKIN (voice-over): With that, Democratic fund-raiser Beth Dozoretz avoided questions from a House committee on her role in the controversial pardon of commodities trader, Marc Rich. Dozoretz made it clear she wouldn`t be responding to the questions on the pardon, her ties to the former president, or any subject. 

 REP. CHRISTOPHER SHAYS (R), CONNECTICUT: Let me ask you this: Will that be your response to all our questions, or are those, there are specific  subjects or persons you will not discuss and others you are willing to discuss with us? 

 DOZORETZ: Sir, that will be my response to all questions. 

 REP. DAN BURTON (R-IN), CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE GOVERNMENT REFORMS COMMITTEE: Involved in the discussion. 

 CLARKIN: Congressmen then grilled three of former President Clinton`s closest advisers, trying to get to the bottom how and why Rich and his partner, Pincus Green received their last minute pardons. All of the former president`s advisers said they opposed the pardons. 

 BRUCE LINDSEY, FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: In my judgment the fact they were fugitives was the beginning and the end of the discussion. For the president that was a factor, but not the beginning and the end. 

 CLARKIN: Clinton`s former chief of staff said he may have been swayed by world leaders, such as then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who went to bat for Rich. 

 JOHN PODESTA, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: I think that he felt obliged having heard from a number of people who he respected, asking him to take it under serious consideration, that he did that. And I think that based on that, he looked at it, he bought the argument. 

 CLARKIN: The former counsel to the president said may have come down to the absolute pardon power of the office. 

 BETH NOLAN, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL: And I said, "Look, my job is to tell you what I think about this and to tell you what my best judgment about it is. But I know who`s president and who`s not. And he got to exercise the pardon power." 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: Committee members hammered away at those former advisers, looking for details about the last days, the last hours of the Clinton presidency. And while some of the advisers said the pardon of Marc Rich was definitely poor judgment, nobody said there was any wrongdoing involved --Willow. 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin in Washington. You know,Greg, the Marc Rich drama today wasn`t just playing out in Washington, but in New York as well. The state`s tax commissioner announced today that the state wants back taxes from 1980 to 1982, when the commodities trader was a New York resident before fleeing to Switzerland. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 ARTHUR ROTH, NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION: Marc Rich is no innocent victim here. He`s a tax evader, and I have the responsibility to go after the taxes that he rightfully owes to the state of New York, and I intend to pursue it to its fullest. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: OK, so here`s how it breaks down: The state says he owes nearly 27 million in back taxes, 13.5 million in penalties, and more than 97 million in interest. The total: nearly $138 million. And the state says the interest continues to accumulate at more than $20,000 a day. 

 VARNEY: All right, Willow, let`s go to Wall Street because there today, a late day bounce took the markets by storm. 

 The Dow fell more than 190 points but ended down just a fraction of that. A loss of 45 points on the day, at 10,450. 

 The turnaround, much more dramatic on the Nasdaq which was down nearly 4 percent at its low today. And it actually ended up 31 points at 2,183. 

 As for the S&P 500, which briefly dipped into bear market territory today, it closed up a point, at 1,241. 

 What was behind the rebound? All right, let`s go to Terry Keenan at the New York Stock Exchange for some answers there. 

 Terry, what do you have? 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, you can thank Big Blue for much of the late-day turnaround in the Dow and the positive sentiment in tech sector overall. 

 Around 2:30 p.m. here, word began to leak out that IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) was making some positive comments in what the company is referring to as a routine but private meeting with some investors. That news sent IBM stock up about $8 from its lows, to be the biggest winner among the Dow 30 today, closing up more than 6. 

 Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) helped a bit by the sentiment: it bounced off of 52-week low that it hit yesterday. 

 Still, there was wide spread and persistent selling in some of the other weaker tech and telecom names. Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) lost another $1.45 after that earnings warning this time yesterday. AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) down nearly $1; SBC also lower. 

 And the airline stocks suffering today: USAirways (URL: http://www.usairways.com/) losing $1 after warning of a wider than expected loss for its first quarter. AMR and its potential merger partner UAL also down, and Goldman Sachs noting  that air travel has been slowing, along with the economy. 

 All in all, an OK day here. The S&P did not move into the bear market territory, but March -- not coming in much like a lamb or a lion here at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Let`s go to the Nasdaq now and John Metaxas. 

 JOHN METAXAS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Terry, the story of the day here was the dramatic turn around in technology stocks, the market rallying 100 points from fresh two-year lows to finish with a gain here. Some bargain-hunting, some short covering and the IBM news helping technology stocks here. 

 But after the bell, you have more evidence of a continued slowing in technology company earnings. The database software company Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) announcing after the bell: they`re expecting a third-quarter profit shortfall. The company is blaming delayed spending by customers pushing orders into the next quarter, and perhaps beyond. 

 And like many other technology companies, blaming, in fact, a slowing economy. After hours, the stock getting punished. Oracle, after a big gain today, down sharply in after-hours trading. 

 Now, the news put a cloud over a terrific comeback in the Nasdaq today. At its lows, we were down 50 percent from the highs set back in March. Semiconductor stocks hit new yearly lows today before bouncing back sharply. 

 Take a look at the performance of Broadcom (URL: http://www.broadcom.com/) , the communications chip company. This stock was hammered down below $42 a share after some downgrades. And their customer, 3com, announced their own earnings  warning. But Broadcom came back to post a more modest loss. 

 AMCC (URL: http://www.amcc.com) , another communication chip company that warned. After being down, closed with a nice gain of $2.81. And indeed, four of the five biggest stocks at the Nasdaq hit 52-week lows in intra-day trading, and then all closed with gains. Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) up 3 1/2 percent, Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) up 2 percent, Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) gaining nearly 1 percent, and Oracle, the big winner of the day -- up 12 1/2 percent, off its 52-week low. 

 This was before they announced after the bell. Question now is, what will Oracle`s warning mean for this one-day Nasdaq rally -- Willow. 

 BAY: John Metaxas, thank you. And when you look at what`s going in the after hours, with Oracle down 4, brace yourself for tomorrow. 

 Still to come on MONEYLINE: a software dynamo becomes the latest tech firm to suffer from the slowing economy. We will ask Larry Ellison just what went wrong at Oracle. 

 And we`ll go live to Seattle for the latest on the economic impact of yesterday`s powerful earthquake. Plus, as the White House and congressional Democrats spar over how much to cut taxes, we`ll hear from both sides of the tax divide: Senator Domenici and Gene Sperling. That`s next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK: Giving tax relief, that is, 60 percent of it, to the highest 10 percent of the taxpayers, and having 43 percent going to the top one percent is not going to spur the economy. We don`t see a rush of these high rollers going out to buy refrigerators and washing machines. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: Clearly, the debate in Washington over cutting taxes heated up today. The Democrats unveiled their own tax cut plan, while the House Ways and Means Committee approved an across-the-board tax cut, the linchpin to President Bush`s $1.6 trillion reduction. 

 Congressional Democrats are proposing to cut taxes by a smaller $900 billion, with tax relief focused on lower income brackets. All this came as President Bush pressed on with a multistate tour to sell his budget, which would increase federal spending by 4 percent. 

 The biggest winner under the Bush plan would be education, which would get an 11 percent boost. Defense spending would increase by nearly five percent to $310 billion. On the down side, the Environment Protection Agency as well as the agricultural and transportation departments -- they would see their budgets reduced. 

 But the most controversial piece of the puzzle revolves around tax cuts. For more on that, we`re joined from Washington by Gene Sperling, who served as President Clinton`s economic adviser and is now at the Brookings Institution, and New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici. He is the Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee. 

 Gentlemen welcome back to MONEYLINE. 

 GENE SPERLING, FORMER CLINTON ADVISER: Thank you, Stuart. 

 SEN. PETE DOMENICI (R), NEW MEXICO: Thank you, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Gene, if I could start with you first -- and forgive me for starting out somewhat harshly, but this is what is being said. It is being said that the Democrats will move heaven and earth to stop  the Bush tax plan because it would work. It would get the economy moving, it would stimulate a recovery in the stock market, and the Republicans would get political credit. And that`s why you don`t want it. What do you say? 

 SPERLING: It couldn`t be further from the truth. 

 Our nation has benefited significantly over the last several years from a commitment to fiscal prudence, to paying down the national debt, and insuring that we`re saving the Medicare and Social Security surpluses to increase savings and growth in our country. 

 What`s disturbing is that this budget takes a U-turn on that fiscal discipline. The tax cut is so large when the costs are added that when you add the missile defense and other Bush spending priorities, it is quite clear that this tax cut is going to mean draining hundreds of billions of dollars from the Medicare and Social Security surplus, and taking us off our path to make America debt- free. 

 I think that will be bad for savings, bad for capital formation, and ultimately bad for our long-term growth. 

 VARNEY: Senator... 

 SPERLING: Democrats simply want a more moderate tax cut... 

 VARNEY: Let me just bring in Senator Domenici, because Mr. Gephardt, speaking after Mr. Bush`s speech the other night, he said, "The president`s tax plan threatens Social Security and Medicare. His plan fails to set aside the resources that these programs need in the future." 

 Would you respond to that, Mr. Domenici? 

 DOMENICI: Oh, I`d be pleased to, and Mr. Sperling`s alluded to that, too. Frankly, you know, it seems to me that whenever the other side of the aisle wants to take the -- our side of the aisle on or our Republican president, that what they do is bring back their two hold hail and hearty approaches and that is blame the Republicans for doing something  to Social Security and Medicare. 

 I really thought that had left the scene, but now, since we`re on the verge of success in giving the American people back a lot of their money, which  we don`t need, once again, the old argument comes up in spite of the budget from the president saying: all the Social Security money is left intact for Social Security. All of the Medicare money is going to be spent on Medicare. The old tried-and-true, "Let`s scare them up," comes up again, but this time it won`t work, because, essentially, we are collecting far more from the people than we need. And before we`re finished we`ll show how we`re going to pay for everything and the people are going to say: Give us back some of our money. If you don`t, you`ll spend it all. 

 VARNEY: Gene, can I ask you this: if layoffs started to mount and the economy really started to head south, would you change your opinion and back Mr. Bush`s plan to get this economy moving with a tax cut? 

 SPERLING: First, I think most economists believe that what`s been best for managing the economy is to have the fiscal discipline that gives the Federal Reserve the maximum flexibility to ease rates. I think most economists are very skeptical about whether you can time a tax cut tightly enough to have that type of impact. 

 But that really isn`t the debate... 

 VARNEY: But if you back-dated the tax cut to January the first and you reduce federal income tax rates at that point, you would inject money directly into the economy very, very quickly. And if this economy keeps heading south, you might need that kind of stimulus. 

 SPERLING: Stuart, a couple of points. No. 1: You could have a good discussion about exactly what you`re talking about -- how much should we try too inject perhaps, as you say, some retroactive tax cuts to try to stimulate the economy. You can have that debate. But that is entirely separate from whether we should take our country off the course of fiscal discipline and making a commitment to save the Medicare and Social Security surpluses and reach a debt-free America. That is about the long, 10-year commitment. 

 What`s disturbing about this is not whether they make it retroactive --or a tax cut retroactive to try to stimulate the economy; what`s disturbing is, based on 10-year projections they`re willing to commit over $2 trillion to a very large tax cut. And... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 VARNEY: We`re running out of time. Senator would you respond to that? 

 DOMENICI: Well, first of all, when he was the adviser to then- President Clinton, they used 15-year projection -- isn`t that amazing. We thought that was way too long, we`re using 10. Now they`re saying 10 is too long. 

 But let me suggest another thing: In terms of what`s going to happen to this surplus, they`re worried about us giving it back to the people, but watch what I say -- before we`re finished the other side of the aisle is going to be claiming most about wanting to spend more money. If you spend more money, you use the surplus up and it can`t be used for tax cuts. 

 VARNEY: Gentlemen, I want to thank you very much indeed, both of you. Gene Sperling, Senator Pete Domenici, thanks for being with us on MONEYLINE, gentlemen. 

 DOMENICI: Stuart, thank you. 

 SPERLING: Thank you, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, coming up, much more on that late-day profit warning from tech bellwether, Oracle. We will ask chief Larry Ellison next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: In tonight`s tech watch, another new economy powerhouse scales back profit forecasts. As we told you, Oracle became the latest in a flood of tech firms to feel the pinch of a slowing U.S. Economy. In after-hours activity, Oracle lost nearly 4 1/2. 

 Joining us now from Redwood City, California, Oracle`s chairman and CEO, Larry Ellison. 

 Larry, welcome. 

 LARRY ELLISON, CEO, ORACLE: Hi, Willow. 

 BAY: What happened? 

 ELLISON: Well, we had a very strong beginning to this quarter, we had a very strong December, we had a very good January and things were looking very good for us up until the last week of February. And we`ve found a number of transactions just moved out. The market expected us to earn a consensus earnings of 11 cents; we thought we were going to beat that, in fact, we`ll come in at 10 cents, so we`re very disappointed and surprised. 

 BAY: This happened at the very end of the quarter; were you counting on those sales before they were final? 

 ELLISON: Sure, you always have a forecast for a certain number of sales and as deals work their way up to CEOs. There`s so much concern about this economy, an awful lot of transactions, an awful lot of software purchases have been deferred from February to subsequent months. So, we see a tremendous concern among CEOs about the state of this economy and they`re being very cautious about spending money on anything. 

 BAY: And simply, that`s what you were noticing: it was a delay in customers, they`re putting off their spending? 

 ELLISON: Absolutely. It hit us much worse in February than January or December. 

 BAY: Now, it hit you much worse in February, as you say, but, given the carnage all around you, were you, perhaps, too confident or too optimistic in your original forecasts? 

 ELLISON: Well, again, the market was expecting us to have operating income of around billion dollars and in fact we`ll have an operating income of about $900 million. So, we didn`t miss by very much. But the answer is, am I surprised? I am very surprised. 

 Because I thought we were going to beat those billion dollar estimates. Our margin still improved from 31 percent a year ago to 33 percent, so our profits are up, our margins are up by not nearly as much as I thought they would be. 

 BAY: Do you have any sense, when you look out to the future, of where we are in this slowdown and therefore, where your business is? Are we near the end or is that far from clear? 

 ELLISON: I wish I knew, Willow. A lot of these deals are people that are actually committed, they`re existing Oracle customers, they have ongoing projects that actually need the software, but they`re being extremely cautious, so -- by the way, it`s located entirely in the United States. 

 Our Asia Pacific business is very strong, our European business is very strong, it happened to us entirely in the U.S., entirely in the month of February. 

 BAY: Larry Ellison, tough times in the tech world. Thanks as always for joining us. 

 ELLISON: Thanks, Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Still to come, assessing the damage: how much will Seattle`s economy suffer after yesterday`s major earthquake? We`ll have a live report for you next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: After being rocked yesterday by that 6.8 earthquake, Seattle today focused on picking up the pieces and assessing the damage. Estimates put the cost at around $2 billion. Katharine Barrett has the latest on the economic impact on a city that ten Fortune 500 companies call home. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATHARINE BARRETT, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a day to clear  debris and survey the damage, but spotty cell phone service and some bridge and street closures tied tongues and traffic, delaying a return to normal business. Workers were shut out of Starbucks (URL: http://www.starbucks.com/)  global headquarters while clean up went on. The building`s damage was spectacular but superficial. 

 ORIN SMITH, PRESIDENT & CEO, STARBUCKS: I`m not sure what the cost will be but I know we have very good insurance and I`m told that all of this damage will be covered. 

 BARRETT: Boeing (URL: http://www.boeing.com/) was shut out of their offices, too, operating instead from a fire station across the street. Boeing`s largest plant, building wide-bodied jets, was operating normally with only partial operations in some other facilities. 

 LARRY MCCRACKEN, BOEING SPOKESPERSON: If you have to go in and recalibrate a lot of your measuring equipment, we have cranes across the ceiling and you need to make sure that everything structurally is OK, before you let people back in. 

 You have to make sure that the power, water, fire, sprinkling systems are all intact; and we`re going through that with our emergency preparedness people and with our engineers on a building by building basis. 

 BARRETT: And for now, no delivery of the company`s smaller jets, due to damage on county-owned runways. High-tech titans Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) and Amazon (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) said damage to their buildings was minimal. In the end, most Seattleites, even economists, were counting not dollar damages but blessings. 

 PAUL SOMMERS, PROF.,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON: The impact overall  is relatively small, this is not the scale of the disaster that hit San Francisco, for example, because of the depth of the earthquake and the amount of damage -- it just seems overall to be less. A lot of the serious damage is to infrastructure -- to bridges in particular. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BARRETT: Now, employees here at Starbucks headquarters won`t be able to get back to their desks until sometime next week. One of those workers I should note is my husband, who evacuated the building with his colleagues yesterday, leaving his wallet on his desk and his car still parked in the parking garage right over there -- Willow. 

 BAY: Katharine Barrett reporting from Seattle. I hope you get that car out, and get a ride home, Katharine. Coming up in our next half hour, the worst stock market slump in a decade has left some retirees reeling from stock shock. We`ll take a special look at the victims Wall Street has left in its wake. 

 Plus, the lights may be back on in California, but are we headed for a national energy crisis? We`ll talk to Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) leader, Ken Lay. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: The MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR continues. Here again, Willow Bay in Los Angeles and Stuart Varney in New York. 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s headlines: what does a top democratic fund- raiser know about the presidential pardon of Marc Rich? Her lips are sealed. Beth Dozoretz takes the Fifth in the latest congressional hearings on the scandal. On Wall Street: back from the abyss; we`ll look at  how and why the S&P clawed its way out of bear market territory during today`s session. And, what to do in your golden years when some can`t-miss investments turn south -- the effect of a stock market slide on seniors, and we`re going to meet some of the victims. 

 BAY: For those of you just joining us, an update on our top story: Oracle, the world`s No. 2 software company warned profits would fall short of forecasts. The company said it would suffer an earnings shortfall in its fiscal third quarter, and that future profits would also disappoint. The problem: a substantial number of customers delayed spending -- this, because of the U.S. economic slowdown. 

 Earlier on MONEYLINE, Oracle boss Larry Ellison told us what was behind the shortfall. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 ELLISON: We just see a tremendous concern among CEOs about the state of this economy, and they`re being very cautious about spending money on anything. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: The stock took a hit in after-hours trading, down almost 4 1/2. A host of tech firms have warned over the past two weeks, including Gateway, EMC (URL: http://www.emc.com/) , Sun Microsystems, Motorola (URL: http://www.mot.com/) , and 3Com (URL: http://www.3com.com/) . 

 VARNEY: And that is quite a list. 

 Well, tech profit worries have been pressuring the market, and that was true again today. At one point, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P were all off sharply, with the Nasdaq dangerously close to breaking through the 2000 level. But by the afternoon, the indicators rebounded. After falling as much as 193 points, the Dow managed to claw its way back, and it finished the session down just 45 at 10450. Helping the Dow, IBM, after the company said it remains confident it will hit its numbers for 2001. IBM, by the way, ended up more than six points. Johnson & Johnson (URL: http://www.jnj.com/) up 1 3/4; ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) , General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) , Caterpillar (URL: http://www.caterpillar.com/) , all up just a fraction. The Nasdaq slipped as much as 80 points, but finished the day in the plus column, fueled higher by chips, software, telecom equipment stocks. The Nasdaq ended up 31 at 2183. 

 But the biggest turnaround story was from the S&P 500. That index ended up a point at 1241. But earlier in the day, the index actually touched bear market territory, trading down more than 20 percent from its all-time high of 1527, which was set in March of 2000. 

 BAY: Stuart, you know the market downturn has taken a toll on stocks across the board -- even many considered safe havens. The impact, though, is especially tough on senior citizens, many of whom depend on those so-called widow`s and orphan stocks to carry them through retirement. But that is proving unrealistic. 

 Fred Katayama reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 MARGARET WEIDLING, RETIREE: We`re going to have gutters put up along the top. 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Margaret Weidling and her husband, Ralph (ph), took out a $40,000 loan to jack up their sloping house on the hillside, but their financial fortunes are sliding like their home. The 8,000 shares of Pacific Gas and Electric Ralph had bought as a PG&E employee have tumbled and the utility postponed its dividend in January. Their dividend income shrank by $300 dollars a month; money the Weidlings were counting on to pay back the loan. 

 WEIDLING: Instead of taking two years, it will probably take me three years to pay it off. 

 KATAYAMA (on camera): Many seniors are facing stock shock. They`ve invested in so-called widow`s and orphan`s stocks like AT&T and PG&A for their price stability and their ability to steadily pay out dividends. But a sharp economic slowdown has forced some of those companies to suspend or slash cash payouts, and their stocks have plummeted to boot. Widow`s and orphan`s stocks are not the safe havens many people thought they were. 

 (voice-over): One of the most widely-held stocks, AT&T, has fallen 64 percent from it`s all-time high. It chopped its dividend 83 percent this month, the first cut in its 125-year history. It`s spin- off, Lucent (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) Technologies, nosedived 85 percent, but it maintains its dividend. PG&E (URL: http://www.pgecorp.com/) , off 62 percent, has postponed its payout. Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) , down 91 percent, slashed its dividend. 

 A big dividend cut has put Bob McKenney in a bind. Making up half of his portfolio: Lucent Technologies and his former employer, AT&T. 

 ROBERT MCKENNEY, AT&T RETIREE: And it was suppose to be one of the stocks that was going to be around for years, and you`d put it in a safe deposit  box and forget about it. That hasn`t happened. 

 KATAYAMA: His shrinking portfolio of $650,000 has cut his net worth in half. This year the 65-year-old retiree will get $3,200 less in dividends. 

 MCKENNEY: We`re starting to cutback. We were going to purchase a new car; we`re holding off on that a little while. And we`re going to cut back on a trip out West -- we`re going to postpone that for a little while. 

 JANET MCKENNEY, RETIREE: I do use a lot of coupons; I try to watch what I buy. 

 KATAYAMA: Back in California, the Weidling`s have 100 percent of their portfolio in utilities. Financial planners say elderly investors should diversify, spreading their money across many stocks and across other assets, such as bonds. 

 The Weidlings and the McKenney`s say they cannot afford to spend as much on their grandchildren as a result of the dividend cutbacks, but both couples are holding on to their stocks for now -- hoping that a bounce back will give them a shot at reclaiming financial freedom. 

 Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VARNEY: So what recourse do those investors and others like them really have? Will they ever make their money back in this market? 

 Terry Keenan decided to use history as a guide to try to answer that question, and she joins us now from the Big Board -- Terry. 

 KEENAN: Stuart, some interesting things that you find when you look back over time: the investors that Fred just profiled were followers of one of the most familiar investment mantras of the last decade: buy and hold for the long-term. It worked for Warren Buffett, and during the momentum-driven market of the 1990s it worked for many other investors as well. 

 But history does show that a hands-off approach to investing can be extremely risky, particularly in the technology sector, where the pace of innovation changes so rapidly. An analysis of the so-called nifty 50 stocks of the early 1970s shows that none of that decade`s most coveted technology names produced above-market returns over the next 25 years. In fact, the returns on the tech leaders: IBM, Xerox, Digital Equipment and Burroughs  all paled in comparison to the 12 percent gain in the S&P 500 on an annualized basis over the same period of time. 

 And, more recently, many former tech-related darlings have turned into ugly ducklings on Wall Street, never to recover after a flurry of negative news. Apple Computer, for example, has been dead money since 1988; Eastman Kodak is stuck where it was trading back in 1995; while Lucent Technologies is back where it was trading four years ago. 

 As more and more investors get burned, they`re also turning more cautious. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 NICK SARGEN, J.P. MORGAN, PRIVATE CLIENT GROUP: I think, again, on the retail investors, people are hopeful. But you know what I`m noticing? We`re not buying on dips anymore. I think the new attitude is, why buy it today if you can buy it cheaper tomorrow? 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KEENAN: Well, it is that psychology that may keep some of these fallen angels underwater for years to come, and one reason that experts say it is more important to actively manage your portfolio than ever before. And remember: Even Warren Buffett prunes his portfolio several times a year; he has also never invested in technology, saying that he doesn`t understand it and it changes too quickly. 

 The bottom line: Even the oracle of Omaha says that but and hold isn`t as easy as it sounds -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Well said; Terry Keenan at the Big Board. 

 All right, so is the buy and hold philosophy absolutely dead? Let`s put that question, now, to our next guest, Dennis McKechnie, fund manager at Pimco funds. 

 Dennis, welcome back. 

 DENNIS MCKECHNIE, PIMCO FUNDS: Hi, thank you. 

 VARNEY: Buy and hold as an investment strategy -- is it thoroughly discredited and something you would wall away from now? 

 MCKECHNIE: Well, yes, it doesn`t work in tech. Tech moves so quickly; it moves five to 10 times faster than the rest of the economy. You have to move in when the fundamentals are improving, and you can`t just buy blindly when things fall. 

 VARNEY: But look, there`s all kinds of people out there looking for some kind of bottom in technology, and some of these big names are truly beaten down. What`s wrong with buying at this kind of very, very low price -- or it seems a low price level -- and holding it for a period of years to make your money? 

 MCKECHNIE: Oh, by all means, there should be selective buying; but you have to buy the right companies. You know, the economy -- the impact of the economy is having a rolling effect. Semiconductor companies, for example, got hit about six months back. You see today Oracle`s just now getting hit now. So you`re going to have a similar, staggered recovery. You can`t just buy any tech company, you have to buy the companies that are poised to benefit. 

 VARNEY: So you can`t just buy a cross-section of the big names in various sectors of technology and figure out you`re going to do well -- it`s not that simple? MCKECHNIE: Correct. 

 VARNEY: OK, let`s deal with some specific stocks: Microsoft; now there`s a biggie that`s beaten down. Do you like it? 

 MCKECHNIE: I think Microsoft`s a buy, here. Microsoft has had this impact on the economy which has really slowed down PC growth. PC growth is just about at a standstill. I think it will return to about 15 percent growth rate; and when it does, people will get more interested in owning Microsoft. 

 VARNEY: So your position on Microsoft is premised on the PC market returning to strong growth? 

 MCKECHNIE: Right. 

 VARNEY: Would you also buy, like a Dell (URL: http://www.dell.com/) , Gateway, Compaq (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) -- the box-makers? 

 MCKECHNIE: I would, and actually have. Dell and Compaq -- I actually bought Dell in the last couple days. Compaq`s turning into a larger and larger holding. These companies don`t have as much inventory as some of the telecom companies, and so when the economy recovers they`ll be coincident beneficiaries. 

 VARNEY: Got you; Dennis McKechnie, thanks for joining us. 

 MCKECHNIE: Thank you. 

 VARNEY: Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, coming up on MONEYLINE: he`s got the ear of president Bush and he is warning of a potential nationwide energy crisis; a one-on-one interview with Enron`s chairman. And earnings warnings, labor issues and commission cuts -- a lot to talk about in the airlines industry. 

 We will fill you in when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: The markets today got further signs of a slowing economy when the big three auto makers reported vehicle sales dropped sharply in February. General Motors saw its sales slump 9 percent, Daimler Chrysler recorded an 11 percent decline, as did Ford. 

 But the manufacturing sector overall is still under water. The closely-watched purchasing managers survey showed the sector stuck in low gear for a seventh straight month. The survey showed a slight uptick in February to 41.9, but any number below 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is contracting. 

 And a former fed member says the economy, as a whole, is weakening. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALICE RIVLIN, FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD: I think the economy is growing extremely slowly, if at all. It grew a little more than 1 percent in the fourth quarter. Probably isn`t growing much faster than that now. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: The recent rally in the bond market continued. On the news, the 10-year up almost half a point at 4.86 percent. The 30- year, that rose nearly 3/4 of a point. 

 VARNEY: There were some stocks that made very big moves today. Let`s start with Broadcom. It was down a point and a quarter after two analyst downgrades. Joe Osha, Merrill Lynch, blamed the economy, saying Broadcom faces -- quote -- "a number of challenges that are not fully factored into the stock price." -- end quote. 

 Lam Research added a dollar. In an effort to salvage its bottom line, the chip equipment maker is closing its doors five days each quarter and cutting executive pay. 

 Then we have VeriSign (URL: http://www.verisign.com/) . It jumped over 6.25 in what one analyst dubbed: a nice surprise. Verisign will retain exclusive control of the worldwide registry for all dot-com addresses through 2007. 

 Elsewhere on the corporate fronts, Hollywood writers walked out of heated contract talks with studio chiefs today. In a press conference late this afternoon, Nick Counter, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and 

 Television Producers, said in the end, money remained the sticking point. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 NICK COUNTER, ALLIANCE OF MOTION PICTURE AND TV PRODUCERS: We put a package on the table this morning that would represent net gains to writers, writers only, over three years, of $30 million. To give you an idea of how far apart we are, their last proposal to us would represent an increase in compensation and residuals for writers only at scale  of $112 million dollars. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: Hollywood is safe from strife until May 31st. That`s when the current writer`s contract expires. 

 Other news: Northwest Airlines deals a blow to online travel brokers, saying it will stop paying commissions to Web sites selling its tickets. Web travel sites rely on airline payments for 20 percent of their revenues, making commission cuts a threat to their survival. 

 Today, the stocks plunged on fears that other airlines may follow suit. Northwest`s lead, that is. Travelocity.com (URL: http://www.travelocity.com/) tumbled more than 30 percent. Sabre, which owns a majority of Travelocity, sank over 3 points, and Expedia down 17 percent. 

 BAY: And in our sector report, more on those rather unfriendly skies. U.S. Airways, awaiting approval of its hotly-contested merger with United, warned of earnings well below forecasts. At fault, sharp declines in business travel and cutthroat pricing in U.S. Airs` east coast stomping grounds. Add to that, the dismal outlook, the latest in airline labor strife. Now, Delta and its pilots cannot find common ground, signaling that a strike could hit as early as April 1st. And American canceled 39 flights at New York`s JFK airport after a work slowdown from its mechanics` union. American immediately filed for a restraining order against the union, saying its actions were quote, "deliberate, illegal and unwarranted." 

 No surprise after such grim goings-on: analysts slashed estimates, and investors took flight. UAL (URL: http://www.ual.com) fell more than 3, Continental off 2 1/2, AMR (URL: http://www.amrcorp.com/) , Delta Air Lines (URL: http://www.delta-air.com/) and U.S. Airways all fell more than $1. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE: we`ll talk to one top exec in the energy industry who says the power crisis could get even worse. Enron`s chairman, Kenneth Lay, when MONEYLINE returns. Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Energy policy: a critical issue for the Bush administration, as the nation struggles under increased demand, overtaxed systems and sky- rocketing prices. 

 Just this week, President Bush in his address to Congress said, the nation has a serious energy problem, one that demands a national energy policy. One supporter of Bush agrees: Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron, the largest buyer and seller of energy in the country. 

 An economist by training, he has advised both presidents Clinton and Bush, as well as California Governor Gray Davis. Lay believes we are headed for a nationwide energy crisis. I spoke with Mr. Lay recently, and began by asking him, what`s ahead for California. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KENNETH LAY, ECONOMIST: It`s going to get worse. It`s going to get worse, and it could get very bad this summer. Cambridge Energy Research Associates recently estimated that California will be about 10 percent short of electricity this summer. 

 To put it in order of magnitude, Cambridge Energy Research Associates estimates about 20 hours of blackout this summer. 

 BAY: Twenty hours... 

 LAY: Across the whole state. 

 BAY: Realistically, can consumers avoid rate increases here in California? 

 LAY: No. This problem can be solved, it can`t be solved painlessly. 

 BAY: There are some who say that the energy crisis will cast a longer shadow, a darker shadow over the Bush administration potentially than even an economic slowdown. You`re an economist, do you agree? 

 LAY: I think, in fact, that it could be one of the largest problems that the new administration has to face, and has to face pretty much early on. 

 BAY: You are a close friend and supporter of the Bush family, friend and adviser to now-President Bush. How much have you helped to shape this policy? 

 LAY: Well, I`ve said before, I think my influence on the shaping of either  energy policy or about anything else in Washington is greatly exaggerated. As I said, certainly I do talk with some of his senior cabinet officers involved in this, from time to time. I`ve been to at least a couple of meetings with other CEOs where he`s been present, and he`s asked me to comment on, in particular, the California situation. 

 But I am on his advisory council, energy advisory council. 

 BAY: Why do you think, as you describe it, your role is exaggerated. I mean, why is there the charge that President Bush`s vision on energy policy, on energy is yours? 

 LAY: Well, I mean, I see articles just like you see articles, including in one paper in this town, "The Los Angeles Times" which would suggest that somehow I`m really dictating energy policy today. Well, I`m not going that and I`m not even try -- I wouldn`t even try to do  that. 

 BAY: Based on what you know, based on what you know the discussions are, what would be the key elements of a national energy policy? 

 LAY: Well, I think again, there would be quite a bit of discussion about access. Obviously, you can`t produce oil or natural gas unless you have access to the areas where it is, has high potential. 

 And right now there are several areas that have high potential that are restricted for exploration and development, and that will be a tough battle, I know. 

 BAY: A tough battle, and also the charge is, as you well know, on this issue of exploration, that Mr. Bush will use the California energy crisis and the momentum created by that, to achieve one of his goals which is increased exploration. A fair charge? 

 LAY: Well let`s keep in mind, let`s keep in mind, this is not a trumped up crisis. I mean, California has a very, very difficult situation which has now spread throughout the west. And indeed there is some  chance this could spread throughout the country. It could, in fact, significantly impact financial markets as well as the real economy, the economic growth. So, there is a problem. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Ken Lay told me that no matter what happens with the California crisis, he is confident his company will meet earnings estimates for 2001. 

 Over the past 52 weeks, Enron has dropped 24 percent from its high. Today, shares closed up 18 cents at 68 dollars, 68 cents -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right, Willow, up next, our financial editor Myron Kandel on what would be a very long march back to the top for the Nasdaq. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: At its low today, the Nasdaq was at 2,071, way down from the 5,000 of just one year ago. Let`s get some perspective on how far back it would be to get back to the top. Here`s financial editor Myron Kandel -- Mike. 

 MYRON KANDEL, CNNfn FINANCIAL EDITOR: Stuart, if the Nasdaq gained  20 percent a year, 20 percent, it would take 5 years for the Nasdaq to reach it`s old record, which was set a year ago a week from Saturday. 

 VARNEY: That`s right. March 10. 

 KANDEL: March 10 of last year. 

 VARNEY: I think, 5,100. 

 KANDEL: 5,040, I believe. But let me tell you something on the plus side. The Dow -- 12 months after the Fed starts easing interest rates, the Dow traditionally rises 20 percent, and that, at the end of this year, would put the Dow over 12,000. See? I got back to the 12,000. 

 VARNEY: We should tell our viewers that we were saying, 12,000 in January. That`s water under the bridge. Correct? 

 KANDEL: Correct. 

 VARNEY: We`ll look at it later. Thanks, Mike. 

 Up next, "Ahead of the Curve": what you need to know tonight before some 

 of those markets open again tomorrow. Stay with us please. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Taking a look at some of what could move the markets tomorrow, keep an eye on shares of Oracle. After today`s closing bell earnings warning. 

 And Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan speaks before the House Budget Committee on current fiscal issues tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. And to stay a step ahead of the markets tune in to "AHEAD OF THE CURVE" at 5:00 a.m. Eastern right here on CNN. 

 The ultimate slap for investors who have been slammed with more than their share of bad news this year. If you want to read the latest gloom and doom  news about the economy from the Financial Paper of Record. Get ready to pay more. The "Wall Street Journal" is hiking the newsstand price from $.75 to a dollar. It is the first time in more than a decade. The increase, however, will only affect the casual "Journal" reader. The subscription rate will stay the same. So, just a little bit of good news, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: I`m going to get a subscription. Believe me. 

 BAY: That`s MONEYLINE for this Thursday. I`m Willow Bay from Los Angeles. 

 VARNEY: And I`m Stuart Varney from New York. Good night, everyone. "CROSSFIRE" is next.

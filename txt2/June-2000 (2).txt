ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

There are two words investors never want to hear: profit warning. But over 20 companies put Wall Street on alert Thursday, saying that earnings will miss the mark in the latest quarter. And that put investors in a selling mood. Well-known names like  Goodyear Tire & Rubber and  Del Monte Foods saw their stock prices turn sour after warning of a profit shortfall.

CHRISTOFOROUS: And here at the NASDAQ, Ericsson sank nearly 7 percent on the day after saying profits will miss the mark because of slowing growth in the mobile phone market. And  Priceline.com took it on the chin, down more than 8 percent on news that six of the major airlines, including United, American and Continental, are investing in a Web site that will offer discount airline tickets and be in direct competition with Priceline.   

But there was a bright spot. Just take a look at  Eli Lilly. The stock was on fire, up better than $15. New Jersey-based  Eli Lilly said its drug to fight sepsis, which is often a fatal blood infection, showed promise in reducing deaths.   

Marking headlines after the closing bell, Xerox. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company for accounting issues related to its Mexico business.   

And  Nike served up profits that were right in line with expectations.  Nike got a boost from sales of its up-tempo and retro-styled Air Jordan shoes.  Nike also announced a major buyback. It plans to buy a billion dollars of its own stock.

 WorldCom and Sprint are back on market - Blocked by federal regulators, theyll look for new partners

 Federal antitrust lawyers stopped WorldCom Inc. s $129 billion purchase of Sprint Corp. dead in its tracks, but they may have just started a new scramble over the two companies. 

 Analysts predicted a fresh round of wheeling and dealing will result from yesterday s lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department to halt the transaction, which would have joined the nation s No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance companies. AT&T Corp. is the market leader with a 53 percent share. 

 WorldCom, which lacks a wireless business, may target Nextel or Voicestream, the last two independent mobile-phone carriers with national reach, analysts said. Or the Clinton, Miss.-based company could become prey itself, either for a global behemoth such as Deutsche Telekom, Europe s largest phone company, or a small but voracious carrier such as Qwest. 

 Sprint, with its top-of-the-line long-distance network, plum wireless assets and smaller price tag, is even more of a target, analysts said. 

 "Sprint would quickly attract several bidders given its strong Internet backbone and highly desirable ... wireless businesses," said Daniel Reingold, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. 

 Another possibility for WorldCom is to sell off its consumer long-distance unit, said Merrill Lynch analyst Adam Quinton. That would allow it to exit a business with sinking profit margins, and use the proceeds to invest in more profitable services for corporations. 

 Investors have little patience for slow-growing businesses, especially in telecommunications. AT&T s shares are down 32 percent since the company s May 2 warning that this year s profit would be less than expected because of weakness in consumer long distance. 

 "AT&T has demonstrated that the adverse sentiment attached to owning a substantial voice (long-distance) franchise has become a major drag on value," Quinton said. 

 WorldCom and Sprint could conceivably retool their partnership, but it would involve drastic changes to overcome regulators concerns. In its complaint, the Department of Justice found that the combined companies would reduce competition in a number of significant markets, including long distance. WorldCom and Sprint together control 27 percent of the market. 

 "This merger is effectively dead," said Scott Cleland, an analyst for The Precursor Group. 

 The two companies had argued that telecommunications is changing so swiftly that it no longer makes sense to measure market power in separate pieces of the industry, such as long distance. In any case, the coming entry of the regional Bell companies and other competitors into long distance would be more than enough to protect consumers, they said. 

 Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department s antitrust division, disagreed. 

 "Other companies have entered the market on a much smaller scale," he said. "But none has produced beneficial effects on competition comparable in magnitude to the effects produced by competition between WorldCom and Sprint, and between those companies and AT&T." 

 After the Justice Department s action, WorldCom and Sprint withdrew their merger notice to the European Commission, which also would have had to approve the deal. WorldCom chief executive Bernie Ebbers is more likely to abandon the merger than engage in a protracted legal battle with U.S. regulators, unnamed sources told Bloomberg News. 

 The derailing of the Sprint-WorldCom deal benefits AT&T in the short term because it can continue to distinguish itself from WorldCom by offering wireless calls in discount packages of telecommunications services. 

 The picture is murkier for AT&T if WorldCom peddles its consumer long-distance unit. While AT&T could benefit from any disarray surrounding a sale, the long-term trends aren t promising. There are more than 600 competitors in long distance, even as the business declines because of wireless calls and cheap Internet-routed service. 

 What WorldCom would gain from the sale of its consumer long-distance unit is cash to seed faster-growing businesses. Sprint s consumer long-distance business was valued at $39 billion this week by Credit Suisse First Boston, and WorldCom s is twice as big. It would probably sell at a discount, however, given the sector s diminishing returns. 

 For now, WorldCom and Sprint said they re reviewing their options. 

 "We are disappointed that we were unable to convince the Justice Department that the merger is in the best interest of the American public and would advance competition," J. Richard Devlin, Sprint s general counsel. "Over the next several days we will determine our next steps."

The struggle over prescription drug benefits for the elderly, now center stage in the House, is not simply between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives.

It has also driven a wedge between two of the biggest, most influe- ntial lobbies in Washington: the Health Insurance Association of America and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. For months, the pharmaceutical industry has been arguing -- on Capitol Hill and beyond, in an intensive advertising campaign -- that any prescription drug benefit for the elderly must be provided through the private sector, not the traditional Medicare program.

Critics say the industry fears that direct government involvement will inevitably mean government pressure on drug industry prices -- and profits.

The pharmaceutical association asserts, as it said in one recent advertisement, that "a government-run prescription drug plan" and "government controls" on prices would hurt the industry, slow research and ultimately harm patients.

That philosophy, which fits neatly with the Republican desire for less government and more private market forces in the Medicare program, is at the heart of the prescription drug bill that the Ways and Means Committee passed on Wednesday night, which may hit the House floor this week. The Republican bill would use government subsidies to encourage private companies to offer drug policies to the elderly. Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and about a third of the elderlyhaveno drug coverage at all.

But there has been a persistent voice of resistance from the insurance industry, ordinarily an ally of the Republican Party. Officials of the Health Insurance Association of America have been warning that the private-sector solution being debated would be difficult to achieve. Even with federal subsidies, insurance officials have warned, private companies would have a hard time offering an affordable product and making a profit in a market where drug prices keep rising and the sickestelderly people -- the heaviest users of prescription drugs -- are most likely to buy the coverage.

This tension between two industry giants is one more hurdle in the way of passing prescription drug legislation this year. The debate has bubbled throughout the spring, much to the annoyance of Republican leaders who have been scrambling to find a consensus on prescription drug coverage, considered one of the most powerful issues of this election year.

Neither industry group has taken a position on the Republican bill, but their disagreement is widely known and infuses the larger, more partisan debate. Democrats and their allies say the insurance industry's resistance proves that the Republican bill is not a realistic effort to meet the needs of the elderly.

 WASHINGTON, June 24 -- The struggle over prescription drug benefits for the elderly, now center stage in the House, is not simply between Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives. It has also driven a wedge between two of the biggest, most influential lobbies in Washington: the Health Insurance Association of America and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. 

 For months now, the pharmaceutical industry has been arguing -- on Capitol Hill and beyond, in an intensive advertising campaign -- that any new prescription drug benefit for the elderly must be provided through the private sector, not the traditional Medicare program. 

 Critics say the industry fears that direct government involvement will inevitably mean government pressure on drug industry prices -- and profits. The pharmaceutical association asserts, as it said in one recent advertisement, that ''a government-run prescription drug plan'' and ''government controls'' on prices would hurt the industry, slow research and ultimately harm patients. 

 That philosophy, which fits neatly with the Republican desire for less government and more private market forces in the Medicare program, is at the heart of the prescription drug bill that the Ways and Means Committee passed Wednesday night, which may hit the House floor next week. The Republican bill would use government subsidies to encourage private companies to offer drug policies to the elderly. Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and about a third of the elderly have no drug coverage at all. 

 But there has been a persistent voice of resistance from the insurance industry, ordinarily a strong ally of the Republican Party. Officials of the Health Insurance Association of America have been warning that the private-sector solution being debated would be difficult to achieve. Even with federal subsidies, insurance officials have warned, private companies would have a hard time offering an affordable product and making a profit in a market where drug prices keep rising and the sickest elderly people -- the heaviest users of prescription drugs -- are most likely to buy the coverage. 

 As Charles N. Kahn III, president of the group, testified before a House committee earlier this month, ''We do not believe that private drug-only insurance is a viable concept given the substantial economic and regulatory barriers and problems with adverse selection that would face such a product.'' 

 This tension between two industry giants, like the fierce partisan warfare, is one more hurdle in the way of passing prescription drug legislation this year. The debate has bubbled throughout the spring, much to the annoyance of Republican leaders who have been scrambling to find a consensus on prescription drug coverage, considered one of the most powerful issues of this election year. 

 ''We've been trying to find something that gets through the House,'' said John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert. ''Obviously, some aspects of the insurance industry aren't that excited about it, but we're trying to get something that will help seniors.'' 

 Neither industry group has officially taken a position on the Republican bill, but their disagreement is widely known and infuses the larger, more partisan debate. Democrats and their allies say the insurance industry's resistance proves that the Republican bill is not a realistic effort to meet the needs of the elderly. 

 ''This really shows the G.O.P. drug plan to be a mirage,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health care advocacy group. ''It looks good from a distance, but there's very little there. Notwithstanding the fact that the G.O.P. bill would provide huge subsidies to insurance companies, the insurance companies are still saying, 'We're not going to offer these policies.' '' 

 President Clinton, who has a drug proposal of his own and is a sharp critic of the House Republicans' plan, has noted the insurance industry's criticism on several occasions. Mr. Clinton has spent much of his administration at odds with the health insurers association, most notably when the group ran the legendary ''Harry and Louise'' advertisements attacking his proposal for national health insurance. 

 Chris Jennings, the deputy assistant to the president for health policy, said, ''When the advocates of Harry and Louise and the president agree on something, people say there must be something to this.'' 

 The larger Democratic critique of the Republican plan, as voiced by many people this week, is that the obvious solution to the lack of a drug benefit in Medicare is to add a drug benefit to Medicare -- rather than, as Mr. Pollack puts it, ''contorting yourself'' to find private-sector mechanisms that the private sector itself has doubts about. As Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, put it, ''Republicans want to basically privatize this benefit, as they've always wanted to privatize Medicare.'' 

 Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, argued that the last major effort to open Medicare to more private insurance involvement, Medicare+Choice, ''by anyone's analysis has not worked.'' He was referring to the fact that many Medicare beneficiaries in recent years have signed with private health maintenance organizations, rather than the traditional Medicare program, only to see their H.M.O.'s pull out of the Medicare market because they found it unprofitable. 

 Republicans counter that their plan would give the nation's elderly more choices in drug plans; they note that it guarantees every Medicare beneficiary a choice of at least two plans, and would also provide for a federal fallback plan if private insurers do not offer coverage in a particular area. 

 And while the Health Insurance Association of America -- whose members include the biggest health insurers and provide benefits to 123 million Americans over all -- may be resisting this new market, Republican leaders note that others are not. Representative Bill Thomas of California, the chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health and the prime mover on this bill, noted this week that a leading drug benefit manager, Merck-Medco Managed Care, had said it would ''work to develop a prescription-drug-only plan that we could offer nationwide in competition with others in what we expect will be a highly competitive market.'' 

 ''The fact of the matter is, if you build it, they will come,'' said Mr. Feehery, the House speaker's aide. The legislation, he added, ''will create a huge pot of money that the private market will want to get involved in. The fact is, this is a great benefit for seniors and we've already had some movement from the private sector that they will be interested in it.'' 

 Judith H. Bello, executive vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said in her testimony on June 13 that she was certain the private marketplace could produce drug benefits for the elderly, since it had already produced private insurance policies for ''cancer, sports accidents, emergency room visits, pregnancy complications and campers.'' 

 After the Republican bill passed the Ways and Means Committee Wednesday, on a strict party-line vote, Mr. Kahn said he had no comment ''on the bill right now.'' Asked if he would lobby against the bill when it hits the floor next week, he again declined to comment. But the dispute clearly puts him in an awkward position, politically and, perhaps, personally. Before assuming the presidency of the health insurance association, Mr. Kahn was staff director for the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. 

 As for the pharmaceutical association, its critics assert that it is so panic-stricken over the prospect of the government cutting into its profits that industry lobbying will only intensify. Even if, as many expect, nothing is enacted this year to provide prescription drug coverage to the elderly, the issue will only return in the new administration and Congress of 2001. 

 ''There's so much money being thrown around on this issue that it's really hard to track,'' said Holly Bailey, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics.

 After bouncing in and out of negative territory, market mover Nortel Networks Corp. finished up 5 cents at $96.55 yesterday. The telecom blue chip, based in Brampton, Ont., announced it had completed its acquisition of privately held optical component company CoreTek Inc. 

 Nortel's former parent company BCE Inc. sank almost 2.5 per cent to $35.45 after one of its holdings -- CGI Group Inc. -- took a hit. CGI lost more than 28 per cent to close at $10.95 after the Montreal-based consulting services company issued a stern profit warning. CGI was one of the most heavily traded companies on the TSE, with more than five million shares changing hands. 

 Stocks of Mitel Corp. rose $1.20 to $31.75 after the company announced its communications systems division had won a $10-million maintenance contract with Ericsson in Britain.

ANGLO-DUTCH giant Unilever was the Achilles heel of the London market today, tumbling 35p to 419p after the group came clean with an admission that growth at the detergents-to-food conglomerate has fallen below targets.  

Company officials, locked in meetings on both sides of the North Sea today while more than Pounds 1.5 billion was wiped off the group's market cap earlier, eventually confirmed talk that it had downgraded its like-for-like year's sales growth target to between 2% and 3%. The previous forecast had been for between 3% and 4% although recent acquisitions, such as US ice cream group Ben and Jerry's, should push full-year sales up by between 4% and 5%.  

Elsewhere the super-jumbo deal sent BAE Systems flying 14p higher to 431 1/2p in an otherwise depressed London market. London was hit less than feared after a steep slide in US markets overnight but it was still shaping up for a depressing end to the week for a thinly traded market, with the FT-SE losing 29.6 points to 6384.2. Technology stocks were in the spotlight after the Nasdaq Composite index snapped a five-session winning streak overnight, and extended losses today. That kept the squeezed on most London technology bellwethers, with the techMARK 100 losing 43.56 to 3416.85.  

Recent leading 100 entrant Bookham slipped 140p to 3700p, Sema dropped 23 1/2p to 936 1/2p and Reuters fell 10p to 1247p as Morgan Stanley cut its rating. Logica bucked the trend for most of the day on the back of its new take on the WAP phone phenomenon, but eventually succumbed to the tech gloom to lose 45p to 1620p.  

Thus, up 21p to 291p, came charging back  

from the shock resignation of its finance director. Otherwise telecoms were mostly under the Nasdaq cosh with Telewest down 6p at 272p, Colt off 86p to 2504p and Energis falling 82p to 2768p.  

Earnings concerns have surrounded British Telecom but heavy retail support helped prop up the stock 12p at 912p in a falling sector. Vodafone was down 11 1/4p to 297 1/4p. Tech sentiment was further tested by yet another profit warning from a computer company. This time it was ICM's turn to report slower-than-expected trad-  

ing. The shares lost 107 1/2p to 435p as investors headed for the exit.  

Action Computer, which joined the growing profits warning club yesterday, had stabilised at 56p, but caution is the watchword.  

Computacenter, another member of the reduced forecasts crowd, was plumbing more than one-year lows as it dipped 7 1/2p to 390p.  

Rio Tinto moved up 22p to 1012p after unveiling a Pounds 1.12 billion bid for Australian mining and lumber group North, but it was off opening highs as analysts bet North could

 CNH GLOBAL WARNS OF LOSSES THE TOP MAKER OF FARM TRACTORS SAYS IT EXPECTS A DEFICIT IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FOR THE YEAR.

 CNH Global, the top maker of farm tractors, said it expects a loss in the second quarter and for the year, after predicting a profit, because low crop prices have left farmers with little to spend on equipment. 

 The news sent CNH Global shares tumbling 24 percent, their biggest one-day decline since the completion of New Holland NV's acquisition of Case Corp. to form CNH Global in November 1999. 

 CNH Global was expected to earn 30 cents a share in the second quarter and 40 cents in 2000, the average estimates of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Prices for corn, wheat and soy beans remain pinned at close to 20- year lows. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six times in the past year, raising borrowing costs. It's the company's second profit warning this year. In a warning issued last month, the company still projected profit. 

 "Continued caution on what commodity prices will do will keep farmers on the sideline" and away from purchases of big-ticket items such as combines or threshers, said James McCann, a Merrill Lynch analyst with a "near-term accumulate" rating on the shares. 

 Shares of CNH fell $2.688 to $8.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dropped 15 percent this year already as investors' concern about the struggling farm economy persists. They are now down 35 percent in 2000, while shares of rival Deere & Co. are down 9.5 percent. 

 Of the 15 analysts with ratings on the company, according to Bloomberg Analytics, seven have ratings of "buy" or "recommended." None has a sell rating on the company. 

 Raw commodities prices for corn have spiraled from more than $5 a bushel in mid 1996 to about $2.24 today. Some commodities analysts have said prices aren't likely to recover for years. 

 CNH Global said the loss it expects is before restructuring charges and goodwill. Besides North America, the company singled out Brazil, where the government there has initiated a low-cost loan program for domestically produced farm equipment. 

 On a broader scale, CNH Global said it expects industrywide sales of large agricultural equipment to decline by 10 to 15 percent this year. 

 CNH Global, based in Racine, Wisconsin, also said customers and dealers have stopped buying some equipment because they're concerned about the company's plans to stop making some products. The company was required to exit some production to satisfy antitrust regulators during the merger process. 

 The company is cutting output of some products in its construction equipment business, and said it will take charges in the second quarter and the full year to write down the value of some agricultural equipment. 

 CNH Global didn't directly inform all its shareholders that it held a conference call today to discuss the warning. The company said it alerted certain analysts and institutional investors. 

 Smaller investors must sign up at the company's Web site to be notified of conference calls. The company didn't issue a press release announcing the conference call. 

 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has criticized the practice of selective disclosure by some companies. 

 The SEC has proposed a rule to stop selective disclosure. The practice puts small investors at a disadvantage to big institutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds, which have analysts to represent their interests.

CNNfn: Talking Stocks
TKST

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS:  Not faring very well in the Dow today, and we might add Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) to that list.  Honeywell trading down at a new 52-week low, just above $35 a share.  Stock continues to get beat up. 

 Going to go to the phones now.  John from New York is on the line. John, go right ahead. 

 CALLER:  Yes, Derek, I`d like your one-year outlook for Pfizer (URL: http://www.pfizer.com/) . 

 DEREK IZUEL, AIM FUNDS:  Well we`re big bulls of Pfizer.  Pfizer is the largest holding in our portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we follow earnings momentum and Pfizer, and the company they just acquired, Warner-Lambert (URL: http://www.warner-lambert.com/) , were two companies that really showed up well in the models that we use. They`ve got a great lineup of drugs put together and as I mentioned, the population demographics are really in their favor. So you have to like this company going forward. 

 TUCKER:  Do you like the entire pharmaceuticals or do you like, you obviously like this the most.  Is it just because of the combination of Warner-Lambert and Pfizer, brand names, or? 

 IZUEL:  We like the whole sector as a whole in the long term. We like this one specifically long-term and short-term because a lot of the stock selection metrics that we use look at this.  And another one on the international basis would be Novartis (URL: http://www.novartis.com/) which is in a similar type of situation that they`re showing good earnings momentum. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Let`s go with Riz (ph) down in Virginia.  Riz, you`re on. 

 CALLER:  Thanks for talking my call. My question is about Circuit City (URL: http://www.circuitcity.com/) and in the past month or so, it`s almost cut in-half.  Do you think this is a good time to buy that? Thank you very much. 

 IZUEL:  I don`t think it`s a good time to buy Circuit City. The problem with the retailers in general is that if we do have the end of the cycle coming here, then it`s definitely going to slow sales. Retail sales in the retail sector have slowed in the last two months which is the first time that`s happened in a couple of years. Now, the one sub- sector of retail that you might think might hold out against this was the electronic retailers: Circuit City, as we`ve mentioned; RadioShack (URL: http://www.RadioShack.com/) , which is formerly Tandy;  and also, Best Buy (URL: http://www.bestbuy.com/) . However, they`ve now started to disappoint results and we like to subscribe to the "cockroach theory" in that when you have one bad disappointing result, it`s like if you go into a hotel room and see one cockroach, there`s probably more coming, and so we would stay away from those type of stocks. 

 TUCKER:  Stay away from - it`s surprising that these retailers in particular don`t hold up because I`m thinking of Circuit City and Best Buy and RadioShack, the Whiz, being large volume discounters. So that if you`re going to buy the next generation of electronic products, which are the digital products, it seems like you`d be buying from these guys before you bought them from someone else. 

 IZUEL:  Most certainly you would.  The problem is, is that, that was all realized into the market, and it was built into the expectations of these companies ahead of time.  Now as the economy`s beginning to slow a little bit on the margin, people are going to be  buying less electronic products.  Maybe you`re not going to get that DVD player you were thinking about, and so that started to just make enough a dent in the sales that it`s going to hurt the earnings.  And once that starts to happen, it often can indicate a trend of a short term and not the kind of stock I would invest in. 

 TUCKER:  Now that goes for the US, but I`m curious because you have a global focus. Do you like - are there retailers that you like outside the US? 

 IZUEL:  Right now, we`re not big fans of retailers in other parts of the world, either. 

 TUCKER:  Really! 

 IZUEL:  There`s selected ones here and there, but in general we`ve been staying away from this space. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Well, we`ve got Franklin on the line.  Franklin is calling in from Florida.  Franklin you`re on with Derek. 

 CALLER:  Yes, thank you for taking my call.  When Palm (URL: http://www.palm.com/) was first offered, I got it on the very high end, and now it`s been stuck in the 20`s. Do you think it`s time for me to just take my losses and run? 

 IZUEL:  I don`t actually. I think Palm has been beaten up because of the technology sell-off.  It has come back a little bit here in this resurgence, but I think it`s a good long-term holding because you can say what you want about the technology sector, but one of the strongest sub-sectors of technology is going to be wireless access, and Palm has about a 2/3 share of hand-held PDAs; you have to figure this is going to be a core component of people`s digital wireless access, getting onto the Internet, doing transactions, and they`ve got a big holding there.  So it`s the kind of firm that you`re going to want to hold onto.  Plus their operating system is used among other platforms as well - 

 TUCKER:  Yes, that`s what I was going to say. 

 IZUEL:  And that builds them a big foundation that they can grow a lot of business on. 

 TUCKER:  It`s interesting in that Handspring (URL: http://www.handspring.com/) which went public yesterday - nice piece of equipment as well - but it runs on a Palm operating system. 

 IZUEL:  That`s right, exactly. 

 TUCKER:  And they pay a licensing fee for it, right? 

 IZUEL:  That`s right.  That`s right.  It`s similar to Windows that`s done in PC`s. 

 TUCKER:  Grab that market and hold onto it. 

 IZUEL:  Yep. 

 TUCKER:  We`re going to continue this wireless theme here in just a second but we need to run up and do a quick commercial break first. 1- 800-304-FNET is the number. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Welcome back.  We`re talking to Derek Izuel of the Aim Global Funds today.  Let`s get back to the phones. We`ve got a lot of people waiting to talk to you.  JoAnn`s calling in from Alberta. Go ahead JoAnn. 

 CALLER:  I was wondering what your outlook is for Nokia (URL: http://www.nokia.com/) and Ericsson (URL: http://www.ericsson.com/) ? And are there any suppliers to these companies that you would recommend? 

 IZUEL:  Nokia and Ericsson, obviously two core wireless companies, fantastic sector, lots of growth going on.  Of the two, I would put Nokia in your holdings as a core global holding.  This company is the biggest cell phone producer.  They`re growing their cell phone production every year, and it continues to exceed estimates and the forecasts for growth. I believe they`re going to be one of the companies that really dictates what kind of standards are put together for wireless data transfers and that`s because of their market power. Ericsson, on the other hand, is more of an infrastructure play. I don`t think you have as - it`s still a good company, but I don`t think you have the upside or the potential long-term growth in that company as 

 you do in Nokia; and also their handsets are not as good a quality. 

 As far as suppliers to this, there`s a company in Germany we hold called Epcos (URL: N/A) which makes passive  filters and components that go into wireless equipment, cell phones and such. We`ve held that as a supplier for Nokia and Ericsson and such, and it`s done fairly well. It`s a good company that really has a broad-based portfolio of products. 

 TUCKER:  Jerry in New York, your on. Go ahead. 

 CALLER:  Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my call. I wondered if you`d be kind enough to give me your long-term outlook on Texas Instruments (URL: http://www.ti.com/) . I have a 5-year time horizon.  I`m going to hang up and listen to your response. Thanks a lot. 

 IZUEL:  Well, Texas Instruments is a great company.  They made a good acquisition yesterday of Burr-Brown (URL: http://www.burr-brown.com/) to help strengthen their portfolio in the analog semiconductor business. And that is good for Texas Instruments because analog semiconductors is a much steadier business, and if there is a shortage of talent to design analog semiconductors, which is why Texas was willing to pay a premium for this company.  So that should help Texas.  But the problem is, is that when it comes down to it, Texas Instruments is a semiconductor company, it`s a cyclical company, and you have to be careful about holding it in the long term, because of these up and down cycles that affect that industry.  Right now we`re in a very strong semiconductor cycle.  Is it going to last for five years?  I doubt it. Probably another year or two and then you could see some weakness in these stocks. 

 TUCKER:  What`s to keep it from lasting five years though?  I mean, it`s a huge assumption, but let`s, just for the sake of argument, take note of the fact that we are in a midst of a technological revolution, and technology is changing at a very rapid pace.  And it would seem to me changes the demand cycles, you know, in that we are going to have a continuous need for chips, because all of this stuff can`t run without semiconductors inside of them.  I mean, could we see a sort of fundamental reshaping of the business cycle for the semiconductor industry? 

 IZUEL:  Well the problem there and that - is capacity.  And that`s - yes, we have fantastic demand.  Chips are going into everything.  But there are lots of competitors out there.  They`re very aggressive.  It`s a  very profitable market, for sure.  And so they are building more and more capacity, and these plants take time to build.  And eventually, in another year or two, the plant growth will get to a point where there`s too many fabs and they`re producing too many chips and it`s going to hurt their pricing power.  And that is why it`s still always going to be a cyclical business just because of the labor - not labor, but capital-intensive nature of building semiconductors. 

 TUCKER:  So like for example we saw a Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) go into Ireland and announce it`s putting in a $2 billion plant there, that plant would come online in just about the time - 

 IZUEL:  Yep, exactly.  And when you are looking at the sector though, the higher or the greater the technology content of that chip, whether it`s, for example, memory chips on the one hand being probably the lowest technology content; on the other hand, some of these communication chips being the highest, the less cyclical that business is, in general.  There are some exceptions.  So some of the more higher-end companies, such as AMCC (URL: http://www.amcc.com) or PMCS (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com) that have very high technical content in their chips, are going to be somewhat less cyclical than the rest of - 

 TUCKER:  Well that works beautifully because we have Eric from Ontario on the line.  I think he wants to ask about one of those high contents. Go ahead, Eric. 

 CALLER:  Thank you.  This is just a good lead in, the PMC-Sierra.  I wanted to buy it about three months ago, it was at about 150; now I think  it`s 195 or 200.  When does one go into a stock like this, please?  Thank you. 

 IZUEL:  Well, that is the difficult question is obviously the valuation in these.  People realize the high technology content in these chips, and they`ve pushed these valuations to very high levels.  I think you have to keep PMC-Sierra on your radar screen.  I am not sure if this is the time to buy it, actually when a lot of tech stocks and especially chip stocks have spiked up.  It`s a great company.  I think I`d wait for a little bit of weakness before I`d enter into it. 

 But it does have that high technical content you want, and it goes right into a market: communications and specifically optical communications, it has fabulous growth. 

 TUCKER:  All right, terrific.  Let`s end on that thought, go to another commercial break, the number to call 1-800-304-fnet .

 Pacific Century Financial Corp., the parent of Bank of Hawaii, said bad loans will all but wipe out second-quarter earnings, becoming the third U.S. bank in a week to issue such a profit warning. The Honolulu-based bank's shares dropped $3.56, or 18%, to close at $16.25, on the New York Stock Exchange, in response. The bank said it will set aside an additional $55 million to $65 million to offset bad loans and increase its provision for possible future bad loans. The charges will result in "nominal" earnings for the second quarter, it said. Analysts in a First Call/Thomson Financial survey were expecting earnings of 51 cents a share. Most of Pacific Century's write-offs and provisions stemmed from bad commercial real estate loans in Hawaii and syndicated loans, which are divided among a number of banks, the company said. They also cover recent political and economic turmoil in Fiji, where Bank of Hawaii has three branches, the company said.

 A jolt of enthusiasm in the technology sector pushed Bay Street higher. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index gained 103.07 points to close at an all-time peak of 10,239.88, after setting an earlier record Monday. Canada's benchmark index touched an intraday high yesterday of 10,286.5 on the strength of the telecom blue chips and fuel cell maker Ballard Power Systems Inc. 

 In New York,the Nasdaq Stock Market's tech-heavy composite index advanced 23.53 points to 4,013.36. The gains pushed it past the 4,000-point mark for the first time in two months but the figure is still well off of Nasdaq's 52-week intraday high of 5,132.52. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 122.68 points to 10,435.16 as Honeywell International Inc. tumbled another 10.5 per cent to $36 (U.S.). On Monday, it plunged more than 20 per cent after the computer equipment company issued a second-quarter profit warning. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 10.05 points to 1,475.95. 

 The small caps on the Canadian Venture Exchange pulled the overall CDNX down 1.77 points to 3,470.43. 

 Thanks mainly to Nortel Networks Corp. and BCE Inc., Bay Street's performance yesterday outpaced that of Wall Street, said Subodh Kumar, market strategist at CIBC World Markets in Toronto. "But I think the underlying issue with both markets is the upcoming earnings season, so, that was one of the overhangs on the Dow. 

 "I think the overall trend in both markets for the next two weeks is going to be some corrections until the earning season is behind us, in the U.S. particularly," Mr. Kumar said. 

 Nortel gained $2.30 (Canadian) to $101.70 in TSE trading. A day after signing a huge deal with U.S.-based computer equipment company Hewlett-Packard Co., Nortel launched new Internet security software, and a research firm deemed it the leader in the emerging market for systems that allow service providers to offer network-based services. 

 Nortel's former parent company, BCE, gained $1.05 or 3 per cent to $36.95. Nortel and BCE account for more than 30 per cent of the overall weighting on the TSE-300. 

 The technology-laden industrial-products sector also shone, rising more than 2 per cent. Burnaby, B.C.-based fuel-cell maker, Ballard Power, closed up more than 14 per cent to $137. 

 But shares of Seagram Co. Ltd. took a beating. After confirming it was merging with Vivendi SA and Canal Plus SA of France, the Montreal-based liquor and entertainment giant slumped $7 to close at $85.40. The slide in heavily weighted Seagram forced the TSE's communications and media subindex down almost 3 per cent. 

 Western Star Trucks Holdings Inc. made one of the biggest advances. However, trading of the stock was halted within the first hour of trading after it surged $4.50 or 24 per cent to $23.50. It didn't resume trading on Tuesday. You can read Richard Bloom's market updates through the day at www.globeandmail.com

CNNfn: Talking Stocks
TKST

 (c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved. 

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS:  Meanwhile, let`s get up to date at the action at  New York Stock Exchange.  The Dow Industrials under some pressure.  The Dow currently down 100 points.  Part of the problem here is, well, my honey ain`t well again today. 

 Rhonda Schaffler is watching that action for us.  Hey, Rhonda. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  It`s like being in a country music song with you, Bill.  You never know what you`re going to say. But I believe you are talking about Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) and you`re right. It`s been in trouble again today.  It`s trading at a new 52-week low.  Very interesting thing going on with Honeywell and some other stocks. 

 Let`s first show you how the actives are faring, because Honeywell is right at the top.  It`s down 4 3/4.  Remember yesterday, it lost more than 8, this on a profit warning.  Today, no surprise, it`s got a couple of brokerages out there cutting their ratings and/or price targets and/or earnings estimates on Honeywell.  So, it`s getting pounded once again here.  It`s the worst performing Dow stock right now. 

 Compaq Computer (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) , always actively traded here, it`s up about 50 cents.  AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) , which hit a 52-week low not long ago and is trying to recover from that, is up 5/16. 

 America Online (URL: http://www.aol.com/) is up more than 2.  Henry Blodgett (ph), an analyst with Merrill Lynch making some upbeat comments about AOLTV, the service that AOL unveiled yesterday.  Blodgett (ph) saying it`s going to be one of the first services to successfully combine interactivity on the television with regular Internet usage.  AOL and CNNfn`s parent company, Time Warner (URL: http://www.timewarner.com/) , have announced plans to merge. 

 Lucent (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) is down 1 1/4.  It`s interesting, while we`re  seeing some strength in technology stocks, we`re not seeing buying here across the board in techs. 

 Now, as far as Honeywell goes, Larry Rice over at Joseph Hall (ph) has some very interesting things to say about some of these stocks getting pounded again, because that`s one trend we`ve seen on the big board. Companies that warn are continuing to sell off the day after  their warnings.  And he said they`re relieved to see change on Wall Street, that you cannot play the bounce back that is, usually, investors were used to seeing a stock really get slammed on a profit warning, then everyone would decide the worst is over and let`s come in and buy.  His feeling is that things have really changed on that  front and that people have just decided if you warn once, we`re not going to stick around to see if you warn twice, and have, instead, decided to go out and chase some other stocks.  So, that`s going to be a pattern to watch over the earnings season.  We have seen it with other stocks - EDS (URL: http://www.eds.com/) , Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) and Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) . They all sort of fall into that category.  So, Honeywell is something being talked about on Wall Street again today.  And, as I said, a new 52-week low. 

 Bill? 

 TUCKER:  Very much not a happy story there.  The breadth of this market also not good at all. 

 SCHAFFLER:  Yeah.  We`ve got decliners over advancers by an eight to five margin.  Interestingly, while the Dow was up strong yesterday, the market breadth was pretty much dead even for much of the session.  So, you didn`t have a very broad rally here yesterday.  And, perhaps, that`s why we`re seeing a bit of a turnaround today. 

 TUCKER:  Is there any theme to the Dow stocks that are managing to post some gains here?  Because looking down at my Dow chart here, there`s a lot of red numbers. 

 SCHAFFLER:  Yeah.  You have some of the techs doing well and, not surprisingly, they`re the Nasdaq tech stocks that are members of the Dow 30.  You`re not seeing an across-the-board sense of movement into financial stocks.  That`s a change from yesterday.  Pharmaceutical stocks also weak. And continuing a theme from yesterday, too, many of the  cyclical stocks, like Honeywell and others, are giving back. So, really, you`re getting strength in some of these technology names, and they are, some of them, Nasdaq stocks. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Terrific, Rhonda.  Thanks for that update from the New York Stock Exchange.

 U.S. Stocks seen inching up at open.

 NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - Stocks were expected to rise slightly at the opening bell on on Tuesday following Monday's technology-led gains, with investors relatively unfazed by fresh data about the yawning U.S. trade gap. 

 Stock futures bobbed slightly lower after the U.S. Commerce Department reported the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $30.44 billion in April from a revised $30.15 billion record high in March. 

 The figures slightly exceeded consensus Wall Street estimates for a $29.29 billion deficit, but analysts said most market players had become largely accustomed to seeing such an enormous gap. 

 "The numbers do not represent an explosion," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics. "We're just back to the old-fashioned problem of a very big trade deficit that sooner or later has to be corrected but for the moment is not creating a problem." 

 In a separate report, the government said the U.S. current account deficit widened 6.3 percent in the first quarter to a record $102.3 billion compared to the prior quarter. 

 With more than an hour to go before the opening bell, the Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for September were off 0.10 points at 1504.40, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures were up 17.50 points at 4,000.00. 

 The buying mood of investors was expected to carry over from Monday, when stocks were lifted by a rally in the technology sector and a rebound in banking stocks. 

 "It looks as though these markets want to follow through from yesterday," said James Volk, co-director, institutional trading at D.A. Davidson and Co. 

 But traders said lingering jitters about what the Fed will do at its next policy-setting meeting on June 27-28 will keep the market on edge. The Fed has hiked rates six times in the past year. 

 The suspense was also building around a key meeting of OPEC oil ministers scheduled for Wednesday as they gather under pressure to raise exports for the second time this year to ease skyrocketing crude prices. 

 On Monday, Wall Street had applauded the resilience of many high-tech shares after their steep springtime tumble. 

 The technology-stacked Nasdaq composite index pulled off its highest close in more than two months, finishing just shy of the 4,000 mark as computer chip powerhouse Intel Corp jumped 10-7/16 to 136-1/2. 

 The Nasdaq shot up late in the session to end up 129.29 points, or 3.35 percent, at 3,989.85. It was the index's highest close since the composite ended at 4,055.9 on April 11. The index, which was sent into a rout in April on concerns about overly giddy technology stock prices, was off just 1.96 percent for the year. 

 Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average marched up 108.54 points, or 1.04 percent, to 10,557.84 despite a profit warning from component Honeywell International Inc. . 

 The diversified technology and manufacturing company dropped 8-5/8 to 39-7/8 after saying it sees second-quarter earnings below expectations on weaker revenues. 

 With earnings pre-announcement season now in full swing, market players were on guard for more profit warnings. Last week, Xerox Corp. and Wachovia Corp. said their earnings would fall short of Wall Street estimates, sending a shudder through the market. 

 But the outlook for corporate earnings remains bright, said Joseph S. Kalinowski, equity strategist at I/B/E/S International. 

 "Despite some high profile negative pre-announcements, the second-quarter confession season remains quiet," Kalinowski said.

Overnight market action...



NEW YORK - Stocks romped ahead on Monday, fuelled by hopes the Federal Reserve will hold its fire next week, which would brighten the outlook for interest-rate sensitive companies like big banks and highly-valued technology firms.



The technology-stacked Nasdaq composite index pulled off its highest close in more than two months, finishing just shy of the 4,000 mark as computer chip powerhouse Intel Corp jumped 10-7/16 to 136-1/2.



"I think the market is expecting the Fed to do nothing this time around," said Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management in Garden City, N.Y.



"The stocks are pretty much trading on their fundamentals and the big rally in techs kind of shows that tech earnings are going to be very strong. We really don't have too much economic data this week to sidetrack us right now," he said.



The central bank meets again on June 27-28 after taking up interest rates six times since June 1999.



The Nasdaq shot up late in the session to end up 129.29 points, or 3.35 percent, at 3,989.85. It was the index's highest close since the composite ended at 4,055.9 on April 11.



The index, which was sent into a rout in April on concerns about overly-giddy technology stock prices, was off just 1.96 percent for the year.



Rambus Inc. , which ran up sharply last week on positive corporate news and an upgrade from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, was the most heavily traded stock on the Nasdaq. Rambus develops technology to speed the performance of memory chips.



Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average marched up 108.54 points, or 1.04 percent, to 10,557.84 despite a profit warning from component Honeywell International Inc. .



Gains in financial shares also buoyed the blue-chip Dow as the sector licked its wounds from last week's beating on interest-rate jitters and an earnings warning by southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp. .



Broader measures of the market advanced.



The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 21.54 points, or 1.47 percent, to 1,486.00. The Wilshire 5000 index , a gauge of nearly the entire stock market, was up 222.18 points, or 1.63 percent, at 13,856.79.

LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 sweltered in the summer doldrums on Monday, as the market extended its recent mixed and directionless trend amid a dearth of fresh market-moving company or economic news.



Depressed by weakness in megastock Vodafone Airtouch , the UK's blue chip index reversed Friday's 35 point gain to close down 35.8 points or 0.6 percent at 6,490.2. Decliners were in a three to two majority.



-



TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed higher on Monday, led by gains among high-techs and brokerages. The smooth start of Nasdaq Japan, sister to the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq market, lent support to overall market sentiment, brokers said.



The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares closed 273.04 points or 1.67 percent higher at 16,591.35, its first gain in five trading days.

COMMODITIES



BASE METALS - London Metal Exchange copper and zinc prices rallied in late kerb trade to post apparently positive closes after a largely uneventful day.



Three-months copper futures ended the PM kerb at $1,813 a tonne, up $14 from the late kerb close on Friday.



The market broke back above the $1,800 level in the second afternoon ring and made further gains during kerb trading. The next major resistance level is seen at $1,845/50.



"In the last half hour we saw some influential buying give a bit of a false close on copper and zinc," said Standard Bank London analyst Robin Bhar.



"It looks like they were being nudged up above the $1,800 and $1,150 levels to suck in a few more players tomorrow," he added.



Zinc closed at $1,152, up $5, having broken through resistance at $1,150. Until the late flurry, the complex had generally been consolidating after last week's gains, with fund buying largely absent.



Nickel bounced off support around the $7,800 level in early trade, bolstered by a 180-tonne fall in LME stocks which reinstated the downward trend following Friday's increase.



The market traded up to $8,000 before retracing to end the late kerb at $7,950, up $100 from Friday's kerb close.



"There's a lot of stale longs around and they're going to stop it from climbing too high, but anything below $7,800 is viewed as a buying opportunity," Bhar said, citing declining stock levels and healthy physical demand.



Aluminium ended at $1,570, down $12 from its previous close but still holding above support at $1,555/60.



-



OIL - NYMEX crude oil futures recouped some losses late Monday but still ended sharply lower as OPEC ministers began to gather for what is shaping up to be an output-raising meeting in Vienna that begins on Wednesday.



As traders wound down positions on the volatile July crude, which expires on Tuesday, some late short-covering trimmed the contract's losses.



July crude settled at $31.69, losing 64 cents on the day, after dropping $1.43 to the intraday low of $30.90. The contract peaked in the morning at $32.15.



The August contract moved more moderately, settling at $29.50, down 50 cents, as it bounced off its intraday low of $29.05. It traded as high as $29.85.



-



GOLD - COMEX gold gave up more ground to long liquidation Monday, impacted by late Friday statistics showing funds turned from heavily short to modestly long during the run up to three-month highs last week.



August gold lost $3.20, ending at $288.00 an ounce, in a range of $287.50 to $290.80. Spot bullion was last quoted at $286.00/6.50, versus London's late fix at $285.90 and Friday's New York close at $289.00/9.50.



It was the third setback in a row for gold, which a week ago looked set to test the $300 mark. Also weighing in were a firmer dollar and U.S. stock market, along with reports of more producer selling overnight.



-



GRAINS - Chicago Board of Trade soft red winter wheat futures closed higher on Monday on concerns about the fate of the ripe U.S. winter wheat crop amid rainfall in key wheat harvesting areas, traders and analysts said.



CBOT wheat closed 1 to 5-cents higher with July up 5-at $2.68-3/4. Buy stops were hit late in the July contract as it penetrated technical resistance at $2.65 per bushel.



-.



FOREX/DEBT



NEW YORK - The yen rose broadly on Monday amid hopes Japan's battered economy is finally recovering from its long recession and official interest rates may soon rise after hovering near zero for more than a year.



Pushing to a 10-day high against the dollar, the yen rallied about half a percent against the greenback and more than full percent against the euro. This allowed the dollar to gain more than three quarters of a percent against the euro.



As New York trading closed, the dollar stood near 105.94 yen, little changed from the rates seen near the opening. The euro slipped to the 101.31 yen area , reversing course after threatening two-month highs above 103 yen overnight.



-.



NEW YORK - U.S. Treasuries slipped lower on Monday as an outlook of heavy corporate supply weighed on prices which have soared in recent weeks as evidence of a slowing economy has slashed the chances of more interest rate hikes.



At the New York close, the 10-year note stood near session lows at 103-19/32, down 5/32, to yield 6.00 percent. The long bond was off 8/32 at 104-30/32, yielding 5.90 percent.



Two-year notes, which are most sensitive to the interest rate outlook, were off 1/32 at 100-13/32, yielding 6.39 percent. Yields which move in the opposite direction to prices have slumped from 6.93 percent on May 16 when the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 0.50 percent to 6.50 percent.

PARIS - France's Vivendi looked poised to secure a $33 billion three-way tie-up with Canadian liquor and entertainment group Seagram after its board backed a merger plan on Monday and scheduled announcements for Tuesday morning.



Analysts said that the French media, telecoms and utilities group had called them to a 0630 GMT Tuesday meeting to detail the expected takeover of Seagram by Vivendi and its 49-percent owned pay-TV unit Canal Plus.



Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier said on the sidelines of a separate Internet event on Monday the Vivendi and Canal Plus boards had unanimously approved plans for a merger.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday voted to approve Pfizer Inc.'s purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. in a $110 billion stock deal, after the firms agreed to four major divestitures.



The FTC voted 5-0 to approve the deal, which still requires final approval by a federal court. The FTC has pushed for a policy to have divestitures completed as a part of consent decrees, and in this case there are agreements in hand.

LONDON/NEW YORK - Continental Airlines Inc. is discussing U.S. aviation consolidation with rival Delta Air Lines Inc. but sees AMR Corp.'s American Airlines making the next step, Continental said on Monday.



Delta and Continental had not "appreciably" had merger negotiations, Continental Chief Executive Gordon Bethune told reporters in London.



But they had talked about the general consolidation that might stem from the proposed takeover of US Airways Group Inc. by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.



"I think we (Delta and Continental) are just chit-chatting about who is going to do what to whom," said Bethune, who is also chairman of Continental.



-



WASHINGTON - Sixteen House Democrats on Monday urged the Federal Reserve to not raise U.S. interest rates when it meets next week, turning up the political heat on the central bank as the election season gets in full swing.



In the most serious congressional criticism since the Fed started raising rates a year ago, the lawmakers sent a letter to the Fed signed by some high-ranking members of the Appropriations, Ways and Means and Banking committees.



"We write to urge you as strongly as we can not to raise interest rates at your next meeting," the Democrats wrote to the independent agency.



"While some of us were in disagreement with several of the recent interest rate raises you have voted, we did not join in a public effort to oppose them, because we did understand the uncertainty which you confronted," they said.



"But it is now clear that an increase in interest rates at this time - on top of the very significant cumulative increase you have voted over the past year - is likely to lead to an unnecessary and socially damaging increase in unemployment without any significant offsetting advantage," they wrote.

 (Refiling to fix typo in final paragraph to read "March" instead of "May" so it reads " ... from $30.18 billion in March") (Updates to early afternoon) 

 NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks extended their gains in afternoon trading on Monday despite a much anticipated profit warning from conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. , which was pressuring blue-chip issues. 

 Honeywell, a diversified technology and manufacturing concern, dropped 7-5/8 to 40-7/8 after beginning to fall around midday on rumours of a profit warning in the works. The company said it sees second-quarter earnings below expectations on weaker revenues. 

 "I am surprised that the market is holding up so well in the face of the negative pre-announcements and the upcoming (Federal Reserve) meeting," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Holdings. "I am pretty bullish." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average , of which Honeywell is a component, was up 98 points, or 0.94 percent, at 10,547.

 The New York Stock Exchange had halted trading in Honeywell stock for news pending for about an hour before it resumed trading at about 1:20 p.m. (1720 GMT) after the warning was released. 

 Intel Corp. , the world's largest computer chip maker, however, helped balance out Honeywell's drag on the Dow as its shares rallied 7-9/16 to 133-5/8 after announcing new processors for notebook computers. 

 Gains in financial shares also buoyed the blue-chip Dow as they licked their wounds from the beating they took late last week on interest-rate jitters and an earnings warning by southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp. . 

 J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. was up 3-1/2 at 121-7/16. And American Express Co. clung to gains, up 3 at 54-1/2 early Monday afternoon. Wachovia was up 1-1/2 at 57-15/16. 

 Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index struggled to keep its upward momentum. The Nasdaq was up 69 points, or 1.80 percent, at 3,930. 

 Rambus Inc. , which ran up sharply last week on positive corporate news and an upgrade from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, helped lift the Nasdaq. The company, which develops technology to speed the performance of memory chips, climbed 8-1/8 to 91-1/2 and was the Nasdaq's most heavily traded issue. 

 Broader measures of the market advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 14 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,478. The Wilshire 5000 index , a gauge of nearly the entire stock market, was up 132 points, or 0.97 percent, at 13,767. 

 Stocks remained mostly rangebound as investors await a key meeting of oil-producing nations on Wednesday and the Federal Reserve's policy-making meeting next week on June 27-28. 

 "The trend followers are just going crazy because there really is no trend one way or the other at this point in time," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. 

 Worries that rising interest rates might stunt the growth of corporate profits battered blue-chip stocks on Friday as the "triple witching" quarterly expiration of options and index futures whipsawed the market on Friday. 

 "This market is headed for a narrow trading range this week, bouncing off Friday's lows as far as the broader market is concerned," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 

 Ahead of that, traders will be tuned in for data on U.S. international trade on Tuesday. U.S. economists in a Reuters survey predicted that the trade gap narrowed slightly to a $29.29 billion deficit for April from $30.18 billion in May - in what could be another sign that consumer demand is starting to let up. 

 In the meantime, investors will be scanning the horizon for more negative news on earnings after printer giant Xerox Corp. issued its earnings warning last week.

Abreast of the Market
 `Fed Effect' May Roil Sleepy Stocks This Week --- Premeeting Rallies Have Been Bonanzas For Some Investors

 Stocks haven't done a lot in the past two weeks. But if recent history is any indication, hold on to your hat this week. Stocks could be about to take off -- at least temporarily.   

 Why? Blame the "Fed effect."   

 Federal Reserve policy makers meet next week, setting the stage for an unusual phenomenon that has accompanied Fed meetings since the end of 1998.   

 Stocks have rallied strongly in the days up to and the day of the meetings, only to level off or even fall afterward. That trend has provided a bonanza for nimble short-term investors, who have been buying stocks in advance of the meetings, and then selling at a profit when the meetings end. In fact, the more they have "gamed" the trend, the sharper it has become.   

 Consider the most recent Fed meeting, on May 16. In the five days up to and including the day of the meeting, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose almost 4%. Then it fell more than 6% in the next five days. Or look at the prior meeting, in March. The S&P 500 rose almost 10% in the five days through the meeting, and was virtually flat in the next five days.   

 Coincidence? Probably not. For each of the past 11 Fed meetings, starting with that of February 1999, the S&P 500 has done better in the five days through the meeting than it has on the following five days. It has surged an average 2.7% before and fallen an average 0.9% after. After five of the 11 meetings, in fact, the S&P 500 actually fell. That is the kind of trend that Wall Street is made to jump on.   

 "You can see it happening," says William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, who has watched the buying and selling unfold. "You see people talking about it in chat rooms and you hear about it when you talk to clients."   

 Investors will get their chance to test the effect in a few days. The next Fed decision will be announced June 28; if the Fed effect is going to hold, it should kick in soon. The expectation is that if the Fed doesn't raise rates this time around, it will do so in August, but in either case, if the economy continues to cool, the string of increases could be near an end.   

 Last week, uncertainty about the outcome kept stocks relatively range-bound. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.6%. Nearly all of the loss for the industrial average came Friday, as earnings worries hit banking stocks, pulling the Dow industrials down 2.5%; but technology stocks managed to survive, and the Nasdaq Composite Index ended the day with a small gain.   

 At its outset, the Fed effect may simply have reflected market psychology. Investors became fixated on interest-rate policy, first worrying that the Fed would raise rates and then hoping that any rate increases would be the last. They also came to believe that, whatever the economic problem, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan would adopt policies to fix it.   

 The result: Optimism tended to spring up right before Fed meetings, only to be replaced with more worry afterward, as economic data indicated that the economy still was hot and the Fed might have to raise rates more.   

 As the trend became apparent, speculators would use the premeeting period to buy stocks, or instruments that mimic the performance of the S&P 500 such as options or futures. Some would sell them around the time that the meetings ended, while other, longer-term players sometimes would hold on.   

 The short-term trading is the kind often carried out by hedge funds, which invest money for the wealthy, and by brokerage-firm trading desks. But in addition, Mr. Meehan says, some brokers have begun calling ordinary clients and suggesting that they use the runup before Fed meetings as an opportunity to buy stocks in hopes they will get a pop.   

 Wall Street is full of people who look for patterns they can use for short-term bets. Investors discovered the "January effect," for example, which originally referred to a tendency for small stocks to outperform large in that month, but in recent years came to mean the strong performance of almost all stocks as retirement programs funneled money into the market. So many traders began buying stocks in advance of the January effect that they pushed it back to October or November, muting its effect in January.   

 Something similar could happen to the Fed effect.   

 But as of the most recent Fed meeting, there wasn't any falloff. In fact, an examination of data back to 1983 by Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla., indicates that the effect still is relatively new. Until 1997, little clear pattern shows up around Fed meetings. For one thing, the Fed for many years didn't announce interest-rate decisions immediately after meetings, so there was no clear news on which to act.   

 Something started to happen in December 1997. For 18 of the 20 meetings since, the S&P 500 did better before than after. Since December 1998, the effect has been unrelenting: Every time the Fed met, the S&P 500 did better before than after. Sometimes it was slight, but it appeared regardless of what the Fed actually announced or was expected to announce. The effect even worked the one time that stocks dropped before the meeting, in May 1999; they dropped even more afterward.   

 Some market analysts think the phenomenon really took off after the financial crisis of the summer and fall of 1998, when the Fed stopped cutting rates and began to move toward raising them again.   

 By June 1999, when the Fed first raised rates after the crisis, investors were hoping that each rate increase would be the last. They took to buying stocks ahead of each meeting, and then buying on the day of the meeting, but selling as worries of more rate increases sank in.   

 "Going into each Fed meeting, the sense sort of developed that this would be the last Fed tightening," says Claude Amadeo, senior research associate at investment manager Bridgewater Associates in Westport, Conn. "What you would have is markets rallying, stocks rising and bond yields falling going into the Fed meeting, but afterward more economic news would come out indicating that the economy was still strong."   

 He also points out that trading volumes tended to decline during the uncertain periods ahead of Fed meetings, accentuating market moves. And he notes that the same thing happened to Treasury bonds as to stocks. They rose before meetings, causing their yields to decline, and then, as reality crept back in, their prices would fall and yields rise after the meetings.   

 In fact, although the effect on stocks is sharpest in the S&P 500, it also can be seen in other indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq 100, which is comprised of 100 of the biggest Nasdaq stocks.   

 And as the trend was noticed, Wall Street jumped on it.   

 "People got the notion of, 'What's the point of waiting for the announcement when we can jump in in front of it,' " Mr. Meehan says.   

 It probably is no coincidence that the trend is most consistent in the S&P 500. In addition to being the broadest big-stock index, it also is the index with the largest number of related financial instruments that can be used to try to game the market.   

 The big question now: Will the effect last? Some analysts think the Fed effect is mainly an outgrowth of the recent rate increases. Once the Fed finishes raising rates, they figure, fear of the Fed won't dominate markets and the trend could subside. And many analysts say the Fed is getting close to the end of its rate increases.   

 That said, the effect has worked since 1997 -- whether the Fed has cut rates, raised them, or left them alone.

 Circuit City fell 1 9/16 to 35 13/16. The Richmond, Va., consumer-electronics retailer reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street's targets, though those targets had been lowered by the company earlier this month.   

 Adobe Systems (Nasdaq) lost 4 1/2 to 120 1/4, halting a recent advance that built on expectations of strong earnings. The software developer's fiscal second-quarter earnings, turned in late Thursday, beat Wall Street's forecasts, though the company acknowledged weaker-than-expected sales of its InDesign page-layout software.   

 "The Wachovia earnings warning just put a dent in these stocks, which had been acting pretty well," Jon Brorson, director of equities at Northern Trust in Chicago. "Now it's hitting the sector just across the board. But in this market, everything acts in the extreme, both to the upside and the downside."

 Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal 
 Strength of banks' loan portfolios debated Investors trying to discern whether selloff was justified or an overreaction to bad news

 A debate is raging among bankers, investors and analysts over exactly how serious are the problems in U.S. banks' loan portfolios after bank stocks took a drubbing Friday on concerns about loan quality. 

 News last week that Wachovia Corp. would revise its earnings in part because of mounting problems in its loan portfolio sparked a round of selling in bank shares Thursday. Nearly all bank shares fell again Friday, with investors dumping lenders across the board, from big banks to smaller regional banks. 

 In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Chase Manhattan Corp. fell $1.87 (U.S.), or 3.9 per cent to $45.62, First Union Corp. fell $1.56, or 5.4 per cent, to $27.31, while J.P. Morgan & Co. sank $8.37, or 6.6 per cent, to $118.12. The widely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange bank index fell 11 per cent over Thursday and Friday alone. The decline in financial shares contributed to Friday's 265.52-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average to 10,449.30. 

 Wachovia, which fell 20 per cent Thursday, slid another 62 cents, or 1 per cent, Friday to $56.44 after shocking investors with news that it will take a second-quarter charge of $200-million to absorb problems in its loan portfolio. Now, investors are trying to discern if the market's reaction was justified or an overreaction to bad news after encountering relatively few banking sector problems in recent years, particularly from banks such as Wachovia that are considered well managed. 

 "Wachovia is going from extremely good credit quality to normal credit quality" with the $200-million charge, said James Schmidt, who manages a fund for John Hancock that invests in bank stocks. "The reaction has been a little severe." 

 Yet UnionBanCal Corp., a small, San Francisco bank, further unsettled the financial sector last week when it, too, issued a profit warning for the second quarter. The bears expect more such news in the weeks ahead. "This is not an isolated event," says Mike Mayo, a banking industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 The selloff in bank shares and the fears of mounting defaults are to many the inevitable result of both the unprecedented U.S. economic expansion and the U.S. Federal Reserve's effort to slow the economy through higher interest rates. Lenders' discipline tends to slacken after many years without a rash of defaults. Then, slower growth and higher interest rates make it harder for corporations to repay loans. 

 That is especially true for corporations that credit agencies rate below investment grade. Chase, of New York, and Bank of America Corp., of Charlotte, N.C., are among the biggest providers of financing to such corporations. The loans these banks provide usually are syndicated, that is divided up among dozens of lending institutions, the "syndicate." The top arrangers of these deals, such as Chase, tend to keep between 5 and 7 per cent of each deal on its own books. 

 Bears say these banks are the most exposed if bad loans arise. The banks say bunk. Chase, for example, says such lending is a small part of its overall portfolio, and that the state of its loan portfolio has never been better. "We do not see a need to increase our reserves" against the danger of loans going bad, said Bob Strong, Chase's chief credit officer. 

 Wachovia, of Winston-Salem, N.C., last week said it would write off a $50-million loan to a struggling corporation that it declined to name. Susan Roth, a banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, says that the loan is merely a small slice of a $1-billion syndicated loan. Thus, more banks likely are holding $950-million of the same problem loan. 

 Many analysts warn that, like Wachovia, banks haven't been setting aside sufficient reserves to cover an increase in problems. Mr. Mayo of First Boston says bank reserves are at the lowest level since 1987. 

 Many investors think earnings will suffer, as many banks set aside chunks of their earnings to cover the risk of contingencies. First Union, for example, is "very low in the reserve game," said David Bugajski, analyst at asset manager Invesco. "I don't think they have any wiggle room." 

 First Union, of Charlotte, N.C., declined to comment on its earnings. 

 Thus many investors expect more big banks to announce that they, too, are setting aside reserves. Some investors say more downward earnings revisions are coming. "We're not finished yet," says Frank Barkocy, who runs a bank hedge fund for Keefe Managers. 

 Regardless of how severe any problems may become, investors are moving quickly to re-examine their exposure to banks, which inevitably will lead to moves on the part of bankers to show that they are prepared to weather any storm. 

 Meanwhile, bankers likely will have to take a closer look at each deal. 

 "When you have issues like this, it will increase discipline" in the lending markets, Chase's Mr. Strong says. "We welcome that."

No pork at DuBois

In her June 7 column ("When pork comes back to haunt"), Rachelle Cohen somehow lumps the $1 million for new reference material earmarked for the W.E.B. DuBois Library at UMass-Amherst into an essay on pork. This concept refers to fat in the budget provided by pols to the exclusive benefit of their own districts. Reference materials for the DuBois Library will benefit the entire commonwealth. It is imperative that they be kept up to date if the institution is to maintain its status among university libraries.

If Cohen wants to out the porkers among our legislators, more power to her. But she would be more effective to focus on the issue at hand, not drag down an institution that deserves support from us all.

Housing's a priority

Do we really need another convention center and baseball park? How about putting the money into something that is needed, like affordable housing. With the rents out of control in the city of Boston, how many working-class Bostonians are going to be left to enjoy the multimillion-dollar entertainment centers that were once in their back yards? - John B. Brennan, Brighton

Silber changes view

It is comforting to read that John Silber now finds disagreement with mandatory busing in the assignment of students ("Busing may foster truancy," June 15).

When the busing plan was introduced by Judge W. Arthur Garrity in 1974, Dr. Silber was one of its staunchest advocates. He encouraged Boston residents to obey the orders of the court, and stated that he would be happy to send his own children on the buses but for the fact that Boston University provided him with housing in Brookline and by law he was required to send them to that school system.

It is unfortunate that in 1974 all of the leaders who favored busing were living outside the city and weren't affected by the ruling. Those in the city were ignored.

Some deserve to die

My only refreshing observation associated with the recent murders of a couple in Rhode Island by five degenerate sociopaths was the demand for capital punishment by the father of victim Jason Burgeson ("Providence victims' kin want death penalty," June 14). Though the absence of the death penalty in yet another politically spineless and liberal New England state will likely result in convictions of "life sentences," the slight hope exists that the Justice Department will try these cases federally with death sentences at the forefront.

Supports gay teacher

Our second-grader had David Gaita last year ("First grade teacher tells kids he's gay," June 8). We want you to know that we have only the deepest respect for this gentleman. He is a wonderful teacher and our son still speaks of him with a smile on his face. Mr. Gaita helped bring out our son's sense of humor and sense of self-respect, along with the academic work he did with all his students.

One of the reasons we moved to Newton was because we thought the educational system matched our beliefs. David Gaita's disclosure and the manner in which he handled it with his students only reinforce how we want our children to learn about the people in their lives. We hope his honesty will not result in any action that will disappoint us.

Knutsford gang swap their dream for US dotcom deal

THE Knutsford Five's High Street adventure has ended in a huge anticlimax. Archie Norman, Nick Leslau, Nigel Wray, Julian Richer and Mike Edelson have sold the company to a little known US company, WILink.com, in which Wray already has an interest.  

The five acquired Knutsford, then a cash shell, in November as a vehicle to buy an ailing High Street retailer, with names such as Marks & Spencer or Somerfield widely rumoured.  

Leslau said their desks were 'piled high' with these companies' annual reports.  

The shares rocketed to 270p. To finance the WILink deal, new shares are being issued at just 10p. As the gang paid just 2p they are still in profit.  

The dream turned sour when Norman joined the shadow cabinet and cut down business activities. A bid for Wassall flopped.  

Wray says: 'We did not hype Knutsford at all. This is not what we planned, but when Archie joined the front bench we had to rethink the By Brett Arends strategy.' For investors in Knutsford , now shareholders in online investment bank WILink.com, the ten-for-one share offer at 10p is better than nothing.  

WILink raises capital from online investors, and profits rose 52pc last year to Pounds 1.7m.  

But it is hardly the hoped for High Street glory.  

* Publisher Columbus said deputy chairman Nigel Wray, who sold Pounds 2.6m of  

its shares last August, was not told until September of a DTI inquiry.  

Columbus issued a profit warning in September. Wray said: 'The directors did not think a fact-finding inquiry by the DTI of sufficient importance to tell me.  

'I am irritated that people think I would be stupid enough to sell shares knowing a DTI inquiry had taken place.'  

Wor d s f r om the bosses just eight months ago  

WHAT the Knutsford bosses said in November: Mike Edelson(chairman): 'An outstanding team with proven expertise in the retail, property and leisure sectors. They will have the ability to grow the company both organically and by acquisition.' Nigel Wray: 'Directors will seek to maximise shareholder returns by identifying, acquiring and developing undervalued businesses operating in areas within which the team have amassed a great deal of experience.' Nick Leslau:'The real reasons for doing this (are) acquiring undervalued retail businesses. We could start looking at several hundred million but it has got to be the right deal.' Julian Richer:'Retailing is a very depressed sector and it is clear that in some areas it will be badly hit by the Internet.' Archie Norman: 'My whole track record is making money for people and I don't want to let them down.'

DOW TUMBLES STEEPLY, BUT NASDAQ GAINS -- BLUE-CHIP SHARES HURT BY XEROX  PROFIT WARNING

NEW YORK (AP) - Blue-chip stocks fell steeply Friday after Xerox and a regional banking company issued profit warnings. The warnings resonated throughout the market, sending the Dow industrials to its biggest selloff in two months and reviving fears that rising interest rates will take a toll on corporate profits.

Technology stocks were a lone source of strength, helping the Nasdaq finish with modest gains.

According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 265.52 points to close at 10,449.30. It was the Dow's worst performance since its stunning 617-point drop on April 14.

Friday's decline left the Dow with a loss of 164.76 points for the week.

Broader stock indicators held up much better than the blue-chip Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 14.26 at 1,442.69, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 14.79 at 3,860.53.

Financial stocks pulled the market lower Friday after UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in San Francisco, lowered its second-quarter earnings projection, sending its stock down $8.75 to $19.875.

The warning from UnionBanCal followed similar bad news from Wachovia, a North Carolina banking company. The banks have begun setting aside money to cover bad loans.

A recent research note from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston raised the possibility that many other banks will follow, depressing the entire sector. Mellon fell $3 to $34, and Bank of America dropped $3.813 to $48.25.

Larger banks and brokerages also tumbled. J.P. Morgan was down $6.938 at $119.563, contributing most to the Dow's decline.

''There's not a great fundamental reason for the whole sector to be down so much,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. ''But it's a momentum-driven sector, and some people obviously feel that profits are going to come under pressure.''

An additional sign that profits are being threatened came from Xerox Corp., which fell $4.50 to $20.813 after the office machine maker said its second-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street analysts' estimates.

As has been the case all week, stocks were being pulled in different directions Friday.

Technology stocks showed some scattered strength. Qualcomm was up $4 to $65.438, bouncing higher after two days of steep losses.

And semiconductor company Rambus soared $26.563 to $83.25 after signing a licensing deal with Japanese consumer electronics company Toshiba Corp. The deal will boost Rambus's revenue.

Analysts said many investors are waiting to see if slowing economic growth is hurting corporate profits and whether the Federal Reserve once more raises interest rates.

Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts' estimates.

The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into demand. That's a direct result of the Fed's six inflationfighting rate increases over the last year.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.21 billion shares, well ahead of 988.75 million shares on Thursday.

The so-called ''triple-witching'' day - marking the quarterly expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts - contributed to the higher volume.

The Russell 2000 index was up 1.46 at 513.71.

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Xinhua) - The Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply Friday as two companies warned that they would miss earning expectations in the second quarter. But the technology heavy Nasdaq composite rose moderately. 

 At the close of session, the Dow index fell 265.52 or 2.47 percent at 10,449.30, the biggest drop after its stunning selloff of 617 points on April 14. 

 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.82 at 3,860.56 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14. 27 at 1,464.46. 

 UnionBanCal Corp., a regional bank company, warned that its second-quarter earnings would be lower than projection. The warning, coincided with the similar one from Wachovia, another regional bank in the previous session, sparked fears that higher interest rates would take a toll on corporate profits 

 The whole financial sector was hit heavily. J.P. Morgan fell and Bank of American was also lower. 

 Additional profit warning came from Xerox Corp., making investors much nervous about the prospects of corporate performance under pressure of higher rates. Xerox said its second-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street analysts' estimates. 

 But some scattered strength in the tech sector drove the Nasdaq index higher. Semiconductor company Rambus rose sharply while Qualcomm was up after suffering big losses in the previous two sessions. 

 The NYSE index fell 7.76 at 649.68 and the American Stock Exchange index fell 4.12 at 935.89. But The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.49 at 513.74. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,601 down, 1,306 up and 483 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume increased to 1.21 billion shares from 988.75 million in the previous session.

 Banking Issues Sink Again As UnionBanCal Issues  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- For the second day in a row, investors fled bank stocks after another regional banking company warned that it will miss earnings forecasts. 

 Shares of UnionBanCal Corp. (UB) crumbled after the company said late Thursday that it will set aside an additional $70 million to cover bad loans. That will reduce second-quarter earnings to between 77 cents and 82 cents a share, compared with the 88 cents a share that analysts were expecting in a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Based in San Francisco, UnionBanCal's primary asset is Union Bank of California - the third largest commercial bank in California. Earlier on Thursday, Wachovia Corp., a major Southeast regional bank, started the slide in banking and financial issues after warning that earnings will likely miss Wall Street views in the second quarter and for the year. The bank also said it will take a $200 million charge in the quarter to increase its allowance for loan losses. 

 All of this has heightened fears that higher interest rates, a slowdown in the capital markets and lingering merger-integration problems, will hurt profits at banking companies. In an effort to moderate economic growth and prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Reserve Board has raised short-term interest rates six times in the past year. 

 On Friday, shares of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), FleetBoston Financial Corp. (FBF), Chicago-based Bank One Corp. (ONE), and Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) were all lower. 

 Joining in the sell-off were shares of of financial-service giants Citigroup Inc. (C), J.P. Morgan & Co. (JPM) and American Express Co. (AXP) - all components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

 THE Australian sharemarket opened quietly today, shrugging off US market gains on Wall Street overnight. 

 Most blue chips turned lower, with profit taking in News Corporation, after yesterday's stellar gains, responsible for most of the weakness on the local bourse. 

 At 10.23am, the S&P/ASX200 index was down 2.1 points to 3131.0 points and the all ordinaries 1.4 points softer to 3088.4 points. 

 The all industrials slipped by 7.4 points to 5406.1 points while gains in BHP and Rio Tinto saw the all resources index buck the trend, gaining 8.2 points to 1248.3 points. 

 In New York overnight shares ended mostly higher after being pulled in different directions. 


                        Technology stocks rose after reports that Lucent Technologies was considering spinning off a micro-electronics unit for more than $50 billion.



However financial stocks turned lower after a profit warning from a respected regional banking company.



The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 points to close at 10,714.82 points, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.19 points to 1478.73 points.



The Nasdaq composite index was up 48.33 points at 3845.74 points.



On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the June share price index contract was 1.0 point lower to 3134.0 points at 10.26am on 1639 lots.



This was a three point premium to the S&P/ASx200 and a 45.6 point premium to the all ordinaries.



By 10.32am, the market had turned higher with the S&P/ASX200 gaining 2.8 points to 3135.9 points and the all ordinaries up 3.0 points to 3092.8 points.



"It's early days, but basically we have got some good support for blue chip stocks such as NAB, Rio Tinto and BHP," ABN AMRO head of sales Michael Wills said.



"There are no real themes in terms of sectors, but those industrial stocks are giving the market a push ahead today."



BHP gained 24 cents or 1.30 per cent to 18.70 despite mixed base metal prices on the London Metals Exchange overnight.



Rio Tinto added 55 cents or 2.21 per



cent to $25.45.



Other resource stocks were mixed, with Coal and Allied surging by $1 or 6.67 per cent to $16 but Caltex slipped by 4.3 cents to $2.80 at 10.38am.



In Sydney, the price of gold bullion slumped by $US2.10 an ounce to $US289.45 an ounce.

 WACHOVIA SAYS PROFITS TO FALL BECAUSE OF RISING INTEREST

 NEW YORK -- Southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp. said Thursday its second-quarter and full-year profits would fall short of Wall Street's expectations because of rising interest rates, and the company's shares fell more than 17 percent. 

 The warning spurred fears that higher interest rates would damage profit margins and trigger loan defaults at other regional banks, knocking down those stocks too. 

 The bank, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., also said it plans to take a $200 million loan loss provision in the second quarter. A slowdown in economic growth has squeezed borrowers and boosted the bank's level of problem loans, it said. 

 Rate increases make it expensive for banks themselves to borrow to fund new loans. They also cause people who are hard-pressed to make loan payments to default, known as "credit quality deterioration" in banking lingo. 

 "Asset quality is moving to the front burner for the banking industry," Michael Mayo, an analyst at CS First Boston, said. "The flip side of a slower economy is more asset-quality problems. The special provision was a surprise." 

 Wachovia's stock tumbled $13.13 to $53.06 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. 

 Merrill Lynch bank industry analyst Sandra Flannigan cut her second-quarter estimate on Wachovia to 69 cents a share from $1.33, her 2000 estimate to $4.70 a share from $5.45 and her 2001 estimate to $5.75 a share from $6. 

 Wachovia said the pace of profit growth might slow this year from last year, because higher rates have curbed growth in its capital markets, mortgage and investment businesses, and put pressure on lending income. 

 The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times, or a total of 1.75 percent, since last June to keep inflation at bay during an unprecedented economic boom.  Most banks normally protect themselves against only a 1.25-basis point rate increase over a year. 

 "Notwithstanding the difficult interest rate environment, Wachovia should still achieve good growth in revenue and earnings," Robert McCoy Jr., Wachovia's chief financial officer, said. 

 Debt rating agency Standard & Poor lowered its rating outlook on Wachovia to negative from stable on Thursday after the announcement. 

 Other regional bank shares also fell, though not as much as Wachovia's stock. Shares of BB&T Corp., another bank in Winston- Salem, fell $2 to 26.88, while SunTrust Banks Inc. stock fell $4.31 to $53.88. 

 Wachovia recently entered the Central Florida market with the purchase of a small Winter Park bank, the National Bank of Commerce. 

 It also operates a loan production office in Maitland.

Toronto -- However, the Canadian dollar lost almost half of an American cent in value after Statistics Canada reported that manufacturing shipments fell 2.8 per cent in April -- the second big decline this year -- as vehicle sales decelerated.  

The currency closed at 67.76 cents US, down 0.46 cent.  

A revival of confidence in technology stocks lifted American markets, with the Dow Jones industrial average higher by 26.87 to 10,714.82 and the Nasdaq composite up 48.33 at 3,845.74.  

The Canadian Venture Exchange index slipped 9.91 points to 3,461.57. The junior market's mining group rose 1.3 per cent, but the CDNX oil and gas sector was down 0.7 per cent and the technology group slipped 0.1 per cent.  

In currency dealings, "the Canadian dollar didn't really like the weaker-than-expected manufacturing report," observed Jeff Cheah, an analyst at Standard and Poor's MMS in Toronto.  

Interest-rate worries have eased as softer American economic data increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve "will probably not be raising rates in an aggressive fashion going forward," Cheah noted. At the same time, anxiety is growing about a weakening in the Canadian economy, putting what Cheah regards as unwarranted pressure on the loonie.  

"It's too early to use the manufacturing data as a sign that the economy is slowing too fast," he said. "We still have a very robust outlook for the Canadian economy."  

On the TSE, the March all-time intraday record of 10,176.70 stood through yesterday's trading, which peaked at the close.  

After the March 24 closing peak of 10,052.68, the TSE 300 had slid to an April 14 trough of 8,473.51, then recovered steadily.  

Market giant Nortel Networks powered the TSE's advance -- which now totals just over 20 per cent since the start of 2000.  

Nortel, accounting for about one-quarter of the entire 300 index, rose $5 on the day to $99.40, by far the TSE's most active issue with almost 9.2 million shares traded.  

"The $100 mark for Nortel is important from a technical perspective," Cheah said. "If it breaks that, it could target $120. If you believe in that, the TSE 300 will do well going forward."  

Seagram was the second-most-active Toronto industrial, up $3.10 to $91.50 as traders savoured the prospect of a takeover by Vivendi of France.  

The Nortel-dominated industrial products index rose 3.5 per cent on the day, while the VO-fuelled communications and media group gained 2.1 per cent.  

Eight of the TSE's 14 industry sectors were higher, but the other gains were minor.  

On the losing side, golds were down 1.55 per cent as the New York spot bullion price declined $2 to $289.60 US an ounce.  

And the TSE financial services group declined 1.3 per cent.  

"If you believe that the Fed is coming close to the end of the tightening cycle, that (financial) sector will do well," Cheah said. "People are quite skeptical about the earnings potential from the banking sector; I think they will be surprised on the upside."  

TSE volume was 128.7 million shares worth $3.4 billion, with declines edging advances 550 to 520 and 288 issues unchanged.  

On U.S. markets, traders balanced favourable tech-sector news against a profit warning from Wachovia Corp., a banking company based in North Carolina.  

The Standard and Poor's 500 index rose 8.19 points to 1,478.73.  

Lucent Technologies led tech stocks higher amid reports that the telecommunications equipment maker may spin off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion US.

Stocks end higher on tech rebound

NEW YORK - Stocks ended mostly higher Thursday after being pulled in different directions. Investors had to balance favorable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.06 to 1,478.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 48.33 at 3,845.74.

Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion.

Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.063 to $59.688. Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $3 to $117 after the company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in Japan.

Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep dropoff in wireless equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell $9.062 to $61.438. Chase H&Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for Qualcomm for the fourth quarter and next year. Financial sector stocks took a hit after Wachovia Corp., a respected banking company based in North Carolina, warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest rates. Wachovia shares tumbled $13.125 to $57.063.

Declining issues barely edged out advancing issues on the NYSE, where composite volume came to 1.12 billion shares, nearly unchanged from Wednesday.

The Russell 2000 index was down 3.78 at 509.98.

-- Industrial output increases in May

WASHINGTON, D.C. - A burst in output at utilities helped send industrial production up in May. Despite the unexpected rise, analysts still felt the economy was showing signs of slowing.

The Federal Reserve reported Thursday that industrial production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a solid 0.4 percent last month, surprising economists who were predicting output would decline.

Warmer-than-normal weather in May boosted output at gas and electric utilities 1.4 percent, the second straight month where output rose sharply.

Output in the manufacturing sector grew 0.3 percent last month with much of the gain coming from increased production of computers and other business equipment. However, production of consumer goods, including cars and household appliances, fell.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Even though his personal fortune shrank by a third this past year, the $60 billion bankroll of Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates still makes him the world's richest man, according to Forbes magazine's rankings. 

 The world's billionaires' club expanded this year to 482, pushing the combined wealth of the richest 200 working people in the world upward of $1.1 trillion - 17 more people and a $100 billion increase from 1999, the magazine reported Thursday. The rankings appear in the July 3 issue of Forbes, which reaches newsstands Friday. 

 The 14th annual list of the working rich ranks Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison as the world's second-richest man with $47 billion, followed by Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen at $28 billion.

 ATLANTA (AP) - Coca-Cola Co. criticized a new racial discrimination lawsuit filed against the soft-drink giant, saying it was designed to derail a tentative settlement involving a similar discrimination suit. 

 The beverage giant has struggled to maintain its once-sterling image in the past few years, and Wednesday's settlement with black employees was seen as confirmation that new chairman Douglas Daft was fixing many of the public relations problems he inherited. 

 But hours after Coke reached the tentative agreement, it learned that Johnnie Cochran Jr. - who defended O.J. Simpson - and another lawyer had filed another race-discrimination lawsuit, this one alleging that black women had been passed over for promotion, paid less than their white colleagues and forced to do demeaning jobs such as cleaning up after their bosses ate lunch.

 WASHINGTON (AP) - So much for the "Baby" Bells. 

 The anticipated merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE will create a telephone powerhouse with the most local lines and wireless customers in the nation. Together, the two phone giants will own 63 million U.S. phone lines, have a presence in more than 30 states and serve more than 25 million wireless customers. 

 The deal is still awaiting final clearance from the Federal Communications Commission. 

 A majority of the commissioners there have tentatively signed off on the deal, according to sources familiar with the process. But it won't be formally approved until all commissioners have cast their vote and the agency issues a final decision, which could come before the weekend.

 NEW YORK (AP) - AT&T Corp. finalized its acquisition of MediaOne Group on Thursday, completing the long-distance phone company's transformation into the nation's largest provider of cable TV and high-speed Internet services. 

 The deal, costing AT&T about $44 billion in cash and stock, was struck slightly more than a year ago after a bidding war with Comcast Corp., a rival cable company that MediaOne had agreed to merge with originally. 

 The winning bid by AT&T, which just months earlier had acquired the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc., drew intense scrutiny from federal regulators who worried that the former telephone monopoly might soon monopolize the growing market for providing Internet services over cable TV lines.

 WASHINGTON (AP) - Major content providers - and the director of the federal copyright office - argued Thursday that Internet companies should not be eligible for the special licenses that satellite and cable companies have to carry broadcast programming. 

 But Web businesses, testifying at a congressional hearing, said this puts them on an uneven playing field and singles out their technology as different from others. 

 Current law enables cable operators and satellite companies to get special blanket licenses so they can retransmit broadcast programming without getting individual consent from each company. They then pay a portion of their revenues into a fund which is distributed to the individual copyright holders.

 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Southern California will decide Friday whether nearly 11,000 transit buses and garbage trucks must convert to cleaner-burning alternative fuels - a move that could lead to similar requirements across the country. 

 Under the plan, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, every new vehicle purchased by public fleet operators will have to run on alternative fuels: natural gas, methanol, electricity or fuel cells. . The higher cost and limited availability of the fuels have some worried, though. And the petroleum industry said there should be a place for cleaner-burning diesel in the new rules.

 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Southern California will decide Friday whether nearly 11,000 transit buses and garbage trucks must convert to cleaner-burning alternative fuels - a move that could lead to similar requirements across the country. 

 Under the plan, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, every new vehicle purchased by public fleet operators will have to run on alternative fuels: natural gas, methanol, electricity or fuel cells. 

 Advocates say it will give a boost to the alternative-fuel industry and force automakers to build more vehicles operating on such fuel. The higher cost and limited availability of the fuels have some worried, though. And the petroleum industry said there should be a place for cleaner-burning diesel in the new rules.

 Bebe Stores Inc., a women's clothing chain whose stock has lost 74% of its value this year, said Tuesday that it expects its fiscal fourth-quarter profit to be hurt by a decline in same-store sales this month. 

 Bebe expects sales at stores open at least a year to fall in the "high teens" to 20% range for June, said Chief Financial Officer Blair Lambert. 

 The Brisbane, Calif.-based firm declined to say what it expects to earn in its fiscal fourth quarter, ending this month. The average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial is 18 cents a share. 

 On Tuesday, shares of Bebe fell 88 cents to close at $6.88 on Nasdaq.

 Tech Stock Focus: Citrix  Profit Warning  Highlights Growing Pains --- Company Predicts Sales-Channel Problems Will Hurt Earnings

 Citrix Systems Inc.'s recent profit warning highlights the company's growing pains. 

 The software company, in a significant stumble, predicted that unexpected problems in its sales channels will cause second-quarter profit to be about half what Wall Street expected. 

 The warning caused shares of the company to plunge by 46% Monday, knocking more than $3.5 billion off Citrix's market value. In early Tuesday trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market the shares were up 5.6%, or $1.25, to $23.50. 

 Citrix began to feel investor jitters Thursday and Friday. The stock, which traded above $122 in March before the stock-market sell-off, fell 31% over the two trading sessions last week after the company's chief financial officer missed an investor conference and an analyst downgraded the company's stock. 

 Still, the downdraft comes as a jolt to people who had been following the company, which has been on a three-year tear because of its early lead in a broad-industry trend. Citrix makes software that allows personal-computer software, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Office suite, to be run on server computers connected to networks. That means those programs can be used with desktop machines that don't have Microsoft's Windows operating system, including simple terminals and Macintosh systems from Apple Computer Inc. 

 But Citrix, which is expected to hit about $500 million in sales this year, is going through some growing pains in how it sells its products. 

 The company cited three main problems. First, Citrix historically booked revenue when it shipped boxed copies of its programs to distributors, who then resell the product. The new trend is for corporate customers to buy a single software disk along with a license to make as many copies as they need. Citrix then gets an accounting at the end of each quarter for the number of copies each customer used. 

 Mark Templeton, Citrix's chief executive officer, said customers began shifting to that so-called paper license scheme more quickly than expected during the quarter. That change leaves distributors with too many copies of the boxed software, causing them to reduce orders. Though Citrix should ultimately end up with the same amount of revenue, the change causes delays and costs for liquidating inventory. 

 The second issue was delays in landing big sales to large corporations, which the company is discovering may take 12 months to close rather than its customary 90 days. Citrix expected to land about 20 such corporate sales in the period; it now expects to complete about 10, Mr. Templeton said. 

 Third, Citrix is finding the process of setting up sales channels in Asia slower than expected, Mr. Templeton said. The three problems should continue to be felt in the third quarter as well, he said, though he predicted that sales should rise 10% in that period over the second quarter.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- When Alan Greenspan opens his mouth, the Street listens. Especially when he does so just two weeks before the Federal Open Market Committee meets. So, when the mighty Fed head spoke on Tuesday to the New York Association for Business Economics, his words resonated far and wide. But Greenspan didn't discuss interest rate hikes. He had another topic on the brain: productivity. 

 Yes, tech-fueled productivity is good news all around. Higher productivity has allowed companies to pay employees higher salaries without feeling the pinch in their operating costs. We're talking about bigger bonuses and more widgets. 

 That's the good news. The bad news is that consumer spending is slowing; we heard this week that retail sales slumped for the second month in a row. Of course, declining sales mean lower revenue growth for many companies. 

 Which is why we want to turn to the bottom line - old-fashioned profits, squeezed by cost-cutting or other means. The old-school profit margin metric is once again in vogue among the investing savvy. Take, for example, Procter & Gamble's (PG) recent nosedive. Last week, the consumer-products giant stunned the Street with a serious earnings warning. P&G's enfeebling flaw was its focus on sales in new areas at the expense of profit margins. "In hindsight, it's clear we changed too much, too fast," said the newly elected Chief Executive A.G. Lafley in Thursday's press release. "As a result, we didn't make enough tough choices to balance top- and bottom-line growth." 

 The search for solid businesses that don't face P&G's precarious position is at the heart of this week's screen. In our margin-growth recipe, we selected companies with growing profits and growing margins - which means growing sales aren't quite as crucial. We think these increasingly efficient organizations are better off as consumer spending slows. 

 But there's more to an equity investment than its underlying profit growth. We also hunted for bargains. Despite recovering from their recent troughs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still 10% off its Jan. 14 high and the Nasdaq is still 26% off its March 10 high. There are some discounts to be had in both Old and New Economy stocks. 

 In order to grab for both growth and value at the same time, we use something called the PEG ratio - the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) divided by the projected long-term growth rate. Of course, the plain old P/E is a better-known valuation yardstick, but it doesn't take future growth into account. One company with a high P/E might grow 20% for the next few years while another with a lower P/E might only grow 10%. How do they compare? The stock of the company with 20% growth is poised to become more valuable, but the slower poke might be no bargain. The PEG is an attempt to compare the valuations of slow- and fast-growing companies side by side. Got it? 

 So the PEG ratio helps pick out relatively conservative growth plays. To exclude the deadbeats, we insisted on long-term growth of at least 10%. After all, in our tech-fueled productivity boom, any company not growing is probably doing something wrong. We asked for a recent positive earnings revision and limited indebtedness to separate the wheat from the chaff in our screen results. 

 Among the 44 companies fit enough to jump through our many hoops, we were surprised to see Boeing (BA), the airline giant that used to rule Seattle - until Redmond's Microsoft (MSFT) shook up the region. 

 The largest aerospace company in the world has a long-term earnings growth rate of nearly 17%, which was about average for our screen's results. And we liked that, since the faster growing companies - like Novellus (NVLS), Advanced Energy Industries (AEIS) and Express Scripts (ESRX) - bear the burden of higher expectations. Meanwhile, the slower growing ones - like Cooper Industries (CBE) and Dime Bancorp (DME) - are, well, growing slower. 

 Boeing is looking sleeker these days. And for the first time since the Reagan-Bush era, defense spending is actually poised to grow. (Boeing designs defense systems.) On top of that, Boeing may be well-positioned to benefit from the airline industry's consolidation. That's because Boeing, which alone controls about half the U.S. commercial-plane market, supplies many of the biggest airlines. Its rival Airbus may feel the squeeze. 

 But Boeing's business still doesn't boom as it did in its heyday. So the company has been on a diet lately. Barring the $3.75 billion binge of acquiring Hughes' (GMH) space and communications business, the cash-rich company has vowed to slim down operating costs and boost profits. Already, both net and operating margins are fatter than their five-year averages and fatter than those of the company's smaller rivals. That's fuel for share growth. 

 With retail and home sales slowing, it was no surprise to see a slew of home-improvement companies wind up on our list of bargains. Paint company Sherwin-Williams (SHW), appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR), hardware retailer Lowes (LOW) and bedding chain Linens N Things (LIN) - all members of our screen results - are not as hot as they used to be. Here, the big risk is that analysts' growth projections haven't been lowered enough to reflect the emerging consumer caution. 

 But another home-related retailer, Pier 1 (PIR), caught our eye. It stuck out because there's no doubt Pier 1's expectations have been lowered. (And how. Its price peaked back in 1998.) 

 But it seems expectations have been lowered too far. On Tuesday, Pier 1 beat Street estimates by posting earnings of 17 cents a share - compared to 13 cents a year ago. After the announcement, analysts boosted their annual estimates, bringing the consensus a penny higher for this fiscal year and next. Gross margins improved by 0.10 percentage point this quarter. 

 In the past, Pier 1 was said to have grown too fast for its own good. Its current cautious focus on improving margins is now about right for the times. With interest rate concerns continuing throughout the summer, cost-cutting looks like an antidote to P&G-type swoons.

 JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS:  For more on what stocks may be moving on Wall Street, let`s check in with Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange.  She has details of some bad  news that is hitting a few companies today, and I changed the wording on the Ts of a waste company who says its future is in the - they had written something derogatory - I said "container."  Does that work? 

 (LAUGHTER) 

 It`s future is in the container? 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Depends on what kind of container you`re talking about, Jack. 

 CAFFERTY:  Well, I`m trying to, you know, clean it up a little; it`s a family show. 

 ROMANS:  Kleen it up first. 

 CAFFERTY:  Right, that was it. 

 ROMANS:  Safety-Kleen (URL: http://www.safety-kleen.com/) has filed for bankruptcy, Jack, Chapter 11.  If you look at a chart of this stock, ouch, it`s down 94, 95 percent so far this year.  Somewhere up near 20 bucks a share, down to oh just a couple of bucks a share when you look at Safety-Kleen shares.  It`s really been a rough year for this stock. It`s listing, you can see, they`re down 96.4 percent to be exact.  Yes, it`s had a little bit of trouble - it`s a South Carolina-based company; it`s listed more than $4.4 billion in assets, and $3.1 billion in debts, in its Chapter 11 Petition filed in Wilmington, Delaware.  This is among the largest Chapter 11 cases filed so far this year, for US companies. SK is  the ticker symbol; we`ll watch it. But it has filed for bankruptcy.  So if you have been watching Safety-Kleen and hoping for a bounceback or hoping for some sort of recovery from these weakened levels, it does not look so good. 

 Another stock to watch today: Boise Cascade (URL: http://www.bc.com/) , BCC.  This is a forest products giant.  Interesting about this company, its profit warning on Friday has named as part of the problem is building products unit, and it said that rising interest rates and easing residential home construction combined with a continued strong industry production that led to sharply lower prices for lumber and structural panels, and this is going to be a problem for the company. 

 Rising interest rates, again, playing out in the profit sheet of a big American company.  And the fact that it noted easing residential home construction.  That is interesting too because rising interest rates eating into home purchases and home sales is something that  folks have been looking for signs of all year.  And you are hearing Boise Cascade talk about it.  So another profit warning in the week last week. 

 They had a flurry of profit warnings, from everything from Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) to EDS (URL: http://www.eds.com/) to Boise Cascade.  Look at this stock, it`s down 35.5 percent over the past 52 weeks.  It had a bit of a pullback last week, so we`ll be closely watching that one as well. 

 And finally, American General (URL: http://www.agc.com/) , this an interesting story as well, the ticker is AGC, this is a company that Florida has been authorized to negotiate a settlement with this company regarding the sale of life insurance policies  where the premiums were higher for about 350,000 of these policies, based on race.  And this company has admitted to that, and now Florida will be negotiating a settlement for other companies, or at least is expected today to announce that they will be negotiating a settlement for other states as well.  Just one company, American General Corp.  And they will be beginning that settlement process likely today so watch that one as well today and see how it fares; it`s really trading within the middle of its 52-week trading range, so it is not trading near a 52-week low but it is off of its 52-week high as well. 

 So overall here today, after a mixed week last week, the Dow closing down 54 points; ending down for the week as well.  We`ve got a lot of data that comes up later this week.  We have got people a little bit on alert on edge about potential profit warnings and we`re starting to see more companies start to report today. 

 Solectron (URL: http://www.solectron.com/) ; 

 Heinz (URL: http://www.heinz.com/) this week; 

 we get some others  as well, including Best Buy (URL: http://www.bestbuy.com/) . 

 And then heading into July 10, the official beginning of the next reporting season, we`ll see more and more companies start to report as we get closer to this gradual buildup in the pre-announcement season as well, Jack.  So, watch the corporate headlines. 

 Back to you. 

 CAFFERTY:  Christine, that was a pretty good inflation report.  Sasha and I were talking about this earlier on Friday; came in lower-than-expected, wholesale inflation was flat.  And yet the Dow kind of went the other way.  What were you hearing down there on Friday; why didn`t the market do better? 

 ROMANS:  It`s interesting; I have been hearing that this is now a growth story, not an inflation story.  And folks want to see more corroborating evidence that growth is slowing down; but, they don`t want to see growth, they don`t want to see the economy hitting a wall, they want to see a soft landing.  So unless there is some scary stuff in these inflation numbers, folks are telling me that the inflation  - these numbers, isn`t really the story. 

 CAFFERTY:  So inflation is OK, but now they will worry about something else. 

 ROMANS:  Exactly. 

 CAFFERTY:  I mean it`s like you can`t make `em happy, you know what I mean? 

 ROMANS:  Never.

 In 1971 Lionel Trilling gave a talk at Purdue University on the subject of his work as a critic. He spoke autobiographically, which was not his custom. His notes for the occasion dwell at length on his experience as an undergraduate at Columbia College in the 1920s. "The great word in the college was INTELLIGENCE," he wrote. 

  "An eminent teacher of ours, John Erskine, provided a kind of slogan by the title he gave to an essay of his which, chiefly through its title, gained a kind of fame: THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO BE INTELLIGENT." Trilling must have startled his audience when he submitted that as a young man, "I did not count myself among those who were intelligent." Instead "I was intuitive; and I rather prided myself on a quality that went by the name of subtlety." He did not aspire to intelligence, he explained, because it was not a quality that was required of a novelist, and he aspired to be a novelist, a calling that required "only a quick eye for behavior and motive and a feeling heart." In Trilling's criticism, certainly, there is no trace of this depleted conception of the novel. In 1947 he gave his own demonstration of the utility of "intelligence" for the writer of fiction in his novel "The Middle of the Journey," which shrewdly examined the fideist mentality of American communism and recorded the disfigurements that ideology visits upon experience. (It included a portrait of Whittaker Chambers as George Eliot might have drawn him.) It is hard to imagine a waking moment in Trilling's life in which he was not consecrated to the intellect and to its cause. He had almost no higher term of approbation than to call something or someone "exigent" and "strenuous." But youth is unexigent and unstrenuous. In any event, Trilling's early indifference to intellectuality did not last long. (As he later remarked fondly about Elliot Cohen, "he never played the game of being young.") And so he recalled that he was soon "seduced into bucking to be intelligent by the assumption which was prepotent in Columbia College--that intelligence was connected with literature, that it was advanced by literature." It must be said that Trilling's professor did not always live up to his own maxim. John Erskine's works included the novels "Galahad: Enough of His Life to Explain His Reputation" and "Penelope's Man: The Homing Instinct" and a particularly witless essay in misogyny called "The Influence of Leon Wieseltier is literary editor of The New Republic and the author, most recently, of "Kaddish." His essay will appear as the introduction to "The Moral Obligation To Be Intelligent." Women--And Its Cure." (It concludes with a coarse colloquium among Socrates, Diogenes, Herodotus, Pericles, Casanova and Andre Chenier.) But still Erskine earned a place in the history of the humanities in America. A scholar of the English literature of the Renaissance, he created the General Honors course at Columbia, the immersion in great books that eventually transformed undergraduate education in America. "We were assigned nothing else but the great books themselves," Trilling recalled in his seminar at Purdue, "confronting them as best we could without the mediation of ancillary works." The excitement of a canon, of this canon: There was a time when there was such an excitement, though Trilling typically animadverted that the course "was not exigent enough." In 1961, in Partisan Review, he complained famously of the complacence, the "delighted glibness" with which his own students at Columbia experienced, and thereby betrayed, their collision with the literary monuments of modernity. (Trilling was appointed an instructor in the English department at Columbia in 1931, and a few years later he completed the dissertation on Matthew Arnold that became his first book in 1939. Also in 1939, Nicholas Murray Butler, the president of the university, invoked his "summer powers" to appoint Trilling an assistant professor of English and the first Jew in the department to become a member of the Columbia faculty. Trilling taught at Columbia until his death in 1975. In a life without external incident, he became an authority on internal incident.) "The Moral Obligation To Be Intelligent" had appeared in The Hibbert Journal in 1914. "The disposition to consider intelligence a peril," Erskine began, "is an old Anglo-Saxon inheritance." The grounds of this hoary demotion of the mind were moral, religious and emotional--this "assumption that a choice must be made between goodness and intelligence; that stupidity is first cousin to moral conduct, and cleverness the first step into mischief; that reason and God are not on good terms with each other; that the heart and the mind are rival buckets in the well of truth, inexorably balanced--full mind, starved heart--stout heart, weak head." The aim of Erskine's manifesto was to end "the peculiar warfare between character and intellect." Conscience, in his account, originated not in the English tradition but in the German tradition, and not in the mind but in the will. Yet it was in America that the party of the intellect was formed. Americans, Erskine proclaimed, were "confederated in a Greek love of knowledge, in a Greek assurance that sin and misery are the fruit of ignorance." Americans momentously understood that "if you want to get out of prison, what you need is the key to the lock [and] if you cannot get that, have courage and steadfastness." Social and economic problems were not problems of will, they were problems of mind. Erskine's essay was not immune, clearly, to the racialist idiosyncrasies of its time, and its survey of anti-intellectualism in English literature (in the English novel especially) was sorely inadequate. Its construction of mental life in America was somewhat imbued with the new enthusiasm for expertise, with the technocratic inflection of the intellectual vocation. Yet finally Erskine extolled intelligence for more than its utility. Shifting rather fitfully from the pragmatic mood to the transcendental mood, he finished his essay with the vatic announcement that "we really seek intelligence not for the answers it may suggest to the problems of life, but because we believe it is life--not for the aid in making the will of God prevail, but because we believe it is the will of God. We love it, as we love virtue, for its own sake, and we believe it is only virtue's other and more precise name." This is an exalted jumble, and there is much in it from which Trilling would have recoiled--its supernaturalism in particular, though he allowed that there are sublimities of character and understanding that may not be competently captured by an exclusively naturalistic vocabulary. (Of Eliot's supernaturalism, Trilling wrote, "I have spoken of it with respect because it suggests elements which a rational and naturalistic philosophy, to be adequate, must encompass.") And Trilling emphatically believed that "the problems of life" must indeed be brought before the mind, though not for the purpose of eliciting anything so simple and so heartening as "answers." The elements of Erskine's creed to which Trilling must have kindled, and to which he hewed in all his criticism, were its avowal of the intrinsic worth of the mind, and its affiliation of the mental with the moral. The influence of the teacher upon the student is unmistakable, for example, in a withering commentary on Dreiser that Trilling wrote in 1946: "But with us it is always too late for mind, yet never too late for honest stupidity; always a little too late for understanding, never too late for righteous, bewildered wrath; always too late for thought, never too late for naive moralizing." Trilling never encountered a good reason to postpone thinking, though he lived in an age when such reasons were regularly and popularly advanced, in the forms of totalistic philosophies and totalistic politics. He was one of the most formidable critics of totalism that his dogmatic and pitiless century produced. Trilling was a distinguished enemy of his time. There was never just one thing, in his work: no single lock, no single key. He was mentally indefatigable; there Please see Page 4 Continued from Page 3 was order in his writing, but there was no repose. This made Trilling an exceedingly unmoralistic moralist. His interest in virtue included also an interest in a doubting regard of the prevailing notions of virtue. He exemplified the intellectual vocation not least by his impiety about it. He bore down on people like himself--on the infamous "we" in his essays--almost to the point of provincialism. But this was the cheerless and thankless virtue of the true intellectual: to disquiet his own side, to "unmask the unmaskers," to "dissent from the orthodoxies of dissent." The intellectual life, if it is genuine, is a life of strain. The business of the intellectual is the stringency business. Those were Trilling's onerous instructions. A half century later, it is impossible to read the golden preface to "The Liberal Imagination," the influential collection of essays that he published in 1950--"it has for some time seemed to me that a criticism which has at heart the interests of liberalism might find its most useful work not in confirming liberalism in its sense of general rightness but rather in putting under some degree of pressure the liberal ideas and assumptions of the present time"--and not to feel the sting. There is a lasting profit in Trilling's sting. In his polemic against the undiscomfited progressivism of the 1930s and 1940s lies a lesson about the relationship of honesty to love. He deplored ease more than he deplored error. He prized fearlessness more than he prized happiness. Innocence bored him; purity he refused to credit; sanctity was more than he wished to grasp. His gospel was complexity--or as he put it, "variousness, possibility, complexity, and difficulty." This was not a theory or a method. It was a cast of mind and a pedagogical scruple. In Trilling's hands, nuance was an instrument of clarification, not an instrument of equivocation. This made his work exhilarating and exasperating. He was always warning about appearances and worrying that a life without illusions was itself an illusion. Trilling cherished the modern novel for its worldliness, for its ability to provide an accurate picture of the problem of reality and appearance in modern life. The subject of the novel was society, or complication. A multiplicity of classes had engendered a multiplicity of meanings, Trilling contended, so that certainty was no longer possible, and appearances, in the form of manners, acquired a new prestige as a condition of knowledge; and of these appearances the novel was made. Since the novel was social, it was epistemological. It was the art that was born when the settled sense of reality died. Trilling's criticism was a long search for the sense of reality and a long tribute to it. "When, generations from now, the historian of our time undertakes to describe the assumptions of our culture, he will surely discover that the word 'reality' is of central importance in his understanding of us." Trilling deeply resented the obscurantist uses of realism in American culture, "the chronic American belief that there exists an opposition between reality and mind and that one must enlist oneself in the party of reality." But he was not quite a party man, philosophically or politically. He inhabited an essentially inharmonious world. He was enough of an idealist not to mistake reality for mind, but not so much of an idealist that he mistook mind for reality. He was, instead, a scholar of the relation. Trilling took the sense of reality to be one of the most precious attainments of the mind and also one of the most unlikely. "Let us not deceive ourselves," he declared at the end of an introduction to "Anna Karenina" in 1951. "To comprehend unconditioned spirit is not so very hard, but there is no knowledge rarer than the understanding of spirit as it exists in the inescapable conditions which the actual and the trivial make for it." Trilling ardently defended William Dean Howells for devoting many chapters of a novel to its hero's hunt for an apartment. In this way, he argued, the writer had acknowledged "the actuality of the conditioned, the literality of matter." And "to lose this is to lose not a material fact but a spiritual one, for it is a fact of spirit that it must exist in a world which requires it to engage in so dispiriting an occupation as hunting for a house." Trilling was not a materialist, but he was not an escapist. The objective of his work as a critic was a lucid apprehension of the thick tangle of freedom and necessity. He had no doubt that the tangle was final, that the poles of existence would never part. But lucidity--the mixture of clarity and courage that Camus in particular promoted into a new stoical ideal--was not all that Trilling meant by "mind." When he spoke of mind, he was speaking of reason. To be sure, he might not have been delighted by the characterization of his point of regard as rationalism. The career of rationalism in modern culture did not exactly dazzle him. "To be rational, to be reasonable, is a good thing, but when we say of a thinker that he is committed to rationalism, we mean to convey a pejorative judgment. It expresses our sense that he conceives of the universe and man in a simplistic way, and often it suggests that his thought proceeds on the assumption that there is a close analogy to be drawn between man and a machine." The modern misadventures of reason were many: the reason of the utilitarians and their liberal heirs had desiccated the spirit, but the Reason of the Hegelians and their totalitarian heirs had killed it. Historically, reason had often behaved like the enemy of imagination and the enemy of decency. It had given absolution to middlebrows and murderers. And the enemies of reason repelled Trilling as completely as some of reason's friends. His later writings in particular were a sustained assault upon "the contemporary ideology of irrationalism," a rubric of intellectual irresponsibility under which he included the sins of "intuition, inspiration, revelation; the annihilation of selfhood--perhaps through contemplation, but also through ecstasy and the various forms of intoxication; violence; madness"; in a word, the sins of immediacy. In 1972, in "Sincerity and Authenticity," he traced the history of "the disintegrated consciousness" from Diderot and Hegel to Marcuse and Laing. Trilling inquired frequently and penetratingly into the nonethical or anti-ethical energies in modern literature. He acknowledged the vitality of what he famously called "the adversary culture," and he was himself the most forceful (and the most wry) adversary of the adversary culture. The important point is that Trilling's fascination with unreason followed strictly from his commitment to reason. In this respect he belonged to the most superb line of modern rationalism, to the sturdy, disabused company of Freud and Mann (who once remarked, against Nietzsche, that the world is never suffering from a surfeit of reason) and Isaiah Berlin. These were the rationalists with night vision. When Trilling cautioned that "we must be aware of the dangers which lie in our most generous wishes," when he detected traces of evil in the good and traces of good in the evil, he was practicing this night vision. These rationalists trained reason's gaze upon its contrary, and they held fast to the study of disorder until reason no longer flinched. They rejected the day vision, the flinching rationalism, of the Enlightenment, for which the rational was the real, or at least all the real that reason would consent to recognize. Instead they preached rationalism after romanticism. For the rational is plainly not the real; and before the reality of the irrational, reason's scorn will not suffice. These rationalists demanded of reason what Milton demanded of virtue, that it not be a youngling in the contemplation of evil. (The greatest of the rationalists with night vision was Primo Levi, who actually lived the night.) Trilling, too, was undeceived about the immunity of the world to mind; but it was this sobering knowledge of the world's punishing way with human purposes --Trilling called this knowledge "moral realism"--that gave to mind its muscle and its magnanimity, its power to withstand its own weakness and not be put to flight by what it could not master. In a review of "The Liberal Imagination" that R.P. Blackmur later collected among his "essays in solicitude and critique," he patronizingly described Trilling as "an administrator of the affairs of the mind" and as "a liberal humanist in hard straits" as if there were no glory in liberal humanism and the straits were not hard. Trilling "has cut down on tykish impulses and wild insights," Blackmur observed, more in critique than in solicitude. "The trouble is that his masters, Arnold and Freud, both extremists in thought, make him think too much." To the charge of thinking too much, Trilling would have gladly pleaded guilty; but he would have demanded to know how it was possible to think too much about problems whose solutions can be discovered only by means of reflection. He understood, of course, that not all of life's problems are of that kind. In the notes for his autobiographical lecture, he reminisced about "the rational life" of the 1930s and 1940s: "Every aspect of existence was touched by ideas, or the simulacra of ideas. Not only politics, but child-rearing, the sexual life, the life of the psyche, the innermost part of existence was subject to ideation." The mordancy of his reminiscence is evident. The "ideation" of which Trilling speaks in this passage is a little comic, almost a deformation. And many of the "New York intellectuals"--Trilling's colleagues in the great mid-century metropolitan experiment in balancing the claims of Marxism and modernism, Europe and America, alienation and solidarity, justice and beauty--were in this way deformed. In their delegitimation of Stalinism and in their divorce of the criticism of literature from the criticism of politics, they made themselves genuinely indispensable to the intellectual history of their country; but they often exaggerated the transparency of the world to their minds, and in their worship of "ideas" they often failed to observe the difference between an idea and an opinion. Trilling was not noisy in the New York manner. For this reason, he wrote the most lasting prose of any of the New Yorkers. His writing is precious not least for its patience. The imperturbability of his style was the consequence of a pained and permanent sense of the opacity of life. The dialectical toil of his essays was Trilling's way of walking diligently before what he could not promptly and cleverly understand. About one thing, then, Blackmur was right. Trilling was indeed an extremist in thought, or an extremist for thought. This marked his limitation as a critic of literature. He was singularly unstimulated by form and by the machinery of beauty. (He wrote about Keats as if Keats, too, was an intellectual.) He did not read to be ravished. He was exercised more by "the moral imagination" than by the imagination. And he grew increasingly suspicious of art. (He became especially absorbed, in his later years, by Rousseau's letter to d'Alembert.) In works of literature Trilling found mainly the records of concepts and sentiments and values. "For our time the most effective agent of the moral imagination has been the novel of the last two hundred years. It was never, either aesthetically or morally, a perfect form and its faults and failures can quickly be enumerated. But its greatness and its practical usefulness lay in its unremitting work of involving the reader himself in the moral life, inviting him to put his own motives under examination, suggesting that reality is not as his conventional education has led him to see it. . . ." In this regard, Trilling was a very unliterary literary critic. His conception of his critical duty was less professional and less playful--and bigger. The novels and the poems that he pondered were documents for a moral history of his culture. Finally he was a historian of morality working with literary materials, and the exquisiteness of the result is most perfectly on display in the great essay on "The Princess Casamassima." So there is indeed nothing tykish or wild here. There is instead a climate of philosophy and deferred felicity, of renunciation and unceasing examination. There are ironies, but not shabby ones. And art, too, falls under the moral obligation to be intelligent. At the time of his death, Trilling was working on an essay about Jane Austen. He was a little baffled by the apparent revival of the writer's reputation among his students--the uprisings at Columbia and elsewhere in 1968 were still fresh in memory--and he dared to hope that "in reading about the conduct of other people as presented by a writer highly endowed with moral imagination and in consenting to see this conduct as relevant to their own, they had undertaken an activity which humanism holds precious, in that it redeems the individual from moral torpor." Trilling left the essay unfinished, though it is clear from the fragment that remains that the piece was conceived as an admonition against aesthetic ideals of life. His partisan devotion to the critical intellect, to the dignity of dialectic, was the subject of the very last sentence that he wrote: "It is, I think, open to us to believe that our alternations of view on this matter of life seeking to approximate art are not a mere display of cultural indecisiveness but, rather, that they constitute a dialectic, with all the dignity that inheres in that word. . . ." And still inheres in it, if Lionel Trilling's teaching still lives.

 The Treasury said a congressional commission proposal that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund restrict lending to poor countries would damage U.S. interests and rob the global lenders of their ability to respond to crises. In a 45-page response to the recommendations for a radical reform of lending agencies the Treasury said it disagreed with the bulk of the commission's reform prescriptions, which would effectively cut the number of countries eligible for international help. 

 Safety-Kleen, the nation's largest hazardous waste handler, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking time to reorganize and pay its debts. The filing seeks to protect Safety-Kleen and 73 of its U.S. subsidiaries from creditors. The company said it filed with the support of its top-tier lenders. 

 Allstate said it will reimburse some Oklahoma policyholders who had home replacement-cost guarantees and roof-surfacing coverage deleted from their homeowner policies. The payments are part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed in federal court in Oklahoma. Allstate didn't disclose how many policyholders were involved or how much the settlement would cost. 

 Chase Manhattan shares fell $3.18 3/4, to $73.31 1/4, after J.P. Morgan cut second-quarter earnings estimates for the second-largest U.S. bank from $1.29 to $1.05 a share. Morgan analyst Catherine Murray said Chase would have trouble cutting expenses as it builds its investment banking business, and may lose money from its venture capital investments. 

 Shares of Electronic Data Systems, which competes with IBM for contracts to run corporate computer systems, tumbled 26 percent, the biggest drop ever, after it said second-quarter sales will be lower than expected. EDS shares fell $14.81 1/4, to $43, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock fell 8.5 percent Thursday and has slipped 36 percent this year. Changes in the organization of the sales force are hurting revenue growth at EDS; the warning is a setback for chief executive Dick Brown, who took over last year and has slashed more than 8,000 jobs and pared management in an effort to jump-start sales and profit growth. 

 Mylan Laboratories stock fell 27 percent after it said fiscal first-quarter profit will be 14 cents to 17 cents a share, well short of the 31 cents predicted by analysts. It blamed the decrease on price cuts amid increased competition in generic drugs such as its anti-anxiety medicine Lorazepam. It also said it could not get enough of the blood-pressure drug nifedipine from Pfizer, which sells it under the name Procardia. 

 Bon-Ton Stores, which runs 72 department stores in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and other eastern states, said it will cut 187 jobs, or about 2 percent of its staff, to reduce costs. 

 Commercial and industrial loans at U.S. commercial banks fell $1.1 billion in the week ended May 31, to $1.062 trillion, the Federal Reserve said. During the previous week, commercial and industrial lending, considered a gauge of business activity, also fell $1.1 billion. Over the past four weeks, commercial and industrial loans have risen $4.4 billion. The Fed also reported that commercial and industrial loans at large banks rose to a seasonally adjusted $626 billion in the latest reporting period from $624.8 billion the previous week. 

 LOCAL BUSINESS 

 Kaiser Group International filed for bankruptcy protection and sold two units after an internal effort to revive the struggling engineering and construction company failed. Fairfax-based Kaiser listed $82.4 million in assets and $146.8 million in debts in its Chapter 11 petition filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Kaiser's engineering units were sold to Earth Tech and the Hatch Group for $40 million. 

 Radio One, a Lanham-based broadcaster serving black audiences, said it bought three Indianapolis FM stations from Shirk and IBL for about $40 million in cash and stock, bringing to 50 the number of radio stations it owns, operates or is acquiring. As part of the transaction, Radio One also acquired the low-powered Indianapolis television station W53AV.

No change in wholesale prices in May

Wholesale prices showed no change in May as lower costs for energy and food more than offset higher prices for cars and a record jump in the cost of books, according to government figures released Friday.

The flat reading in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, surprised analysts who had predicted that a rebound in energy costs would push up wholesale prices by 0.3 percent.

Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the "core" rate of inflation at the wholesale level rose 0.2 percent last month, slightly faster than many analysts were forecasting. In March and April, core prices rose by just 0.1 percent.

AT&T says it will submit another rate increase

AT&T Corp. plans to submit another rate-increase plan after withdrawing the previous one amid pressure from consumers and regulators, spokesman Mark Siegel said.

AT&T on Wednesday canceled increases in some rates for consumers not enrolled in discount plans. The company needs the rate increases to meet sales projections, Siegel said. AT&T warned May 2 that profit this year could be as low as $1.80 to $1.85 a share.

The company was criticized for trying to push through rate increases of as much as 80 percent last week while at the same time announcing an agreement with regulators to lower other prices.

MP3.com shares rise after settlement with music firms

MP3.com Inc. settled copyright-infringement claims by two of the five largest recorded music companies Friday and agreed to license their songs for its online service, sending MP3.com shares up as much as 30 percent.

Terms of the agreement with Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music Group and Bertelsmann AG's BMG Entertainment weren't disclosed. Seagram Co.'s Universal Music, EMI Group Plc and Sony Corp. are also expected to settle with MP3.com, analysts say.

The $40 billion music industry is battling upstart online services like MP3.com and Napster Inc. as more consumers use the Web to download music.

In brief

ELECTRONIC DATA Systems Corp. shares tumbled 26 percent, the biggest drop ever, after the No. 2 U.S. computer-services company said second-quarter sales will be lower than expected. Changes in the organization of the sales force are hurting revenue growth at EDS, which competes with International Business Machines Corp. for contracts to run corporate computer systems. The warning is a setback for Chief Executive Dick Brown, who took over last year and has slashed more than 8,000 jobs and pared management in an effort to jump-start sales and profit growth.

FIDELITY, the Boston-based mutual fund giant, denied a Wall Street Journal report Friday that it was considering a merger with Lehman Brothers. Lehman and Fidelity have had a strategic alliance since June 1999, an arrangement that has gone so well that executives are looking for ways to tighten the relationship, the paper said. Fidelity, which has a massive retail brokerage business, distributes stock from Lehman-backed public offerings to individual investors.

DEUTSCHE BANK plans to push ahead with sales of stakes in industrial companies to free up cash for expansion after the purchase of Dresdner Bank failed in April, CEO Rolf Breuer told shareholders Friday. The bank has "no concrete plans" for acquisitions, he added.

On the CBS MarketWatch, the Dow was down 144 points and the NASDAQ just under 14, with traders looking ahead to today's session. MarketWatch correspondent Alexis Christoforous has more.   

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

Big changes at a blue chip company and some pending inflation news put investors on alert. Trading was slower than usual as Wall Street awaits some economic reports. We get May wholesale prices Friday morning, and consumer prices next week. Those reports could signal whether interest rates will keep rising.   

Checking specific stocks, it was the day after for  Microsoft. The stock falling 2.4 percent, to close at 68 13/16ths one day after a judge ordered the company to be split in two. Now  Microsoft wiped out the NASDAQ's 1 percent rally, sending the index lower in the final hour of trading.   

And  Procter & Gamble gave the blue chip index a bruising. The maker of Tide detergent and Bounty paper towel fired its chairman and CEO Durk Jager after 17 months of disappointing profits and a 52-percent drop in its stock price.  P&G also revealed that earnings will miss the mark for the second straight quarter. Well, investors punished the stock. It fell nearly $5.

 P&G Declines on  Profit Warning , Helping to Lead Blue Chips Lower

 NEW YORK -- Procter & Gamble's earnings warning damaged some of the optimism that has fueled market gains recently.   

 The consumer-products giant, which warned Wall Street in March that it would miss its profit targets, fell sharply yesterday when it admitted, once again, it wouldn't live up to expectations. The stock sank 5 7/8 to 57 on the New York Stock Exchange.   

 That contributed 34.12 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 144.14-point decline; the average lost 1.33% to end at 10668.72.   

 The blue-chip camp also suffered from declines in some industrial issues, as Honeywell fell 2 5/16 to 51 1/2, and United Technologies surrendered 3 1/16 to 56 15/16. The losses reflected expectations that the anticipated slowdown in economic expansion that has been the catalyst for more optimism about interest rates may hurt industrial stocks exposed to the expansion.   

 Technology stocks demonstrated more fortitude in the session than the broad list did, with market averages exposed to the sector showing almost minimal losses.   

 Semiconductor stocks gained ground after a report from the Semiconductor Industry Association showed that demand for dynamic random access memory chips is expected to grow even more sharply this year and into 2002 than initially expected.   

 Micron Technology climbed 3 15/16 to 80 1/2, thanks to the report, and Analog Devices gained 6 1/16 to 94 11/16, while Integrated Device Technology gained 2 3/16 to 55 7/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.   

 Kulicke & Soffa Industries (Nasdaq) moved ahead 5/8 to 57 11/16, and had been higher intraday, following an optimistic research note from Lehman Brothers, which said the chip-equipment makers' outlook for orders continues to improve.   

 With the support from chip makers, the Nasdaq Composite Index finished in pretty fair shape, relative to the rest of the market, losing a scant 13.70, or 0.36%, to 3825.56.   

 "After the tremendous rally we had last week, particularly on the Nasdaq market, which rose almost 19%, we needed a little consolidation," said Richard McCabe, market analyst at Merrill Lynch. "It's a healthy, but shallow, consolidation -- not giving up much ground -- and that's a good sign."   

 The strength in technology came about despite an adverse turn for shares of Microsoft (Nasdaq), which reacted to a federal judge's ruling late Wednesday that the company should be split in two. The stock initially held up relatively well, but turned a little weaker as investors adopted a defensive tone toward its outlook. Shares finished 1 11/16 lower at 68 13/16.   

 Citrix Systems declined 8 1/8 to 51 9/16 on Nasdaq, apparently on investors' worries that the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., provider of software for server-based computing might face increased competition from whatever permutation of Microsoft existed if the government succeeded in splitting the company. Analysts interviewed yesterday said they didn't put much stock in that presumption.   

 EchoStar Communications rose 1 1/8 to 38 1/8 on Nasdaq, after Lehman Brothers, in a research note, said the price of the stock of the Littleton, Colo., concern represented a buying opportunity.   

 Rival Hughes Electronics, which operates the DirecTV satellite broadcasting unit, rose 1 3/8 to 100 1/2.   

 Electronic Arts fell 3 1/4 to 68 1/2 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston lowered its earnings forecasts for the Redwood City, Calif., entertainment-software developer's first and second quarters.   

 Electronic Data Systems fell 5 3/8 to 57 13/16. Merrill Lynch cut its earnings forecasts for the Plano, Texas, computer-services concern, citing the impact of foreign-currency translations, and slower realization of revenues from new contracts and projects with General Motors.   

 Earthlink eased 3/8 to 17 9/16 on Nasdaq. The Atlanta Internet-service provider agreed to acquire OneMain.com, another Internet-service provider, for $308 million in cash and stock. Shares of OneMain.com, valued at about $12.27 under the deal, rose 3 5/16 to 11 5/16 on Nasdaq.   

 Inktomi declined 2 15/16 to 125 7/8 on Nasdaq. The Foster City, Calif., networking-software developer agreed to buy Ultraseek, a unit of Walt Disney's Go.com operation, for $341.2 million in stock and $3.5 million in cash. Disney shares added 1/4 to 40 7/16, while the company's Go.com unit rose 3/16 to 12 1/2.   

 Intermedia Communications moved up 5 13/16 to 41 5/8 on Nasdaq. According to a news report on CNBC television, the Tampa, Fla., telecommunications-service provider has held negotiations with Broadwing about a takeover. Broadwing, a Cincinnati telecom provider, fell 3 3/8 to 22 7/16. Intermedia described the report as a rumor, and declined to comment.   

 Atmel gained 2 1/4 to 42 9/16 on Nasdaq in a session of strong gains for semiconductor stocks. Chase H&Q raised its rating on the San Jose, Calif., chip maker, saying that bookings and billings in the current quarter have appeared to shape up well.   

 Tech Data advanced 4 to 42 on Nasdaq. Chase H&Q raised its rating on shares of the Clearwater, Fla., provider of information-technology products, citing favorable industry fundamentals and attractive valuation.   

 Research in Motion added 2 3/8 to 44 7/8 on Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch issued an upbeat research note on the Canadian developer of wireless-communications products, citing expectations that the company will increase its revenues.   

 National Semiconductor retreated 1 1/8 to 63 in a session where several other chip stocks gained ground, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., chip maker's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, reported yesterday beat Wall Street's forecasts.   

 Central Newspaper climbed 20 1/2 to 52. The Phoenix newspaper-publishing concern said it has held preliminary talks about selling the company, though it said there could be no assurances any transactions will be completed. The company hired Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette to serve as adviser in any transactions.   

 Dow Jones gained 4 3/16 to 73 1/4. The New York media and information concern said total advertising linage for The Wall Street Journal, which it publishes, rose 42.7% in May. Donaldson Lufkin raised its recommendation on the stock to a buy from a market performer, citing an upturn in the company's electronic-publishing division.   

 Viacom's Class B shares gained 1 3/16 to 64. Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating on the stock of the New York media and information concern, and raised its price target on the shares to 80 from 75. UBS Warburg, which has a strong buy rating on the stock, also made some positive comments about the company.   

 Medtronic lost 1 1/8 to 47 1/4. ABN Amro cut its rating on the Minneapolis medical-technology developer. However, an analyst at PaineWebber, taking an alternate view, said the pessimistic issues about the company have been overblown.   

 AT&T fell 1 3/16 to 35 1/4, after retreating from a controversial rate schedule it previously unveiled that would have raised some consumer long-distance charges as much as 80%, which drew criticism from the Federal Communications Commission.

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL:  Good morning.  A clear, sunny day on  Wall Street.  Joining us all this week with your MARKET CALL is Tony Dwyer, market strategist at Kirlin Holdings. 

 We`re starting our trading day at the New York Stock Exchange. Christine Romans standing by there.  Hi, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Rhonda.  The Dow is up just slightly in the first few minutes of trade, but we`re still waiting for Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) to open up.  I just came from visiting that post.  A little bit of crowd starting to develop over there. And earnings warning the second this year, and a management shake-up there had the stock trading lower on Instinet.  The indication here at the NYSE is for P&G to trade between 59 and $62 a share.  Last trade here at the New York Stock Exchange was 62 7/8. 

 There seems to be a little bit of mixed opinion about exactly how this will pan out in terms of trading here in the overall market.  Some traders say look for P&G`s stock to get hit and also look for that whole kind of consumer group to get hit, but it could be just focused on that kind of sector of the market. 

 But other people are telling me they expect it to filter into the rest of the market since we don`t have a lot of economic news today. At least heavy on the economic calendar today.  And we are a little bit nervous, some are saying, after a bit of a rally late yesterday.  They want some confirmation, not a profit warning. 

 SCHAFFLER:  Christine, you know, there have been negative news before from Procter & Gamble.  So that`s not going to sit well either, I would guess. 

 ROMANS:  Yes, you know, this is the second profit warning this year. When you take a look at the stock, it`s off something like 33 percent over the past 52 weeks.  It has been a tough road to hoe  if you have been a bull in Procter & Gamble.  Shares trading not far from their 52-week low.  But as one trader pointed out, he said, you know, it`s not like this is out of the blue.  This is the second earnings warning we`ve had this year.  So it shouldn`t have the impact of the first one that we saw earlier this spring. 

 So if you`re looking for a silver lining as well, some traders are saying they want to see the details about this succession there, about the plans over the next six weeks to get things reversed, and there could be some silver linings in this conference call. 

 SCHAFFLER:  All right, we`ll wait and see.

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - U.S. share prices were weak Thursday as uncertainty over interest rates continues to dry up investment and speculation. 

 At 2:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Industrials were down 133.00 at 10679.86, while the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.10 at 3833.16. 

 "People are reluctant to take risks. There's no leadership and volumes are very poor," said Michael Lyons, chief dealer at Dean Witter. 

 Dealers and analysts say spirits won't return to the market until softness in the economy is confirmed and doubts over Federal Reserve policy clear up. 

 Friday's producer price report will be the first of three key reports that could, at least partly, clear up the uncertainty. The PPI has been erratic in recent months but is expected to rise 0.3 percent. 

 "The market is scared that there's more than one-quarter point coming in June and August. We won't move much more than sideways until the Fed is out of the way," Lyons said. 

 A surprisingly sharp 50 basis point rate hike by the European Central Bank led to a spike then dip for the euro-dollar, but had little impact on expectations for Federal Reserve policy. The ECB is seen stepping aside for at least the near term. 

 Procter & Gamble was down 5 7/16 at 56 7/16 [PG] after top executive Durk Jager stepped down. The company also issued a profit warning, the second in three months. 

 Microsoft was down 1 5/16 at 69 3/16 [MSFT] a day after a Federal judge ordered its breakup. Bill Gates has vowed he will fight the ruling.

 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Blue-chip stocks languished near their lows in midday trading on Thursday battered by losses in Procter & Gamble and heavy selling in banks and brokerages shares. 

 The technology sector continued to shine however, buoyed by market cheer that the agonizing wait for a ruling in software giant Microsoft Corp.'s anti-trust trial was over. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) fell 138 points, or 1.29 percent, to 10,673, while the Nasdaq composite index .IXIC) was up 26 points, or 69 percent, at 3,866. 

 Procter & Gamble was clearly leading the way down for the Dow after the company announced the retirement of Durk Jager as its chairman and chief executive. 

 The consumer products giant also warned that its earnings would be nearly flat in the fourth quarter compared with the prior year, falling far short of its previous forecast for a 15-17 percent gain. P&G fell 4-7/8 to 58. 

 "The Dow is obviously being wacked around by the Proctor & Gamble warning," said Bryan Piskorowski at Prudential Securities. 

 Nervousness that P&G's profit warning might foreshadow more bad news on the earnings front prompted the selling, traders said. 

 "People are wondering will there be other profit warnings, because you can't have a slowing economy without also a slowing in corporate earnings," said Sam Stovall, senior investment strategist for Standard & Poor's, referring to recent signs of cooling in the blazing pace of U.S. economic growth. 

 Losses in leading financial names were also a drag on blue chip issues. J.P. Morgan, a Dow 30 component, fell 3-9/16 to 133-9/16, while American Express slipped 12/16 to 55-11/16. 

 Weakness in manufacturing conglomerate Honeywell and United Technologies Corp also weighed on the Dow index. 

 One of the day's big losers was Electronic Data Systems, which slumped 5 to 58-3/16 after Merrill Lynch cut its target on the company's shares to $81 per share from $90. 

 Meanwhile, tech sector's flame continued to blaze, thanks to the ability of Microsoft's stock to stave off a selloff in the face of federal court's order that the software giant be split in two encouraged buying, traders said. 

 The long-awaited decision, although harsh, helped part the clouds of uncertainty that have hung over the company's shares since the trial began. 

 Microsoft, the most actively traded on the Nasdaq, rose 1/2 to 70. 

 Gains in Qualcomm Inc also bolstered the Nasdaq, rising on news that it had signed a series of research and development pacts in China, industry executives said. Its shares jumped 3-13/16 to 78-1/2. 

 Qualcomm suffered a major setback when China United Telecommunications confirmed it had ditched plans for Qualcomm to supply CDMA, or code division multiple access, technology. 

 Semiconductor shares blasted higher amid the broader tech rally, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index .SOXX) climbed 1.51 percent to 1,147. 

 In a measure of the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX) fell 7 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,464, while the Wilshire 5000 .TMW) slipped 44 points, or 0.32 percent to 13,681. 

 Earlier in the session, investors cheered U.S. jobless claims, which rose by a stronger-than-expected 309,000 in the week ended June 3. The data underpinned optimism that the economy's blazing pace of growth may be cooling somewhat, limiting the need for tighter monetary policy. 

 "Anything that demonstrates that the Fed's tightenings of the past 11 months are taking hold ... is going to be bullish for stocks," said Paul Cherney, analyst at S&P Marketscope. 

 "It's just more evidence that the Fed is at or near the end of its tightening cycle," he added. 

 But traders said the jury was still out on interest rates, waiting for further evidence, such as producer prices data due out on Friday, which they hope will give hints as to the extent of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. 

 The market was largely unfazed by a surprisingly large half-point hike in interest rates by the European Central Bank, which dented European stocks.

 Microsoft Investors Fear Uncertainty More Than Breakup --- Restrictions Could Hobble Software Maker for Years

 In Wall Street's leading corporate drama, it's not the opening act that worries investors. It's the encore.   

 What investors fear most these days about Microsoft's antitrust case isn't so much an AT&T-style breakup, but rather "conduct remedies" that could hobble Microsoft much as International Business Machines was legally hamstrung in the 1970s and 1980s.   

 Investors and analysts still expect Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to endorse the government's proposal to break Microsoft into two: one company focusing on computer operating systems, the other on application and Internet software. Even if the ruling isn't overturned on appeal, it might not be so bad in and of itself, some investors say. Judge Jackson was due to issue his ruling late Wednesday.   

 "What if, 18 months ago, Bill Gates said: `We're getting too big, we're gonna split into three companies,'" muses Charles Carlson, manager of the $145 million (151.8 million euro) Strong Dow 30 Value Fund, which has a stake in Microsoft. If a breakup had been proposed in that way, Mr. Carlson says: "The stock would have gone up 50%."   

 Well, it didn't. And now, investors are more worried about the less-obvious conduct remedies, which have been proposed and are expected to be included in Judge Jackson's ruling. As in: new rules governing Microsoft's relations with computer makers, Windows pricing and the disclosure of computer source code. These rules are designed to restrain Microsoft from abusing its monopoly in the software business and would expire in three years if Microsoft were broken up -- or 10 years if it isn't.   

 "The big issue would be putting constraints on them," asserts Craig Braemer, whose $800 million Highmark Growth Fund owns about 315,000 shares of Microsoft. "That would be the biggest negative."   

 Walter Casey, a veteran technology analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors, believes the breakup of Microsoft will get overturned on appeal. But he, too, worries that "severe behavioral remedies could also be a negative." The specter of IBM's poor performance in the 1980s, after three government antitrust suits and two consent decrees, haunts him.   

 "The lawyers really had a tremendous influence on IBM after they had their antitrust problems," Mr. Casey says. His impression of IBM? "The lawyers ran the company. The marketing guys had to run everything past the attorneys. The new products and the pricing and the different contracts had to be run past the attorneys." In retrospect, the hollowing out of IBM in the 1980s -- a process that wasn't immediately clear to investors -- probably owed much to the company's fear of crossing antitrust authorities again.   

 You can bet Microsoft will battle fiercely against severe legal restrictions on its business. Such an environment would be the antithesis of its aggressive business culture. And Microsoft executives are well aware that IBM's own legal sclerosis gave them crucial room to maneuver when IBM was still the feared giant in the computer industry.   

 And it's still unclear how a breakup or behavioral remedies would affect Microsoft -- not surprising since any remedies would undergo an uncertain appeals process. Moreover, the plunge in Microsoft's stock price to $69.1875 early Wednesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, from a peak of almost $120 on Dec. 30 isn't entirely because of the antitrust trial. Many analysts worry about Microsoft's ability to compete in a new world in which more and more computing is done not on personal computers (where Windows dominates) but on other devices, such as pocket organizers and cable television set-top boxes. In those markets, Microsoft is playing catch-up.   

 Indeed, in its most recent earnings report, Microsoft warned of possible slowing profit growth in its next fiscal year, beginning July 1, and said revenue would grow at a lower-than-expected rate because of lower demand for PCs. That warning let a lot of air out of the stock. Tuesday, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors reiterated that outlook, saying at an investment conference that revenue would likely grow 15% in the next fiscal year, roughly the same as some estimates of around 16% for this year.   

 Still, analyst Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs -- a firm that has been allied with Microsoft since the company's initial public offering in the 1980s -- figures that $150 billion to $175 billion of Microsoft's $260 billion decline in stock-market value is because of antitrust concerns.   

 Mr. Sherlund is one of the biggest bears on the implications of a breakup. "Anyone that owns Microsoft stock right now has to be presuming that the appeals court overturns the judge," he says. "If you don't think it's going to happen, you shouldn't own the stock." He says Microsoft suffers in many ways from a breakup, and the company's intrinsic value would be at least 15% lower than where it trades currently.   

 At the same time, some of Mr. Sherlund's concerns stem from the conduct remedies, beyond the breakup of the company. For instance, he argues that one destructive rule for the proposed Microsoft operating-system unit would be that the price of old versions of the operating system would have to be discounted, according to a strict formula, when new versions are introduced. Since most users don't upgrade to the new system right away, there would be no incentive to enhance the operating systems, he argues. Any innovations to the software would "reduce my revenues for a year or two" and thus "trash my stock," he says.

Since most users don't upgrade to the new system right away, there would be no incentive to enhance the operating systems, he argues. Any innovations to the software would "reduce my revenues for a year or two" and thus "trash my stock," he says.   

 Some of the conduct remedies proposed by the government don't seem as damaging. There's a prohibition against threatening or taking any action against computer makers that want to sell or develop competing products, for instance. The government also wants Microsoft to license Windows to computer makers according to uniform agreements, so Microsoft can't favor one partner over another. And in some ways, the proposed restrictions on Microsoft's conduct are narrower than those imposed on IBM or AT&T in the past.   

 Other proposals, however, have raised Microsoft's ire, and prompted Wall Street to worry about Microsoft's ability to compete in the future. Those remedies include allowing computer makers to cut off access to certain features of Windows -- such as broadly defined "middleware" products including the company's Web browser -- and charge less for stripped-down systems. Microsoft worries that this would give its partners an incentive to sell bare-bones versions of Windows, and hurt its bottom line.   

 The government also wants Microsoft to disclose some of its base computer source code to address concerns that Microsoft purposely designed some of its products so they wouldn't work well with those of rivals. Some fret that disclosing the important code, though, could put Microsoft at a competitive disadvantage, since others could copy its products.   

 Other investors don't fear the publication of code as much as the prospect that Microsoft might have to look over its shoulder constantly at the legal ramifications of its normally aggressive business moves.   

 "I think Microsoft realizes, even absent these court proceedings, that it would be opening up its code more and more," says David Brady, senior manager of $1.4 billion Stein Roe Young Investor Fund. He says the fund, which owned 400,000 shares of Microsoft at the end of March, hasn't sold any shares lately in the hopes that Microsoft will emerge with less damage than appears possible. Still, he hasn't bought any more Microsoft stock at its much lower price, either.   

 The prospect of conduct remedies has Mr. Brady worried -- and he isn't afraid, like many big Microsoft holders, to raise the volume on his alarm. "If that were to happen, the implications are much broader than Microsoft," Mr. Brady says.   

 "The government would be sending a loud message to investors, that a large dominant position isn't worth what you once thought it was." And such a message, Mr. Brady says, "could be an inflection point for the market."

 Procter Gamble chief will step down, issues new  profit warning

 CINCINNATI, Ohio, June 8 (AFP) - Procter Gamble said Thursday that its chairman, president and chief executive, Durk Jager, would retire from the struggling consumer products giant. 

 Alan Lafley will take over as president and chief executive and John Pepper as chairman, the company said in a statement. 

 Procter Gamble also warned it expects fourth-quarter core net earnings per share on a diluted basis to be equal to their year-ago level, down from its previous prediction of a 15-to-17 percent increase. 

 Earlier this year, P and G shares plunged on a similar profitwarning. 

 Jager said it was a personal decision to step aside. 

 "I am proud of the vision we set out to achieve with Organization 2005, and we've made important progress. It's unfortunate our progress in stepping up topline sales growth resulted in earnings disappointments," he said. 

 Alan Lafley is currently the company's president of global beauty care and North America, and John Pepper is retired from Procter and Gamble and is chairman of the executive committee of the board. 

 Lafley said the size and pace of change P and G undertook this fiscal year were major factors causing the lower-than-expected results. 

 "In hindsight, it's clear we changed too much too fast," said Lafley.

 New York, June 8 (Jiji Press) - U.S. stocks fell back on Thursday, as a profit warning by consumer products leader Procter and Gamble unleashed broad selling in consumption-related issues. 

 The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average dipped 144.14 points from Wednesday, or 1.3 pct, to finish at 10,668.72. Trading was slow, with the volume on the New York Stock Exchange coming to 854.30 million shares, down 320,000 shares from the previous day. 

 The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index also gave up 13.70 points to end at 3,825.56, wrenched down by a late bout of profit-taking as cautiousness spread ahead of Friday's release of the U.S. producer price index for May. 

 The downward profit estimate revision by Procter and Gamble kindled worries over earnings at U.S. consumer products makers, as the U.S. economy is already signaling a slowdown in its red-hot expansion, brokers said. 

 Shares of Microsoft wiped out early gains and closed down, after the software titan was ordered by a U.S. judge to break into two in an antitrust suit.

 NEW YORK -- Stock prices are mostly lower on Wall Street with investors worried about a big profit warning. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average is down 131.95 at 10681.91. 

 Decliners on the New York Stock Exchange hold a three-to-two lead over advancers. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index has gained 35.75 at 3875.01. 

 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange during the first two hours totalled 340-million shares. 

 Volume on the Nasdaq Market came to 550-million shares. 

 Procter-and-Gamble is leading the decline on the Dow after company officials said fourth-quarter core earnings should be flat with last year's levels. 

 The maker of Ivory soap and Crest toothpaste had earlier predicted a 15 percent to 17 percent increase. 

 Procter-and-Gamble's warning follows a similar disappointment in the last quarter. 

 Also, the company says it's replaced chief executive officer Durk Jager (YAH'-gur) with company veteran A-G Lafley. 

 The broader market is struggling as well, although some technology stocks are showing strength.

 Microsoft Investors Fear Uncertainty More Than Breakup --- Restrictions Could Hobble Software Maker for Years

 In Wall Street's leading corporate drama, it's not the opening act that worries investors. It's the encore.   

 What investors fear most these days about Microsoft's antitrust case isn't so much an AT&T-style breakup, but rather "conduct remedies" that could hobble Microsoft much as IBM was legally hamstrung in the 1970s and 1980s.   

 Investors and analysts still expect Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to endorse the government's proposal to break Microsoft into two -- one company focusing on computer operating systems, the other on application and Internet software. Even if the ruling isn't overturned on appeal, it might not be so bad in and of itself, some investors say.   

 "What if, 18 months ago, Bill Gates said: `We're getting too big, we're going to split into three companies,'" muses Charles Carlson, manager of the $145 million (153 million euros) Strong Dow 30 Value Fund, which has a stake in Microsoft.

 "The big issue would be putting constraints on them," asserts Craig Braemer, whose $800 million Highmark Growth Fund owns about 315,000 shares of Microsoft. "That would be the biggest negative."

But he, too, worries that "severe behavioral remedies could also be a negative."

 And it's still unclear how a breakup or behavioral remedies would affect Microsoft since any remedies would undergo an uncertain appeals process. Moreover, the plunge in Microsoft's stock price -- to $69.625 a share in 4 p.m. trading Tuesday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, down from a peak of almost $120 on Dec. 30 -- isn't entirely due to the antitrust trial.   

 Many analysts worry about Microsoft's ability to compete in a new world in which more and more computing is done not on personal computers (where Windows dominates) but on other types of computing devices, such as pocket organizers and cable television set-top boxes. In those markets, Microsoft is playing catch-up.   

 Indeed, in its most recent earnings report, Microsoft warned that profit growth may slow in its next fiscal year, beginning July 1, and said revenue would grow at a lower-than-expected rate because of lower demand for personal computers. That warning let a lot of air out of the stock. On Tuesday, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors reiterated that outlook, saying at an investment conference that revenue would likely grow 15% in the next fiscal year, roughly flat from some estimates of around 16% this year.   

 Still, analyst Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs -- a firm that's been allied with Microsoft since the company's initial public offering in the 1980s -- figures that $150 billion to $175 billion of Microsoft's $260 billion decline in stock market value is due to antitrust concerns.   

 Mr. Sherlund is one of the biggest bears on the implications of a breakup. "Anyone that owns Microsoft stock right now has to be presuming that the appeals court overturns the judge," he says. "If you don't think it's going to happen, you shouldn't own the stock." He says Microsoft suffers in many ways from a breakup, and that the company's intrinsic value would be at least 15% lower than where it trades today.   

 At the same time, some of Mr. Sherlund's concerns stem from the conduct remedies, beyond the breakup of the company. For instance, he argues that one destructive rule for the proposed Microsoft operating-system unit would be that the price of old versions of the operating system would have to be discounted, according to a strict formula, when new versions are introduced. Since most users don't upgrade to the new system right away, there would be no incentive to enhance the operating systems, he argues. Any innovations to the software would "reduce my revenues for a year or two," and thus "trash my stock," he says.

 In Wall Street's leading corporate drama, it's not the opening act that worries investors. It's the encore.   

 What investors fear most these days about Microsoft's antitrust case isn't so much an AT&T-style breakup, but rather "conduct remedies" that could hobble Microsoft much as International Business Machines was legally hamstrung in the 1970s and 1980s.   

 Investors and analysts still expect Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to endorse the government's proposal to break Microsoft into two: one company focusing on computer operating systems, the other on application and Internet software. Even if the ruling isn't overturned on appeal, it might not be so bad in and of itself, some investors say.   

 "What if, 18 months ago, Bill Gates said: `We're getting too big, we're gonna split into three companies,'" muses Charles Carlson, manager of the $145 million Strong Dow 30 Value Fund, which has a stake in Microsoft. If a breakup had been proposed in that way, Mr. Carlson says: "The stock would have gone up 50%."   

 Well, it didn't. And now, investors increasingly are worrying about the lessobvious conduct remedies, which have been proposed and are expected to be included in Judge Jackson's ruling. As in: new rules governing Microsoft's relations with computer makers, Windows pricing and the disclosure of computer source code. These rules are designed to restrain Microsoft from abusing its monopoly in the software business and would expire in three years if Microsoft were broken upor 10 years if it isn't.   

 "The big issue would be putting constraints on them," asserts Craig Braemer, whose $800 million Highmark Growth Fund owns about 315,000 shares of Microsoft. "That would be the biggest negative."   

 Walter Casey, a veteran technology analyst at Banc One Investment Advisors, believes the breakup of Microsoft will get overturned on appeal. But he, too, worries that "severe behavioral remedies could also be a negative." The specter of IBM's poor performance in the 1980s, after three government antitrust suits and two consent decrees, haunts him.   

 "The lawyers really had a tremendous influence on IBM after they had their antitrust problems," Mr. Casey says. His impression of IBM? "The lawyers ran the company. The marketing guys had to run everything past the attorneys. The new products and the pricing and the different contracts had to be run past the attorneys." In retrospect, the hollowing out of IBM in the 1980s -- a process that wasn't immediately clear to investors -- probably owed much to the company's fear of crossing antitrust authorities again.   

 You can bet Microsoft will battle fiercely against severe legal restrictions on its business. Such an environment would be the antithesis of its aggressive business culture. And Microsoft executives are well aware that IBM's own legal sclerosis gave them crucial room to maneuver when IBM was still the feared giant in the computer industry.   

 And it's still unclear how a breakup or behavioral remedies would affect Microsoft -- not surprising since any remedies would undergo an uncertain appeals process. Moreover, the plunge in Microsoft's stock price -- to $69.625 yesterday in 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, down from a peak of almost $120 on Dec. 30 -- isn't entirely because of the antitrust trial. Many analysts worry about Microsoft's ability to compete in a new world in which more and more computing is done not on personal computers (where Windows dominates) but on other types of computing devices, such as pocket organizers and cable television set-top boxes. In those markets, Microsoft is playing catch-up.   

 Indeed, in its most recent earnings report, Microsoft warned of possible slowing profit growth in its next fiscal year, beginning July 1, and said revenue would grow at a lower-than-expected rate because of lower demand for PCs. That warning let a lot of air out of the stock. Yesterday, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors reiterated that outlook, saying at an investment conference that revenue would likely grow 15% in the next fiscal year, roughly the same as some estimates of around 16% for this year.   

 Still, analyst Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs -- a firm that has been allied with Microsoft since the company's initial public offering in the 1980s -- figures that $150 billion to $175 billion of Microsoft's $260 billion decline in stock-market value is because of antitrust concerns.   

 Mr. Sherlund is one of the biggest bears on the implications of a breakup. "Anyone that owns Microsoft stock right now has to be presuming that the appeals court overturns the judge," he says. "If you don't think it's going to happen, you shouldn't own the stock." He says Microsoft suffers in many ways from a breakup, and the company's intrinsic value would be at least 15% lower than where it trades today.   

 At the same time, some of Mr. Sherlund's concerns stem from the conduct remedies, beyond the breakup of the company. For instance, he argues that one destructive rule for the proposed Microsoft operating-system unit would be that the price of old versions of the operating system would have to be discounted, according to a strict formula, when new versions are introduced. Since most users don't upgrade to the new system right away, there would be no incentive to enhance the operating systems, he argues. Any innovations to the software would "reduce my revenues for a year or two" and thus "trash my stock," he says.   

 Some of the conduct remedies proposed by the government don't seem as damaging. There's a prohibition against threatening or taking any action against computer makers that want to sell or develop competing products, for instance. The government also wants Microsoft to license Windows to computer makers according to uniform agreements, so Microsoft can't favor one partner over another. And in some ways, the proposed restrictions on Microsoft's conduct are narrower than those imposed on IBM or AT&T in the past.   

 Other proposals, however, have raised Microsoft's ire, and prompted Wall Street to fear for Microsoft's ability to compete. Those remedies include allowing computer makers to cut off access to certain features of Windows -- such as broadly defined "middleware" products including the company's Web browser -- and charge less for stripped-down systems. Microsoft worries that this would give its partners an incentive to sell bare-bones versions of Windows, and hurt its bottom line.   

 The government also wants Microsoft to disclose some of its base computer source code to address concerns that Microsoft purposely designed some of its products so they wouldn't work well with those of rivals. Some fret that disclosing the important code, though, could put Microsoft at a competitive disadvantage, since others could copy its products.   

 Other investors don't fear the publication of code as much as the prospect that Microsoft might have to look over its shoulder constantly at the legal ramifications of its normally aggressive business moves.   

 "I think Microsoft realizes, even absent these court proceedings, that it would be opening up its code more and more," says David Brady, senior manager of $1.4 billion Stein Roe Young Investor Fund. He says the fund, which owned 400,000 shares of Microsoft at the end of March, hasn't sold any shares lately in the hopes that Microsoft will emerge with less damage than appears possible. Still, he hasn't bought any more Microsoft stock at its much lower price, either.   

 The prospect of conduct remedies has Mr. Brady worried -- and he isn't afraid, like many big Microsoft holders, to raise the volume on his alarm. "If that were to happen, the implications are much broader than Microsoft," Mr. Brady says.   

 "The government would be sending a loud message to investors, that a large dominant position isn't worth what you once thought it was." And such a message, Mr. Brady says, "could be an inflection point for the market."

The Sleeper Division of Kinefac has developed a new Micro-Coiler
for the production of very small diameter wire coils for medical
applications. This unique, ultra-precision coiling system uses the
deflection coiling method rather than the traditional winding method.
Therefore, it can form wire as fine as .002" into coils as small as
.010" in diameter. In the process, it can automatically and
simultaneously open the pitch, change diameter or control droop.
Finally, it automatically cuts off the completed spring, thereby
eliminating manual operations. To simplify introduction of this new
process, Sleeper provides Kine-Form Certified tooling to meet user

THE prospect of hungry British food companies feasting on US deals provided sustenance for investors today in a market which struggled to make headway against looming FT-SE 100 constituent changes and a Bank of England announcement on interest rates.  

Investors bit on talk of an Anglo-French bid for US food giant Nabisco from a pairing of Cadbury-Schweppes, up 6p to 521p, and French group Danone.  

Danone said it was still studying the menu before committing to a possible Pounds 10 billion joint bid.  

Unilever, up 8 3/4p to 438 3/4p, was also on the snack list for share shoppers as the market awaited a response to its revised offer for US group Bestfoods. But there was more food for thought at chocolate group Thorntons as its shares melted another 1/2p to a year's low of 93p following last week's profit warning.  

Investors were considering loftier matters over at British Airways on hopes that a rumoured deal with Dutch carrier KLM will get off the ground.  

KLM is looking for new friends after plans to join forces with Alitalia crash-landed acrimoniously while moves in the US, where BA's ally American Airlines has lined up KLM's Stateside partner Northwest Airlines for a bid, might provide some impetus for a tie-up. BA's shares added 1p to 399p.  

But the market was generally lower and the FT-SE 100 dropped 42.2 points to 6584.2 despite a strong performance from global markets. With the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meeting tomorrow, traders said most players were unwilling to second-guess it and were finding it hard to commit after a strong recent rally. Predictions favour a choppy week.  

Back on the ground, property stocks further reacted to a sudden burst of mergers in a sector which has long been in the doldrums. It was mixed fortunes for the Rit-blat real-estate dynasty as John Ritblat's British Land dipped 29p to 419 1/2p after it took 29.9% of rival UK property firm Liberty International from South African listed firms Standard Bank Investment Corporation and Liberty Group. Liberty pushed 20p higher to 487 1/2p against a purchase price of 550p. Analysts reckon British Land indebtedness means Ritblat will be sitting on the stake for now, but long-term analysts reckon it's a bargain.  

But Liberty's more than 70% subsidiary Capital Shopping Cen-tres, which is quoted separately, was a big gainer, up 31p to 393p, as the British Land deal raised questions about its future.  

Capital's Lakeside and MetroCentre are prime assets. Meanwhile, Delancey Estates, headed by son James Ritblat and with George Soros' investment, moved 4p higher to 94 1/2 p on reports that the group was thinking about taking itself private.  

Among the top gainers, warship maker Vosper Thornycroft added 156 1/2 p to 1256 1/2p. French defence group Thomson-CSF is said to be circling.  

Friday's strong 6.44% Nasdaq rally warmed tech stocks at opening but, with the FT-SE 100 likely to ditch some of its recent technology entrants later this month, brokers were urging caution. Possible drop outs are Psion, down 18p to 639p, and Baltimore, off 21 1/2p at 560p.  

A German government licence award pushed Easynet Group up 65p to 750p, but Freeserve dropped 17p to 535p. Vodafone dipped 9 3/4p to 325 3/4p after mobile auction costs resurfaced as a concern.

 With polls showing him neck and neck with Francisco Labastida, presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Vicente Fox recently brought his campaign to Mexican communities in the United States. But his rollicking plunge into binational politics was not only reckless but also potentially damaging to future U.S.-Mexico relations. 

 The outsized audacity that has propelled the candidate of the National Action Party into a dead heat in Mexico's presidential race is ill-suited for the diplomacy of bilateral relations with the United States. Fox's detour north of the border showed how he could undermine the very hopes he aroused in Mexicans living here. 

 In campaign stops from Chicago to California's Central Valley, Fox pledged to seek an open border between Mexico and the U.S. within five to 10 years. At his biggest rally, he held out the prospect of an open border in only five years. But by appealing to crowds in this manner, Fox showcased his failure to grasp U.S. immigration politics. Either that or he just doesn't care. 

 Immigration politics in the U.S. have plainly changed since the mid-1990s, but not enough to embrace an open border with Mexico. Rather than advancing bilateral relations, which could help his struggling compatriots living here, Fox was playing binational politics. In addition to his open-border pledge, Fox repeated his promise to extend absentee voting in Mexico's elections to millions of Mexicans living in the United States. 

 In playing the binational game, Fox transplanted Mexico's internal politics into U.S. soil for his own gain. Last year marked the official arrival of such politics, when Gov. Gray Davis and President Ernesto Zedillo swapped showy campaign-style "state visits." When Mexican politicians come to the U.S., they enjoy the added benefit of having a substantial Mexican constituency to which to appeal. But they can sometimes forget that the mainstream U.S. media are listening to and reporting on what they say and do. 

 The notoriously blunt Fox didn't disappoint. His boldness and brashness captured the U.S. media's attention like no previous opposition figure ever had. As a result, Fox's open-border pledge, though little more than an empty promise back home, risked inviting a political backlash against Mexico in the United States. 

 Following the immigration-policy wars of the '90s, important U.S. actors like organized labor are joining immigrants and their advocates in pushing for a new amnesty for millions of undocumented workers and their families. Others, including U.S. agricultural interests and the Mexican government, favor some form of temporary-labor-migration agreement. These politically ambitious ideas face strong U.S. opposition. But no group of legislators, future U.S. administration or labor union is prepared to even entertain a proposal for throwing open the border between Mexico and the United States. Indeed, the very idea is politically radioactive. Fox's style and open-border rhetoric made him a risky visitor for California officials to associate with. 

 Zedillo was warmly received last year when he addressed a joint session of the California Legislature. The Fox campaign wanted the same opportunity, even hyped it as a scheduled event. But top state officials and legislators tried to avoid even courtesy meetings with the Mexican candidate. Fox did address the state Senate, but threw out his prepared remarks after his Latino hosts advised that talk of an open border was not something state legislators wanted to hear about. After a perfunctory introduction on the floor of the state Assembly, Fox beat it out of town, canceling a scheduled press conference. 

 As president of Mexico, Fox would likely deliver on his promise to extend the right to vote to Mexicans living in the U.S. Even Labastida has reversed position and now supports the absentee emigre vote. Five years from now, when Mexico's next presidential race is underway, full-blown Mexican campaigns and elections may well be conducted on both sides of the border. 

 But Fox-style campaigning among potential Mexican voters would virtually guarantee that any significant liberalization of migration controls between Mexico and the U.S.--to say nothing of an open border--would be politically dead on arrival not only throughout a Fox term in office but for some time thereafter. Such campaigning and rhetoric, coupled with large-scale foreign voting on U.S. soil, would risk creating an image of Mexican immigration that veers far from accepted patterns of immigrant absorption and assimilation into U.S. society and politics. 

 In the words of Fox's shelved Sacramento speech, Mexican politicians look "with utmost indignation" at U.S. immigration policy. What they see is enhanced border enforcement, continuous apprehension and repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans annually and their co-nationals struggling in undesirable jobs at meager wages under the cloud of undocumented status. But they should not overlook or discount the substantial volume of legal Mexican immigration to the U.S. and an immigration policy that depends upon mainstream political support. 

 That political support is predicated on a continuing belief in a tradition of immigration to the United States. And that tradition means an opportunity to start a new life in a country still uniquely open to newcomers. To the extent that Mexican politicians succeed in changing the U.S. public's perception of what Mexican and other immigration is essentially about, they run the risk of critically weakening political support for more liberal immigration policies. 

 Both Mexican and Californian politicians are new to the game of binational politics. They need to think long and hard about both the substance and appearance of playing it responsibly and effectively. In so doing, they would do well to reflect upon Fox's bull run through the china shop of U.S. immigration policy and politics. He didn't bust the place up, but he came alarmingly close.  *

 Reports Indicate Economy's Pace May Be Slowing Statistics: Manufacturing, construction and retail sales data for May suggest Fed rate increases are having a moderating influence.

 WASHINGTON -- The evidence mounted Thursday that the economy is finally slowing. A fresh batch of statistics pointed to pullbacks in construction and manufacturing and suggested that even consumers are pausing to catch their breath. 

 Retail sales at major store chains grew less than expected in May, sales of cars and trucks weakened, growth in manufacturing slipped to a 15-month low, and construction spending fell slightly. 

 The latest data don't signal a serious downturn, but taken together they indicate that the six interest rate increases in less than a year by the Federal Reserve are having their intended effect of cooling the red-hot economy. 

 That was Wall Street's interpretation, as bond yields tumbled again and stock prices surged on hopes the Fed might be nearing the end of its series of rate hikes. 

 "The evidence is piling up that the brakes are on the pace of growth," said Gordon Richards, economist at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 

 In one of the first major readings of the last month, an industry group said growth of the U.S. manufacturing economy slowed considerably in May. The survey by the National Assn. of Purchasing Managers also reported fewer price increases for raw materials. An executive of the group said it appears that such inflationary pressures peaked in March. 

 The purchasing agents group reported that its overall index of economic activity in the manufacturing economy fell 1.7 points to 53.2 in May, the lowest reading since February 1999. Any reading above 50 indicates growth. 

 But economists said there was still reason to fear a surge in inflation, as oil prices once more are on the rise and as companies are pressured to raise wages to attract workers in a tight labor market. 

 The monthly report on employment and hourly wages, scheduled for release today by the Labor Department, should provide clues on the labor market, where the unemployment rate last month fell to a 30-year low of 3.9%. 

 The government said Thursday that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose a modest 1,000 last week to 286,000. Economists view anything below 300,000 as a sign that employers will have trouble filling jobs. 

 In another government report from Washington, spending on construction projects, a sector sensitive to interest rates, fell 0.6% in April, the Commerce Department said. It was the biggest setback in almost a year. 

 Elsewhere, a survey of 68 retailers by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. showed that U.S. retail sales rose 4.6% in May, below the average pace of the first four months of the year. Retail sales are vulnerable to higher interest rates. 

 But May's sales probably reflect the cool, wet weather that kept many consumers at home more than any economic weakness, Bank of Tokyo economist Mike Niemira said. 

 Taken together, the reports were consistent in pointing to modestly slower growth. Earlier in the week, economists reported falling home sales and slippage in an index of leading economic indicators. 

 But economists said this won't necessarily change the Fed's stance on interest rates. Fed policymakers next meet June 27-28, then again for an Aug. 22 session. 

 Worried that inflation would reemerge as a result of the economy's rapid growth, the Fed began tapping on the brakes last June. It raised short-term interest rates one-quarter of a percentage point five times. Last month it became more aggressive, going with a half-point increase. 

 "You have some tentative evidence of slowdown, but unemployment is so low, and the Fed wants to be very sure they have their slowdown in hand before they back off," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Group Inc. in New York. 

 However, Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., said, "The news that the economy is cooling off a little bit may make it a little easier for them to hold off raising rates in June, and I think that's what they would like to do." 

 But economists appeared optimistic the slowing is likely to lead to a healthier economy, rather than a recession. 

 "I think we are going to head for a soft landing," Harris said. "The hard landings or recessions . . . usually come after you have exceptional high inflation."

TECHNOLOGY shares ruled the roost today after strong overnight performances in the US brought buyers out of the woodwork.  

Retail stockbrokers have noted a steady crescendo in volumes from private investors during the week, with the likes of Baltimore, up 29p to 541p, Kingston Communications, ahead 20p to 620p, and biotech group Celltech, up 40p to 1000p, all benefiting.  

The FT-SE 100 index slipped 5.2 points to 6465.3 despite strong gains on Wall Street where Cisco, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard all advanced. Crucial US non-farm payroll figures today were expected to come in strongly but have already been priced into the markets.  

Optimism about the global semiconductors market was cited as one reason for the improvement in New York, and underpinned a 22p gain to 650p at British microchips designer ARM Holdings. At the opposite end of the size scale in London, penny stock Billam, the engineer being relaunched as a venture capital group for internet companies, saw further big percentage gains. It jumped 0.12p to 1.12p with investors scrambling for the new shares issued yesterday at 0.1p.  

"I've done 10 or 15 million shares in Bil-lam already," said one dealer less than an hour into the trading session. Word is that some big backers are likely to come into the group, giving it the firepower for major acquisitions.  

AIM-listed internet content and games developer Online jumped 16p to 277 1/2p as brisk trade followed news that it had signed a deal with a leading Swedish distributor. Meanwhile, Martha Lane Fox's lastminute.com gained 7 1/2p to 139p after its content deal with online travel operator Expedia.  

Financials came down with a bump.  

Schroders lost 53p to 1060p, Alliance and Leicester fell 18 1/2p to 600p, Woolwich was off 7 3/4p to 303 1/4p and Abbey National was 22p cheaper at 883p. Most of the biggest Footsie fallers were drawn from the more traditional sectors.  

Fewer PandO shareholders will be splashing out on cruises this summer after a profit warning wiped 10% off the share price, which fell down 73p to 653p.  

Tornado whipped up a storm, gaining 17 1/2p to 126 1/2p and bringing some relief to investors who have seen the digital services group fall from 382p in March.  

House broker Wise Speke said the gain was sentiment-driven, with no corporate action in the pipeline.  

Penny share Arthur Shaw was entertaining its shareholders with a 1p jump to 11.37p on reports of a possible big Sony contract for the internet content provider. Formerly an engineering group, it now broadcasts live concerts over the web. Rank was untouched at 144p after selling its 50% stake in Universal Studios Escape to investment group Blackstone Capital Partners for Pounds 185 million. Depending on the studio's future returns, Rank stands to gain a further Pounds 50 million from the deal. The USE stake made a loss of Pounds 2 million last year.  

Household products group McBride warned that a sales slowdown and the weak euro would hit profits this year. The shares bombed 9p to 71 1/2 p. Investors Chronicle worked its magic on intellectual property group Chorion, which jumped 1p to 46 1/4p on a share tip, and pubs company Ambishus, which frothed 5p to 119p for the same reason.

 Australia's Pasminco Shares Drop On  Profit Warning 

 By Andrew Trounson

 MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS), an Australian lead and zinc producer, Thursday stunned investors with a warning that its 1999-00 profit will fall below expectations. 

 The warning put Pasminco shares into a tail spin and sent analysts scrambling to start slashing profit forecasts, and raised the possibility of a takeover bid pitched at A$1 billion or more. 

 Its shares dropped 9 cents, or 9.9%, on heavy volume to close at 82 cents, valuing the company at A$922.1 million. In contrast the All Ordinaries Index rose 0.2% while the All Mining Index was down 0.2%. 

 Foreign exchange losses and poor performance at some Australian operations led Pasminco to issue a statement thatt earnings in its fiscal second half ending June 30 will likely be less than the first half result. 

 Pasminco posted a first half profit of A$11.9 million, before abnormal items. It is now set to post a full year profit of up to A$24 million, compared with some analyst forecasts in April of more than A$50 million. 

 "Clearly this has come as a shock to most people," said one resources analyst who asked not to be named. 

 John Colnan, resources analyst at Shaw Stockbroking in Sydney, had forecast the full year pre-abnormal profit at a pessimistic A$22 million, but told Dow Jones Newswires he is now likely to cut that to around A$15 million. 


Pasminco said its full year result would still exceed last year's. It
notched an A$8.3 million pre-abnormal loss in 1998-99.
             Now Vulnerable To Take Over



The drop in Pasminco's share price now leaves Pasminco exposed to a
takeover bid, especially from overseas companies seeking to capitalize
on the low value of the Australian dollar.



Analysts presented a plethora of possible predators including Korea
Zinc Co. (Q.KZC), Cominco Ltd. (CLT), Billiton PLC (U.BIX), Phelps Dodge
Corp. (PD), Union Miniere SA (B.ACE), and from Australia, North Ltd.
(A.NTH).



The key attraction would be Pasminco's new Century zinc mine in the
northern Australian state of Queensland, the production build up at
which is so far exceeding analyst expectations.



"It seems to be the one positive aspect for the company," said D&D
Tolhurst's resources analyst in Melbourne, Peter Rudd.



Pasminco is aiming to have Century producing zinc concentrate at a
rate of 300,000 metric tons a year by June, ahead of reaching 90% of
capacity, or 450,000 tons a year, by December.



But Shaw's Colnan believes Pasminco is an unlikely target, partly
because there are too many uncertainties hanging over it. While Century
is performing well it is yet to reach capacity and the company is facing
legal action in Australia over pollution from two of its smelters.



"They have too many issues to resolve first, one of them being to
lower costs at all their existing operations," Colnan said.
            Abandons Ernest Henry Sale For Now



Pasminco blamed the anticipated fall in second half earnings on the
under performance of its Cockle Creek lead and zinc smelter and its
Broken Hill and Elura lead and zinc mines, all in Australia.



Cockle Creek has lost seven weeks of production after having to shut
down in April for repairs and for work to be carried out on improving
the plant's environmental performance. At Broken Hill and Elura ore
grades have been lower than anticipated.



In addition a persistently low Australian dollar relative to the U.S.
dollar has increased Pasminco's U.S. dollar loan repayments, and caused
losses from its currency hedging.



Separately, Pasminco said it has failed to find a buyer for its 49%
stake in the Ernest Henry copper and gold mine in Queensland and will
now abandon the sale process for the time being. MIM Holdings Ltd.
(A.MIM) owns the remainder.



Analysts said Ernest Henry is unattractive because the stake doesn't
bring control of the asset, and the mine itself is too small for a big
company but too large for a little company.



Ernest Henry produces an average 95,000 metric tons of copper and
120,000 ounces of gold a year.



Pasminco said Ernest Henry is continuing to generate a profit and its
investment in the mine will now be refinanced.

 California SOUTHLAND FOCUS Fleetwood Says 4th-Quarter Earnings Drop 53%

 Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. reported a 53% drop in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and said first-quarter profit will be hurt as rising interest rates stifle demand. The maker of recreational vehicles and manufactured homes said net income fell to $11.4 million, or 37 cents a share after the payment of preferred dividends, from $24.5 million, or 66 cents after dividends, last year. Sales fell 5.7% to $893.9 million. The Riverside-based company had warned that profit would fall in the fourth quarter because of reduced demand for manufactured housing. It said sales of such homes will continue to fall in the first quarter because of excess inventory, tightened credit and rising interest rates. Fleetwood also said it's concerned about slowing sales and rising inventory of recreational vehicles and will cut production as a result. The profit warning was Fleetwood's fourth in about a year. The company didn't provide a specific forecast for first-quarter results. 

  It earned $26.4 million, or 72 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Fleetwood shares have fallen 44% over that period. Fleetwood closed up 6 cents at $14.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

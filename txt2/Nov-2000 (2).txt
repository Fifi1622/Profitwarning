 London's dismal techMARK heads to lifetime low.

 LONDON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - The London stock market's high-tech index, the techMARK, slumped close to its lifetime low on Thursday, after a dismal first year for the index that was meant to be a flagship for technology listings. 

 The index of 100 leading technology stocks, launched last November as part of London's strategy to match its U.S. and German rivals, is now almost back where it was a year ago and half its dizzying peak in March. 

 On Thursday, the techMARK was heading for a third straight day in which it has lost more than 100 points. By 1349 GMT, the index was down 104.6 points or 4.1 percent at 2,423.07. 

 Investors who chased techs up believing they could never lose value fell out of love with the sector in March on worries about astronomical valuations. 

 Things have continued to get worse with a string of earnings warnings from UK firms and from their cousins across the Atlantic taking their toll in recent weeks, sending the techMARK uncomforably close to its life low of 2,302.22, and well below its heady 5,753.46 peak in March. 

 And there is little sign of any immediate respite for the index, launched on November 4 last year and heralded as a London answer to New York's Nasdaq and the Neuer Markt in Germany. 

 Nick Glydon, director of technical analysis at Chase, said the techMARK was unlikely stop until it reached the 2,000-mark, its theoretical position in the summer of 1999 before tech mania began gripping the market in the fourth quarter of 1999. 

 "Basically there are an awful lot of technology stocks that are a lot higher than they were 18 months ago," he said. "That's where we think it is going back to, just deflating the bubble." 

 On Thursday, the damage was done by two warnings overnight, from U.S. semiconductor maker Altera Corp and personal computer maker Gateway Inc , sending futures in the U.S. tech-heavy Nasdaq index sharply lower. 

 SHATTERED CONFIDENCE 

 But they are only the latest of the big U.S. tech names to shatter confidence in the sector, sending the UK market tumbling as it plays out a now traditional role of mirroring moves across the Atlantic. 

 "Whereas in the past the market was pretty much prepared to take everything on trust, it is no prepared to take nothing at all on trust," said Richard Donner, managing director of Granville Baird's technology group. 

 He said investors' pessimism may be overdone. "When markets move very strongly in one direction or another they tend to overshoot. They overshot certainly in the first quarter of this year, and arguably they're overshooting...now," Donner added. 

 That is little consolation after a rough first year for the techMARK, but its rivals have little to crow about. 

 The techMARK, Neuer Markt and Nasdaq are all down more than 30 percent on the start of the year. 

 The UK tech index has watched some of its biggest names hammered by fears about corporate earnings, as investors have turned tail and fled from the volatile sector. 

 "The market basically pushed all of them up almost without any differentiation and by the same token they're all getting slammed on the way down again," said one equity salesman about Thursday's mauling in the technology sector. 

 "It's not as though the technological revolution has suddenly stopped," he added. 

 Among the big fallers on Thursday, Irish security software supplier Baltimore Technologies plunged 10.2 percent to 285-1/2 pence, after surging to 15 pounds in February, while chip designer ARM Holdings , dropped 6.2 percent and is now worth less than half its peak of more than 10 pounds. 

 Former stock market darling, Bookham Technology , has now plunged below its 10 pounds April flotation price, and well below its July peak of more than 54 pounds. 

 Elsewhere, software services firm Sema Group , which slid 44 percent last week on the back of a profit warning, was still struggling to find support, dropping 6.8 percent.

 Lehman Clears Up Its Position On CP Kelco's EUR255M Bond

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Lehman Brothers officials Thursday defended the bank's recent actions as lead underwriter in U.S. food additives producer CP Kelco's EUR255 million 10-year high-yield bond, which saw its price halve two weeks ago following profit warnings. 

 The bank has been heavily criticized for not warning investors during the roadshow presentations held in early September that CP Kelco's third quarter profits would be lower than expected. CP Kelco is 70% owned by Lehman's private-equity arm. 

 Late Wednesday, the bank said it would back bonds held by original bondholders at a price of 80-82 cents on the dollar. 

 An official at Lehman Brothers in New York late Thursday elaborated, saying the figures used during the marketing presentations were those that were last available, dating from the end of July. 

 "Why would we, as a 70% shareholder, have closed on such a deal knowing those figures in advance? It just makes no sense. We have a much bigger stake as investors," the official said. 

 CP Kelco, rated B3/B-, released poor earning results early last week and was subsequently downgraded by Standard & Poor's. Its notes settled at 55-60 cents on the dollar, after earlier dropping 50 points on the profit warning the borrower gave ahead of final results. 

 Lehman Brothers subsequently halted all trading on the issue, awaiting further clarification from the borrower on its financial profile. CP Kelco officials then called a press conference Nov. 20, where they announced results and their financial outlook. Bondholders still weren't happy, calling for Lehman Brothers to buy the bonds back at face value. 

 "The 80-82 level is where we feel the bonds should trade and this is where we are now making a market for them," said the Lehman official. "We had to halt trading on the bonds without saying when we first got word from the borrower (on its financial figures) until CP Kelco made a formal announcement, otherwise we would have been restricting our clients in their trading by giving them nonpublic information," he added. 

 But traders early Thursday said investors who had bought bonds in the secondary market have still been hurt, as Lehman's offer applies only to initial bondholders. 

 Results from CP Kelco, rated B3/B-, released last week showed EBITDA for the third quarter was 33% lower on the previous year, while turnover was also lower than expected. 

 This triggered the borrower's need for a capital injection as well as a comprehensive financial and operating review. 

 Despite a $50 million injection by Lehman Brother's private-equity group, both S&P and Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed CP Kelco on negative outlook, while S&P reacted swiftly by lowering the borrower's rating one notch, to B-. 

 CP Kelco's EUR255 million bond was launched in September and was priced at par with a 11.875% yield. Over 150 accounts participated in the transaction, with the bulk of orders placed with European high-yield investors. 

 CP Kelco was bought out from Pharmacia Monsanto Biogums earlier this year, and is now owned by Hercules Food Gums and Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P.

 Lehman Compromises With Bondholders Of CP Kelco Aps

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Lehman Brothers reached a compromise with European investors Wednesday, formally announcing it would buy back U.S. food additives producer CP Kelco APs' EUR255 million 10-year bonds at a price of 80 cents on the dollar from original bondholders. 

 The whole fiasco has tainted the European high yield market in what has been a poor year all-together for the sector, say traders. Lehman Brothers' actions as lead manager of the bond are also regarded as questionable by many. 

 "Our clients are saying it is broadly the right thing to do. But they are also asking 'What about the people who bought in secondary?' We are saying, that is just the way it goes. The market is still a little naive, over here," said a trader at a U.S. bank in London. 

 Lehman Brothers was criticized for not warning investors during the roadshows held in early September that third-quarter profits at CP Kelco would be lower than expected. 

 The borrower is 70%-owned by Lehman's Private Equity arm and investors have argued Lehman bankers were certainly in the know and could have presented a more accurate picture of the borrower's financial profile. Lehman officials were unavailable for comment at the time of this report. 

 "These Chinese walls do really exist, mind you, but of course the whole episode has really tarnished the European high yield market's image, and specifically Lehman Brother's profile," says a head of European high yield at a European bank. 

 CP Kelco released poor earning results early last week and was subsequently downgraded by Standard and Poor's. Its notes settled at 55/60 cents on the dollar, after earlier dropping 50 points on the profit warning the borrower gave ahead of final results. 

 Lehman Brothers subsequently halted all trading on the issue leaving investors in the lurch before announcing the terms of its buyback. Lehman bankers said legal constraints had impeded them from reaching an agreement sooner. 

 Results from CP Kelco, rated B3/B-, released last week showed EBITDA for the third quarter was 33% lower than the previous year, while turnover was also lower than expected. 

 Competitive prices from substitute products weighed on margins which dropped 19% in its food segment. Although net debt fell slightly during the quarter, its leverage ratio stands at 6.6 times on an annualized basis, from 5.1 times at the end of June 2000. 

 This triggered the borrower's need for a capital injection as well as a comprehensive financial and operating review. 

 Despite a $50 million injection by shareholder Lehman Brother's private equity group, both agencies placed CP Kelco on negative outlook while Standard and Poor's reacted swiftly by lowering the borrower's rating one notch to B-. 

 Analysts remain vigilant on the credit awaiting asset sales and cost reduction measures, but most note the borrower does not have immediate liquidity concerns now, nor does it have a reliance on oil as a raw material, making earnings less cyclical. 

 CP Kelco's EUR255 million bond was launched in September amid less than auspicious market conditions and was priced at par with a 11.875% yield. 

 CP Kelco was bought-out from Pharmacia Monsanto Biogums earlier this year and is now owned by Hercules Food Gums and Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P.

Gateway Warning Slams Tech Sector; Gateway's News Takes Heavy Toll On Tech Stocks

Tech stocks plummeted in after-hours trading late yesterday as computer- maker Gateway warned that its fourth-quarter profits will be much less than expected because of weak holiday sales.

The gloomy forecast from the No. 2 direct seller of personal computers caught investors by surprise and sparked a stampede to get out of PC and chip stocks before the start of trading today.

"This was a bombshell out of nowhere," said Art Russell, senior technology analyst at Edward Jones Co. in St. Louis. "Nobody was expecting this kind of weakness."

Adding to investors' jitters was an afternoon profit warning from chipmaker Altera, which said its sales are down "in all geographies."

Russell predicted wholesale carnage in today's trading. "Gateway will be decimated," he said, "as will most of the PC group and the tech sector as a whole."

Gateway's stock plunged more than 30 percent to $20 after the closing bell yesterday. The company said its quarterly profit will come in around 37 cents a share, well below the 62 cents expected by Wall Street.

In a conference call with analysts, John Todd, Gateway's chief financial officer, said the company had taken a close look at sales on the first weekend after Thanksgiving and "didn't see anything in the numbers that gave us confidence."

This sent a chill through investors, who already have weathered profit warnings from the likes of Intel Corp., Apple Computer and Dell Computer.

The selling quickly gathered force and, like a tsunami crashing ashore, swept up most leading tech names in its destructive path.

Intel dropped 12 percent to $37.69 in after-hours trading, while Dell tumbled 11 percent to $19.31 and Oracle Corp. fell nearly 8 percent to $21.13. For its part, Altera nose-dived more than 24 percent to $19.63.

Earlier yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index shed 28.05 points to close at a 13-month low of 2,706.93. The index is down 33 percent for the year.

Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 121.53 points to 10,629. 11, boosted by a government report showing that U.S. economic growth continues to slow. This strengthens the case for a possible cut in interest rates early next year.

The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.82 points to 1,341.91.

"The economy is slowing, and this is definitely impacting on earnings," said Rick Welty of Welty Capital Management in Lafayette. "But the overall economy is still pretty healthy, and we're probably looking at a rate cut."

Like Russell, he also expects a rocky start to trading today. But Welty said share prices could rebound "as people look for favorite stocks at the right price."

Analysts remain bullish about pharmaceutical and financial firms and are generally upbeat about the aerospace, telecom and consumer-goods sectors.

No one is prepared to call a bottom to the Nasdaq's slide. The tech-heavy index is down almost 50 percent from its record high in March. If it remains at current levels through December, it is facing its worst year since 1974.

Still, few analysts are advising investors to cut and run altogether from tech stocks. Most see real bargains emerging from the ashes of the sector's wildfire.

"The technology sector was way overvalued," said John Scarborough, a partner at the San Francisco investment firm of Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough. "Things have finally gotten back to more reasonably priced valuations."

He said investors overreacted yesterday when they heard the bad news from Gateway. The outlook for tech stocks remains bright, he said.

"Everyone should still have technology in their portfolios," Scarborough said. "You just have to take a long-term perspective."

High-techs low on appeal - Stock Market.

DEALERS talked of "indiscriminate selling" as technology, media and telecoms stocks plunged for the second day in a row. US economic figures showed a sharp slowdown in growth in the third quarter, to 2.4 per cent, against 5.4 per cent in the second quarter.

However, although many had feared that growth would be much worse, possibly below 2 per cent, the Nasdaq remained weak, after recording a 145-point fall on Tuesday. The FTSE 100 stayed resolutely in the red, shedding as much as 95.1 points by lunchtime before rallying slightly to end the day 84.9 off at 6,164.9.

Today is not expected to be as bad, with talk of European institutions starting to dip into the market for bargains.

The scale of the new economy problem was illustrated by Baltimore Technologies, which lost 23p to close at 318p despite the reiteration of long-term and intermediate buy recommendations from Merrill Lynch, although the broker did lower its price target to 800p, from #11.50. Baltimore's fall was, however, eclipsed by ARM Holdings, the semiconductor group, driven down 62p to 465p, mainly because of earnings fears.

Software groups remained under pressure. Hartmut Lademacher, resigned as a non-executive director of Sema at its board's request after controversy over the sale of 1.8 million shares for #24 million in the run-up to the group's profit warning. Mr Lademacher was the founder president of Atlanta-based LHS, a supplier of telecoms software, whose poor trading since its #2.6 billion acquisition in March was largely to blame for last week's warning. Sema fell 21p to 308p.

Dealers said there was no logical reason for groups such as Logica and CMG to suffer in its wake, but they continued to fall, losing 122p to #13.60 and 52p to 848p, respectively.

Amid all the technology gloom, profit-takers took bites out of CGNU, down 38p at #10.22, and Canary Wharf, off 32p at 513p.

There was little to show on the upside, although Vodafone helped to limit the FTSE fall with a 3 1/2p gain to 246p. Dealers talked warmly of Vodafone's ability to buy and sell businesses at the right time and produce the goods. This enabled it to avoid the carnage among its less weighty rivals.

Elsewhere, stocks with perceived defensive qualities, such as retailers and utilities, were among the few to find support. Sainsbury continued to tick up on hopes of a Schroder Ventures buy-up of Homebase, closing 12p ahead at 413 1/2p. Land Securities, the subject of positive noises from Deutsche Bank earlier in the week, rose 10p to 828 1/2p.

GILT-EDGED: Gilts ended lower, prompted by the US Treasury market's weakness. The December future lost 20p to #115.55. Long-dated bonds suffered profit-taking, with Treasury 8 per cent 2021 down 108p at #146.50, but shorter-dated issues held up on hopes of good interest rate news, Treasury 5 per cent 2004 finishing up 3p at #98.86.

NEW YORK: Blue chips gained as investors unloaded technology shares. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 121.53 at 10,629.11.

 NEW YORK - While a welcome assessment of the nation's economic health sent blue chip stocks rising Wednesday, investors again punished technology issues for their bleak earnings prospects. 

 A late earnings warning from computer maker Gateway sent tech prices diving even further in after-hours trading. That decline was expected to continue today, repeating a pattern that has become familiar in recent months as a series of high-profile and premium-priced computer and Internet companies announced disheartening results. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.53 to 10,629.11, but the Nasdaq composite index fell 28.05 to 2,706.93. The Nasdaq's decline gave it yet another new low for this year. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 5.84 to 1,341.93. 

 Gateway's bad news could bring a long-awaited bottom to the Nasdaq, one analyst said. 

 "Technology stocks are still likely to head lower. We saw irrational exuberance in these tech stocks at their peaks, but we're getting to more rational levels and we are getting a little too oversold," said Chris Dickerson, market analyst for Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga. "We're looking for capitulation and Gateway could give us that capitulation." 

 The tech selling, Dickerson said, likely won't spread to blue chips, which analysts have likened to a refuge for downtrodden investors. 

 Despite the decline in tech stocks, investors traded with cautious optimism on new evidence that the nation's economic growth is slowing, analysts said. The Commerce Department said Wednesday the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent during the summer, the slowest rate in four years and a steep decline from the rocketing 5.6 percent registered in the second quarter. 

 The technology sector, already punished for its dismal performance, tumbled further after Gateway's profit warning. 

 Gateway fell 40 cents in extended trading after plunging $10.70, or 34.5 percent, to $20.30 in the regular session. Dell Computer lost another $2.45 in extended dealings after ending the regular session down 63 cents at $21.81. 

 Microsoft, which fell $1.94 to close at $65.06 in regular trading, gave up $2.06 in after-hours dealings. 

 Throughout Wednesday, investors continued their migration to Old Economy stocks, because their earnings are seen as more predictable. 

 McDonald's rose $1.25 to close at $32.50.

 CHICAGO, Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. interest rate futures were higher in early dealings on Thursday, bolstered in large part by continued weakness in U.S. equities. 

 "There's a lot of concern about the equities markets. That's the major factor," said one debt futures analyst at a large U.S. brokerage house. 

 "A lot of people feel weakness in tech stocks reduces the Fed's concern about overvaluation in the stock market," the analyst said. 

 Weakness in stocks overnight stemmed from a profit warning issued late Wednesday by personal computer maker Gateway, which said fourth quarter sales and profits would fall short of Wall Street estimates. 

 Economic data released this morning did little to deter buying in debt futures, although the decline in U.S. jobless claims had been expected, analysts said. 

 Still, claims rose in the latest week to their highest level in more than two years and "the four-week moving average is above 340,000," said Jim Collins, senior vice president at Salomon Smith Barney. 

 "People are talking about a hard landing. There's a term we haven't heard for a while and all of a sudden it's on everyone's lips," Collins said. 

 U.S. personal income in October slipped 0.2 percent while spending rose 0.2 percent, contributing to a record 0.8 percent fall in the savings rate, the Commerce Department said. 

 March debt futures contracts with maturities of two years and longer rose to new contract highs in early pit dealings for the second day in a row. 

 Traders cited resistance in the March T-bond contract at 102-10/32, the high of the day and the new contract high, which also corresponds to a cash bond yield of about 5-5/8 percent, according to Optima Investment Research. 

 In the March note contract, resistance is at 102-26/32, which is about equal to a cash yield of 5-1/2 percent, and just above the new contract high of 102-24/32 set in early pit dealings. 

 Analysts also said uncertainty about the election that has resulted in some flight-to-quality buying in recent weeks also provided a firm undertone. 

 Traders await the release of the National Association of Purchasing Management Chicago index for November, which analysts expect will come in at 48.9 compared to 48.7 the prior month. 

 At 8:39 a.m. CST (1439 GMT), March bonds were up 10/32 at 102-05/32, 10-year notes rose 8.5/32 to 102-21/32, five-year notes were up 5/32 at 101-27/32, two-year notes were 3.25/32 higher at 100-24.5/32, muni bonds were gained 4/32 at 100-41/32, and June Eurodollars were up 4 basis points to 93.810.

 UPDATE 3-Tech stocks hammered after Gateway sales warning.

 LOS ANGELES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A surprise warning of weak fourth-quarter sales by personal computer maker Gateway Inc. hammered technology stocks across the board on Thursday, from software giant Microsoft to chip-maker Intel. 

 The latest in a string of companies bearing bad news for the once-booming tech industry, Gateway on Wednesday cautioned that sales in its crucial holiday season fourth quarter would slow. 

 That advisory drove technology stocks sharply lower in after-hours trading Wednesday and spilled over into even steeper losses at the end of regular stock market trade on Thursday. 

 "The sentiment for sure has been deteriorating fast in the past few months, and the bad news from Gateway didn't help much," said Stephen Gauthier, fund manager at Montreal-based National Bank's Global Technologies Fund. 

 Gateway's announcement that its operating earnings per share for the quarter could miss expectations by as much as 40 percent confirmed analyst fears of a major slowdown, formally adding PC firms to a growing list of troubled tech companies. 

 The stock of Gateway, No. 4 U.S. PC maker, lost more than a third of its value on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping $10.50, or 36 percent, to close at $19 - its lowest level since summer 1999, and down from its year high of $81.50. 

 Gateway, which until recently had been outperforming the S&P 500 index, was now underperforming it by more than 70 percent for the year. 

 Rival PC makers also suffered. 

 Dell Computer Corp. was off $2-9/16 at $19-1/4 in late Nasdaq trade, Compaq Computer Corp. fell $1.20 to $21.50 on the NYSE, and Apple Computer Inc. closed down $1-1/16 to $16-1/2. 

 Hewlett-Packard Co. saw its shares fall 8.5 percent or $2-15/16 to $31-5/8 after it said U.S. PC sales were softer than expected but reaffirmed its revenue and earnings forecasts for fiscal 2001. 

 The Philadelphia box maker index , comprising the top computer makers, fell 12.24 points, or 9 percent, to 125.71, its lowest level in more than 2 years and about half its year-high of 244 hit on Sept. 1. 

 EVEN INDUSTRY LEADERS VULNERABLE 

 As investors shunned technology stocks, even the traditionally strong issues traded lower. 

 Microsoft Corp. , the No. 1 personal computer software maker, fell 12 percent, losing $7-11/16 to $57-3/8, while top chip maker Intel Corp. , dropped 11 percent, down $4-11/16 to $38-1/16. Cisco Systems , the world's largest networking equipment maker, fell 7 percent, closing down $3-13/16 to $47-7/8. 

 Electronics retailers also lost ground with Best Buy Co. off $4-1/16, or nearly 14 percent, to $25-3/4, Circuit City Stores Inc. ended down 13/16 or 6 percent to $12-11/16, and RadioShack Corp. off $3-15/16, some 8 percent, to $46-7/8. 

 General U.S. economic and political uncertainty also appeared to weigh on technology stocks, with recent data confirming an economic slowdown and the presidential election still unresolved, analysts said. 

 "We think really the possibility of recession next year is up," Gauthier said. "Despite the New Economy thinking, tech stocks are cyclicals." 

 Another factor he cited for the recent sell-off was margin selling, the practice of investors who have bought on margin - or with funds borrowed from a brokerage - selling when stock prices fall sharply to meet their brokers' requirements. 

 Yet patient investors might find some good opportunities to buy stock of sturdier firms in the technology sector, he said. Gauthier cited software giant Oracle Corp. , which he owns, as shares closed up $3-5/8 or 16 percent to $26-1/2. 

 WALL STREET DOWNGRADES HURT 

 Wall Street analysts scurried to change their forecasts on Gateway to reflect the slack holiday sales. Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Banc of America Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston all downgraded Gateway, citing its downward revision of fourth-quarter revenues. 

 Gateway on Wednesday said fourth-quarter results would fall well below analysts' and its own forecasts after disappointing Thanksgiving weekend sales. It said revenues would be about $2.55 billion, a $500 million reduction from prior estimates. 

 "The moral of this part of the story is that it's all in the gauging of expectations, and Gateway, while indeed the victim of economic conditions beyond its control, took an optimistic tack at the end of the third quarter that it could not fulfill," JP Morgan analysts wrote in a report. 

 San Diego-based Gateway had been considered a more resilient PC maker, as it kept optimistic revenue forecasts even after Apple and Dell sales warnings earlier this year. 

 Other than Gateway, specialty chipmaker Altera Inc. on Wednesday had more bad news for investors, issuing its second profit sales warning in less than a month. San Jose, Calif.-based Altera was downgraded on Thursday by Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Robertson Stephens. 

 Altera was off $2 or nearly 8 percent, at $23-15/16, and its main rival Xilinx. Inc. was off $4, or 9 percent, at $39.

 LOS ANGELES, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A surprise warning by personal computer maker Gateway Inc. of weak fourth-quarter sales sent technology stocks down across the board on Thursday. 

 In just the latest of a string of bad news for the once-booming tech industry, Gateway on Wednesday warned of slowing sales in the crucial fourth quarter. 

 That warning drove technology stocks sharply lower in after-hours trading and spilled over into steep losses as the stock market opened on Thursday morning. 

 "All of them are under severe pressure. The whole sector has been whacked. And no one is going to want to sit back and differentiate who has the better business model," U.S. Piper Jaffray analyst Ashok Kumar said late on Wednesday. 

 Gateway's announcement that operating earnings per share for the quarter could miss expectations by as much as 40 percent confirmed analyst fears of a major slowdown, formally adding PC makers to a growing list of troubled tech companies. 

 Shares of Gateway, the No. 4 U.S. PC maker, lost more than a third of their value in the first half hour of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, dropping $11, or 37 percent, to $18.50 - their lowest level since the summer of 1999. 

 Rival PC makers also suffered. Dell Computer Corp. was off $1-11/16 at $20-1/8, Compaq Computer Corp. dropped $3.09 to $19.61, and Apple Computer Inc. lost 13/16 to $16-3/4. 

 The losses extended beyond PC makers. 

 Microsoft Corp. , the leading maker of personal computer software, fell more than 5 percent, or $4, to $61-1/16, while top chip maker Intel Corp. , dropped more than 10 percent, or $4-5/16, to 38-7/16. 

 The news of slack holiday sales at Gateway led to downgrades from Wall Street analysts. 

 Brokerages Salomon Smith Barney and JP Morgan both downgraded Gateway, citing its downward revision of fourth-quarter revenues. 

 San Diego-based Gateway said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter results would fall well below analyst and its own forecasts after disappointing Thanksgiving weekend sales. It said revenues would be about $2.55 billion, a $500 million reduction from prior estimates.

 Altera was off $3, or nearly 12 percent, at $22-15/16, and its main rival, Xilinx. Inc., was off $3-7/8, or 9 percent, at $39-1/8.

At an investment meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, analysts grilled Gateway CEO Jeffrey Weitzen, with some asking him if he deliberately lowered expectations so that his stock would pop when things don't turn out so bad in the fullness of time. Weitzen denies that any games are being played here, but acknowledges that Gateway's profit warning, issued after the markets closed yesterday, is, quote, "worst case."

It doesn't take years of Jungian analysis to figure out what disturbed investors in computer companies today. It was one of the biggest retail computer companies in the country coming out and saying that its sales did not go well over the Thanksgiving weekend; `considerably weaker than expected,' is the actual phrase Gateway used. Some analysts are criticizing Gateway for reading too much into one weekend's worth of data, but the company's CEO is sticking by the warning, saying a slow economy is to blame. Gateway shares closed down more than 35 percent. The NASDAQ Composite, at one point today, was trading down 6.8 percent; but at the end, the loss was 4 percent, 109 points. The Dow, at one point today, was down 336 points; but it ended with a loss of 214 points, or 2 percent. Bob Moon has the story.   

BOB MOON reporting:   

Frustration with high-tech stocks turned to outright fear today on the heels of Gateway's profit warning. Not only did it hit other computer and related high-tech stocks, it unleashed a marketwide wave of selling.   

Mr. MIKE SHELDON (Spencer Clark): There's certainly a lot of carnage out there. It's a scary market to be perfectly honest. The average NASDAQ stock today is down 52 percent from its high earlier this year.   

MOON: But amid distant rumblings from some analysts of possible hard landings or even a recession, it's important to note there were raise of hopes glinting through the storm clouds.   

Mr. SHELDON: We are relatively optimistic. I'd say generally optimistic about the next 12 to 18 months.   

MOON: Mike Sheldon is chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke.   

Mr. SHELDON: We think things will get better and stabilize over the near term. We think we're near bottom. Some of the catalysts to help the market are the fact that there's about $4 trillion in savings and money market mutual funds on the sidelines, cash on the sidelines waiting to come in. We think the Fed is going to go to a neutral by December and possibly cut rates in the first part of next year. And we think the election will get solved by early December. So these are some of the things which should help alleviate market concerns.   

MOON: But even if the clouds do clear, the fair weather may come too late for those hit by margin calls, investors who can't wait out the market because they're forced to pay back the loans they made to buy stock in the first place. Dallas stock broker and business analyst David Johnson says that sell-off fed on itself today.   

Mr. DAVID JOHNSON (Dallas Stock Broker; Business Analyst): People have been losing money and losing it rapidly, and they have to pay the piper at some point. At some point, you have to sell the stock and pay back the money you borrowed.   

MOON: Johnson worries that once a sell-off like this starts, it's difficult to stop. Though encouragement from the Fed and a resolution to the presidential stalemate could help the dust to settle, he says investors need some good news and they need it soon.   

Mr. JOHNSON: There's nothing wrong with a slowdown in the economy. The economy coming to an abrupt halt, now that's a problem.   

MOON: I'm Bob Moon for MARKETPLACE.

 Lehman Clears Up Its Position On CP Kelco's EUR255M Bond

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Lehman Brothers officials Thursday defended the bank's recent actions as lead underwriter in U.S. food additives producer CP Kelco's EUR255 million 10-year high-yield bond, which saw its price halve two weeks ago following profit warnings. 

 The bank has been heavily criticized for not warning investors during the roadshow presentations held in early September that CP Kelco's third quarter profits would be lower than expected. CP Kelco is 70% owned by Lehman's private-equity arm. 

 Late Wednesday, the bank said it would back bonds held by original bondholders at a price of 80-82 cents on the dollar. 

 An official at Lehman Brothers in New York late Thursday elaborated, saying the figures used during the marketing presentations were those that were last available, dating from the end of July. 

 "Why would we, as a 70% shareholder, have closed on such a deal knowing those figures in advance? It just makes no sense. We have a much bigger stake as investors," the official said. 

 CP Kelco, rated B3/B-, released poor earning results early last week and was subsequently downgraded by Standard & Poor's. Its notes settled at 55-60 cents on the dollar, after earlier dropping 50 points on the profit warning the borrower gave ahead of final results. 

 Lehman Brothers subsequently halted all trading on the issue, awaiting further clarification from the borrower on its financial profile. CP Kelco officials then called a press conference Nov. 20, where they announced results and their financial outlook. Bondholders still weren't happy, calling for Lehman Brothers to buy the bonds back at face value. 

 "The 80-82 level is where we feel the bonds should trade and this is where we are now making a market for them," said the Lehman official. "We had to halt trading on the bonds without saying when we first got word from the borrower (on its financial figures) until CP Kelco made a formal announcement, otherwise we would have been restricting our clients in their trading by giving them nonpublic information," he added. 

 But traders early Thursday said investors who had bought bonds in the secondary market have still been hurt, as Lehman's offer applies only to initial bondholders. 

 Results from CP Kelco, rated B3/B-, released last week showed EBITDA for the third quarter was 33% lower on the previous year, while turnover was also lower than expected. 

 This triggered the borrower's need for a capital injection as well as a comprehensive financial and operating review. 

 Despite a $50 million injection by Lehman Brother's private-equity group, both S&P and Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed CP Kelco on negative outlook, while S&P reacted swiftly by lowering the borrower's rating one notch, to B-. 

 CP Kelco's EUR255 million bond was launched in September and was priced at par with a 11.875% yield. Over 150 accounts participated in the transaction, with the bulk of orders placed with European high-yield investors. 

 CP Kelco was bought out from Pharmacia Monsanto Biogums earlier this year, and is now owned by Hercules Food Gums and Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P.

 Lehman Compromises With Bondholders Of CP Kelco Aps

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Lehman Brothers reached a compromise with European investors Wednesday, formally announcing it would buy back U.S. food additives producer CP Kelco APs' EUR255 million 10-year bonds at a price of 80 cents on the dollar from original bondholders. 

 The whole fiasco has tainted the European high yield market in what has been a poor year all-together for the sector, say traders. Lehman Brothers' actions as lead manager of the bond are also regarded as questionable by many. 

 "Our clients are saying it is broadly the right thing to do. But they are also asking 'What about the people who bought in secondary?' We are saying, that is just the way it goes. The market is still a little naive, over here," said a trader at a U.S. bank in London. 

 Lehman Brothers was criticized for not warning investors during the roadshows held in early September that third-quarter profits at CP Kelco would be lower than expected. 

 The borrower is 70%-owned by Lehman's Private Equity arm and investors have argued Lehman bankers were certainly in the know and could have presented a more accurate picture of the borrower's financial profile. Lehman officials were unavailable for comment at the time of this report. 

 "These Chinese walls do really exist, mind you, but of course the whole episode has really tarnished the European high yield market's image, and specifically Lehman Brother's profile," says a head of European high yield at a European bank. 

 CP Kelco released poor earning results early last week and was subsequently downgraded by Standard and Poor's. Its notes settled at 55/60 cents on the dollar, after earlier dropping 50 points on the profit warning the borrower gave ahead of final results. 

 Lehman Brothers subsequently halted all trading on the issue leaving investors in the lurch before announcing the terms of its buyback. Lehman bankers said legal constraints had impeded them from reaching an agreement sooner. 

 Results from CP Kelco, rated B3/B-, released last week showed EBITDA for the third quarter was 33% lower than the previous year, while turnover was also lower than expected. 

 Competitive prices from substitute products weighed on margins which dropped 19% in its food segment. Although net debt fell slightly during the quarter, its leverage ratio stands at 6.6 times on an annualized basis, from 5.1 times at the end of June 2000. 

 This triggered the borrower's need for a capital injection as well as a comprehensive financial and operating review. 

 Despite a $50 million injection by shareholder Lehman Brother's private equity group, both agencies placed CP Kelco on negative outlook while Standard and Poor's reacted swiftly by lowering the borrower's rating one notch to B-. 

 Analysts remain vigilant on the credit awaiting asset sales and cost reduction measures, but most note the borrower does not have immediate liquidity concerns now, nor does it have a reliance on oil as a raw material, making earnings less cyclical. 

 CP Kelco's EUR255 million bond was launched in September amid less than auspicious market conditions and was priced at par with a 11.875% yield. 

 CP Kelco was bought-out from Pharmacia Monsanto Biogums earlier this year and is now owned by Hercules Food Gums and Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P.

 US Bond Markets-Quality yields drop as economy slows.

 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - U.S. market interest rates slid further on Wednesday after the government said the economy grew at its slowest pace in four years in the third quarter and sinking U.S. tech stocks boosted the allure of the safest bonds. 

 Signs a record economic boom is losing momentum, fears that evaporating stock market wealth will curb growth even more, and concerns over high levels of corporate indebtedness have raised the odds the Federal Reserve may have to ease credit to curb any risk of a recession. 

 In the Treasury market, yields on benchmark 10-year notes hit lows not seen since May 1999, a month before the Fed started hiking short-term interest rates by 1.75 percentage points over 11 months to brake hot economic growth. 

 Government-guaranteed agency debt largely kept pace with the red-hot Treasury market while mortgage-backed securities lagged Treasuries. 

 In the corporate bond market, investment-grade yield spreads to Treasuries were also little changed, but companies trying to sell new bonds were being forced to offer higher interest rates to entice investors. 

 Prices of junk bonds, the lowest-rated corporate bonds, fell about one point. 

 Dollar interest rate swap spreads were mostly unchanged, but traders said there was a flurry of interest by investors to receive fixed-interest payments in anticipation of possible future Fed interest rate cuts. 

 The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the July-September period, its slowest pace in four years, down from an earlier estimate of 2.7 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP). 

 That marks a dramatic slowdown from the robust 5.6 percent pace of growth in the second quarter. 

 "The economy is slowing and there is very good reason to believe that the Fed will move to a neutral risk stance and sometime in the first quarter will cut rates," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset Management. 

 After hiking short-term rates six times since June 1999, Fed policy makers have said they stand ready to raise rates further at any signs inflation may be heating up, so shifting to a neutral stance would be interpreted as a greater willingness to lower rates. 

 At the 5 p.m. close (2200 GMT), two-year Treasury notes US2YT=RR gained 5/32 to 100-2/32, as their yield fell to 5.72 percent. Five-year notes US5YT=RR were up 10/32 at 101-4/32, yielding 5.48 percent. 

 Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR climbed 15/32 to 101-20/32, yielding 5.53 percent. Thirty-year bonds US30YT=RR rose 15/32 to 108-20/32, yielding 5.65 percent. 

 Treasuries extended strong gains shortly before the close as the No. 4 U.S. computer maker Gateway Inc issued an after-hours profit warning, signalling more technology stock carnage ahead. 

 The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index, which crumbled Wednesday to another record low close for the year, has lost more than a fifth of its value in three weeks. 

 Investors often shelter funds in low-risk debt markets to hedge against steep stock market losses. 

 Peter McTeague, Treasury strategist at Greenwich Capital Markets, said Treasuries were finding additional mileage from concerns over the ability of many corporations to repay debt burdens as a slowing economy clouds their earnings outlook. 

 And as yields on Treasuries have sunk 0.75 and 1 percentage point below the Fed's 6.50 percent benchmark federal funds - making them expensive to players who borrow from banks to buy securities - agency debt has also looked attractive. 

 "(Agency) credit spreads have actually been fairly steady even as Treasuries have been moving," McTeague said. 

 "I think credit spreads will continue to widen, but with 5-years (Treasuries) at 5.50 percent, agency benchmark 5-years look pretty cheap," he said. 

 A five billion euro Freddie Mac five-year note and $1 billion Federal Farm Credit Banks two-year bond sale sailed smoothly through the agency debt market on Wednesday, where both issues were said to sell out quickly. 

 In the corporate market, even strong, stable credits like Citigroup Inc were forced to pay up in the current environment. 

 Citigroup, the No. 1 U.S. financial services company, on Wednesday launched its $2.75 billion two-part global note sale, market sources said, at yield spreads three to 10 basis points wider than had been earlier expected.

 Blue chips higher, tech losses widen on Gateway earnings warning

 NEW YORK (AP) - While a welcome assessment of the nation's economic health sent blue chip stocks rising Wednesday, investors again punished technology issues for their bleak earnings prospects. 

 A late earnings warning from computer maker Gateway sent tech prices diving even further in after-hours trading. That decline was expected to continue Thursday, repeating a pattern that has become familiar in recent months as a series of high-profile and premium-priced computer and Internet companies announced disheartening results. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 121.53 to 10,629.11, but the Nasdaq composite index fell 28.05 to 2,706.93. The Nasdaq's decline gave it yet another new low for this year. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 5.82 to 1,341.91. 

 Gateway's bad news could bring a long-awaited bottom to the Nasdaq, one analyst said. 

 "Technology stocks are still likely to head lower. We saw irrational exuberance in these tech stocks at their peaks, but we're getting to more rational levels and we are getting a little too oversold," said Chris Dickerson, market analyst for Global Market Strategists in Gainesville, Ga. "We're looking for capitulation and Gateway could give us that capitulation." 

 The tech selling, Dickerson said, likely won't spread to blue chips, which analysts have likened to a refuge for downtrodden investors. 

 Despite the decline in tech stocks, investors traded with cautious optimism on new evidence that the nation's economic growth is slowing, analysts said. The Commerce Department said Wednesday the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent last summer, the slowest rate in four years and a steep decline from the rocketing 5.6 percent registered in the second quarter. 

 Wall Street considered the report good news because the slowdown could be an incentive for the Federal Reserve to declare at its Dec. 19 meeting that inflation is less of a risk to the economy. That could be a precursor of lower interest rates. 

 "We're still feeling quite bullish on the market. The Fed likely will go to a more neutral bias, which is what today's GDP figure pointed to," said Eugene G. Mintz, financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. 

 While other recent reports have pointed to a slowing economy, investors have been waiting for a significant drop in the GDP, because it carries more weight with the Fed, analysts said. 

 The possibility of lower interest rates, Mintz said, would help mitigate some of the damage on Wall Street expected from fourth-quarter earnings disappointments. 

 "Earnings are going to be mainly weaker than people expected," he said, but added that history has shown that "lower interest rates will overpower disappointing earnings." 

 Investors have been selling since September because of lackluster results and worries about inflation, and have been focusing on pricey tech issues that aren't producing the same stellar profits as they did last year. 

 The technology sector, already punished for its dismal performance, tumbled further after Gateway's profit warning. 

 Gateway fell 40 cents in extended trading after plunging $10.70, or 34.5 percent, to $20.30 in the regular session. Dell Computer lost another $2.45 in extended dealings after ending the regular session down 63 cents at $21.81. 

 Microsoft, which fell $1.94 to close at $65.06 in regular trading, gave up $2.06 in after-hours dealings. 

 Throughout Wednesday, investors continued their migration to Old Economy stocks, because their earnings are seen as more predictable. 

 "You are seeing the rally in safe havens like McDonald's and drugs and places, like retailers, that have been washed out," said Jim Myers, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott. 

 McDonald's rose $1.25 to close at $32.50. 

 Drug and financial issues, often considered safer bets in uncertain or bearish markets, also boosted blue chips. Merck picked up $2.62 to trade at $94.88; Bank One rose $1.34 to $35.56. 

 Retailers, which have suffered on concerns that a dip in consumer confidence and the slowing economy would hamper holiday sales, were mixed. Wal-Mart advanced $2.34 to $51.75. The Limited fell $1.56 to $20.38 after releasing November sales results short of Wall Street's expectations. 

 The Russell 2000 index fell 4.42 to 454.60. 

 Declining issues traded evenly with advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.37 billion shares, up from Tuesday's 1.27 billion. 

 Overseas markets were lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.0 percent and Germany's DAX index lost 0.4 percent. Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.4 percent and France's CAC-40 lost 0.1 percent.

 Editorial - What next, maestro?

 ACCORDING to a new book, Maestro: Greenspan's Fed and the American Boom by Mr Bob Woodward, Mr Alan Greenspan once told his board: 'We are in a sense in economic-political policy turmoil. In that type of environment, it is crucial that there be some stable anchor in the economic system. It's got to be we.' That was 10 years ago, when America was slipping into a recession, and neither Congress nor the administration was willing to act. Ten years later, America is no longer in recession - on the contrary, it is still enjoying the longest period of uninterrupted growth in its history - but the policy paralysis that Mr Greenspan diagnosed before may well grip the country again. With the next President, whoever he is, lacking a mandate, and the next Congress almost evenly divided, Washington is likely to be gridlocked for the next two years. 

  With all of the other chief players of the past decade gone or going, there is only Mr Greenspan left to provide continuity and stability in economic policy. The public's confidence in him is one reason why the current unseemly battle for the presidency has so far not spooked the markets. The question is: What will he do? The consensus forecast for next year is for 3 per cent growth. Though that is a respectable figure, it would be the slowest since 1995, and well below this year's estimated 5 per cent. Indeed, many economists think a recession is a distinct possibility in 2002, if not in next year itself. The warning signs are in corporate profits, which are projected to grow by 0.9 next year, compared to this year's 15 per cent increase. A slowdown in profit growth may knock the stuffing out of the stock market, as nervous investors pull out of equities. That, in turn, would have an adverse impact on consumer spending, reduce capital investment, and make it difficult for new high-tech companies to get financing. To a certain extent, all this is already happening, for the recent turmoil in both the stock and bond markets has caused many blue-chip corporations to cut back on their investments and stalled the initial public offerings of Internet companies and biotech start-ups. Since corporate borrowings in recent years have far exceeded the pace of economic growth, it is not inconceivable that a general slowdown may lead to a wave of bankruptcies. Ten years ago, when a similar slowdown threatened the stability of banks, the Federal Reserve, with the full cooperation of Congress and the Bush administration, pumped a huge amount of liquidity into the system. Wall Street seems convinced that the Fed would do the same again, but it may be better if Mr Greenspan acted soon to forestall the occasion for a rescue, rather than wait for it to occur. The six rate increases that he has engineered in the past year have obviously worked to wring excess out of the economy. He has consistently denied targeting stock prices, but his rate hikes have nevertheless worked to subdue the market's 'irrational exuberance'. The problem is he may have succeeded only too well. A slowdown means declining earnings, which means falling stock prices, which, if precipitous, can lead to a further slowdown. Mr Greenspan has seen all this before, for when he first assumed office in 1987, the stock market was overvalued, and his decision to raise rates then arguably caused the market to crash in October of that year. He reversed course immediately, assuring banks and brokerages that the Fed stood ready to provide whatever liquidity was needed, but the damage had been done. If history is not to repeat itself, Mr Greenspan should perhaps signal soon an easing of monetary policy.

 *Saudi Oil Minister Says Uncertain OPEC Will Hike Output 

 MANAMA, Bahrain - (Dow Jones) Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi told the Arabic al-Hayat newspaper Saturday that he isn't certain that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would further boost its total output any time soon, or that oil prices would fall after the winter season. 

 "It's wrong to assert that we won't raise production (if prices remain at current levels)," he said on the sidelines of a meeting of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries in Cairo. "What we've been saying is that we want a stable market and a fair price...and to achieve this, we have to constantly follow up and study the market...and it isn't necessary that we'll increase supply because the price today is higher than our target," he added. However, Naimi said OPEC will maintain its current production level until Jan. 17, when the group is set to hold a meeting in Vienna. 

 Naimi said OPEC should be very cautious about deciding to increase production, because there is a big risk concerning market stability, since world oil inventories have begun to build up. 

 *New Iraq-U.N. Showdown May Send Oil Over $40; Markets Braced 

 LONDON (Dow Jones) - Benchmark physical Brent crude could hit $40 a barrel if Iraq makes good on its threat to halt exports as early as next week, and $50 a barrel if the break lasts two weeks or more, traders said Friday. Coming at the onset of winter, with U.S. heating oil stocks at their lowest October level on record, a withdrawal of Iraq's 2.2 million barrels a day of exports would boost demand for other sour crudes, and later sweet, as refiners seek alternatives in Europe, traders say. Iraq's crude exports represent around 3% of global daily consumption. 

 "You've got some people who are very concerned about sour supply. It's definitely an Iraqi thing," one trader said. "I think the incremental demand will be made up by sweet barrels because sour become so expensive; it costs more to run than sweet." 

 In the latest of a series of assaults against U.N. sanctions, Iraq has threatened to cut off supplies Dec. 1 to buyers who refuse to pay 50 cents a barrel in advance into an account outside U.N. control. Iraq has proposed a price for its December crude which traders say is 50 cents below the market value. The U.N. is unlikely to approve that price and buyers can't legally pay up the premium. 

 *Lack of West African Crude a Boon to Persian Gulf Sour Crudes 

 SINGAPORE (Dow Jones) - Middle East sour crude prices may find renewed support as Asian refiners cut imports of Brent-linked West African crudes in December, Asian crude trading sources said Monday. "The arbitrage window has slammed shut and we are seeing less and less of West African crudes to Asia," one West African crude supplier said. 

 The Brent-Dubai price differential is wider at US$4.40-$4.50 a barrel for January, compared with US$3-$3.50 a barrel two weeks ago. The current differential isn't narrow and economical enough for Asian buyers to soak up the Brent-linked grade, traders said. Swing supplies of West African crudes normally head to Asia if priced cheaply compared with the Asian benchmark Dubai crude. 

 *Philippine Proposed Petroleum Products Tax Cut to Cost 4 Billion Pesos in 2001 

 SINGAPORE (Dow Jones) - Proposed legislation to cut excise taxes on petroleum products could cost the Philippine government over 4 billion pesos (US$1=PHP49.41) in lost tax revenue in 2001, officials from the Departments of Finance and Energy said Monday. The Department of Finance estimates a House of Representatives bill to reduce petroleum products taxes by 10%-20% would cost PHP4 billion next year, reducing total tax revenues for the year by 0.63%-0.79%, an official said. 

 Energy Secretary Mario Tiaoqui, in an interview with local media late last week, put revenue losses from the tax cuts between PHP3.6 billion and PHP7.6 billion. Reducing the oil products tax would cushion the impact of rising global crude prices and the depreciating peso on domestic products prices, Tiaoqui said. The bill, which has been endorsed by the House Ways and Means committee, would cut wholesale taxes on diesel and kerosene by 20%, while taxes on gasoline and fuel oil would be reduced by 10%. 

 *India to Sign Oil Exploration Contract With Iraq 

 NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) will sign a contract with Oil Exploration Company of Iraq on Tuesday for exploration of Block No. 8 in Iraq's western desert, an industry official said on Monday. 

 "The two will sign the exploration contract for Block No. 8 tomorrow at the plenary session of the Indo-Iraq Joint Commission," the official, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters. "It allows OVL to undertake exploration-related activities which do not violate U.N. sanctions. All terms other than the date from which the contract will come into effect have been finalized," he said. 

 *Exxon Mobil, Guangzhou Petrochemical in Ethylene Expansion Talks 

 SINGAPORE (Dow Jones) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Guangzhou Petrochemical Corp., a unit of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec (SNP), are in talks to expand an existing ethylene cracker at Guangzhou Petrochemical, a Guangzhou official told Dow Jones Newswires Monday. He said the two companies signed an agreement to start the feasibility study of expanding the 130,000 metric ton a year ethylene cracker in June. 

 Exxon Mobil sent a task force to Guangdong in October for a field study. The partners are expected to submit the expansion proposal soon to the government for approval. Beijing-based industry sources said Exxon Mobil is likely to take a 50% stake in the project, which will see its capacity expanded to about 450,000 tons a year. 

 *Nigerian Oil Union Strikes, Monitors Work On 

 LAGOS, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigerian white-collar oil workers began on Monday an indefinite pay strike which could hit crude output of more than two million barrels a day from the West African country. The white-collar PENGASSAN oil workers' union said it had directed its members to suspend work both in the offices and oilfields after negotiations with the management of the oil companies did not yield results. 

 "Negotiations with our employers for an increase in minimum wage payable to workers failed, hence the strike," a PENGASSAN official told Reuters in Lagos. 

 But Nigeria's oil industry monitors of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), said they had not joined the strike. "We have not joined the strike because the government has just met our own demand for pay rise," a spokesman for the DPR PEGASSAN unit, Rasaq Adeshina, said. 

 *Shell Pakistan Says Oil Truckers End Strike Late Saturday 

 SINGAPORE (Dow Jones) - Pakistani oil truckers late Saturday ended their strike protesting Shell Pakistan Ltd.'s tanker upgrade program, a Karachi-based Shell Pakistan spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires Monday. A breakdown in government-mediated talks last week threatened to extend the strike into its second week. 

 The action - called by the All-Pakistan Oil Tankers Owners' Association - had disrupted the movement of gasoline distributed by Shell Pakistan from Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd.'s 100,000 barrel a day Mehmood Kot plant near central Punjab's Multan. The strikers oppose Shell Pakistan's modernization of its contracted 5,000-strong tanker truck fleet to European safety standards. 

 *Woodside Board Meets Tuesday on Shell Offer 

 MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum Ltd's board will hold a video-conference meeting on Tuesday to consider Royal Dutch/Shell's offer to take a controlling stake in the Australian oil and gas group, Woodside said on Monday. The 10-member board, including three Shell representatives, held its regular monthly meeting on Friday but would reconvene on Tuesday to consider Shell's bid to lift its stake in the company to around 56% from 34.3%. 

 *Enron Denies Profit-Warning Rumors, Says it is Comfortable with Estimates 

 HOUSTON (Dow Jones) - Enron Corp. denied rumors of a potential profit warning untrue, and said it is comfortable with analysts' expectations for the fourth quarter of 2000 and fiscal 2001. Jeff Skilling, president and chief operating officer of the energy concern, said all of its businesses are "performing extremely well." Analysts expect the company to earn about 35 cents a share in the fourth quarter, $1.42 a share in 2000 and $1.66 a share in fiscal 2001. 

 *Thai Petrochemical Creditors Approve Debt Plan, But Further Battles May Loom 

 BANGKOK (Dow Jones) - Creditors of Thai Petrochemical Industry PCL overwhelmingly approved a long-awaited $3.7 billion debt-restructuring plan Monday, but they fear a three-year war with its founder and main shareholder, Prachai Leophairatana, may be far from over. A creditor leaving the meeting told reporters the debt plan was approved by 96% of the company's creditors. 

 The plan calls for an $800 million debt-to-equity swap, which will result in a 75% holding in the company by its creditors. Another $200 million is expected to be raised from the sale of noncore assets. 

 The case of Southeast Asia's biggest petrochemical group is a major test of Thailand's ability to resolve the billions of dollars in bad loans that Thai companies owe. The plan prepared by Effective Planners Ltd., a subsidiary of Australian accounting firm Ferrier Hodgson, was approved by creditors despite protests by thousands of TPI employees who disrupted two attempts to meet and vote on the plan earlier this month.

 *Spain's Endesa Says it Plans Make an Offer for Dutch Energy Concern Remu 

 MADRID (Dow Jones) - Endesa SA plans to launch an offer for Dutch energy concern Remu NV, according to an Endesa spokeswoman. But a possible price-tag for the unlisted Dutch company wasn't disclosed. 

 Endesa, Spain's largest electricity power producer, has been betting on an eventual single European energy market, and is keen to participate in consolidation in the sector. Earlier this month, the company announced that it had purchased a 30% stake in French electricity producer Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermique, or SNET, for $310.1 million. 

 A spokeswoman for Remu said she was surprised by the statements from Endesa (ELE), but reiterated comments made earlier this year that the company is looking for a partner. She declined to speculate on possible buyers or whether Remu is in talks with Endesa. 

 *Chernobyl Reactor Shut Down, Possibly Forever 

 KIEV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Power line failures forced the shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear power station on Monday, and a top atomic energy official said there may be no point in turning it back on less than three weeks before its final closure. A cold snap brought havoc to Ukraine's creaking national power grid, leaving millions without electricity. 

 A spokeswoman for atomic energy agency Enerhoatom said a sudden drop in demand due to a power line fault caused the shutdown of the last functioning reactor at Chernobyl, site of the worst civilian nuclear disaster in 1986. Another reactor at the South Ukraine power station was also forced out of action after engineers found a leak in a steam generator, officials said. There was no increase in radiation levels around either power station. 

 Chernobyl is due to be shut down for good on December 15, and Vadim Hryshchenko, the acting director of Ukraine's atomic energy regulator told Reuters it might not be turned back on. He said there was a preliminary plan to restart the reactor on December 2, but added: "It's a completely reasonable question - is it worth our while restarting the reactor if it will only work for a few days before being turned off forever?"

 REGULATORY & ENVIRONMENT 

 *Struggle Between Utilities and Customers May Affect Future of Energy Deregulation 

 LOS ANGELES - When California utilities got into financial trouble in the past, regulators usually let them hit their captive customers with the bill. The deregulation of the electricity industry here two years ago was supposed to change that. It may not have. The state's two biggest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co., are back pressing lawmakers, judges and regulators to let them pass on to customers billions of dollars in costs arising under the troubled deregulation program, which just isn't working as planned, the Wall Street Journal reported. The case, pitting utilities and their investors against the public, is shaping up as a titanic struggle that could affect the future of energy deregulation not only here but across the U.S. 

 Before deregulation, the price of electricity was tied to investments made by utilities in generating and transmission facilities. Under the new scheme, the utilities had to give up their monopolies, sell many of their plants and buy their juice from a state-sanctioned wholesale market. That market was assumed to be big and transparent enough to offer the lowest possible prices. Deregulation's architects promised that in a few years the prices consumers paid for power would fall at least 30%. 

 *EU, U.S. Trade Charges Over Climate Talks Failure 

 THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The United States and European Union blamed each other on Sunday for the collapse of world climate talks while much of the rest of the world held them both responsible for the fiasco. Saturday's chaotic breakup of the two-week Hague conference left the fight against global warming in disarray. Activists and poor nations poured scorn on the failure of the gas-guzzling richest countries to stop squabbling over the cost of cleaning the planet and unite to tackle climate change which is already being blamed for extreme weather conditions in many parts of the world. 

 "The failure of these talks is a disaster. No words can truly express our anger," said the Friends of the Earth group. 

 The Hague conference had been trying to agree on steps to implement a pact reached in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 calling for a 5% average cut in developed nations' 1990 levels of emissions by 2010. Delegates said a compromise deal on steps to implement Kyoto hatched by some EU countries and Washington had been rejected at the 11th hour by the broad membership of the 15-nation EU.

 Brooklyn's Craft Brewers Guild has never been a conventional beer distributorship. Now they might just turn the tier on its ear. 

 The Brooklyn Brewery began distributing its own beer on a "temporary basis" when Tom Potter and Steve Hindy started the company back in the mid-1980s. A fellow Brooklyn beverage pioneer, the founder of SoHo natural sodas, had advised them that the best course for a new beverage product in New York was self distribution. So the partners began to truck their contract-brewed Brooklyn Lager and Brooklyn Brown to accounts throughout the borough. Over the years, the contract brewer became a true brewer, with the construction of the Brooklyn Brewery in Green Point. The brewery's evolution was paralleled by the growth of the distributorship-from a limited self-distribution operation to a full-fledged specialty beer distributor. The distribution company is now called the Craft Brewers Guild, and handles a broad portfolio of the world's best-known specialty beers in the metro New York area. (The Craft Brewers Guild also operates a Massachusetts distributorship, handling many local Massachusetts brands in addition to i ts portfolio of micros and imports:). The Craft Brewers Guild has now embarked on a dramatic new program aiming at building depth in its home market. Under this program, called totalbeer.com, consumers in metro New York can now contact Brooklyn on the web, and order beer for next-day delivery to their homes. This novel concept is just the latest wrinkle from what might be America's most agile beer company. Our talk with Brooklyn Brewery and Craft Brewers Guild co-founder Tom Potter follows. 

 Modern Brewery Age: I gather you planned to self-distribute as only a temporary expedient... 

 TOM POTTER: Yes. We started distributing ourselves in Brooklyn. We had two trucks and a van. For Manhattan, Long Island and Westchester, we took on beer distributors. These were independents, the classic "all other" second-tier houses. And our experience was pretty miserable with them. By 1991, we could have turned over all distribution to some other distributor. We were a million-dollar company, and we were starting to become attractive. All of the traditional beer distributors would have taken our brands. We had an established product, we were growing, we had good margins, and a good reputation, although of course we were still relatively small. The problem was that by then we had been doing our own distribution here for a couple of years. We were in those basements, looking at the other guy's drivers. We were next in line listening to the other guy's salespeople give their pitch for their products. And we had a hard time imagining we could hand our beer over to these other guys. Because they did not unders tand our products. They didn't understand what our beer was. Their whole pitch was different. 

 Conventional distributors are built, efficiently, around a different proposition--high volume, lower margin items. That's how they work. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with that, but for our kind of beer, there was not a recognition in the early 1990s of what an expensive, high-quality American beer was all about. 

 Around that time, all of our senior managers went up to Vermont for a long weekend, and we hashed out what we were going to do. The question was whether to get out of distribution, or jump in with both feet. That was in 1991, and we had been in business for about three years. At the end of that weekend, we had decided on our course. We would jump in with both feet, and take on other products. Initially, we would just distribute for friends, other people in the American micro movement, and some of the smaller importers. Some of these were people who were already in New York, but not doing well with the other distributors. It started slowly, in 1991, and 1992, with a few products, and then in a rush, between 1993-1995. By the end of 1995, almost all the well-established specialty beers in the New York market came to us. Some who had not been in the market, because they didn't feel they had a good choice, came on board with us. One of those was Sierra Nevada. I had gone out to Chico and spoken with Steve Harris on back in 1990. We loved his beers, but they were doing terribly on the East Coast. They were in Connecticut and New Jersey, but not in New York. And they were flopping in both states, although the product was just fantastic. So we tried to convince them to give us a chance. 

 By 1996, we had assembled our current portfolio. Not all of the beers on the market, but most of the good beers that are below the nationally advertised level. Food & Wine did their list of the 100 best beers in 1996-97, and on that list 75 beers were sold in New York, and we carried 62 of them. We built a very dominant portfolio of high-end beers. We essentially stopped taking on new products, as of 1996-97. We had 30 suppliers at the time, and we have about the same number now. A few have left, we dropped a few, and we've added a few. But in the last year, we've only added two breweries, and dropped two. We're still open to additional beers, but we want a portfolio that contains beers that compliment each other. We don't want additional beers just for the sale of having additional beers. From the U.K. we represent Fuller's, Young's and Sam Smith's. We view those as classy brands that we are proud of. There are not a lot of additional British beers that we'd really look at. Same with Belgian beers. In 1996, we carried every Belgian beer that was legally registered in New York. But in 1996, 1997, 1998, we've seen a flood of smaller imports come into New York. What had been a relatively limited number of top-tier brewers importing into the U.S., suddenly became a flood as every family brewery in Europe started to look at the U.S. as a possible market. We already had five different lambics. How many lambics can you really do justice to? We didn't want to duplicate what we had. We wanted to have a leading example of every beer style. Because we got in early, we established a very strong portfolio. I think it helped that we approached it knowledgeably. We loved these beers, and some of them were the beers we had admired before we got into the business. We might still look at new beers, but we won't take a new one unless it has already established its reputation, and we feel it has a chance to be commercially successful in New York City. 

 So that's how and why we got into distribution. At first it was temporary, and then we couldn't really get out of it, without hurting our chances for growth. We wanted a strong distributorship, selling beers that were complimentary of Brooklyn. 

 We had an idea that our niche should be top quality beers. It didn't matter if they were known in New York. It just mattered if we thought they were good. We were arrogant enough to think we knew which were the good beers. We thought if we believed in these beers, we could sell them. That hasn't always proven to be true, but that's what we felt in 1994-1995, We made some mistakes. I can't say we were a great distributor in the mid-1990s. We were a small distributor, and we were better than the alternatives in New York for our kind of beer. But compared to any decent Miller distributor in a mid sized city in the U.S., we weren't a great distributor. Our internal procedures were O.K., but we probably made a few more mistakes than we should have. Fortunately, we had some very smart, committed people, who were passionate about the business, so we'd fix those mistakes. I think customers during that time might have felt we weren't good at avoiding mistakes, but we were pretty good at fixing them. Five years down t he line, we have gotten much better. We're a good distributor in terms of operational efficiencies and professionalism. We admire our competitors, because they are very well-managed companies. But now we're also a good company. 

 The decision to self-distribute seems prescient in retrospect, given what has happened... 

 I gave a speech about distribution at a microbrewer's conference in 1991. At least a dozen small brewers came up to me after the speech, all excited, thinking about doing it themselves. I thought that it made sense for a lot of small, home-town breweries to do what we had done. I expected that there would be quite a few, over time. But I don't think there were any, for the next six or seven years. Even now, the only other one I know of is Left Hand/Tabernash in Colorado. 

 Pyramid had a distributor that they sold before they went public. There are several that do their own brands, but they are not multi-brand distributors. 

 If you were a regional brewery looking at the pros and cons of doing multiple-brand distribution, it would be a tough choice. If you were an outside brewery looking to hook-up with an operation like we are, you'd have concerns. So I understand why there would be concerns on both sides. 

 If there was one in each city, they could distribute each other's brands... 

 They could. They could provide an attractive alternative network, and if you have a track record, it stops being theoretical. If you're looking at the Craft Brewer's Guild now, you don't have to wonder how we would handle other brewer's brands. We have a ten-year record. Have we done a great job for everybody? Probably not. But our good intentions and our corporate culture are established. It's obvious we're not trying to promote Brooklyn at the expense of other brands. We think that consumers are smart, and good brands will find their place. We're very confident about Brooklyn. At this point, we're confident that our beers will succeed, given a chance. We're also confident that if other brands succeed, it just helps us in the long run, The success of Sierra Nevada will help us sell Paulaner, which will help us sell Otter Creek, which may or may not help us sell Brooklyn. But it can't hurt. 

 Were other New York distributors wary of you? 

 We weren't even on their radar screens. The other distributors weren't aware of the products we carried, because they were so specialized. They started to notice when brands left them, and came to us. Even when a small brand leaves, it stings your pride a little. They also noticed when we started to take draft lines. Sierra Nevada and Brooklyn really started to take off on draft three or four years ago, and more recently Paulaner. That made them take notice. You can argue about we stack up, but we are now a strong presence. We had focused on Manhattan for some time, but we have a growing on-premise business outside Manhattan. We're not really big enough to do a great job off-premise. So we have brought in partners to help us. I think in the future, you will see distributors work together in unconventional ways. Typically a distributor will just be geographic, and might have partners in a network. Like the old Stroh network. You have your county, and the guy next to you has his county. You might swap products back and forth. More and more, I think you'll see distributors focus on core competencies. They may not be geographically split. Our core competency is brand building and on-premise. We would be grateful for help off-premise. We've been sketchy off-premise, with chain stores particularly sketchy. The former Stroh/Heileman network had good strength off-premise, so it makes sense for us to work with them where we can. 

 Although that network will likely begin to fade away... 

 The distribution environment is pretty tough right now, obviously. There is a lot of consolidation, and fading brewery support. The ones that are left are doing pretty well. If you are in the market with a good Bud distributor, those guys set the bar pretty high. Margins have bounced back a little, but they are still less than they were five-six years ago. The biggest fallacy among brewers is that distributors are making a ton of money. It's so backward. Smaller brewers are probably operating at about 40% profit margins. Their businesses may be valued at lx sales. Distributors are operating at about 24% profit margins, and they would be lucky to be valued at lx gross profit. Most distributors are struggling to eke out a 2% profit. The numbers get skewed, because the big Bud guys are much stronger than that. They've got healthy profit margins. But take the Bud distributors from the equation. It's basically a low-profit business. Brewing is a much more attractive business, per dollar sales. The brewers would b e a lot better off recognizing that and working with distributors when they can. The hostility they sometimes show to distributors amazes me. The naivete about the economics amazes me. There is a lot of hostility about franchise laws, which I think is understandable. If you are a small brewer stuck with a distributor who's not doing a good job, it's not fair. But some of my fellow brewers don't always treat their distributors right, Some have left distributors with no compensation, no warning, without so much as a thank you. They think of that as lust business," but they would be first to condemn wholesalers for being perfidious. 

 Why do you think this adversarial dynamic has arisen? 

 I think it's because the distributors are between the breweries and the customers. So it's hard for a brewery to understand the distributor's problems or limitations. They will often ascribe evil motives to things which are not evil. There are natural limitations for distributors. They can't do a great job for every brewery every time. 

 The scope of action for wholesalers is pretty limited, and the economic realities for a distributor are pretty brutal. There's not a lot of flexibility. When you are only making a couple of percent, net, and a big chunk of your business is a big brewery, you have to do what that brewery tells you to do. You have to set up your distributorship to survive. And that means volume product. 

 Brewers sometimes seem to wish that distributors would go broke, and exit. But they will be sorry when that comes to pass, and it is happening. In a lot of towns, you are looking at only two viable distributors. Even a Sam Adams will have trouble. They used to be the number one specialty beer in a house. Now they will sometimes find themselves consolidated down the food chain, so in some houses they are not even in the top five anymore. At this point, as a brewer, I'm rooting for Jim Koch. It's a well-run, well-managed company. They are public, so everyone sees how they are doing. They are large enough to hold their own, but most smaller brewers aren't big enough. In their home-town, maybe. But outside their home market, no. Even a very good West Coast brewery would come to a typical town in the Northeast and just get killed. Sierra Nevada or Sam Adams can make it work nationally, I don't know who else. 

 I think there will be a publicly-owned national beer distributor. The economic vacuum is so large that it will be filled. I'd like to fill it, but if we don't someone will. 

 Yes, but the big brewers have certainly fought public ownership tooth and nail... 

 The only reason we don't have public ownership of beer wholesalers is because it is not in the interest of Miller and Budweiser. But if you don't have those products, their refusal to allow public ownership opens the door for someone new to take the stage. Access to public capital is a good thing, not a bad thing. When there are only two distribution networks, who do you buy? Someone will put together a third network. It won't be a downscale "all other." I think it will be an up-scale, value-added distributorship. We want to help lead that charge, or be an important part of it. 

 There was a time when there wasn't enough specialty product to make a meaningful national portfolio. But that is changing. The rise of the imports, plus the micros, means you've got more than 10% of the market to play in. And that part of the market could double over the next ten years. 

 The logistical strength of an integrated national beer distributorship would be overwhelmingly attractive to most medium and small sized breweries. Right now, trying to put together a network of 400 "all other" beer distributorships in the U.S. is formidable. Import companies like Merchant Du Vin and Manneken Brussels have put together networks and done a pretty good job. But if there was a national specialty beer distributor that could offer a European brewery consistent, logical, national distribution, I think it would be very attractive. 

 A public, national beer distributorship would very quickly become a half-billion to a billion-dollar business. There would be challenges economically. In each local market, you would have scale disadvantages. The trick would be to turn the national scale advantage to your benefit. If you're trying to cover the 50 largest metropolitan markets, you don't need 50 different wholesalers ordering inventory, and coming up with sales programs for 300 different products, with each company trying to train their people separately, insuring them, auditing them. All of those things should be done centrally. 

 With the rise of internet-enabled applications, the benefits of technology are now available to smaller companies. You don't need to have $20 million divisions to integrate them. You could have a $5-$10 million subsidiary, and they could be efficiently integrated into a national whole. 

 You still want a strong local presence, because distributing is very much a local, personality-driven business. But most family distributorships know that they are not big-time marketers. Five separate $10 million businesses don't need five CPAs, MBAs and marketing gurus. You need one of each, and then people locally who can implement things intelligently. 

 How would that coalesce? 

 Someone will get started. It would take two or three distributors to get together with professional management. It wouldn't take that much money to put together the first five or six. But you need professional managers. I've talked to Bob Weinberg about this. He told me, "the economics will speak...if you can make money doing it, it would be a success really quickly, but could you make money doing it?" He's right. That's the trick. 

 You'd have to be willing to invest $2 million in enterprise software to allow you to fully integrate the first two or three subsidiaries, and put you in a position to make acquisitions or mergers, and give them the benefits of integrated accounting and logistics. The key comes down to logistics. Right now the logistics of the independent distributors are really inefficient. In a business that expects to bring 2% down to the bottom line, it would be easy to imagine saving 2-3% in terms of costs. Forget about sales, just costs. If you turn a 2% net business into a 5% net business, you've added a lot of value. Right now we do a pretty job now with two businesses. This year, we're going to work to integrate our Massachusetts operation much more closely, as a kind of proving ground. 

 If you put together ten distributorships, each with $10 million in sales, each making $200,000, you'd end up with a $100 million business, only making $2 million. Privately, if you were selling one of those, it's a buyer's market. Who's buying those outfits? The guy next door. If you have a big product, they'll tell you who the only buyer is. So, privately, that business may be valued at four times cash flow. If that's a public business, with just an average price-to-earnings valuation, it's worth a lot more publicly than privately. For good reason. Right now it is buyer constrained. A $100 million company privately valued is worth $20-25 million, but as a public company it might be worth $50-100 million. If you invest $2-3 million up front in technology, I think that will come back to you quickly, and soon you're making $4-5 million a year. These are not software company returns. But there is a huge difference between making 2% net and 5% net. 

 At what juncture do you take it public? 

 You probably have to do it early. Most potential acquisitions are family businesses that have a difficult time taking private stock. The company might be their only asset, in the family for generations. If it was a public company, then it becomes more likely that a $10 million distributorship in Des Moines is willing to sell their business to you. You offer them half cash and half equity. You say, "We want you to stay in the business. You don't need an accountant or a national sales manager. I'll help you with that. I may have some recommendations on your warehouse operations, I may order your product for you, but you know your customers best." 

 But you need to go public, or find a backer. Distribution is not very volatile, which means you can leverage it to some reasonable level. The leveragibility of distributorships is under-appreciated, because of the requirements of the brewers. But distribution should be a low capital-intensive business, with stable cash flows. Perfect for leverage in a safe way, not in a crazy LBO fashion. Brewers impose capital requirements that are not for the benefit of the distributors, but for the brewers. Distributors are being managed by the brewers for their own benefit. There is no distributor of meaningful size that is managed for the distributor's own benefit. 

 I think a publicly-owned distributorship could make a legitimate bargain with independent suppliers. You tell them, "I'm not beholden to the big guys; I'll work with you nationally; If you're not happy, I'll give you a contract that says you can leave me, regardless of franchise laws, because I agree that franchise laws are a relic of the past...they were meant to stop Anheuser-Busch from taking over the world, and it didn't work." You'll give suppliers a purely contractual agreement, if they're not happy they are free to leave. You can tell large breweries in South Africa or Germany that you are in it for yourself, and it won't matter what St. Louis or Milwaukee think. 

 It sounds like Utopia. 

 [laughs] It'll never be Utopia. You could put your beer out there, maybe it doesn't sell. But there is economic logic behind it. It is hard to integrate without capital, especially a few years ago, when we didn't have these powerful internet-based solutions. You were looking at small divisions of a relatively small company. To spend $2 million to integrate a company whose whole value is only $10-12 million doesn't make much sense. But to spend $2-5 million to integrate a $500 million company. The scaleability is perfect. If you have a $500 million business you can spend $4.5 million for wonderful customer relations management software, computer telephony, and a powerful open architecture database to integrate an essentially infinite number of divisions. It's a reasonable cost of doing business. 

 We were thinking about all this, but we got humble. Some markets just aren't big enough. Albany, New York? Not big enough. For our operation in Massachusetts, our break-even point is around $4 million, and it has taken us three years to get there. We spent $2 million building that business in Massachusetts, not on purpose. So I don't think we'll be looking at small distributorships in every town in America. But I like Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, New York, Boston. That makes a ton of sense. We don't all need huge warehouses. We'd share a 200,000-square-foot warehouse in Port Elizabeth, NJ, and five tractor-trailers that supply us every day. As it is right now, we all have the same inventory. And it is lumpy. I have too much, he has too little. I'm almost going out of code, and I've got to give it away. He needs to order more, because he sold too much. 

 So you do it on a just-in-time basis.. 

 Absolutely. Beer is perfect for that. Palletized case quantities, comes in containers. This is not fancy logistics. This is basic logistics. But independent beer distributors are not good at it. It's not their fault. An "all other" house has 30 different suppliers, none of them giving him good answers. The big houses don't have to find their own answers, because Anheuser-Busch gives them a pretty good answer. 

 So what's the next step? 

 The real pay-off comes when breweries start talking directly to the customers. In New York, we want to be the best answer to get product right to consumers. In our home market, Brooklyn will be strong. But I also want to be the answer for Vanberg & DeWulf, or Brewery Moortgat. If someone loves Duvel, I want to know that person. As a distributor, we sell to retailers. But let me talk directly to that customer, and I will knock their socks off. I will deliver them beer, I will tell them about that beer, I will tell them about other similar beers, I'll tell them about the beer dinner we're having with the brewer. I bet there are more than 100,000 people in New York that are interested in specialty beer. It could be more like 500,000. We had 30,000 people come visit us at this brewery last year alone. If I know the 100,000 people in New York who are buying Sierra Nevada and Fuller's and Celebrator, I can talk to them. I can e-mail them once a month with our options. We can deliver stuff right to them. We can do draught beer too. Not the big kegs, but the little five-liter ones. Pay us with a credit card, and we'll deliver within a two hour window. This changes everything. It changes the ball game, from mass marketing to micro marketing. This is not a new idea. It is going to roll over every consumer specialty goods category. It will change beer the most, because beer is so far behind. This could alter the competitive balance in ways that are crazy. But as a small guy, I like change. I've got nothing to lose. I know I can keep what I've got, and I also want some of yours. If the world is changing, I'll take my chances. I can move quickly, I am adequately financed, and I've got a great portfolio. Maybe that portfolio is underperforming, because I can't get to the consumer. Because Anheuser-Busch is advertising very efficiently, and the retailers see the same ads, and they don't know about beer. This is a classic situation. The current retail environment serves the mass market items very well. The internet won't revolu tionize the world for Budweiser, because Budweiser does a great job distributing itself right now, A beer that is brewed in Newark is delivered to a deli in Manhattan a week later. The entire cost of freighting and warehousing and delivering it is probably only $1.50 for a 25-pound case of goods. That's really efficient, and it's available everywhere. You don't have to look for it. And you don't have any questions about Budweiser, you already know everything you need to know about Budweiser. They spend a half billion dollars a year telling everyone about. So they have won the mass market. But what about these other items? How do you find them? 

 I guess it's a question how many want them, and how often... 

 Yes, and I'm cautious about that. There are millions of beer drinkers in New York, and seven out of ten don't give a damn about Brooklyn beer. If you include the imports, market share for specialty beer is over ten percent. A lot of them drink Heineken, and that tells me that they are willing to spend more for a better beer. Maybe they are looking for an image more than a different taste, but that's still promising. That's a more expensive beer, and I like that. It's trains someone to spend $5-6 a six-pack. Even if there are only 100,000 people in New York, that's a great business. And I've got a way to communicate with my audience that will not get overwhelmed by Budweiser's advertising. Right now, I can't compete, because I can't communicate with the customer. But the distributorship has really helped. It has given us a huge advantage over other breweries. We don't have two layers between us and the customer. And once we start selling beer directly to the customer, that will really change the equation. I th ink we will be the first brewery in recent history to know its customers. In Brooklyn, in the old days, they would "rush the growler," send the kids with the bucket to fill with beer, and bring it home. If you were a neighborhood brewery, you knew your customers. We are going back to the future. We want to know our customers. If you are a Brooklyn Brewery customer in New York, I want to thank you personally for your business. I want to offer you our beer, and other beers. I want to invite you to the brewery, and I want you to tell me if we are doing something wrong. 

 How will delivery work? 

 We have 12 trucks, we'll augment that with four vans. Initially it will be Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn. We understand the logistics of delivery in metro New York. When it comes to running a fleet in New York City we are utterly unafraid. There are some things we have to learn. We have to learn how to deal with individual consumers. We're going to get a signature and driver's license every time we deliver. We'll need customers to sign up ahead of time, probably on the internet, so we know we've got a license and delivery instructions on file. We will be much more careful than any traditional retailer in making sure that we don't sell to an underage consumer. Unlike a traditional retailer, which bases things on an anonymous cash transaction, we will know where we deliver every six-pack. I can tell the authorities where every six-pack has gone five minutes later, five days later or five years later. And customers will pay for it with a credit card. So I think we can offer a higher level of community respon sibility than traditional retailers. 

 The combination of the brewery and the distributorship puts us in a powerful place to attract customers. Every year, more people come to visit the brewery. We do about five promotions a week, through the distributorship, thoughout the metro N.Y area. We are starting to collect names. The number one question at beer dinners is "I really like this beer, where do I get it?" And right now I have to scratch my head, and say, "Mmm, let's see, maybe Hercules has it, they're about 10 blocks from you." Now, we just say, "check out the web-site." It will be case quantities for the specialty stuff, probably two six-pack minimum for Brooklyn. 

 How about the delivery window? 

 With someone like UPS, most deliveries don't specify delivery time. When you order from us, you'll choose a three hour delivery window. If you order tonight for delivery tomorrow, fine. If you order today, for tonight, we can do that, but for a charge. 

 And what's the charge for next-day deliveries? 

 None. But we sell it at straight retail. Our goal is to be competitive with retailers, but not undercut them. So you'll pay the same as you do at the deli down the street, but the difference is that we'll deliver it. 

 There are some entrenched constituencies that might be alarmed by this. 

 Maybe. We will try to allay concerns, but we believe that the consumer will always get what they want. Suppliers and consumers will both demand something like this down the road. We are unwilling to let someone else do it. We're not trying to hurt any of our existing customers. I don't think we will be stealing business. I think we will build the business for customers that are not buying our kind of product right now. 

 In five years, I bet there will be several companies offering direct delivery of beer in New York City. I hope we'll be a leader. We'll focus only on specialty products, our own products. It's going to happen. 

 Some in the industry will want to deny the power of this model. Certainly the underage drinking issue will be raised. 

 The arguments about the risk of underage consumption are patently phony. It's a red herring. Nobody in their right mind could believe that the current retail system offers more protection than what we propose. It's a powerful argument, but it is obviously phony. Some clerk down at the local deli typically won't check ID, won't record ID, won't have any way of tracking you once you've left, especially if it's a fake ID. All the arguments are phony. They are about self-interest. My self-interest is in change. The consumer will get what they want. 

 I believe that beer distributors add economic value. If you strip away franchise protections, and strip away the ABC bureaucracy, and base it purely on economics, a beer supplier with still have good reason to do business with distributors. Now we have the internet, and we have the ability to meet directly with consumers. How do we fit into that world? Well, we better figure out a way. There are ways. I think this is a very exciting path. If other distributors don't see this, then great, we'll get a 2-3 year headstart. 

 But currently there isn't an entity like Craft Brewers Guild in even the developed markets, so you have the field to yourselves. 

 No. I think many small home-town breweries have done pretty well with their local Bud or Miller house. Once you've developed your brand, they'll help sell what sells. I suppose nobody has had the motivation to build their own distributorship, because many of them do O.K. locally. But there are attractive brands that are being orphaned now. There are brands are in houses where they are not appreciated. Of course, it would be a huge advantage to be a national company. Then you can start horse-trading. 

 The long-term future is a national distributor that is managing direct-to-consumer sales. This national distributor will be good at brand building, on-premise sales, specialty off-premise and direct-to-consumer. It will be relatively weak, vis-a-vis other distributors, for chain sales. 

 And best in urban markets... 

 Yeah. High-density markets. I think it's a viable option. If a distributor in Ohio told me he could offer me good on-premise coverage and specialty off-premise, I would find that attractive. Obviously in many states the distributor won't be able to do direct delivery, but could do it through a retail partner. If I'm a national company, I can arrange the retail partner in Ohio, so that I get seamless fulfillment. So anybody in Ohio who wants my beer, this distributor can get it to them. Maybe only in the city, but at least he's got some kind of answer for me. If he tells me that I'll be in the best five stores in Toledo, and the best 12 in Dayton, that's pretty good. And maybe he tells me there's some guy in Toledo who used to be from Brooklyn who runs a bar, so he can get me a few draft accounts. There are all these one-of-a-kind situations that add up to moderate business. It's scattered, but I'll take it. Right now I have no way of reaching those people. 

 How did you come to this point in thinking about this? 

 We've known that we could deliver direct to consumers in New York for some time. We had pondered that. But it was the rise of e-commerce that really got us excited. For the first time, it all hung together. The ability to communicate with customers over the internet, the ability to collect and keep customers, to build a virtual community of beer lovers. That fits what we've been doing on the bricks-and-mortar side, and allows us to extend it into cyberspace. By the time we got this together, the general market had fallen out of love with e-commerce. So by last April, no one wanted to hear about this. But I think this one is very strong. It's just particular to us. We've got a great portfolio of products. We've got a great logistical infrastructure. We have a dedicated community of consumers. These are people that we have already reached, and we can keep reaching. We have a strong product locally, produced by Brooklyn Brewery. But by the time we begin this, it couldn't be a colder topic of conversation. 

 Well, it will be a pretty hot topic in the beer industry... 

 I guess so. I think the original models for wine fulfillment, and the couple of companies that are doing beer, are fatally flawed. Winemarketing.com and wine.com are trying to add a fourth tier of order-taking to the three-tier system. It is very rickety. I've thought about it, I've worked the numbers, and I just don't see it as an attractive model. It requires the naive cooperation of everyone involved. 

 Certainly the big suppliers will do it themselves... 

 And the big distributors will try to do it themselves. That's not going to work either. It's not bad. It's better. At least the people who are doing the work have the motivation to make the money. The fulfillment end of this won't work, and will never work. It only makes sense if someone can integrate the logistics. As a distributor, you begin to really appreciate logistics--trucks, warehouses, invoices. It's not romantic, but it's how you keep customers. Brewers have become used to a world where only they market. The best brewers are very good at marketing. 

 Jim Koch likens specialty beer marketing to whales mating, sending out calls in this vast empty ocean... 

 [laughs] At least he's a whale. The rest of us are like minnows out there. But the internet changes that. Especially if you know who the customers are. This model may not work for just any distributor, because they may not have a compelling portfolio. In this market, we've got a dominant portfolio of specialty beer. Plus, we have a dominant local product, Brooklyn Lager, which is a very important component. Plus, we are used to marketing. Most distributors are terrible marketers. They've been trained not to get involved in marketing. Budweiser doesn't want them messing up the message. They just say, "Please, stay out of the way." They've spent millions shaping the message. So they tell them, "Stay out of the way, deliver the product, and by the way, industry standard warehousing cost is $1.45, so we expect you to lower your price." It's all about efficiency, not about marketing. A whole generation of wholesalers has been trained to be fulfillment houses. They won't be very effective marketing to consumers, or even in a retail environment. 

 The Brooklyn Brewery seems ahead of the pack with its whole business model. 

 I hope we're not too far ahead on this internet business, because I hope it makes money within a couple of years. When I look at the distribution strategy that we have followed, I often wonder whether we were ahead of the curve or not. Because no one has followed us. Are we ahead, or just out there all alone? It's like an infantry officer going over the top, yelling "Follow me, boys!" then finding himself out there all alone, and saying, "Hey, wait a minute, where is everybody?" 

 Thanks for your time, Tom.

 Late Nasdaq rally blunts sharp slide.

 United States stocks rallied on Friday in a holiday-shortened session, with the Nasdaq Composite Index jumping 5.4 per cent while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent. 

 But uncertainty over the presidential election as well as the health of some US companies had weighed heavily on the stock market. 

 The technology-heavy Nasdaq declined 122.81 points, or 4.05 per cent, over the week, to close at 2,904.38 points on Friday. The index is down 42.5 per cent lower from its record level on March 10. 

 Investors appeared to jump in to pick up bargains on Friday but the concerns that had prompted the selling remain. 

 The blue-chip Dow ended the week at 10,470.23 points, down 1.5 per cent from the previous Friday. 

 Investors were closely following the see-sawing legal battle for the White House. 

 Added to electoral woes were concerns about corporate profits, particularly in the Internet sector. Yahoo! shares dropped 20.3 per cent over the week. 

 Financial stocks were also under pressure on bad loan concerns. 

 In Hong Kong, uncertainty from the US and telecommunications news from China weighed heavily, with the Hang Seng Index losing 5.29 per cent, or 803.95 points, over the week. 

 Shares in China Mobile (HK) and China Unicom fell sharply on Wednesday, dragging the index down 2.73 per cent, after reports that Beijing had approved a controversial one-way billing system for mobile-telephone users. 

 Bargain hunters emerged on Thursday but uncertainty resurfaced on Friday on a lack of direction from Beijing on the telecoms issue and no further news from the US. 

 Celestial Asia Securities Holdings director Eugene Law expected the index to test the 14,000-point support level this week. 

 "The trend is still pretty unclear. The US election is a wild card, if it clears up it could be positive for the market," he said. 

 The Government on Friday upgraded Hong Kong's full-year growth forecast to 10 per cent after reporting 10.4 per cent growth for the third quarter. 

 Mr Law said this was good news in the medium term but conflicting messages from the technology sector would override the short-term impact. 

 South China Online director Howard Gorges said the market had levelled off but was still vulnerable. 

 "There is quite a lot of cash sidelined and we have already discounted a lot of bad news," he said. 

 "Buyers are looking for the green light and they are not getting it," Mr Gorges said. 

 Turnover would remain low in the HK$6.5 billion to HK$8 billion range unless there was clarification from the US on the election and from Beijing on the issue of two-way billing for mobile phone calls. 

 "There is still a chance that we can rally before Christmas given that there is liquidity in the market," he said. 

 The Growth Enterprise Market Index closed the week down 1.09 per cent at 345.31 points, a drop of 65.46 per cent since the index was launched in March. 

 In London, the FTSE-100 Index fell 1.74 per cent, or 112.5 points, at 6,327.6 points over the week. 

 Technology stocks led the falls, with a profit warning on Friday from blue-chip British computer consultancy Sema dealing another blow to the sector. Sema shares almost halved in value over the week. 

 In Tokyo, stocks were expected to trade in a tight range in the week ahead, after the key Nikkei-225 Index lost 228.95 points, or 1.5 per cent, in a holiday-shortened week.

OPEC President Ali Rodriguez said the group won't consider boosting output quotas until its next meeting Jan. 17 unless there's an strong increase in demand.

"There won't be an increase in production until the next OPEC meeting unless there is an increase in demand for some reason, such as a very strong winter," Rodriguez said, adding that such a change did not seem likely.

Rodriguez, who is also Venezuela's energy minister, said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wanted to avoid a sharp drop in oil prices caused by excessive supply.

OPEC has raised output quotas four times this year by a total of 3.7 million barrels a day to a 21-year high, but prices remain above its targeted range of $22 to $28 dollars a barrel.

Rodriguez said there was excess supply of 1.4 million barrels per day on the market. Bottlenecks at U.S. refineries, taxes, transportation problems and speculators are responsible for the current high prices, he said. Shell makes offer for Australia outfit

Royal Dutch/Shell Group offered to pay as much as A$6.5 billion ($3.4 billion) in cash to gain control of Woodside Petroleum Ltd. and boost its natural gas reserves as Asian demand for the fuel grows.

The world's second-biggest publicly traded oil company wants to take control of Woodside and merge it with its own Australian operations as part of a plan to capture more of Asia's energy market, where gas demand last year rose 6 percent. Woodside in June rebuffed an offer of oil and gas assets from Shell.

In a bid to reduce the cash outlay and its share of risk in the company's projects, Shell will give investors the option to buy back shares in the merged business at the same price before the end of June. If all these options are exercised, Shell will end up with about 56 percent of the combined company.

"Shell will be exposed if it ends up with 100 percent of the shares, but given the cheap Australian currency and, therefore, the cheap price of Woodside, it offsets that risk at the moment," said Russell Langusch, an oil and gas analyst at CIBC World Markets in Sydney. Amazon.com site experiences outage

Amazon.com Inc.'s Internet site shut down for about half an hour Friday, blocking shoppers from making purchases at its U.S. stores, including an online shop operated with Toys "R" Us Inc.'s Toysrus.com.

Users noticed the outage shortly after 10:30 a.m. CST, Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said. The site was closed until about noon. During that time, the company posted a notice saying it would be "right back" on what normally would be its main page for its U.S. store. Amazon.com is the largest online retailer.

Amazon.com was checking on what caused the outage, Curry said. Today marks the start of the holiday shopping season as U.S. consumers flock to shopping malls and seek purchases at Internet stores. Saab takes policy to hedge aircraft leases

Saab AB, a Swedish warplane and civilian aircraft maker, said it took out an insurance policy to guarantee income of at least $1.2 billion over 15 years from aircraft it leases to customers. The shares rose 3.9 percent.

The policy hedges 203 of the regional aircraft that Saab leases against market cycles, competition, obsolescence and customer default, the company said in a statement distributed by BIT. The policy's $34 million cost won't affect earnings as it's covered by current provisions, Saab said.

"People were worried that they have such a large exposure to commercial airlines. Now they've gotten rid of their risk," said Mats Liss, an analyst at Swedbank Markets, who has a "buy" rating on the shares.

The new insurance policy is based on one implemented two years ago by BAE Systems PLC, which advised Saab on its policy, said Agneta Kammeby, a Saab spokeswoman. Enron disputes rumors of warning

Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, said it won't be issuing a warning on fourth-quarter profit.

"It was a persistent rumor on Wednesday," company spokesman Mark Palmer said. "We wanted to get the news out to everyone that it's not true."

The Houston-based company said it expects earnings to be in line with analysts' estimates of 35 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.65 for next year. Enron's shares rose $2.19, or 2.9 percent, to $77.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

Enron received numerous calls Wednesday from investors and analysts about a possible earnings warning, Palmer said. The company doesn't know where the speculation began, he said.

NEW OPEC BENCHMARK SOUGHT: A new global oil benchmark would reduce artificial price swings caused by speculation in the oil market, the president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said Friday. Ali Rodriguez, who will become OPEC secretary-general in January, urged the oil cartel to adopt a new benchmark to replace the three crude blends currently used as price references. Rodriguez said those benchmarks - Brent Blend, West Texas Intermediate and Dubai - represent only 1 million barrels of the 76 million barrels a day the world produces. Rodriguez, who is also Venezuela's oil minister, first proposed the new benchmark idea at an OPEC ministers' meeting in Vienna this month. OPEC officials are studying the proposal. (AP)

FIRMS DISCUSS E-BOOK ALLIANCE: Barnes & Noble Inc. acknowledged Friday that it is holding talks with Gemstar-TV Guide International about different ways to cooperate in selling e-books, including a possible merger. Earlier this week, the bookselling giant denied a report in The Wall Street Journal saying the two companies were discussing a merger. But Barnes & Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating said the talks have expanded since then. Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide magazine and operates on-screen programming guides, is one of the leading e-book publishers, having also purchased Softbook Press this year. (AP)

LOCKHEED MARTIN UNITS' SALE APPROVED: The U.S. government has formally approved BAE Systems Plc's $1.67 billion purchase of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Sanders military electronics business and two other units, both companies said Friday. The U.S. Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews transactions between U.S. and foreign companies for their national security implications, on Thursday informed Lockheed Martin and Farnborough, England-based BAE Systems that it had no objections to the transaction, said spokesmen for both companies. (Bloomberg)

ENRON DENIES PROFIT WARNING RUMORS: Enron Corp. denied rumors Friday of a possible profit warning, saying all its businesses are performing well. "All of our businesses are performing extremely well and we are very comfortable with consensus analyst earnings estimates of 35 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2000, and $1.65 for the full year 2001," said Jeff Skilling, president and chief operating officer of the Houston-based company. Shares of Enron rose $2.25 to $77.75 in trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. (AP)

H-P TO PAY CD-BURNER FEES: Computer giant Hewlett-Packard Corp. has become the first company to be snagged by a German law requiring firms to pay fees for making CD burners that are being used to illegally lift the latest music hits off the Web. The case sets the stage for other European countries to possibly adopt similar rules to stem an epidemic that cost the music industry an estimated $5 billion last year. But analysts blasted the agreement reached Thursday as another example of Germany's notorious thatch of regulations. (AP)

SOYBEAN FUTURES AT 6-MONTH HIGH: Soybean meal futures rose to a six-month high Friday at the Chicago Board of Trade after Germany said it is seeking to ban the use of meat and bone meal in feed for hogs and poultry. The move marks a potential widening of the restrictions on use of the meal in Europe following a growing number of cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which scientists have linked to the feeding of animal parts to other animals. Vegetable-based feeds such as soy meal are expected to be in greater demand as a result. The December contract jumped $7.50 to $186.90 a short ton. (Dow Jones)

S. KOREA DEAL WILL HELP NEXT LEVEL: Shares of Next Level Communications Inc., down by more than half this month, may be set for a rebound as the company sells more data-communications equipment in Asia and Europe, analysts said. The company in September agreed to sell more than $80 million in gear to South Korean electronics distributor Hansol Electronics Inc. Hansol planned to buy Next Level's set-top boxes, modems and other gear and resell them to South Korean telecommunications companies. Next Level also has announced trial sales with Spain's Telefonica SA, France Telecom SA and Norway's Telenor. (Bloomberg)

FRENCH FOOD GROUP TARGETS U.S. MARKET: The chief executive of French group Danone said that although the company dropped plans to buy Quaker Oats Co., the food and drink conglomerate still has ambitions to enter the U.S. market. In an interview published Friday in Le Monde newspaper, Franck Riboud also said the decision to back away from Quaker has not undermined confidence in the management's ability to defend the company's independence. Danone suddenly dropped its offer Thursday for the Chicago-based cereals maker and owner of the sought-after Gatorade sports drink brand. (AP)

DELL SUED OVER COMPUTER CHIP BOARDS: A unit of Tulip Computers NV filed a patent infringement suit against rival Dell Computer Corp., accusing the largest U.S. personal-computer maker of misappropriating its technology for computer chip boards. Tulip Computers International BV contends that Dell officials have copied the Dutch PC maker's patented technology for so-called "motherboards" that hold computer processing and memory chips. Tulip is seeking damages based on all the infringing computers Dell has sold since 1997. (Bloomberg)

SATELLITE MALFUNCTIONS: PanAmSat Corp., the largest commercial-satellite operator, said its satellite that provides television and video services in the United States is no longer working due to electrical problems. The Galaxy VII satellite had a malfunction Wednesday in the control system that maintains its position in space. The satellite was replaced by the company's Galaxy XI satellite, which was launched in 1999, said spokesman Don Meyer. The problem won't affect PanAmSat's targetof $1 billion in revenue this year or projections for 2001, the company said in a statement. (Bloomberg)

MORTGAGE RATES HOLD STEADY: Rates for 30-year and 15-year mortgages held steady this week but adjustable-rate mortgages ticked up. The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was unchanged at 7.73 percent for the week ending Nov. 24, the same rate as the previous week, according to a survey released Wednesday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. A year ago, the rate on 30-year mortgages stood at 7.75 percent. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also were unchanged at an average 7.41 percent. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 7.28 percent, up from 7.25 percent the week before. (AP)

JAPAN ADJUSTS ECONOMIC FIGURES: The Japanese economy grew nearly 1.4 percent last year, nearly three times the 0.5 percent announced previously, the government said Friday after recalculating the numbers using newer international standards. The statistics also showed the economy shrank 0.6 percent in fiscal 1998, compared with a 2 percent decline under the old rules. The figures measure gross domestic product, the total value of a country's goods and services produced within its borders. (AP)

CHEVRON HAS HIGH HOPES IN RUSSIA: Chevron Corp., the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, said it plans to double sales of lubricants in Russia as it expands in Central and Eastern Europe, where many of the area's economies are growing at the fastest pace since the end of communism. (Bloomberg)

French firm drops bid to buy Quaker

Shares of Quaker Oats Co. fell 3.7 percent Friday after Groupe Danone SA said Thursday it won't pursue a takeover of the maker of Gatorade, the top-selling U.S. sports drink.

The French company's withdrawal came a day after Coca-Cola Co., the biggest soft-drink maker, dropped plans to make an offer for Quaker. That leaves PepsiCo Inc., which had offered 2.3 of its shares for each of Quaker's, or $102.35 a share based on Friday's closing price. Quaker previously rejected PepsiCo's bid.

PepsiCo's offer is a premium to Quaker's stock, which, after reaching as high as $98.94 on Monday, closed today at $83.75 - close to the same price it was when PepsiCo made its bid Nov. 2.

Bond market's fortunes mirror those of Gore The bond market is voting Democratic.

Since before the Nov. 7 election, bonds have rallied along with the fortunes of the Democratic presidential contender Al Gore and fallen as Republican candidate George W. Bush gained ground in what remains a disputed election.

The swings don't reflect the personal preferences of the many on Wall Street whose donations have often favored the GOP. Instead, they indicate a bet that Gore would be more likely to continue a policy of buying back bonds to reduce the country's debt, further boosting the securities' scarcity value.

In addition, Gore spending increases are viewed as less expensive than the Bush tax cut.

"Historically, Republicans have been considered the party for business" and, therefore, Wall Street, said Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University.

These assumptions are "confused because Democrats are more fiscally responsible and Republicans are talking more like Democrats" as they propose spending plans of their own, he said.

OPEC PRESIDENT ALI RODRIGUEZ said Friday the group won't consider boosting output quotas until its next meeting, Jan. 17, unless there's a strong increase in demand.

Rodriguez said the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wanted to avoid a sharp drop in oil prices caused by excessive supply.

ENRON CORP. moved to scotch "persistent rumors" that it would issue a profit warning by affirming on Friday its agreement with analysts' earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and 2001. Jeff Skilling, president and chief operating officer of the Houston-based energy company, said the rumors, which began swirling through the markets on Wednesday, were "not true."

ARMSTRONG HOLDINGS INC., North America's largest maker of vinyl flooring, said it failed to repay $50 million due Wednesday under a long-term $450 million credit agreement. Despite the default, Armstrong's business will continue to operate without interruption, the company said in a statement.

BARNES & NOBLE INC. acknowledged Friday that it is holding talks with Gemstar-TV Guide International about different ways to cooperate in selling e-books, including a possible merger.

11:43 (Dow Jones) Slowdown in AT&T Broadband's demand for cable
equipment won't affect its previous targets for obtaining new telephone,
high-speed data or digital customers, says Steve Lang, a spokesman for
AT&T Broadband, the cable arm of AT&T Corp. (T). "We have enough
inventory to meet our needs for the rest of the year," he says. "For us
this is budget balancing. It's just to make sure our capital spending
and our capital budget line up at the end of the year." (JAW)



11:27 (Dow Jones) Some of the widening earlier this year of agency
debt spreads vs. comparable-term Treasury securities "may have been
attributable to increased scrutiny of agency debt issuance," says new
FHLBank System financial report. (JC)



11:11 (Dow Jones) A flatter, or more inverted, Treasury yield curve
will be a theme next week, as a flood of supply comes to auction. Monday
will be $22 billion in new 3,6-month T-bills, Tuesday is a $10 billion
year-bill, Wednesday is a $10 billion two-year note, and a new cash
management bill to carry Treasury until the Dec. 15 tax date is likely
to be announced. (SV)



11:07 (Dow Jones) SSB economists say Wednesday high of 101-28
represented a new life of contract high for December bond futures. The
previous life of contract high for Dec was seen on Oct. 23 at 101-07,
economists say. (CMN)



10:56 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are staying near session highs, but
traders say volume remains light. However, that could change near the
close. "I suspect we're going to have a flurry of activity the closer we
get the end," he says. "If we're 20 points higher like we are, I think
we'll get some fund selling. No one is going to want to hold a position
ahead of the weekend." (DMC)



10:43 (Dow Jones) Credit problems with corporate issuer was partially
responsible for recent spread widening in commercial mortgage-backeds,
even though the sector's delinquencies remain low, according to a
Merrill Lynch report. (JS)



10:33 (Dow Jones) I2 Technologies (ITWO) is up 4% Friday at $111.25,
which is in sharp contrast to where it was trading after-hours
Wednesday. The software company fell to a low of $93 in extended hours
Wednesday after announcing its chief operating officer, Robert Evans,
resigned to pursue other interests. However, a Dain Rauscher managing
director said on CNBC Wednesday that I2 "could be the next Cisco," and
Merrill Lynch reiterated Friday a near-term accumulate and a long-term
buy on the stock. (GS)



10:19 (Dow Jones) Corporate bond spreads unchanged in dormant
post-holiday trading. Market environment fragile, meaning $11 billion in
new issues coming over the next two weeks will be priced to sell,
analysts say. (DA)



10:13 (Dow Jones) The major stock indexes are hovering near session
highs as bargain-hunting coninues. DJIA gaining 90 at 10490. Nasdaq
Composite up 101 at 2856. S&P 500 rising 17 at 1339. Volume is very
light, so don't consider this a significant indication of any lengthy
rally. (GS)



10:03 (Dow Jones) The initial upward momentum in stocks hasn't done
much to push Treasurys any lower. Support is coming from the dollar's
strength against the yen and the more recent reversal of the dip earlier
against the euro. (SV)



10:01 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are staying strong in the early trade,
floor traders note, but the tone suggests indecision. "It could go
either way and I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up off our highs at
the end of the session, maybe even a little lower. If there's any
election news out, that will sway us," one trader says. He adds that the
strength is likely a rebound from weakness earlier in the week. (DMC)



10:00 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq hits resistance at the session high of
2780 and has pulled back slightly from that area. A move through 2780
could take the contract to Wednesday's high of 2824. Still resistance
seen at 2829. Support comes in at the pivot point of 2728, but solid
support not seen until 2679, floor trader says. (DMC)



9:57 (Dow Jones) End-of-year budget balancing problems at AT&T's (T)
broadband unit is taking a chunk out of the stocks of its suppliers,
Antec (ANTC) and CommScope (CTV). Both companies said in separate press
releases Friday that AT&T Broadband will not accept product deliveries.
Antec is off 36%, while CommScope - which was halted earlier - has lost
30%. Ironically, AT&T remains unaffected, trading flat at nearly $19.
(GS)



9:42 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps could see a broad-based rally as investors
could do some bargain hunting, an off-floor trader says. But if there
are new wrinkles in the election, especially if it appears that the end
may be delayed, stocks could give back gains. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD drops below 84 cents on stock market open,
with Nasdaq, DJIA jumping more than 60 points off the blocks. EUR/USD
now at 0.8394. USD/JPY climbs to nine-month high of 111.37, moving
closer to year high of 111.73. (RTB)



9:38 (Dow Jones) Stocks Start Strong. DJIA up 70 at 10468. Nasdaq
Composite rising 83 to 2838. S&P 500 gaining 15 at 1337. DJIA led by
tech stalwarts Hewlett-Packard, up 6.5%, and Intel, up 3.5%. (GS)



9:35 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq start strong, following gains in
overnight trading. Off-floor trader says market typically gains on the
day after Thanksgiving, but the gains usually come on light volume.
Catalyst for Fri's strength is the Fla. Supreme Court ruling to allow
Miami-Dade county to refuse its manual recount. Mkts close at 12:15 p.m.
CST. (DMC)



9:32 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD has settled back down to the middle of its
intraday range, at 0.8412, ahead of what is seen as a strong U.S. stock
market open. USD/JPY trading just below intraday high of 111.31, now at
111.29. (RTB)



9:20 (Dow Jones) C-SPAN CEO Brian Lamb, in a letter to Supreme Court
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, asks that his network be allowed to
provide TV coverage of any hearing the High Court may decide to hold
regarding the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. U.S. Supreme
Court never has permitted TV coverage of its proceedings. (JC).



9:15 (Dow Jones) "There is great danger lurking in the global
economy," says economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He
sees risk of hard landing, or outright recession, as "high and rising -
especially in the U.S." (JC).



9:12 (Dow Jones) Enron (ENE), in a simple three-paragraph press
release Friday, tried to dispel rumors of a potential profit warning.
President Jeff Skilling said, "All of our businesses are performing
extremely well and we are very comfortable with consensus analyst
earnings estimates of $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2000, and
$1.65 for the full year 2001" It will be interesting to see how
effective the release is. The Houston energy company fell 6% Wednesday
to $75.56. (GS)



9:05 (Dow Jones) A stock-inspired downturn in Treasurys is proving to
be enough to prompt some participants to book some profits after several
stronger days. But at the same time, however, some note that they aren't
yet comfortable with the idea of setting new speculative shorts. Bonds
remain supported by lower dollar versus yen, ongoing tension in Middle
East, credit concerns, buybacks, among other things. (SV)

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



11:11 (Dow Jones) A flatter, or more inverted, Treasury yield curve
will be a theme next week, as a flood of supply comes to auction. Monday
will be $22 billion in new 3,6-month T-bills, Tuesday is a $10 billion
year-bill, Wednesday is a $10 billion two-year note, and a new cash
management bill to carry Treasury until the Dec. 15 tax date is likely
to be announced. (SV)



11:07 (Dow Jones) SSB economists say Wednesday high of 101-28
represented a new life of contract high for December bond futures. The
previous life of contract high for Dec was seen on Oct. 23 at 101-07,
economists say. (CMN)



10:56 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are staying near session highs, but
traders say volume remains light. However, that could change near the
close. "I suspect we're going to have a flurry of activity the closer we
get the end," he says. "If we're 20 points higher like we are, I think
we'll get some fund selling. No one is going to want to hold a position
ahead of the weekend." (DMC)



10:43 (Dow Jones) Credit problems with corporate issuer was partially
responsible for recent spread widening in commercial mortgage-backeds,
even though the sector's delinquencies remain low, according to a
Merrill Lynch report. (JS)



10:33 (Dow Jones) I2 Technologies (ITWO) is up 4% Friday at $111.25,
which is in sharp contrast to where it was trading after-hours
Wednesday. The software company fell to a low of $93 in extended hours
Wednesday after announcing its chief operating officer, Robert Evans,
resigned to pursue other interests. However, a Dain Rauscher managing
director said on CNBC Wednesday that I2 "could be the next Cisco," and
Merrill Lynch reiterated Friday a near-term accumulate and a long-term
buy on the stock. (GS)



10:19 (Dow Jones) Corporate bond spreads unchanged in dormant
post-holiday trading. Market environment fragile, meaning $11 billion in
new issues coming over the next two weeks will be priced to sell,
analysts say. (DA)



10:13 (Dow Jones) The major stock indexes are hovering near session
highs as bargain-hunting coninues. DJIA gaining 90 at 10490. Nasdaq
Composite up 101 at 2856. S&P 500 rising 17 at 1339. Volume is very
light, so don't consider this a significant indication of any lengthy
rally. (GS)



10:03 (Dow Jones) The initial upward momentum in stocks hasn't done
much to push Treasurys any lower. Support is coming from the dollar's
strength against the yen and the more recent reversal of the dip earlier
against the euro. (SV)



10:01 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are staying strong in the early trade,
floor traders note, but the tone suggests indecision. "It could go
either way and I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up off our highs at
the end of the session, maybe even a little lower. If there's any
election news out, that will sway us," one trader says. He adds that the
strength is likely a rebound from weakness earlier in the week. (DMC)



10:00 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq hits resistance at the session high of
2780 and has pulled back slightly from that area. A move through 2780
could take the contract to Wednesday's high of 2824. Still resistance
seen at 2829. Support comes in at the pivot point of 2728, but solid
support not seen until 2679, floor trader says. (DMC)



9:57 (Dow Jones) End-of-year budget balancing problems at AT&T's (T)
broadband unit is taking a chunk out of the stocks of its suppliers,
Antec (ANTC) and CommScope (CTV). Both companies said in separate press
releases Friday that AT&T Broadband will not accept product deliveries.
Antec is off 36%, while CommScope - which was halted earlier - has lost

10:03 (Dow Jones) The initial upward momentum in stocks hasn't done

10:01 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are staying strong in the early trade,
floor traders note, but the tone suggests indecision. "It could go

strength is likely a rebound from weakness earlier in the week. (DMC)



10:00 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq hits resistance at the session high of

seen at 2829. Support comes in at the pivot point of 2728, but solid
support not seen until 2679, floor trader says. (DMC)

10:33 (Dow Jones) I2 Technologies (ITWO) is up 4% Friday at $111.25,
which is in sharp contrast to where it was trading after-hours
Wednesday. The software company fell to a low of $93 in extended hours
Wednesday after announcing its chief operating officer, Robert Evans,
resigned to pursue other interests. However, a Dain Rauscher managing
director said on CNBC Wednesday that I2 "could be the next Cisco," and

8:54 (Dow Jones) Forex market will continue to keep one eye on
election news, trader says. With stock futures up in part on growing
likelihood of Bush win, USD could get bid. But it's looking heavy vs
EUR, JPY. USD/JPY now at 111.22, EUR/USD at 0.8430. (RTB)



8:50 (Dow Jones) Quaker Oats (OAT) shares are trading lower in
premarket trading after Danone Group (DA) ended acquisition talks with
the cereal and sports-drink maker. Danone joins Coke (KO) and Pepsi
(PEP) as former Quaker suitors. This raises two questions: Why is it so
tough to make a deal for Quaker? And who's left to buy the company? One
possibility is Nestle SA (Z.NES). Quaker fell $7 to $87 on Wednesday and
was trading $7 lower on Instinet Friday morning. (GS)



8:40 (Dow Jones) USD/JPY trading within striking distance of 111.73
year high, but trader says unlikely to see it today due to heavy orders
up here. EUR, GBP have rebounded after overnight weakness on
intervention jitters. ECB has declined comment on rumors of
intervention, but traders remain wary. USD/JPY now at 111.17, EUR/USD at
0.8425, GBP/USD at 1.4063. (RTB)



8:35 (Dow Jones) Higher equities futures are taking some of the steam
out of Treasurys following Wednesday's rally, but there is still a bit
of curve-flattening as the long end continues to outperform. Trading is
poised to be in a range, even if stocks deliver a rebound from their
dismal performance earlier in the week. Bond market closes at 2:00 p.m.
EST. (SV)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Bargain-hunting is the order of the day in the stock
market as it is in malls around the country on this day after
Thanksgiving, the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.
Futures are up sharply, and the Nasdaq is seen bouncing off its 12-month
low of 2755.34 set Wednesday.  Many, though, don't think the rally has
legs as election uncertainty, economic worries and earnings concerns
linger like visiting relatives during the holidays. Volume seen light on
this shortened trading day. The stock markets close at 1 p.m. EST. (GS)

111.29. (RTB)



9:20 (Dow Jones) C-SPAN CEO Brian Lamb, in a letter to Supreme Court
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, asks that his network be allowed to
provide TV coverage of any hearing the High Court may decide to hold
regarding the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. U.S. Supreme
Court never has permitted TV coverage of its proceedings. (JC).



9:15 (Dow Jones) "There is great danger lurking in the global
economy," says economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He
sees risk of hard landing, or outright recession, as "high and rising -
especially in the U.S." (JC).



9:12 (Dow Jones) Enron (ENE), in a simple three-paragraph press
release Friday, tried to dispel rumors of a potential profit warning.
President Jeff Skilling said, "All of our businesses are performing
extremely well and we are very comfortable with consensus analyst
earnings estimates of $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2000, and
$1.65 for the full year 2001" It will be interesting to see how
effective the release is. The Houston energy company fell 6% Wednesday
to $75.56. (GS)



9:05 (Dow Jones) A stock-inspired downturn in Treasurys is proving to
be enough to prompt some participants to book some profits after several
stronger days. But at the same time, however, some note that they aren't
yet comfortable with the idea of setting new speculative shorts. Bonds
remain supported by lower dollar versus yen, ongoing tension in Middle
East, credit concerns, buybacks, among other things. (SV)



9:01 (Dow Jones) CME Eurodollar futures, like bonds, will close at 1
p.m. EST. Support for March Eurodollar futures pegged at 93.49.
Resistance for March seen at 93.52 and 93.54/55. (CMN)



8:54 (Dow Jones) Forex market will continue to keep one eye on
election news, trader says. With stock futures up in part on growing
likelihood of Bush win, USD could get bid. But it's looking heavy vs
EUR, JPY. USD/JPY now at 111.22, EUR/USD at 0.8430. (RTB)



8:50 (Dow Jones) Quaker Oats (OAT) shares are trading lower in
premarket trading after Danone Group (DA) ended acquisition talks with
the cereal and sports-drink maker. Danone joins Coke (KO) and Pepsi
(PEP) as former Quaker suitors. This raises two questions: Why is it so
tough to make a deal for Quaker? And who's left to buy the company? One
possibility is Nestle SA (Z.NES). Quaker fell $7 to $87 on Wednesday and
was trading $7 lower on Instinet Friday morning. (GS)



8:40 (Dow Jones) USD/JPY trading within striking distance of 111.73
year high, but trader says unlikely to see it today due to heavy orders
up here. EUR, GBP have rebounded after overnight weakness on
intervention jitters. ECB has declined comment on rumors of
intervention, but traders remain wary. USD/JPY now at 111.17, EUR/USD at
0.8425, GBP/USD at 1.4063. (RTB)



8:35 (Dow Jones) Higher equities futures are taking some of the steam
out of Treasurys following Wednesday's rally, but there is still a bit
of curve-flattening as the long end continues to outperform. Trading is
poised to be in a range, even if stocks deliver a rebound from their
dismal performance earlier in the week. Bond market closes at 2:00 p.m.
EST. (SV)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Bargain-hunting is the order of the day in the stock
market as it is in malls around the country on this day after
Thanksgiving, the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.
Futures are up sharply, and the Nasdaq is seen bouncing off its 12-month
low of 2755.34 set Wednesday.  Many, though, don't think the rally has
legs as election uncertainty, economic worries and earnings concerns
linger like visiting relatives during the holidays. Volume seen light on
this shortened trading day. The stock markets close at 1 p.m. EST. (GS)

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



10:03 (Dow Jones) The initial upward momentum in stocks hasn't done
much to push Treasurys any lower. Support is coming from the dollar's
strength against the yen and the more recent reversal of the dip earlier
against the euro. (SV)



10:01 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are staying strong in the early trade,
floor traders note, but the tone suggests indecision. "It could go
either way and I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up off our highs at
the end of the session, maybe even a little lower. If there's any
election news out, that will sway us," one trader says. He adds that the
strength is likely a rebound from weakness earlier in the week. (DMC)



10:00 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq hits resistance at the session high of
2780 and has pulled back slightly from that area. A move through 2780
could take the contract to Wednesday's high of 2824. Still resistance
seen at 2829. Support comes in at the pivot point of 2728, but solid
support not seen until 2679, floor trader says. (DMC)



9:57 (Dow Jones) End-of-year budget balancing problems at AT&T's (T)
broadband unit is taking a chunk out of the stocks of its suppliers,
Antec (ANTC) and CommScope (CTV). Both companies said in separate press
releases Friday that AT&T Broadband will not accept product deliveries.
Antec is off 36%, while CommScope - which was halted earlier - has lost
30%. Ironically, AT&T remains unaffected, trading flat at nearly $19.
(GS)



9:42 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps could see a broad-based rally as investors
could do some bargain hunting, an off-floor trader says. But if there
are new wrinkles in the election, especially if it appears that the end
may be delayed, stocks could give back gains. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD drops below 84 cents on stock market open,
with Nasdaq, DJIA jumping more than 60 points off the blocks. EUR/USD
now at 0.8394. USD/JPY climbs to nine-month high of 111.37, moving
closer to year high of 111.73. (RTB)



9:38 (Dow Jones) Stocks Start Strong. DJIA up 70 at 10468. Nasdaq
Composite rising 83 to 2838. S&P 500 gaining 15 at 1337. DJIA led by
tech stalwarts Hewlett-Packard, up 6.5%, and Intel, up 3.5%. (GS)



9:35 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq start strong, following gains in
overnight trading. Off-floor trader says market typically gains on the
day after Thanksgiving, but the gains usually come on light volume.
Catalyst for Fri's strength is the Fla. Supreme Court ruling to allow
Miami-Dade county to refuse its manual recount. Mkts close at 12:15 p.m.
CST. (DMC)



9:32 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD has settled back down to the middle of its
intraday range, at 0.8412, ahead of what is seen as a strong U.S. stock
market open. USD/JPY trading just below intraday high of 111.31, now at
111.29. (RTB)

9:57 (Dow Jones) End-of-year budget balancing problems at AT&T's (T)
broadband unit is taking a chunk out of the stocks of its suppliers,
Antec (ANTC) and CommScope (CTV). Both companies said in separate press
releases Friday that AT&T Broadband will not accept product deliveries.
Antec is off 36%, while CommScope - which was halted earlier - has lost
30%. Ironically, AT&T remains unaffected, trading flat at nearly $19.

9:42 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps could see a broad-based rally as investors
could do some bargain hunting, an off-floor trader says. But if there
are new wrinkles in the election, especially if it appears that the end
may be delayed, stocks could give back gains. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD drops below 84 cents on stock market open,
with Nasdaq, DJIA jumping more than 60 points off the blocks. EUR/USD
now at 0.8394. USD/JPY climbs to nine-month high of 111.37, moving
closer to year high of 111.73. (RTB)



9:38 (Dow Jones) Stocks Start Strong. DJIA up 70 at 10468. Nasdaq
Composite rising 83 to 2838. S&P 500 gaining 15 at 1337. DJIA led by
tech stalwarts Hewlett-Packard, up 6.5%, and Intel, up 3.5%. (GS)



9:35 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq start strong, following gains in
overnight trading. Off-floor trader says market typically gains on the
day after Thanksgiving, but the gains usually come on light volume.
Catalyst for Fri's strength is the Fla. Supreme Court ruling to allow
Miami-Dade county to refuse its manual recount. Mkts close at 12:15 p.m.
CST. (DMC)



9:32 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD has settled back down to the middle of its
intraday range, at 0.8412, ahead of what is seen as a strong U.S. stock
market open. USD/JPY trading just below intraday high of 111.31, now at
111.29. (RTB)



9:20 (Dow Jones) C-SPAN CEO Brian Lamb, in a letter to Supreme Court
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, asks that his network be allowed to
provide TV coverage of any hearing the High Court may decide to hold
regarding the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. U.S. Supreme
Court never has permitted TV coverage of its proceedings. (JC).



9:15 (Dow Jones) "There is great danger lurking in the global
economy," says economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He
sees risk of hard landing, or outright recession, as "high and rising -
especially in the U.S." (JC).



9:12 (Dow Jones) Enron (ENE), in a simple three-paragraph press
release Friday, tried to dispel rumors of a potential profit warning.
President Jeff Skilling said, "All of our businesses are performing
extremely well and we are very comfortable with consensus analyst
earnings estimates of $0.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2000, and
$1.65 for the full year 2001" It will be interesting to see how
effective the release is. The Houston energy company fell 6% Wednesday
to $75.56. (GS)



9:05 (Dow Jones) A stock-inspired downturn in Treasurys is proving to
be enough to prompt some participants to book some profits after several
stronger days. But at the same time, however, some note that they aren't
yet comfortable with the idea of setting new speculative shorts. Bonds
remain supported by lower dollar versus yen, ongoing tension in Middle
East, credit concerns, buybacks, among other things. (SV)



9:01 (Dow Jones) CME Eurodollar futures, like bonds, will close at 1
p.m. EST. Support for March Eurodollar futures pegged at 93.49.
Resistance for March seen at 93.52 and 93.54/55. (CMN)



8:54 (Dow Jones) Forex market will continue to keep one eye on
election news, trader says. With stock futures up in part on growing
likelihood of Bush win, USD could get bid. But it's looking heavy vs
EUR, JPY. USD/JPY now at 111.22, EUR/USD at 0.8430. (RTB)



8:50 (Dow Jones) Quaker Oats (OAT) shares are trading lower in
premarket trading after Danone Group (DA) ended acquisition talks with
the cereal and sports-drink maker. Danone joins Coke (KO) and Pepsi
(PEP) as former Quaker suitors. This raises two questions: Why is it so
tough to make a deal for Quaker? And who's left to buy the company? One
possibility is Nestle SA (Z.NES). Quaker fell $7 to $87 on Wednesday and
was trading $7 lower on Instinet Friday morning. (GS)



8:40 (Dow Jones) USD/JPY trading within striking distance of 111.73
year high, but trader says unlikely to see it today due to heavy orders
up here. EUR, GBP have rebounded after overnight weakness on
intervention jitters. ECB has declined comment on rumors of
intervention, but traders remain wary. USD/JPY now at 111.17, EUR/USD at
0.8425, GBP/USD at 1.4063. (RTB)



8:35 (Dow Jones) Higher equities futures are taking some of the steam
out of Treasurys following Wednesday's rally, but there is still a bit
of curve-flattening as the long end continues to outperform. Trading is
poised to be in a range, even if stocks deliver a rebound from their
dismal performance earlier in the week. Bond market closes at 2:00 p.m.
EST. (SV)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Bargain-hunting is the order of the day in the stock
market as it is in malls around the country on this day after
Thanksgiving, the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.
Futures are up sharply, and the Nasdaq is seen bouncing off its 12-month
low of 2755.34 set Wednesday.  Many, though, don't think the rally has
legs as election uncertainty, economic worries and earnings concerns
linger like visiting relatives during the holidays. Volume seen light on
this shortened trading day. The stock markets close at 1 p.m. EST. (GS)

election news, trader says. With stock futures up in part on growing
likelihood of Bush win, USD could get bid. But it's looking heavy vs
EUR, JPY. USD/JPY now at 111.22, EUR/USD at 0.8430. (RTB)



8:50 (Dow Jones) Quaker Oats (OAT) shares are trading lower in
premarket trading after Danone Group (DA) ended acquisition talks with
the cereal and sports-drink maker. Danone joins Coke (KO) and Pepsi
(PEP) as former Quaker suitors. This raises two questions: Why is it so
tough to make a deal for Quaker? And who's left to buy the company? One
possibility is Nestle SA (Z.NES). Quaker fell $7 to $87 on Wednesday and
was trading $7 lower on Instinet Friday morning. (GS)



8:40 (Dow Jones) USD/JPY trading within striking distance of 111.73

intervention jitters. ECB has declined comment on rumors of
intervention, but traders remain wary. USD/JPY now at 111.17, EUR/USD at
0.8425, GBP/USD at 1.4063. (RTB)



8:35 (Dow Jones) Higher equities futures are taking some of the steam
out of Treasurys following Wednesday's rally, but there is still a bit
of curve-flattening as the long end continues to outperform. Trading is
poised to be in a range, even if stocks deliver a rebound from their
dismal performance earlier in the week. Bond market closes at 2:00 p.m.

8:30 (Dow Jones) Bargain-hunting is the order of the day in the stock
market as it is in malls around the country on this day after
Thanksgiving, the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.
Futures are up sharply, and the Nasdaq is seen bouncing off its 12-month
low of 2755.34 set Wednesday.  Many, though, don't think the rally has
legs as election uncertainty, economic worries and earnings concerns
linger like visiting relatives during the holidays. Volume seen light on

 Mayne on the mendMAYNE Nickless Ltd will hold onto both its transport and logistics divisions in a wide-ranging strategic review expected to turn the company around this year. Recently installed chief executive Peter Smedley said earnings, margins, gearing, earnings per share and return on shareholder equity for 2001 would all show improvement over the previous year. 

 Mr Smedley announced the review in August after the company posted a net loss  of $174.1million for the year to July 2, compared to a $482.5million profit a year earlier. Three months later, he has announced Mayne will combat its high cost base, structural duplication and confused market identity with a network business model, streamlined organisational structure and rebranding across the entire group. The market applauded the strategy, sending Mayne shares 38cents higher  to $5.63. Goldmark's US moveAUSTRALIAN jewellery retailer Angus & Coote (Holdings) Ltd hopes to take its youthful Goldmark brand to the US in what would  be its first move offshore. Angus & Coote also enters the crucial Christmas trading period free of the downturn in consumer trading affecting some other retailers, and having made its best ever start to the financial year. 

 Angus & Coote chairman Antony Coote said the retailer was investigating possible moves offshore, but would look for strategic alliances rather than `going it alone'. Angus & Coote shares gained 3cents to $3.59. Hardie's hardy productBUILDING products group James Hardie Industries Ltd unveiled yesterday a revolutionary new production technique it claims will make its fibre cement products lighter and easier to use. The group said that using a new $20million hi-tech production line at its Cleburne plant in Texas, it would produce fibre cement products that were thicker and more lightweight than existing products. 

 `This technology represents a major breakthrough,' chief executive Peter Macdonald said. `It will spawn the development of a wide range of new products for applications which have previously been denied to fibre cement.' James Hardie shares closed 4cents lower at $3.45. OPSM hits new lowSHARES in OPSM Protector Ltd slumped to a five-year low yesterday as investors continued to bail out of the optical and safety technology group following its profit warning  earlier this week. The group's shares plunged as low as $1.75 during the session before clawing back some of their losses to stand down 8.1%, or 17cents, at $1.93. 

 OPSM's shares have not traded around that level since March 1995 when they hit $1.83 before climbing to $2 the following month. The group's shares have been under pressure all week since OPSM warned on Monday that it expected a 40% drop in first half profit following a surprise trading slump. News Corp's retreatSHARES in Rupert Murdoch's media group News Corp continued their unrelenting retreat yesterday with a string of factors driving negative sentiment towards the stock. Analysts said the continuing devaluation of US media and telecommunications stocks was lowering the value of the proposed $40billion spin off of News Corp's satellite assets. 

 Concerns over earnings in the slowing US economy, a downturn in advertising and lingering disappointment with lower than expected first quarter earnings unveiled earlier this month also contributed to sentiment. News Corp shares finished 35cents lower at $16.71 while the preferred scrip dropped 32cents to $14.10. Downer seeks liquidityTHE liquidity of Downer Group shares would be improved if its $224million takeover bid for Evans Deakin Industries (EDI) was successful, managing director Stephen Gillies said. Downer launched the bid last week and has since been rejected by EDI because of `significant issues with the illiquidity and desirability' of Downer scrip. 

 However, Mr Gillies said yesterday one of the by-products of the deal was that Downer shares would be traded more freely and with greater market depth once the takeover was completed. Downer has offered EDI shareholders two alternatives: five Downer shares and $1.50 for every two EDI shares or 15 Downer  shares for every four EDI shares. Downer shares finished yesterday 4cents softer at  59cents while EDI shares were 4cents weaker at $2.06. New float setbackTHE volatile technology sector rattled yesterday another Australian float with Commander Communications Ltd forced to slash $15million off proceeds from its upcoming initial public offer. Commander set a final price of 95cents a share, which was at the lower end of its revised bookbuild range. Tender plan deniedHUTCHISON Telecommunications Ltd said yesterday it was still assessing tenders to build a $1billion high-speed data network with vendor selection scheduled by the end of the year. Hutchison, which is also to decide whether to participate in next year's third generation (3G) spectrum auction, denied yesterday a report it would award the contract to Lucent Technologies. 

 `We have not selected a vendor. We still expect to select a vendor by the end  of the year,' a Hutchison spokesperson said. The Sydney Morning Herald reported  yesterday that Hutchison was expected to award the contract to Lucent, with construction due to start early next year. Hutchison shares fell 17cents to $2.74. Progen patent boostBIOTECHNOLOGY group Progen Industries shares soared nearly 15% yesterday after landing a key United States patent for its anti-cancer drug PI-88. Progen owns the exclusive worldwide licence for the patent, which was granted to Australian National University (ANU) and covers the synthesis and use of PI-88, broadening the protection for the drug which also serves as an anti-thrombotic agent. 

 The patent, which was issued with 23 claims, covers the preparation of sulfated oligosaccharides, in particular the composition of PI-88. Progen shares  climbed 23.8cents to $1.888. Revenue growth intactREGIONAL broadcaster Telecasters Australia Ltd predicted yesterday that its revenue growth in the first quarter should continue to Christmas, but expressed some caution about its calendar 2000 performance. Telecasters chairman Tim Downing said revenue for the six months ending December 2000 should show a pleasing improvement over the previous corresponding period. 

 `Local revenue has continued its consistent growth path and the resurgence in  the national market that began in the last quarter of last financial year should continue through to Christmas,' Mr Downing told the company's annual general meeting. Telecasters shares closed steady at $7.70.

 Outlook bleak for UK hi-tech shares.

 STOCK market seasons have, like the weather, become less well defined as the arrival of day traders and investors taking short positions foster a period of volatility not seen before by experienced stock watchers. 

 The sun has been setting on UK technology shares for some time and the outlook remains bleak in the short-term, although a sudden upturn in the US Nasdaq index could drastically reverse the negative sentiment. 

 A near 6 per cent decline in the new economy techMARK 100 index yesterday, down 175.05 points to 2865.6 seen by some as part of a short-lived switch into defensives, but as the debate rages as to what valuations to put on TMTs, the selling pressure is set to continue. 

 Investors had been content to go with the flow and pay less attention to fundamentals during the bull run, despite some companies trading on crazy multiples, but the blinkers have started coming off as earnings disappointments from the likes of Lucent hit home. 

 Nigel Little, head of technology sector trading and research at Nomura, said: "What I think a lot of chief investment officers have done is instruct their portfolio managers to have a careful look through at what they have bought and where they think it is going in the short-term." 

 Graham Secker, UK strategist with Morgan Stanley, played down the uncertainty over the US election race as a factor in the downturn in equities. 

 What triggered the latest downward spiral was a profit warning from the Dutch IT services group, Getronics, helping to send the techMARK to its lowest close since the end of May. 

 Mr Secker said: "Investors are very skittish on TMTs at this time of year. It is the complete mirror image of last year. Valuations are going down on sentiment and they could easily overshoot on the downside." 

 TMT sectors were responsible for half of the FTSE 100's 160.7 points fall to 6221.4, with IT group, CMG, the biggest blue chip casualty after a 131p fall to 970p. Chip designer, ARM, down 65.5p to 552.5p, internet security firm, Baltimore Technologies, down 39p to 356p, and fibre-optic group, Bookham,124p lower at #11.59, have acquired frequent-faller status, but the media sector was represented on the top losers list by business information group, Reuters, down 112p to #11.15. 

 Under pressure equity markets have also brought a more cautious stance on the fund management sector, with Amvescap hit hardest because of its big exposure to the US. Merrill Lynch has turned bearish on the US fund sector and lowered its earnings for next year for asset managers by an average 7 per cent. 

 Amvescap suffered its second consecutive heavy session loss, down 140p to #13.10, while Aberdeen Asset Management fell 46.5p to 640p and Edinburgh Fund Managers closed 17.5p lower at 695.5p. 

 Mr Secker remained positive on defensive sectors, although UK banks were providing anything but safe havens yesterday. 

 Merrill Lynch turned more cautious on a sector whose strong recent performance had sent it close to its relative all-time high against the UK market. LloydsTSB, which it cut from "accumulate" to "neutral", closed its account 40p in the red at 682p, Barclays fell 85p to #18.60, Royal Bank of Scotland reversed 68p to #14.17, Standard Chartered withdrew 57p to 970.5p, and HSBC fell 52p to 966p. 

 Mr Secker pointed to building society Nationwide's decision to cut its standard variable mortgage rate by 20 basis points, which was adding further competitive pressure to a retail banking sector already in the throes of a fierce price war. 

 The perceived threat to a company's continuing presence in an index is often a cue for more selling pressure and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Support services group, Capita, is falling into that category, with analysts fearing it is slipping towards the relegation trapdoor after a 50p fall to 425p. 

 British Airways has pulled out of such a nosedive after building up a sizeable City fan club following better than expected recent results. The clouds have not disappeared completely from the horizon,. but there is an acceptance the shares may have been oversold. BA's dramatic rise continued with a 14p gain to 397p. 

 The prospect of a bid for internet service provider, Freeserve, up 2.75p to 148.75p, from French rival, Wanadoo, had an immediately uplifting effect on its majority shareholder, Dixons, which climbed 10.25p to 230p as more than 36 million shares changed hands. 

 Mid-cap engineering stock, Glynwed International, tumbled 12p to 185p after the company put the City on a profits alert, but the shares blow was probably softened by speculation of merger activity following the group's separation of its pipes business from its consumer and food service products division. 

 But the negative sector sentiment fed through to Glasgow-based pumps and valves group, Weir, which tumbled 13.5p to 189p.

 Europe and US markets suffer heavy beatings.

 Markets were down sharply across Europe yesterday as the plunging Nasdaq and a continuing lack of direction from the US amid uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election unsettled investors. In New York, the technology heavy Nasdaq took another beating, giving up 4.1 per cent on 2,755.2. 

 Technology stocks, in particular, were hard hit in Europe and sentiment worsened following a profit warning from Getronics. The Dutch information technology company, the world's fifth largest computer services provider, plunged 42 per cent after the company warned it would make a loss in the first half of 2001 due to investment costs and stagnant sales. Germany's Neuer Markt plumbed new depths after its key index fell to an all-time low as panicky investors fled. The Nemax 50 index comprising the top 50 growth stocks in the Neuer Markt - Europe's largest growth market - plunged nearly 10 percent to 3,105.64 points, its largest one-day fall to the lowest level since its launch in April 1998. 

 Negative company news and a string of cancelled initial public offerings domestically compounded the news from abroad. Fund managers and other market participants said yesterday's panic was among many institutional and some retail investors. 

 In Britain, the FTSE 100 slumped to a five-week closing low. Banking stocks knocked 49 points off the blue-chip index, which closed 2.52 per cent lower at 6,221.4. With losers outnumbering gainers by four to one, technology, media and telecom shares (TMT) delivered some 80 points of FTSE downside. The senior market's weakness was reflected in the Techmark index of technology shares, which ended 175.05 points or 5.76 per cent lower at 2,865.60, its lowest close since the end of May. In New York, blue-chips were also hobbled by concern that Republican candidate Governor George W Bush's lead in the election may be in doubt. Drug and tobacco stocks, which are widely viewed as benefiting from a Republican victory, fell amid fears for future earnings in the sector. 

 But the Dow's slide was cushioned by a rebound in Coca Cola after it scrapped efforts to buy Quaker Oats. The US markets will have time to ponder their current malaise as they remain closed today for the US Thanksgiving holiday. Tomorrow brings a shortened session, so it is likely to be next week before investors get some indication as to whether the market has bottomed out ... and whether the nation has a new president. 

 In Europe, lack of news from the US is only like to exacerbate the current unease.

 Global equity markets suffered another bout of jitters yesterday as concern about earnings growth of high-value technology stocks added to deepening unease about the outcome of the US presidential election. 

 On Wall Street the technology-packed Nasdaq Composite plunged 113 points in early trading to a level not seen since October last year. By lunchtime the main US indices had made a slight recovery, with the Nasdaq down around 84 points. 

 In London, the blue chip FTSE 100 index slipped 160.7 points to 6,221.4, a five-week closing low, with technology and telecoms issues bearing the brunt of losses. The Techmark index ended 175 points weaker at 2,865.60, its lowest closing level since May. 

 The immediate cause of the nervousness was a Florida supreme court ruling allowing the hand recount of votes in the state, a verdict which threatens to prolong the battle for the White House by at least another five days. 

 Investors in the US are also worried about the slowdown in the economy. Some analysts have noted that fourth-quarter earnings growth could be half of that anticipated. 

 Fears about earnings growth of technology stocks were back on the agenda after a surprise profit warning from the Netherlands-based Getronics. The world's fifth-biggest computer services provider stunned investors when it warned it would make a loss in the first half of 2001 due to investment costs and sluggish sales. 

 European technology stocks were sold off on the news with rivals such as Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, Sema and CMG among the worst hit. The German Nemax 50 index comprising the top 50 growth stocks in the Neuer Markt - Europe's largest growth market - fell nearly 10% to 3,105.64 points, its largest one-day fall to the lowest level since it was launched in April 1998. 

 In Paris the CAC 40 index ended more than 100 points lower. Asian markets were also hit by the uncertainty with the Nikkei in Tokyo falling to a 20-month closing low.

 Australia Corp Bonds: BBB Rating Sector Expands

   A Dow Jones Newswires Column



SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- The BBB rating sector of the Australian corporate
bond market expanded this week with a total A$250 million of issuance.


 Victoria-based Bendigo Bank Ltd. (A.BBK), rated BBB- by Standard & Poor's, brought a A$100 million two-year floating-rate note to market at 44 basis points over the quarterly bank bill rate via lead managers UBS Warburg Australia and Westpac Banking Corp. 

 The deal cleared Wednesday after the leads initiated a soft bookbuild process in advance of the launch Tuesday. It was allocated to fund managers, banks and through the leads' private client networks, according to Linh Quach, the manager of Westpac's syndication and international desk. 

 And despite issuing a profit warning Wednesday, oil refiner and petroleum products company Caltex Australia Ltd. (A.CTX) proceeded with the launch Thursday of an A$150 million three-year FRN. 

 The deal is due to be priced at an indicative spread of between 73-75 basis points over the three-month bank bill swap rate at 0000 GMT Friday. 

 Caltex said it had downgraded its annual profit outlook due to a partial shutdown of its Kurnell refinery in Sydney. The company said pretax earnings in November and December will be between A$10 million and A$20 million lower due to the shutdown. 

 While market analysts suggested the profit warning would have come as a nasty surprise for many investors, they said the company's rating comes largely as a factor of its parentage. Caltex is 50%-owned by a joint venture of Texaco Inc. (TX) and Chevron Corp. (CHV). 

 Indeed, S&P assigned its BBB+ long-term rating to the Caltex note issue Tuesday, but stated that this was also due to the company's "satisfactory stand-alone credit quality due to its strong market position in the Australian downstream petroleum industry...." 


         Caltex Downgrade Prompts Reassessment



The news came after Caltex had conducted roadshows to investors on the
deal, prompting the lead manager National Australia Bank to reapproach
fund managers to see if they were still interested in the deal.



"They all said 'yes', bar one or two," said NAB's director of debt
capital markets Mark Garrick. "The order-book is looking very healthy -
there was good Asian interest due to Caltex being such a good name
there."



The company is concurrently undertaking a US$750 million syndicated
loan facility, and Garrick says that the relatively attractive pricing
of the Australian deal has brought potential investors in the U.S.
dollar transaction over to this deal. The minimum investment size of
US$75 million in the U.S. dollar loan has also encouraged some smaller
funds to switch to this deal, he adds.



While Caltex generated some interest for a fixed-rate deal, Garrick
points out that BBB-rated offerings generally still come under three
years in maturity due to continuing investor caution with this credit
sector.



         Increasing Development In Corp Mkt



But the arrival of Bendigo Bank's deal, especially, is a sign of the
development of the corporate credit market in Australia, according to
credit analysts.



"To see a BBB- credit, the lowest rung of investment grade, issue
domestically marks another quiet milestone for the increasing
development and diversity on offer in the corporate bond market," said
Salomon Smith Barney fixed-income credit research head Brad Scott.



"Twelve months ago it was inconceivable that a BBB- issue could have
come to the Australian dollar market, but Bendigo's deal demonstrates
that changing fund mandates and a better understanding of credit now
make that dream a reality," said Scott.



Other notable breakthroughs in the BBB sector this year include an
A$100 million 10-year offering from Southcorp Ltd. (A.SBG), a five-year
issue from John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. (A.FFX), and a sizeable deal from
Qantas Airways Ltd. (A.QAN), points out Scott. All these borrowers are
rated BBB+.



Another BBB issuer - Adelaide Airport Ltd. - is also lining up to
issue in the near future, but the deal is expected to be credit-wrapped
by MBIA Insurance Corp. The issuer is also targeting the longer maturity
sector with an issue expected in the seven- to 10-year sector.

General Electric Co. said analysts' fourth-quarter profit estimates are accurate and said speculation that it will issue a profit warning is "outrageous." The maker of appliances, aircraft engines and locomotives is expected to have a fourth-quarter profit of 36 cents a share, the average forecast of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. GE had net income of $3.09 billion, or 31 cents adjusted for a stock split, in the year-earlier period. Full-year profit will be $1.27 a share, matching First Call estimates, spokesman Mark Vachon said.

 Falls on Nasdaq, Nikkei dash hope for market recovery.

 NASDAQ'S Monday plunge to its lowest level in almost 13 months and the Nikkei 225 Average's drop yesterday to a 20-month low put paid to any faint hopes that the local market could recover significantly from Monday's sell-off. 

 The impact these two overseas falls had on sentiment here was readily apparent as sellers emerged in all sectors, although there seemed to be particularly harsher treatment reserved for electronics stocks. 

 Still, the advance-decline score improved steadily as the day wore on, ending the day at 104-163. Also, the Straits Times Index managed a relatively admirable performance, falling just 9.81 points to 1,924.38 after threatening earlier in the day to break below 1,900. 

 Stocks that helped the index reduce its deficit were Venture Manufacturing and Chartered Semiconductor, which rose off their floors in the afternoon, and Singapore Telecom, which remained strong throughout the day. 

 However, although a bounce of this sort could be interpreted as a sign of resilience of sorts, sceptics within broking ranks were more inclined to attribute it to short-covering than genuine "bargain hunting". 

 One chartist preferred a technical explanation, saying investors yesterday had a clear view of a "classic short-term reversal pattern" that also manifested itself in Japan. "You had the Nikkei open sharply lower, then recover significantly, and this was exactly the case here," he said. 

 However, in the longer term, he pointed out that "the bottom line is that when Nasdaq hurts, we hurt. And right now, Nasdaq is hurting a lot." 

 Part of the US technology board's problems on Monday came from profit warnings, but wire reports said they also came after a warning by an analyst from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co that spending is likely to slow at companies that operate communications networks, a report that sent the Nasdaq index down 5 per cent. 

 Meanwhile, ST Engineering's rehabilitation from last Friday's blow-out entered its second consecutive day with the counter adding 6 cents at $2.64 on a volume of 6.8 million units. Brokers said the market appeared to be quickly coming round to the idea that Friday's sell-off - brought on by news that the company failed in a bid to win a big US Army contract - was overdone. 

 Elsewhere, Marco Polo Developments appeared to defy the odds after it reported a disappointing 39 per cent interim profit slump - the counter gained two cents at $1.69 although just 75 lots were traded. The company said the profit fall was because of a change in accounting policy relating to the booking of profit from its Ardmore Park project. 

 Kim Eng Securities issued a "buy", mainly because Marco Polo has "a super-prime landbank" and because "valuations are attractive, at a 44 per cent discount to revalued net tangible assets (RNAV) per share of $2.99 and four times current earnings". 

 OUB Securities was a tad more conservative, calling a "buy" only below $1.60. It said although the discount to RNAV was large, it appears unlikely that Marco Polo will be able to meet its full-year profit forecast of $256 million. 

 Turnover of almost 14 million Chartered shares and 17 million Omni Industries shares helped bolster the final volume figures. Excluding foreign currency issues, 298.40 million units worth $567.20 million were traded. Non-Singapore dollar stocks accounted for another 12 million units.

 Non-Profit Agency Says California Electricity Report Is Optimistic

 The California Energy Commission's report that the state has enough electricity for next summer is overly optimistic, says the California Independent System Operator. 

 "Basically, we are a little perplexed," said ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley. "Their details paint an optimistic picture of things." 

 The California Energy Commission, a state agency that oversees a variety of energy issues from gasoline and natural gas to electricity, released its report Monday. 

 The report said that predictions of a looming energy crisis next summer are exaggerated. The state has enough electricity-generation resources to meet projected demand, the Energy Commission said, although price and market factors could cause shortages. 

 "The sky is not falling," said Energy Commission Executive Director Steve Larson. The ISO, a non-profit agency set up in 1997 to run the state's electric grid and ensure reliability, has been warning of an electricity shortfall of up to 5,000 megawatts next summer. 

 O'Donley said the ISO is re-examining its numbers in light of the Energy Commission report. 

 But several of the assumptions in the report are optimistic, she said. The commission report, for instance, lists new generation resources coming on line July 1 or Aug. 1, O'Donley said. 

 "That would be great if summer starts in July or August. But it leaves us hanging in May and June," she said. 

 The commission's numbers for savings from industries that volunteer for interruptible power is also optimistic, O'Donley said. 

 "We've seen participation in those programs decline over the last six months," she said. 

 Commission numbers for imported power from the Pacific Northwest are also optimistic, O'Donley said. 

 "There's not a lot of margin for error in their scenario," she added. "They only leave a couple of hundred megawatts to play with. That's almost as tight as Florida," O'Donley said, referring to the razor-thin presidential election results in that state. 

 The Energy Commission did emphasize that the state needs to continue pushing energy conservation programs and processing applications for new power plants -- a point that both agencies do agree on.

 Euro High Yield Picture Bleak Led By CP Kelco Downfall

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- European high yield debt has taken a turn for the worse, led by U.S. biogum manufacturer CP Kelco ApS which was downgraded by Standard and Poors after releasing poor earnings Monday. 

 Traders early Wednesday said its EUR255 million ten-year notes were last quoted at 55/58 cents in illiquid trade, now that lead manager Lehman Brothers has ceased trading on the issue. 

 The notes were trading close to par at the beginning of last week, before traders and investors were caught off guard ahead of a profitwarning released last Thursday. 

 Generally, the European high yield market is ending the year on a bleak note, led by losses in its U.S. counterpart, volatility in the telecom sector and high oil prices. Activity in the primary market has now dried up entirely with no new issuance expected until January. 

 Merrill Lynch's European high yield index last posted negative returns of 1.729% year to date, versus negative 2.111% returns for the U.S. high yield market, in local currency terms. 

 Last Thursday the B3/B- rated CP Kelco released a profit warning that caused its notes to trade down to the 60 area from 98 points at the beginning of the week. Official results released Monday show EBITDA for the third quarter was 33% lower than the previous year, while turnover was also lower than expected. 

 Competitive prices from substitute products also caused margins to drop 19% in its food segment. Although net debt fell slightly during the quarter, its leverage ratio stands at 6.6 times earnings before tax, interest and depreciation on an annualized basis, from 5.1 times at the end of June 2000. 

 This triggered the borrower's need for a capital injection as well as a comprehensive financial and operating review. 

 Despite a $50 million injection by shareholder Lehman Brother's private equity group, both agencies have placed CP Kelco on negative outlook. 

 Standard and Poors has also lowered the borrower's rating by one notch to B-, stating in its report: "The uncertainties raised in the company's report could impair CP Kelco's access to the capital markets and may reduce the firm's ability to meet financial covenants and debt maturities related to its bank facilities." 

 Analysts remain vigilant on the credit awaiting asset sales and cost reduction measures, but most note the borrower does not have immediate liquidity concerns now nor does it have a reliance on oil as a raw material, making earnings less cyclical. 

 CP Kelco's EUR255 million bond was launched in September amid less than auspicious market conditions following profit warnings from Intel that weighed on the entire market. The notes priced at par with a 11.875% yield. 

 CP Kelco was bought-out from Pharmacia Monsanto Biogums earlier this year and is now owned by Hercules Food Gums and Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P.

 NY Stocks Come Back A Bit, But Software, Internet Are Off

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index remain off, but have come off of their low points of the day. 

 The Internet sector is weak, with CacheFlow, whose systems store and update frequently requested Internet sites, down $31.88, or 42%, to 45 after posting a narrower-than-expected fiscal second-quarter loss, but indicating slower revenue growth. 

 Among large Internet concerns, Yahoo! has lost 2.25 to 39.50 and Commerce One is down 5.16 to 33.84. But eBay, after initially being off, is up 2.31 to 33.81. 

 Software stocks are down on concerns about the quality of earnings and revenues after some reported results. 

 Portal Software, whose billing systems aid Internet concerns, has lost 12.19, or 65%, to 6.44 after beating third-quarter estimates but trimming guidance for 2001. A number of analysts reduced their projections of the company's future performance, citing disappointing revenue growth and missed expectations for software licenses. 

 Intuit is off 4.25, or 9%, to 44 after the maker of financial software showed a pro forma loss of 10 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter, compared with analysts' expectation of a loss of 16 cents a share. Still, ABN Amro downgraded the stock to add from buy, citing a possible market share shift as the company moves from direct selling to retail and Web-based sales. 

 Dow component General Electric is off 1.63 to 49.13 after the company issued a statement disputing rumors that it would issue a profitwarning. GE reaffirmed its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year earnings estimates. 

 Coca-Cola is up 4.69 to 59.39, helping to prop the Dow, and Quaker Oats has lost 7.50 to 87.50 after Coke's board rejected an $15.75 billion all-stock offer for Quaker Oats. 

 The Dow and the Nasdaq had both been off about 120 points at their lows of the day, but have bounced back a bit after the Miami-Dade canvassing board decided to halt its recount, saying it couldn't meet the Sunday deadline. The Gore camp had hoped to pick up significant ground with those votes. 

 The move seems to bode well for George W. Bush, but a number of traders said that the market isn't pushing for Bush per se. Rather, the prospect of a quicker outcome, with someone named president, is what the market most wants, traders said. 

 At the same time, one strategist said the focus on tech is obscuring a generally okay performance by the rest of the market, which has lots of other stocks to choose from. 

 "Coverage of the Nasdaq and tech stocks is so intense you could be lulled into thinking the overall market is having a terrible year," said Charles Blood, chief market strategist with Brown Brothers Harriman. 

 "However, outside of tech, the market has been doing just fine, a trend expected to continue in 2001," Blood said. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 61.13 points, or 0.43%, to 10451.31 and the Nasdaq Composite Index is off 83.05, or 2.61%, to 2796.16. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down 14.28, or 1.09%, to 1322.93 and the New York Composite Index has dropped 6.59, or 1.2% to 628.06. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners outpace gainers 1,894 to 827. Volume on the Big Board is 725 million shares.

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



10:38 (Dow Jones) Nasdaq Composite drops below 2800 level for first
time since Oct. 27, 1999. Computers, financials leading way down. Nasdaq
off 72 at 2799. (TG)



10:34 (Dow Jones) Another day, another open interest record for the
E-mini Nasdaq, which rose to 65562 contracts on Tuesday, according to
CME stats. The previous record was just set on Monday at 63088
contracts. (DMC)



10:30 (Dow Jones) Renewed weakness in Dec. Nasdaq takes that market to
a new contract low, so far at 2745. The previous contract low was 2755
set on Nov. 13. (DMC)



10:25 (Dow Jones) Although the market holds above support, one trader
sees Dec. S&Ps testing the lows, with a move to at least 1337 likely.
"This market still does not act good," he says. As the session wears on,
moves might become more exaggerated because volume will decrease. (DMC)



10:19 (Dow Jones) HFE economist Ian Shepherdson calls 107.6 Michigan
sentiment reading - roughly unchanged from mid-month - "something of a
relief" given recent stock market declines and election uncertainty.
"With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect
robust growth in consumer spending," he adds. (BB)



10:17 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are in mid-range after short covering
boosted the market to near session highs earlier. Traders say the market
has digested the election news. "It's not down because it looks good for
Gore, it's down because people are tired of this," one trader says.
(DMC)



10:15 (Dow Jones) Economists at Merrill Lynch say the rise in jobless
claims points to Nov. payroll growth of 145K and a 0.1 point uptick in
the jobless rate to 4%. (BB)



10:10 (Dow Jones) Brian Belski, market strategist at US Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, notes that within the S&P 500's top 10 performing stocks so far
in November, seven have current multiples at significant discounts to
the market's expected multiple of 23.3. "This clear trend of valuation
shopping is a sign to us that investors are doing fundamental research
again," he says. Stick to names with positive long-term fundamentals, he
adds. (TG)



9:50 (Dow Jones) A quick look at the "Bush Portfolio" shows how Wall
Street feels about last night's court ruling: Philip Morris (MO) off 4%,
Merck (MRK) down 2%, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) loses 1.4%, AMEX
Pharmaceutical index off 1.8%, and AMEX Oil index slips 0.6%. (TG)



9:42 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq is weaker, but bounces off of lows. The
market opened at 2755, the contract low from October, but has pared
losses since then. Market has mild resistance at 2798 and at 2809.50,
the pivot point. Support seen at 2755 and 2744, according to a floor
trader. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) had much riding on
buspirone, its generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY)
anti-anxiety drug BuSpar, especially if the FDA had approved its filing
today. But with the surprise of Bristol-Myers receiving and listing a
patent with the FDA, Watson's drive to secure a piece of BuSpar's $700
million market is effectively blocked. The company expects 4Q of this
year and all of 2001 to be hit as a result. The shares have not opened
and are indicated sharply lower. (BMM)



9:32 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq are lower, following losses
incurred overnight after the Florida Supreme Court announcement. Dec.
Nasdaq took out contract low of 2755 in overnight action; traders will
watch if that is repeated during pit trade. Focus for markets will be on
election news and the tech sector after recent losses, according to an
off-floor trader. (DMC)



9:28 (Dow Jones) Underwriters can take Wednesday off to get a jump on
basting the bird. Rigel Pharmaceuticals was supposed to price its IPO
Tuesday and trade today, but, instead, the company cut terms on its deal
yet again and delayed the offering. Rigel, which pulled its offering in
the spring, now says it will sell 5 million shares at $7 or $8. That's a
far cry from the 9 million shares at between $8 and $10 a share it hoped
to sell earlier this week. Rigel's pullout leaves no IPOs on the this
week's docket. (RJH)



9:23 (Dow Jones) Portal Software (PRSF) beat 3Q earnings estimates,
but its revenue growth was disappointing and software licenses missed
expectations - marking the first hiccup since last May's IPO. Portal
also trimmed guidance for 2001. The culprits: financing woes among its
telecom customers and increased competition from more established
vendors, like Amdocs (DOX). Stock poised to open 50% lower. (MLP)



9:16 (Dow Jones) Spread widening of bonds in banking sector is
warranted by deteriorating fundamentals, says Gimme Credit. The research
service says more banks likely to be hit with problem loans in months
ahead. Federal Mogul (FMO), Loews Cineplex (LCP), and AMF Bowling (PIN)
all have loans that could have bankers reaching for Maalox, says Gimme.
(DA)



9:13 (Dow Jones) In response to market rumors, GE comes out and backs
4Q, 2000 earnings views. Calls rumor of profit warning "outrageous."
Stock futures coming back a bit. (TG)



9:09 (Dow Jones) CBOT T-bonds up half a point, mainly on election news
and stocks, but low volume ahead of holiday keeping market from adding
to its early gains. "You'd think we'd be higher, but it's pretty quiet
here," trader says. (DMR)



8:55 (Dow Jones) John Roque notes that some observers claim that
technology represents some value, but the Arnold & S. Bleichroeder
technician says that value is still being created. "There is still no
real reason to step up to get aggressive on tech," he says. (TG)



8:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman cuts 4Q view on Home Depot (HD) to 25c a share
from 27c, 2000 view t $1.15 from $1.16, and 2001 estimate to $1.40 from
$1.45. While impressed with long-term initiatives to drive sales and
control costs, the brokerage firm senses a more conservative outlook
from management. Reiterates cautious outlook on stock, though it
continues to believe HD is one of the best names in retailing. (TG)



8:36 (Dow Jones) Jobless claims rose by 7,000 in the week ended Nov.
18 to 336,000 from an upward revised level in the prior week.  That
brings the 4-week moving average to 330,250.  The increases seem to
reflect layoffs in the auto industry, which are themselves a sign of
fundamental weakening in demand.  (JM)



8:34 (Dow Jones) A Greenwich Capital Markets Treasury strategist says
Gore's renewed chance of victory helps put the yield curve flatteners
back on, and should help widen credit spreads at the same time. It will
also allow for a test of the October yield curve low, with the 10-year
snipping away at a 5.56% yield, which means the issue's already decent
bid can improve. (MSD)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Stocks just can't get a break. Last night's ruling
from the Florida Supreme Court was a blow to George W. Bush and a
perceived blow to equities. At least that's how traders are interpreting
the short-term impact. Increasing talk of a Constitutional crisis isn't
helping. Meanwhile, there seems to be more concern that the soft landing
the Fed is trying to engineer may be in jeopardy. Trading will likely be
slowish Wednesday, particularly later in the session. The expected move
to the downside may be exacerbated by a lack of full participation in
front of Thanksgiving. Stock futures sharply lower, and Nasdaq may crack
below 2800. Sentiment numbers should be interesting. (TG)

10:30 (Dow Jones) Renewed weakness in Dec. Nasdaq takes that market to
a new contract low, so far at 2745. The previous contract low was 2755
set on Nov. 13. (DMC)

Pharmaceutical index off 1.8%, and AMEX Oil index slips 0.6%. (TG)



9:42 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq is weaker, but bounces off of lows. The
market opened at 2755, the contract low from October, but has pared
losses since then. Market has mild resistance at 2798 and at 2809.50,
the pivot point. Support seen at 2755 and 2744, according to a floor
trader. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) had much riding on
buspirone, its generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY)
anti-anxiety drug BuSpar, especially if the FDA had approved its filing
today. But with the surprise of Bristol-Myers receiving and listing a
patent with the FDA, Watson's drive to secure a piece of BuSpar's $700
million market is effectively blocked. The company expects 4Q of this
year and all of 2001 to be hit as a result. The shares have not opened
and are indicated sharply lower. (BMM)



9:32 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq are lower, following losses
incurred overnight after the Florida Supreme Court announcement. Dec.
Nasdaq took out contract low of 2755 in overnight action; traders will
watch if that is repeated during pit trade. Focus for markets will be on
election news and the tech sector after recent losses, according to an
off-floor trader. (DMC)



9:28 (Dow Jones) Underwriters can take Wednesday off to get a jump on
basting the bird. Rigel Pharmaceuticals was supposed to price its IPO
Tuesday and trade today, but, instead, the company cut terms on its deal
yet again and delayed the offering. Rigel, which pulled its offering in
the spring, now says it will sell 5 million shares at $7 or $8. That's a
far cry from the 9 million shares at between $8 and $10 a share it hoped
to sell earlier this week. Rigel's pullout leaves no IPOs on the this
week's docket. (RJH)



9:23 (Dow Jones) Portal Software (PRSF) beat 3Q earnings estimates,
but its revenue growth was disappointing and software licenses missed
expectations - marking the first hiccup since last May's IPO. Portal
also trimmed guidance for 2001. The culprits: financing woes among its
telecom customers and increased competition from more established
vendors, like Amdocs (DOX). Stock poised to open 50% lower. (MLP)



9:16 (Dow Jones) Spread widening of bonds in banking sector is
warranted by deteriorating fundamentals, says Gimme Credit. The research
service says more banks likely to be hit with problem loans in months
ahead. Federal Mogul (FMO), Loews Cineplex (LCP), and AMF Bowling (PIN)
all have loans that could have bankers reaching for Maalox, says Gimme.
(DA)



9:13 (Dow Jones) In response to market rumors, GE comes out and backs
4Q, 2000 earnings views. Calls rumor of profit warning "outrageous."
Stock futures coming back a bit. (TG)



9:09 (Dow Jones) CBOT T-bonds up half a point, mainly on election news
and stocks, but low volume ahead of holiday keeping market from adding
to its early gains. "You'd think we'd be higher, but it's pretty quiet
here," trader says. (DMR)



8:55 (Dow Jones) John Roque notes that some observers claim that
technology represents some value, but the Arnold & S. Bleichroeder
technician says that value is still being created. "There is still no
real reason to step up to get aggressive on tech," he says. (TG)



8:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman cuts 4Q view on Home Depot (HD) to 25c a share
from 27c, 2000 view t $1.15 from $1.16, and 2001 estimate to $1.40 from
$1.45. While impressed with long-term initiatives to drive sales and
control costs, the brokerage firm senses a more conservative outlook
from management. Reiterates cautious outlook on stock, though it
continues to believe HD is one of the best names in retailing. (TG)



8:36 (Dow Jones) Jobless claims rose by 7,000 in the week ended Nov.
18 to 336,000 from an upward revised level in the prior week.  That
brings the 4-week moving average to 330,250.  The increases seem to
reflect layoffs in the auto industry, which are themselves a sign of
fundamental weakening in demand.  (JM)



8:34 (Dow Jones) A Greenwich Capital Markets Treasury strategist says
Gore's renewed chance of victory helps put the yield curve flatteners
back on, and should help widen credit spreads at the same time. It will
also allow for a test of the October yield curve low, with the 10-year
snipping away at a 5.56% yield, which means the issue's already decent
bid can improve. (MSD)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Stocks just can't get a break. Last night's ruling
from the Florida Supreme Court was a blow to George W. Bush and a
perceived blow to equities. At least that's how traders are interpreting
the short-term impact. Increasing talk of a Constitutional crisis isn't
helping. Meanwhile, there seems to be more concern that the soft landing
the Fed is trying to engineer may be in jeopardy. Trading will likely be
slowish Wednesday, particularly later in the session. The expected move
to the downside may be exacerbated by a lack of full participation in
front of Thanksgiving. Stock futures sharply lower, and Nasdaq may crack
below 2800. Sentiment numbers should be interesting. (TG)

 MARKET TALK: More Weakness Possible In Dec. S&Ps

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



10:25 (Dow Jones) Although the market holds above support, one trader
sees Dec. S&Ps testing the lows, with a move to at least 1337 likely.
"This market still does not act good," he says. As the session wears on,
moves might become more exaggerated because volume will decrease. (DMC)



10:19 (Dow Jones) HFE economist Ian Shepherdson calls 107.6 Michigan
sentiment reading - roughly unchanged from mid-month - "something of a
relief" given recent stock market declines and election uncertainty.
"With the index at these levels, it would still be reasonable to expect
robust growth in consumer spending," he adds. (BB)



10:17 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are in mid-range after short covering
boosted the market to near session highs earlier. Traders say the market
has digested the election news. "It's not down because it looks good for
Gore, it's down because people are tired of this," one trader says.
(DMC)



10:15 (Dow Jones) Economists at Merrill Lynch say the rise in jobless
claims points to Nov. payroll growth of 145K and a 0.1 point uptick in
the jobless rate to 4%. (BB)



10:10 (Dow Jones) Brian Belski, market strategist at US Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, notes that within the S&P 500's top 10 performing stocks so far
in November, seven have current multiples at significant discounts to
the market's expected multiple of 23.3. "This clear trend of valuation
shopping is a sign to us that investors are doing fundamental research
again," he says. Stick to names with positive long-term fundamentals, he
adds. (TG)



9:50 (Dow Jones) A quick look at the "Bush Portfolio" shows how Wall
Street feels about last night's court ruling: Philip Morris (MO) off 4%,
Merck (MRK) down 2%, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) loses 1.4%, AMEX
Pharmaceutical index off 1.8%, and AMEX Oil index slips 0.6%. (TG)

10:15 (Dow Jones) Economists at Merrill Lynch say the rise in jobless
claims points to Nov. payroll growth of 145K and a 0.1 point uptick in
the jobless rate to 4%. (BB)



10:10 (Dow Jones) Brian Belski, market strategist at US Bancorp Piper
Jaffray, notes that within the S&P 500's top 10 performing stocks so far
in November, seven have current multiples at significant discounts to
the market's expected multiple of 23.3. "This clear trend of valuation
shopping is a sign to us that investors are doing fundamental research
again," he says. Stick to names with positive long-term fundamentals, he
adds. (TG)



9:50 (Dow Jones) A quick look at the "Bush Portfolio" shows how Wall
Street feels about last night's court ruling: Philip Morris (MO) off 4%,
Merck (MRK) down 2%, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) loses 1.4%, AMEX
Pharmaceutical index off 1.8%, and AMEX Oil index slips 0.6%. (TG)



9:42 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq is weaker, but bounces off of lows. The
market opened at 2755, the contract low from October, but has pared
losses since then. Market has mild resistance at 2798 and at 2809.50,
the pivot point. Support seen at 2755 and 2744, according to a floor
trader. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) had much riding on
buspirone, its generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY)
anti-anxiety drug BuSpar, especially if the FDA had approved its filing
today. But with the surprise of Bristol-Myers receiving and listing a
patent with the FDA, Watson's drive to secure a piece of BuSpar's $700
million market is effectively blocked. The company expects 4Q of this
year and all of 2001 to be hit as a result. The shares have not opened
and are indicated sharply lower. (BMM)



9:32 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq are lower, following losses
incurred overnight after the Florida Supreme Court announcement. Dec.
Nasdaq took out contract low of 2755 in overnight action; traders will
watch if that is repeated during pit trade. Focus for markets will be on
election news and the tech sector after recent losses, according to an
off-floor trader. (DMC)



9:28 (Dow Jones) Underwriters can take Wednesday off to get a jump on
basting the bird. Rigel Pharmaceuticals was supposed to price its IPO
Tuesday and trade today, but, instead, the company cut terms on its deal
yet again and delayed the offering. Rigel, which pulled its offering in
the spring, now says it will sell 5 million shares at $7 or $8. That's a
far cry from the 9 million shares at between $8 and $10 a share it hoped
to sell earlier this week. Rigel's pullout leaves no IPOs on the this
week's docket. (RJH)



9:23 (Dow Jones) Portal Software (PRSF) beat 3Q earnings estimates,
but its revenue growth was disappointing and software licenses missed
expectations - marking the first hiccup since last May's IPO. Portal
also trimmed guidance for 2001. The culprits: financing woes among its
telecom customers and increased competition from more established
vendors, like Amdocs (DOX). Stock poised to open 50% lower. (MLP)



9:16 (Dow Jones) Spread widening of bonds in banking sector is
warranted by deteriorating fundamentals, says Gimme Credit. The research
service says more banks likely to be hit with problem loans in months
ahead. Federal Mogul (FMO), Loews Cineplex (LCP), and AMF Bowling (PIN)
all have loans that could have bankers reaching for Maalox, says Gimme.
(DA)



9:13 (Dow Jones) In response to market rumors, GE comes out and backs
4Q, 2000 earnings views. Calls rumor of profit warning "outrageous."
Stock futures coming back a bit. (TG)



9:09 (Dow Jones) CBOT T-bonds up half a point, mainly on election news
and stocks, but low volume ahead of holiday keeping market from adding
to its early gains. "You'd think we'd be higher, but it's pretty quiet
here," trader says. (DMR)



8:55 (Dow Jones) John Roque notes that some observers claim that
technology represents some value, but the Arnold & S. Bleichroeder
technician says that value is still being created. "There is still no
real reason to step up to get aggressive on tech," he says. (TG)



8:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman cuts 4Q view on Home Depot (HD) to 25c a share
from 27c, 2000 view t $1.15 from $1.16, and 2001 estimate to $1.40 from
$1.45. While impressed with long-term initiatives to drive sales and
control costs, the brokerage firm senses a more conservative outlook
from management. Reiterates cautious outlook on stock, though it
continues to believe HD is one of the best names in retailing. (TG)



8:36 (Dow Jones) Jobless claims rose by 7,000 in the week ended Nov.
18 to 336,000 from an upward revised level in the prior week.  That
brings the 4-week moving average to 330,250.  The increases seem to
reflect layoffs in the auto industry, which are themselves a sign of
fundamental weakening in demand.  (JM)



8:34 (Dow Jones) A Greenwich Capital Markets Treasury strategist says
Gore's renewed chance of victory helps put the yield curve flatteners
back on, and should help widen credit spreads at the same time. It will
also allow for a test of the October yield curve low, with the 10-year
snipping away at a 5.56% yield, which means the issue's already decent
bid can improve. (MSD)

9:40 (Dow Jones) Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) had much riding on
buspirone, its generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY)
anti-anxiety drug BuSpar, especially if the FDA had approved its filing
today. But with the surprise of Bristol-Myers receiving and listing a
patent with the FDA, Watson's drive to secure a piece of BuSpar's $700
million market is effectively blocked. The company expects 4Q of this
year and all of 2001 to be hit as a result. The shares have not opened
and are indicated sharply lower. (BMM)



9:32 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq are lower, following losses
incurred overnight after the Florida Supreme Court announcement. Dec.
Nasdaq took out contract low of 2755 in overnight action; traders will
watch if that is repeated during pit trade. Focus for markets will be on
election news and the tech sector after recent losses, according to an
off-floor trader. (DMC)



9:28 (Dow Jones) Underwriters can take Wednesday off to get a jump on
basting the bird. Rigel Pharmaceuticals was supposed to price its IPO
Tuesday and trade today, but, instead, the company cut terms on its deal
yet again and delayed the offering. Rigel, which pulled its offering in
the spring, now says it will sell 5 million shares at $7 or $8. That's a
far cry from the 9 million shares at between $8 and $10 a share it hoped
to sell earlier this week. Rigel's pullout leaves no IPOs on the this
week's docket. (RJH)



9:23 (Dow Jones) Portal Software (PRSF) beat 3Q earnings estimates,
but its revenue growth was disappointing and software licenses missed
expectations - marking the first hiccup since last May's IPO. Portal
also trimmed guidance for 2001. The culprits: financing woes among its
telecom customers and increased competition from more established
vendors, like Amdocs (DOX). Stock poised to open 50% lower. (MLP)



9:16 (Dow Jones) Spread widening of bonds in banking sector is
warranted by deteriorating fundamentals, says Gimme Credit. The research
service says more banks likely to be hit with problem loans in months
ahead. Federal Mogul (FMO), Loews Cineplex (LCP), and AMF Bowling (PIN)
all have loans that could have bankers reaching for Maalox, says Gimme.
(DA)



9:13 (Dow Jones) In response to market rumors, GE comes out and backs
4Q, 2000 earnings views. Calls rumor of profit warning "outrageous."
Stock futures coming back a bit. (TG)



9:09 (Dow Jones) CBOT T-bonds up half a point, mainly on election news
and stocks, but low volume ahead of holiday keeping market from adding
to its early gains. "You'd think we'd be higher, but it's pretty quiet
here," trader says. (DMR)



8:55 (Dow Jones) John Roque notes that some observers claim that
technology represents some value, but the Arnold & S. Bleichroeder
technician says that value is still being created. "There is still no
real reason to step up to get aggressive on tech," he says. (TG)



8:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman cuts 4Q view on Home Depot (HD) to 25c a share
from 27c, 2000 view t $1.15 from $1.16, and 2001 estimate to $1.40 from
$1.45. While impressed with long-term initiatives to drive sales and
control costs, the brokerage firm senses a more conservative outlook
from management. Reiterates cautious outlook on stock, though it
continues to believe HD is one of the best names in retailing. (TG)



8:36 (Dow Jones) Jobless claims rose by 7,000 in the week ended Nov.
18 to 336,000 from an upward revised level in the prior week.  That
brings the 4-week moving average to 330,250.  The increases seem to
reflect layoffs in the auto industry, which are themselves a sign of
fundamental weakening in demand.  (JM)



8:34 (Dow Jones) A Greenwich Capital Markets Treasury strategist says
Gore's renewed chance of victory helps put the yield curve flatteners
back on, and should help widen credit spreads at the same time. It will
also allow for a test of the October yield curve low, with the 10-year
snipping away at a 5.56% yield, which means the issue's already decent
bid can improve. (MSD)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Stocks just can't get a break. Last night's ruling
from the Florida Supreme Court was a blow to George W. Bush and a
perceived blow to equities. At least that's how traders are interpreting
the short-term impact. Increasing talk of a Constitutional crisis isn't
helping. Meanwhile, there seems to be more concern that the soft landing
the Fed is trying to engineer may be in jeopardy. Trading will likely be
slowish Wednesday, particularly later in the session. The expected move
to the downside may be exacerbated by a lack of full participation in
front of Thanksgiving. Stock futures sharply lower, and Nasdaq may crack
below 2800. Sentiment numbers at 10:00 a.m. ET should be interesting.

 Stocks hit again by presidential uncertainty; Nasdaq down 4 percent

22 November 2000
Agence France-Presse
AFPR
English
 (Copyright 2000) 

 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (AFP) - Tech stocks plunged anew Wednesday amid uncertainty over the US presidential election, pushing the Nasdaq down more than four percent. 

 The Nasdaq sank to its lowest level this year, falling 116.11 points (4.04 percent) to 2,755.34. 

 The Dow industrials lost 95.18 points (0.91 percent) to 10,399.32 and the Standard and Poor's 500's slipped 25 points (1.86 percent) to 1,322.35. 

 Investors looked for safety in the bond market, pushing the yield on the 10-year bond down to 5.593 percent from 5.66 percent Tuesday and on the 30-year bond to 5.646 percent against 5.733 percent. A drop in yields reflects a rise in bond prices. 

 Stocks opened lower after the Florida Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that hand recounts must be included in the final state tally in the presidential race. 

 Dean Witter senior equities trader Michael Lyons said shares remained lower throughout most of the session. 

 However, some shares posted sizable gains in early afternoon after Republican contender Texas Governor George W. Bush held a press conference to reiterate his stance that he won. 

 However, investors used the upward trend as an excuse to "sell into the rally," sending stocks back down to lower levels, Lyons noted. 

 He also said shares would not rally decisively in the coming sessions, unless investors receive firm word that Bush has won the election. 

 "We ain't gonna see a rally until we see moving vans outside the (Texas) Governor's Mansion," he said. 

 He added that some investors were encouraged by news late in the session that the Bush campaign will appeal the Florida Supreme Court ruling to the US Supreme Court. 

 Lyons added that prices also were driven lower by "normal profit- taking" ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday and the ongoing concerns that US stocks are overvalued, particularly in the technology sector. 

 The technology sector was pressured by the ongoing earnings worries, including Yahoo, which closed down 3-1/2 at 38-3/16 amid concerns about declining advertising revenues. 

 In the beverage sector, Coca-Cola closed up 4-5/16 at 59-9/16 after announcing it ended tie-up talks with Quaker Oats, which ended down 7-7/16 at 87. 

 General Electric lost 2-3/16 at 48-9/16, after rejecting market rumors of an imminent profit warning. Analysts noted that investors are worried about profits at the GE Capital unit. 

 Caterpillar fell 7/16 at 37-13/16, and DaimlerChrysler gained 23 cents at 39.08 after the two companies announced a joint venture for medium-duty engines and fuel systems. 

 Pharmaceuticals and tobacco stocks fell amid concerns that a Gore presidency would curtail profits in those sectors. 

 Pfizer slipped 1/2 at 43, and Merck 1-5/16 at 90-11/16. 

 Philip Morris edged down 1-5/8 at 35-13/16 and RJ Reynolds 9/16 at 35-1/8. 

 In the retail sector, Home Depot closed down 1-1/2 at 36-3/4 after Roberston Stephens expressed concerns that it would take some time to find a catalyst for earnings growth.

 Slaughter of tech stocks drives European share markets down ATTENTION - UPDATES with Frankfurt closing ///

 LONDON, Nov 22 (AFP) - A rout in tech stocks, prompted by fresh falls in the US Nasdaq index and excerbated by a profit-warning by a Dutch computer consultancy firm, sent European stock markets sharply lower on Wednesday. 

 Technology indices in London and Frankfurt suffered heavy falls, while in Paris, the investment appetite was soured by a sharp drop in food group Danone, which declared that it was interested in US firm Quaker Oats. 

 The FTSE 100 index in London closed down 160.7 points, or 2.52 percent, at 6,221.4 points. 

 In Paris, the CAC-40 index fell 2.24 percent at 5,944.70 points. 

 In Frankfurt, the DAX closed at 6,51054, down 2.51 perecnt. 

 Across the 11-nation euro zone, the Euro Stoxx 50 index fell 1.30 percent to 4,830.33 points. 

 Reflecting the flight from risky share investments, investors bought into the relative safety of bond markets, pushing the yield on the benchmark Germany 10-year bond down to 5.119 percent from Tuesday's 5.173 percent. 

 In late European trading, Wall Street was down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 79.63 points at 10,413.35, while the Nasdaq was 100.80 points down at 2,770.65. 

 The high-tech sector was hit by the disappointing earnings performance of many Internet and high-tech companies and the sharp sell-off of the Nasdaq market in the United States, traders said. 

 The German Neuer Markt for high-growth stocks, the biggest market for new economy stocks in Europe, touched the lowest point in its history on Wednesday, the NEMAX 50 index falling to 3,174.18 points just after midday, before rebounding slightly to 3,186.41 at close, down 270.77 points from Tuesday. 

 At those levels, the NEMAX 50 has lost more than 60 percent since topping an all-time high of 9,694 points on March 10. 

 "Everything is very negative and the Neuer Markt looks as if it is collapsing," one dealer said. 

 Software maker SAP endured the worst losses on the DAX, losing 9.27 percent of its value to trade at 173.75 euros. Infineon was also sharply down, shedding 2.22 euros at 43.61 euros, while Siemens was 1.83 euros lower at 127.50 euros. 

 Index heavyweight Deutsche Telekom was down 1.03 euros at 37.76 euros after the company announced it would not compete in France's UMTS licence auction. 

 In Amsterdam, shares in Dutch information technology consultancy Getronics crashed by 41.58 percent to 7.36 euros after issuing warnings on sales and margins for 2000 and 2001. 

 An analyst at investment bank Stropeve here, Peter Olofsen, said: "Brokers are terribly disappointed. They have lost confidence in Getronics. 

 The fall-out from Getronics sent shares in IT consultancy Cap Gemini tumbling in Paris. 

 "Geotronics, which is the third largest computer services group in Europe,  issued a profit warning this morning on its 2000 and 2001 results," said Nicolas de  Smet, analyst at HSBC CCF Securities in Paris. 

 "I think it's mainly a knock-on effect." 

 Cap Gemini closed down 11.00 euros, or 6.03 percent, at 171.50. 

 Paris also saw blue-chip food group Danone closing down 16.90 euros, or 10.50 percent, at 144.10. Trading had been briefly halted when the stock fell 10 percent, after Danone confirmed that it was interested in buying Quaker Oats. 

 Analysts said investors were taking profits on the stock but there were also fears Danone might pay too much or load up on debt to buy the US group. 

 Later, after a conference call for analysts where it was revealed that the  negotiations for an all-share deal were in an advanced stage, the shares lost  any slight recovery they had made and dipped below the 10 percent level again. 

 In London, the FTSE techMARK index suffered its largest ever one- day fall, of 5.76 percent, to 2,865.60 points. The specialist technology index was launched on November 3, 1999. 

 Technology and telecom issues suffered from a sharp sell-off, led by Bookham Technology -- down 124 pence at 1159 -- Baltimore was 39 pence lower at 356, ARM Holdings shed 65 pence to 522-1/2 and Sema Group shed 61 pence at 624. 

 Elsewhere, Madrid's Ibex-35 dropped 3.56 percent to 9,252.5 points and Zurich's Swiss Market Index fell 1.67 percent to 8,018.70. 

 Amsterdam's AEX fell 2.40 percent to 652.23, Milan's Mib30 index eased 1.96 percent to 46,651 and Brussels' Bel-20 fell 0.65 percent to 3,068.4 points.

 Reflecting the flight from risky share investments, investors bought into the relative safety of bond markets, pushing the yield on the benchmark Germany 10-year bond down to 5.119 percent from Tuesday's 5.173 percent. 

 In late European trading, Wall Street was down ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 79.63 points at 10,413.35, while the Nasdaq was 100.80 points down at 2,770.65. 

 The high-tech sector was hit by the disappointing earnings performance of many Internet and high-tech companies and the sharp sell-off of the Nasdaq market in the United States, traders said. 

 The German Neuer Markt for high-growth stocks, the biggest market for new economy stocks in Europe, fell to the lowest point in its history on Wednesday. 

 The blue-chip Neuer Markt index, the NEMAX 50, fell to 3,174.18 points just after midday, a loss of 8.18 percent from the previous close. The index later rallied off lows to show a loss of 6.52 percent at 3,234.43 points. 

 At those levels, the NEMAX 50 has lost more than 60 percent since topping an all-time high of 9,694 points on March 10. 

 "That's the problem with the Neuer Markt, it's very susceptible to movements on the Nasdaq, even if they're irrational," said Merck Finck analyst Alexander Kachler. 

 Shares in Pixelpark, an Internet services unit of media giant Bertelsmann, fell 11.17 percent to 34.20 euros and the leading online broker, Comdirect, shed 10.45 percent to 21.17 euros. 

 In Amsterdam, shares in Dutch information technology consultancy Getronics crashed by 41.58 percent to 7.36 euros after issuing warnings on sales and margins for 2000 and 2001. 

 An analyst at investment bank Stropeve here, Peter Olofsen, said: "Brokers are terribly disappointed. They have lost confidence in Getronics. 

 The fall-out from Getronics sent shares in IT consultancy Cap Gemini tumbling in Paris. 

 "Geotronics, which is the third largest computer services group in Europe,  issued a profit warning this morning on its 2000 and 2001 results," said Nicolas de  Smet, analyst at HSBC CCF Securities in Paris. 

 "I think it's mainly a knock-on effect." 

 Cap Gemini closed down 11.00 euros, or 6.03 percent, at 171.50. 

 Paris also saw blue-chip food group Danone closing down 16.90 euros, or 10.50 percent, at 144.10. Trading had been briefly halted when the stock fell 10 percent, after Danone confirmed that it was interested in buying Quaker Oats. 

 Analysts said investors were taking profits on the stock but there were also fears Danone might pay too much or load up on debt to buy the US group. 

 Later, after a conference call for analysts where it was revealed that the  negotiations for an all-share deal were in an advanced stage, the shares lost  any slight recovery they had made and dipped below the 10 percent level again. 

 In London, the FTSE techMARK index suffered its largest ever one- day fall, of 5.76 percent, to 2,865.60 points. The specialist technology index was launched on November 3, 1999. 

 Technology and telecom issues suffered from a sharp sell-off, led by Bookham Technology -- down 124 pence at 1159 -- Baltimore was 39 pence lower at 356, ARM Holdings shed 65 pence to 522-1/2 and Sema Group shed 61 pence at 624.

 Invensys in spin-off bid to beef up shares

 INVENSYS, the beleaguered automation and controls group, is spinning off its power systems business next year in an effort to boost its ailing share price. 

 The company, which announced a five per cent fall in first-half operating profit to pounds 470 million - lower than market expectations - said today it would seek listings for the power systems unit in London and the United States. 

 "Our decision to fully separate the unit underlines our clear commitment to restore shareholder value," chief executive Allen Yurko said. 

 Forecasts 

 Invensys more than halved in value after issuing a profits warning on September 7, its shares diving to lows of 120p from 260p previously. After a slight recovery towards 170p last month, shares have fallen back and today they fell a further 8.5p to 150p. 

 While the City had been braced for a fall in first-half profits, the figure was below analyst forecasts of about pounds 480m. 

 Invensys, which has been the subject of takeover talk since its profit warning, said the fall in profits was due mainly to adverse market conditions in the United States and lower profits at its software business unit. Ongoing sales - including business from the acquired Dutch software company Baan - rose eight per cent to pounds 3.66 billion. The interim dividend has been maintained at 2.5p. 

 "A challenging second quarter in the automation and controls market, combined with certain cost overruns and margin pressures, has reduced our overall profitability in the first half," added Mr Yurko. 

 The demerger of its power systems business next year will involve its listing on the London Stock Exchange and the US Nasdaq. 

 Analysts expect the value of the power systems division could top pounds 3bn, although Mr Yurko declined to speculate on any target price today. 

 He said: "This will be an attractive investment. The comparables in the sector are trading with pretty high multiples." 

 The division provides customers in the telecom, IT and digital network with a range of power systems requirements, including remote monitoring and support services. 

 Sales in that business have grown from pounds 910m in 1997/98 to the pounds 1.6bn reported for the last 12 months. 

 Invensys' problems stem from the performance of its core automation and controls operations, where underlying sales declined by two per cent. 

 The group said it planned a restructuring programme, including plant and office consolidations, while streamlining operations.

 Euro High Yield Picture Bleak Led By CP Kelco Downfall

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- European high yield debt has taken a turn for the worse, led by U.S. biogum manufacturer CP Kelco ApS which was downgraded by Standard and Poors after releasing poor earnings Monday. 

 Traders early Wednesday said its EUR255 million ten-year notes were last quoted at 55/58 cents in illiquid trade, now that lead manager Lehman Brothers has ceased trading on the issue. 

 The notes were trading close to par at the beginning of last week, before traders and investors were caught off guard ahead of a profitwarning released last Thursday. 

 Generally, the European high yield market is ending the year on a bleak note, led by losses in its U.S. counterpart, volatility in the telecom sector and high oil prices. Activity in the primary market has now dried up entirely with no new issuance expected until January. 

 Merrill Lynch's European high yield index last posted negative returns of 1.729% year to date, versus negative 2.111% returns for the U.S. high yield market, in local currency terms. 

 Last Thursday the B3/B- rated CP Kelco released a profit warning that caused its notes to trade down to the 60 area from 98 points at the beginning of the week. Official results released Monday show EBITDA for the third quarter was 33% lower than the previous year, while turnover was also lower than expected. 

 Competitive prices from substitute products also caused margins to drop 19% in its food segment. Although net debt fell slightly during the quarter, its leverage ratio stands at 6.6 times earnings before tax, interest and depreciation on an annualized basis, from 5.1 times at the end of June 2000. 

 This triggered the borrower's need for a capital injection as well as a comprehensive financial and operating review. 

 Despite a $50 million injection by shareholder Lehman Brother's private equity group, both agencies have placed CP Kelco on negative outlook. 

 Standard and Poors has also lowered the borrower's rating by one notch to B-, stating in its report: "The uncertainties raised in the company's report could impair CP Kelco's access to the capital markets and may reduce the firm's ability to meet financial covenants and debt maturities related to its bank facilities." 

 Analysts remain vigilant on the credit awaiting asset sales and cost reduction measures, but most note the borrower does not have immediate liquidity concerns now nor does it have a reliance on oil as a raw material, making earnings less cyclical. 

 CP Kelco's EUR255 million bond was launched in September amid less than auspicious market conditions following profit warnings from Intel that weighed on the entire market. The notes priced at par with a 11.875% yield. 

 CP Kelco was bought-out from Pharmacia Monsanto Biogums earlier this year and is now owned by Hercules Food Gums and Lehman Brothers Merchant Banking Partners II L.P.

 Money money money, it's a rich man's world STOCK WATCH/J MulrajMoney! Its what makes the world go round. Or so they say. If not the world, well, at least the stock markets all over the world. In the US, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, did not raise interest rates at the meeting of the board on Wednesday, in his continuing effort to manoeuvre a soft landing for the US economy. In India, the Millennium Bond Deposit scheme raised $5.5 billion, part of which will flow, much like water finding its own level, into the stockmarket. A lot of it would go towards funding the Government's borrowing programme, which is 75 per cent complete - this means that short term interest rates will not rise and may even ease a bit. The Bonds is a very expensive way to raise money and we are going to pay a price for it over the term of the bond, but for now it would fund a small celebration. Who cares about the hangover. 

  Care, though, we should, for there are grave concerns about a fall in the US stockmarkets. A piece entitled Managing Expectations for Value in McKinsey Quarterly 2000 Vol 4 (it can be downloaded on the Internet) has studied how much of the Eurostoxx 50 (top 50 Europoean companies) is derived from the perpetuity value of current earnings per share and how much of it comes from growth expectations of future earnings, i.e. from market expectations. It concludes that the proportion of value due to market expectations has gone up from 26 per cent in 1995 to a whopping 70 per cent in 1999! This means two things. One that there is an abundance of capital flowing into equity markets and pushing up prices, which are justified by higher expectations of future earnings growth. Two that any failure to meet those expectations leads to a sharp fall in valuations. Witness how companies like Proctor & Gamble, Yahoo!, Intel or Hewlett Packard, lost 15 to 40 per cent value in a single day! This is truly a frightening prospect. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor maker, saw its market cap dropping 40 per cent weeks after it issued a guarded warning on its Q3 revenues, prompting its CEO, Craig Barrett, to wonder 'how can market value change by $50 billion of $100 billion in a day?' Its Q3 revenues actually grew 19 per cent! It has also introduced the P4, the fastest chip now. The future of the US markets is of especial concern. The US has a negative domestic savings rate, primarily because the wealth effect of a rising equity portfolio has given comfort to US individuals to spend more than their current income. This money comes from other countries, notably European and Japan, primarily because of the strength of the US dollar vis a vis the weakening Euro and the Japanese yen. The demand for dollars thus generated, due to its status as a platform currency, helps keeps the exchange rate high and inflation low. There are people who feel that the Euro may have bottomed out - if so an outflow of dollar investments into Euro would impact the US markets. The rising stock prices also keep wage costs under check (and margins higher) thanks to stock options. High oil prices are of concern, especially its impact on the auto industry which is going through turmoil thanks to global overcapacity. Daewoo Motors of South Korea has gone into bankruptcy. In the US, for example, a large proportion of sales, especially of the profit generating SUVs (special utility vehicles) are financed on a rental basis. That is, the financing companies estimate a 'residual value' at the end of the rental period and use it to quote a fixed rental. They are now finding that they overestimated the residual value and are taking huge hits. A lot of the dotcom companies are also closing down, and the telecom/networking companies are going through a rough patch. All in all, Greenspan may not be able to maneuver a soft landing despite his best efforts. Closer home, the hostile takeover game is hotting up. In the case of Gesco, the Sheths, alongwith their white knights, Mahindras, financed by a line of credit from HDFC, have bought the 6.3 per cent stake of IFC Washington at a price of Rs 44. In hostile takeover battles, the individual investors have to assess whether there would be further competing bids, driving the prices up, or whether they ought to sell at current market prices. They would not be wooed for their small holdings, as was IFC Washington. There are reports for example that in the case of Bombay Dyeing, the two parties are close to a negotiated settlement - one that would puncture the stock price pretty fast. The takeover panel has asked hostile buyers to declare to both stock exchanges and the company, when they reach threshold levels of 5, 10 and 14 per cent. It is rather strange that nowhere in the public domain is the actual holding of the 'promoter group' available. As per law, the classification is based upon holding by companies, by banks and financial institutions and mutual funds and the public. Why can we not make a disclosure of management holding as a group (broken up into individuals, family friends and associates, group companies) mandatorily made public? This information is not even available with stock exchanges! Nor, for that matter, do Indian laws require a disclosure, as they should, of when these `promoters' sell their stock, giving them a licence for insider trading. Note that not a single incidence of insider trading violation has been verified and punished. Does that make Indian markets the cleanest in the world? Whilst making disclosure by an acquirer compulsory, the panel is considering doing away with the creeping acquisition limit for existing managements. Of course, the extent of their holdings are not revealed in terms of group statistics. This is something that needs to be changed. The CBI has raided the offices of Krishna Filaments Ltd. An investigation into the working of this maker of synthetic ropes, has apparently revealed over invoicing of (tax free) exports for which credit facilities were availed from institutions including IDBI which has an outstanding of Rs 1.2 billion over the 1995-98 period. The case reveals the need to do away with artificial sops like tax free incomes which result in manupilation. It also reveals the sorry state of quality of bank assessments, quality of audits and quality of controls, and the effect these have on competitors (who are disadvantaged by their relative honesty) and on shareholders. The flow of funds into the domestic market thanks to the MBD and from the analgesic provided by Greenspan could cause the market to rally during the coming fortnight, by 300 points or so. Thereafter it may be another story.

 STUTTGART, Germany, Nov 17 (AFP) - German-US car giant DaimlerChrysler said on Friday that earnings at its troubled US arm Chrysler would come out lower than expected and that would weigh on earnings for the group as a whole. 

 In a statement issued following an extraordinary meeting of the group's supervisory board, DaimlerChrysler said: 

 "Since the announcement of the third-quarter results in late October, tough market conditions in the US have intensified further, characterised by ongoing competitive incentive spending, high dealer inventories and a resultant reduction in production levels. 

 "As a consequence, results at the Chrysler Group will fall below the last forecast and thus also affect the earnings of DaimlerChrysler," the statement said.

 Wall Street Stocks End Slightly Lower.

 NEW YORK, November 17 (Xinhua) - Wall Street stocks ended slightly lower in the second straight session Friday as an earnings warning from BellSouth came amid the undecided U.S. presidential election. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 26.16 at 10,629.87 points, extending its 51-point loss Thursday. 

 Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 4.69 to 3,027.19 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was off 4.60 at 1,367.72. 

 The market opened lower but bounced back later after a lower court ruling in the presidential election recount raised hope of a resolution. The ruling allows Florida's Secretary of State Katherine Harris, a Republican, to certify the final votes after the absentee votes are counted on November 18 and to reject votes in the manual recount sought by the democrats. 

 But Stocks fell again in the late session after the Florida Supreme Court dominated by judges from the democrats forbid the state from certifying any election results until further order of the court. The Florida Supreme Court's move reminded investors that the deadlock of the presidential election will not be solved very soon. 

 A profit warning from BellSouth also hit the market. The regional telephone company warned its earnings in 2001 would be lower than expectations because of the costs of expanding its wireless business. 

 In blue chips, J.P. Morgan and American Express fell. 

 Fiber optics company Broadcom in the tech sector moved down again after a big sell-off Thursday. But PMC Sierra, another fiber optics firm, recovered from its heavy losses in the previous session. 

 A number of the big tech names also rose. Chip maker Intel and computer maker IBM were up. 

 The NYSE index closed down 3.28 at 643.74 and the American Stock Exchange index was off 8.93 at 885.22. But the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was up 0.97 at 482.61. 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,512 up, 1,337 down and 477 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume increased to 1.06 billion shares from 935.74 million in the previous session.

 Flawed US system fails to withstand electoral stress - Part 2 of 3.

 Parliament didn't vote for or against the trade agreement, strictly speaking. 

 It voted on the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee's report on the agreement. 

 It was the first time the executive's powers to negotiate and sign treaties had been checked and the first time a trade treaty had been subjected to select committee scrutiny and public submissions before ratification. 

 In the upshot, Prime Minister Helen Clark and Trade Negotiations Minister Jim Sutton flew to Singapore to meet Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for the grand signing yesterday of a deal properly known as the closer economic partnership agreement between New Zealand and Singapore, or CEP for short. 

 Long before clambering on their plane for the signing ceremony, they had Hong Kong in their sights for a similar treaty. 

 Hong Kong is New Zealand's seventh biggest export market. 

 New Zealand officials have briefed their Hong Kong counterparts on the Singapore-New Zealand agreement and will hold exploratory discussions on the concept of a CEP between New Zealand and Hong Kong, Sutton said last Wednesday. 

 These talks would now become more structured, he said, and while it was not yet a formal negotiation, "it is my hope that we will be able to move quite quickly to that stage." 

 Cabinet would have to endorse a detailed negotiating brief and there would be "extensive public out-reach and consultation." 

 Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary for administration, happened to be visiting New Zealand last week as Parliament voted on the committee report on the agreement with Singapore. 

 The territory was willing to sit down for exploratory talks, she said. 

 More significantly, all going well for the government, the Singapore CEP agreement is a blueprint for an agreement embracing other countries in the region. 

 Asia 2000 boss Tim Groser has described it as a Trojan Horse for what he called "the real negotiating end-game: a possible new trade bloc encompassing all of South-east Asia and Australasia." 

 The Apec Monitoring Group, however, sees it as a Trojan Horse that could be used to import goods from low-wage Indonesian free trade zones. 

 Credence for this concern was given the day after the parliamentary vote, when Fisher & Paykel announced staff lay-offs because of the mischief done to its whiteware business by cheap Korean imports. 

 The Apec Monitoring Group also says the unprecedented investment provisions in the Singapore agreement could form a back-door entry to New Zealand for overseas investors wanting to avoid tighter controls. 

 Because of Singapore's strategic position as a South-east Asian commercial hub, they fear the agreement will undermine New Zealand government efforts to regain some control over flows of "hot capital" or foreign investment generally. 

 Clark and Sutton, however, enthused that the agreement "will encourage trade in goods and services, promote investment, create jobs - especially in service industries - and assist economic development." 

 Under the deal, tariffs on goods traded between the two countries will be eliminated and trade in services liberalised, they emphasised. 

 Services generate 80% of all New Zealand jobs and create $8 billion in exports, Sutton said. 

 The CEP also will reduce compliance costs for New Zealand exporters through jointly agreed disciplines on standards. 

 But exporters say, overall, the deal tips the playing field in favour of Singapore. 

 Readers wanting to check the details for themselves will find the task daunting. 

 It employs the arcane and complex language common to world trade agreements and comprises some 190 pages with cross-references to a range of documents within the World Trade Organisation and Apec. It invokes procedures of the International Centre for Investment Disputes; it interfaces with the Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relation Trade Agreement and the bilateral investment agreement between New Zealand and Chile; it impacts on a wide range of domestic legislation, regulations, policy and administrative practices at central and local government levels. 

 Few New Zealanders, if any, will avoid its effects, indirectly if not directly. Yet the public was given just 10 days to prepare submissions for the select committee. 

 As some submissions noted, it was virtually impossible in that short time to check all out aspects of the agreement which cried out for questioning. 

 Provisions on subsidies were cited among the examples. These have been written, obviously, to accommodate the subsidies maintained by the Singapore government, including those which might impact on trade with New Zealand. 

 So how extensive are they? 

 And do they bother New Zealand business people? 

 Auckland Export Institute president Bob Fenwick acknowledged the subsidies are one element of the treaty "that tips the scales somewhat in Singapore's favour." 

 Fenwick was sanguine, nevertheless. 

 But Singapore wasn't going to budge on the subsidies, so New Zealand had to give way. 

 For this and other reasons, said Fenwick, "it's not a level playing field." 

 For starters, Singapore's exporters can come to New Zealand to develop markets and promote their products and have the visit paid for by their government. 

 New Zealand exporters going to Singapore must pay their own way. 

 On balance, Fenwick said his organisation "is quite happy about that." 

 But it needs careful monitoring in several areas, such as the "country of origin" rules, he said. 

 The Customs Department has assured the institute it has the resources to be vigilant in barring products manufactured outside Singapore, but then passing through Singapore and branded there. 

 That's the institute's biggest concern. 

 In the main, however, Fenwick describes the agreement as "a job well done." 

 Manufacturers' Federation chief executive Simon Carlaw has similar concerns. He welcomed the procedure whereby the agreement was subjected to select committee examination and submissions, above all, because it helped put the government on notice that monitoring of the rules of origin provisions must be improved. 

 "A ho-hum approach is not going to be acceptable," said Carlaw. 

 The sensitive textile, clothing and footwear sector has been specially provided for in the agreement. 

 If that provision had not been there from the start, Manfed would have pressed for it. 

 Carlaw welcomed another innovation, the flow of information between foreign affairs negotiators and other organisations during the negotiations. 

 Manfed told the select committee it liked the idea of Parliament looking at treaties of this sort, but it didn't want the country's international credibility damaged by parliamentary dog-fights. 

 Therefore, the consulting process during negotiations had to be improved so there were no surprises to any stake-holders. 

 Most important to Manfed, the agreement must be implemented strictly according to the letter. With these caveats, it gave a cautious approval to the treaty. 

 So what's in it for our exporters? 

 For manufacturing exporters, not very much. 

 They have free access into Singapore already, as Singapore's manufacturers have been able to export into New Zealand. 

 Essentially, the agreement will benefit the services area where there have been constraints on accountants, lawyers and other professional groups trying to set up shop in Singapore. 

 But the export returns from services aren't quite the same as those from merchandise. 

 All the money earned by an exporter for a $100,000 machine, let's say, comes back to New Zealand. 

 A service organisation putting up its shingle in Singapore will leave a wad of its earnings in that country, to pay for rent and other services needed to stay in business, and perhaps for staff. 

 A more significant point was noted in the submission of Auckland University law professor, Jane Kelsey. 

 She set out each signatory country's service schedule, to show Singapore's schedule is much more restrictive than New Zealand's. 

 On investment, Singapore has retained many more restrictions than New Zealand. Non-citizens cannot own land in Singapore, for example, and there are restrictions on owning Housing and Development Board flats. 

 Under the definition of "investor" moreover, a company need not be owned in Singapore. All that is needed is that it has some presence in Singapore. 

 Critics of the agreement worry that corporations could use this as a loophole to avoid New Zealand laws and regulations on overseas investment or to control movements of hot money. 

 At March 2000, Singapore direct investment in New Zealand was $1.023 billion, more than five times the $193 million of New Zealand direct investment in Singapore. 

 Singapore's investment in this country has been strongly focused on service industries. 

 Singapore-based CDL is the biggest hotel operator in New Zealand and Singapore investors control Air New Zealand. 

 The Singapore government owns a large part of Singapore's commerce and controls around 1,000 state-linked companies, whose value amounts to about 25% of the value of the Singapore share market. 

 Forget Paris, exporters prefer Frankfurt 

 Jenny Ruth 

 Calling all exporters of perishable goods to Europe. Frankfurt airport's Perishable Center is ready, willing and able to handle your business. 

 The centre's sales manager, Volker Gimple, is frank about wanting to attract more freight through his centre. Established five years ago, its 9,000 square metres is capable of handling 160,000 tonnes a year but is currently handling only 85,000 tonnes. 

 "We desperately need your support to reach our aim," Gimple told a group of New Zealand freight forwarding agents with whom I toured the facility last month. 

 The centre handles flowers (30%), fish (20%), meat (20%) with fruit and vegies making up most of the remainder. About 98% of incoming commodities are fresh rather than frozen. It offers transit storage - between plane and truck or other forms of transport within Europe - at 18 different temperatures between -24 and +24 degrees, all controlled by computers from 300 different measuring points in the building. 

 "Temperature is our life and death. If we fail we can hang ourselves." 

 Gimple says the centre will repackage goods to meet end customer specifications. For example, it unpacks roses and repacks them in water to lengthen their life. 

 All the relevant authorities, including 12 vets, are housed under one roof. "Formerly people had to walk all over the airport" to get the necessary approvals, he says. The centre claims it can reduce transit times by up to 80%. 

 The centre is independently owned rather than belonging to an airline, as are most handling facilities. It is jointly owned by freight forwarder Kurt Nagel & Co, LuftfrachtpUmschlag GmbH (LUG) and the Frankfurt airport, Flughafen Frankfurt/Main. 

 "All airlines get the same treatment with their shipments. That's our big advantage," he says. 

 Gimple's eagerness for business contrasts sharply with those running a similar facility at Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport. 

 Owned by France Handling, the Paris facility is much bigger at 20,000 square metres. It handles only meat and fish but, unlike the Frankfurt centre, is highly mechanised, greatly reducing the amount of human handling required. 

 "The more people who handle the goods, the more chance of things going wrong," says one of the freight forwarders. In Paris, freight "can come in one door and out the other without anyone touching it." 

 For some exporters, a facility specialising in meat and fish handling is preferable because those products are more temperature sensitive than, say, flowers. "The facilities in Paris are very, very good, and in some ways superior," says another freight forwarder. 

 Still, consensus among the forwarders was that the Paris centre should be avoided. Located at the centre of Europe, the Frankfurt centre has a geographical advantage. 

 While Paris is closer to Spain, the Frankfurt centre is still winning freight to be trucked to Spain. 

 New Zealand exporters trying to get their goods to the international SIAL (Salon International de Alimentation) food fair in Paris last month report difficulties in dealing with the Paris centre. 

 "It's not good to work with. It's very complicated and it's impossible to contact them. They're really rude," says one exporter. 

 Freight forwarders who have visited the Paris centre previously question how much of its capacity is actually used. Certainly, it was almost empty the day we toured the facility. 

 "The French aren't easy to deal with at the best of times. They just don't communicate well," says one freight forwarder, most of whose goods are routed through Frankfurt. 

 Not that the Germans are always easy to deal with, either. "They're keen [for business], but they're very authoritarian. The rules are the rules and you have to get it right first time. If you get it wrong there will be a problem," he says. 

 Still, they're much better organised than their French counterparts and much more in tune the shipper's and end customer's needs. 

 Another freight forwarder reports instances of shipments being delayed at the Paris facility. "You can certainly see how the Frankfurt one is utilised more than the Paris one. The Germans have got things more sorted out. The French just don't seem to have the same network of people making it run smoothly," he says. 

 Yet another of the freight forwarders says his experience is that transit times of goods through the Paris facility are a couple of hours longer than in Frankfurt.

 Is it possible we could learn from overseas? 

 Bob Fenwick 

 One of exporters' more interesting, and at times exasperating, opportunities is to hear from their offshore buyers what other governments do to assist business and exports. 

 The following is a sample of what our competitors have enjoyed over the past 30 days. 

 United States 

 The Senate passed an amended $US6 billion support programme for exporters. 

 The original Bill fell foul of WTO restrictions. To comply, the Americans simply changed the wording, adding another $US300 million in annual tax benefits in the process. 

 The Milwaukee Journal reports that a local manufacturing company will receive $US6 million in state initiatives to purchase another manufacturer and thereby create 90 new jobs. 

 New Zealand was mentioned in one USA Today piece in which Charlene Barshefsky, chief US Trade negotiator, said that a Pacific five trade pact among USA, Chile, Australia, Singapore and New Zealand should be "relatively easy" to achieve. 

 Mexico 

 The government is changing the law for assembly plants located on the Mexican side of the US border, which can import components duty free on condition that the finished goods are exported. 

 From 2001 these companies must pay taxes ranging from 2% to 25% on imported components from countries other than USA and Canada. 

 Japan 

 The government has announced an indefinite delay to its planned capital gains tax reform. Government officials fear the reforms would cause disinvestment and further decline in economic activity. 

 Instead, Japan is introducing a government investment package of $NZ240 billion designed to stimulate industry. 

 Britain 

 Chancellor Gordon Brown announces he intends diverting substantial funds to provide venture capital for entrepreneurs in deprived areas. I wonder if NZ would qualify? 

 Europe 

 What our trade competitors get in Europe is best described in the Wall St Journal's 1 November editorial, headed "The EU's bottomless subsidy pit." 

 Europe takes full advantage of four categories of "non actionable" subsidies permitted under WTO rules. 

 This has enabled cash grants from EU governments to promote private industries and public corporations of $US203 billion in 1997, growing to $US217 billion in 1999. 

 In recent years government provision of equity, soft loans and guarantee schemes have increased by 20% in Germany and 30% in France. In Italy the levels are even higher. 

 The WTO records more than 7,000 aid and support programmes for businesses in Europe, mostly involving cash and tax concessions. 

 India 

 Currently with a direct foreign investment cap of 24% in its garment and textile trade, India has announced liberalisation. 

 The cap will be removed but future foreign-owned companies are required to export a minimum of 50% of their output. 

 The government is setting up a venture capital fund and backing will be given to joint venture partnerships with foreigners. Domestic retail chains are to be supported into campaigns promoting the sale of Indian brands. 

 Canada 

 Canada, like New Zealand, is talking of high tech industries as the new wealth generators. The Canadians are providing incentives of $NZ8 billion in tax benefits and infrastructure programmes to attract offshore capital and corporations. 

 Canada, like NZ, has suffered a brain drain in recent years of highly educated youth to the USA. The government intends attracting its citizens back home with inducements and is liberalising immigration laws to import qualified workers from anywhere abroad. 

 The Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters Association, representing 75% of the country's manufacturing output and 90% of its merchandising exports, is a powerful lobbying voice and has made it clear that the shortage of qualified personnel is limiting members' growth potential. 

 Australia 

 A Melbourne-based company has received a $A12 million research grant to assist in developing new wireless communication networks. 

 The federal government has pledged $A4 million in funding to develop the furniture industry. 

 In the August issue of The Exporter I spoke of US39 cents to the NZ dollar - the first time this low level had been talked about. The latest from the same USA source is that the present $Kiwi level should continue for some considerable time as there is nothing in New Zealand to justify substantial investment.

 Wendy Pye enjoys China challenge 

 Jon Stephenson 

 Life is good for Wendy Pye. The irrepressible publisher has made a small fortune selling books that help kids learn to read. 

 Now she's brimming with enthusiasm about her foray into China and her recent appointment to the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC). 

 Pye says although it's not an easy market, she picked China as "the next frontier" for her business - mating internet technology with her books to teach Chinese kids English. 

 The past half year has seen tremendous growth in internet use in China, she observes. This factor is essential if her company's "Galaxy Kids" internet-plus-print product is to succeed in China. 

 As for the product, Pye is convinced "Galaxy Kids" will be a big hit in China. The 52-week programme involves a mixture of books and animated home learning - downloaded from the internet in three-hourly segments each week. 

 "We've visited lots of companies and already had lots of interest," Pye says. 

 She also helped Beijing University set up a research project using multimedia to teach English and describes the results as "outstandingly successful." 

 Pye was also invited to the Beijing Book Fair - a great opportunity for her company to showcase its product. 

 "We have the English language-learning software and content that the Chinese really want," Pye says. "We are creating a whole new concept of learning. Only the Americans have anything like our product." 

 Pye's company now has five offers on the table including one from Disney Enterprises' Chinese licensees. 

 "Really, now, it's a matter of deciding which offer is best for us," she says, admitting to a preference for a deal with the Disney licensees. 

 "The Chinese agents for Disney are very strong on the entertainment side of things. But they don't really have a structured learning programme, so we would be quite complementary in that sense." 

 Pye's commitment to doing business in China has led to Wendy Pye Beijing Software Ltd buying space in a prestigious building currently under construction in Beijing. With corporate neighbours such as Motorola and Intel, Pye says the location provides her company with a real positioning statement. 

 "We're leading the charge. We're right there in the centre of everything that's happening in China." 

 Despite her enthusiasm, Pye is realistic about the challenges this market presents, saying it will take two years for her to be successful in China. 

 She claims respect for copyright is still a problem, although substantial progress is being made on the issue. 

 Membership of the World Trade Organisation would also encourage China to adopt a more active approach to enforcing intellectual property rights. 

 Meanwhile, Pye is willing to accept the rough with the smooth in her quest for success in one of the world's largest markets. 

 "I find doing business in China extremely interesting and a lot of fun. There are a whole lot of opportunities, but it's not for the faint-hearted." 

 Pye feels her experience of dealing with the Asian region will stand her in good stead as a member of ABAC. 

 She says she's delighted to have been invited to join to the council, and sees her appointment as recognition by the government of the importance of small and medium enterprises. 

 "I accepted the position because I really wanted to contribute something to New Zealand and help the small and medium-sized enterprises which are the export future of this country." 

 Pye says she and her fellow appointees - former Dairy Board chairman Sir Dryden Spring, and Montana Group chairman Peter Masfen - all bring special strengths to their roles. 

 Of herself she says: "I think I represent someone who's gone out and made it happen - not in the corporate sense, but as a Kiwi entrepreneur." 

 Online media site hopes nothing succeeds like XS 

 Jon Stephenson 

 A community website for the media buying and selling industry is the latest innovation in New Zealand's online world. 

 The company behind the concept - XS-Media - says its website will improve New Zealand's media marketplace by providing a communications platform for the advertising community to buy and sell media space on the internet. 

 XS-Media says it will offer media buyers more choice, more flexibility and a better opportunity to buy space without having to wait for media seller's availabilities. Sellers, meanwhile, can promote their product 24 hours a day - simplifying and accelerating the buying process while increasing sellers' exposure and lowering their costs. 

 XS-Media general manager Scott MacDonnell says his company's website will initially display industry news, views and research, to be followed by the introduction of media space transacting in December and a full media directory early next year. 

 "The time is right to launch a tool that allows the media industry to buy and sell space in a neutral marketplace, where media buyers and sellers can meet to do business," he says. 

 MacDonnell, formerly marketing manager with TV3/TV4, joined XS-Media three months ago to implement the online media buying and selling concept in New Zealand. Like their boss, most of MacDonnell's staff come from a media, rather than an online, background. 

 "We're not a group of propeller heads but a company set up for media people by media people," says MacDonnell. 

 To prove the point, he outlines his company's operation in terms even a technologically-challenged journalist can understand. 

 After registering and negotiating a deal with the XS-Media, any media business can access the XS-Media website and place its advertising inventory. Commissions vary from 1%-!5%, depending on the type of media, although MacDonnell says most are around 5%. 

 Although sellers pay commission, the service is free for buyers. 

 The website operates 24 hours a day. MacDonnell says this is great for media buyers trying to secure media space after hours, or when they can't get hold of those difficult-to-contact media suppliers. 

 "We're in the fortunate position of being first in the market place, and are able to set the standard," MacDonnell says. "We know what the market place needs and wants, so we've been able to tailor-make the site to suit media buyers and sellers and to make it easier to navigate and use." 

 While the core component of the site is its transactional facility, XS-Media will provide other services. A full media directory where media sellers can list such things as their specifications, material deadlines and contacts is one added extra. More than 500 key media organisations are already listed on the directory, which MacDonnell says will eventually contain over 1,000 listings. 

 Research information, including advertising case studies from companies such as ACNielsen and CM Research, will also be available free of charge. 

 XS-Media will be compiling all this research into an easy-to-use on-site library, says MacDonnell. 

 "We also aim to have paid research available on site at a later date," he adds. 

 Another service will enable visitors to the XS-Media website to check out a web page containing a wide variety of local and international media-related news. The latest information on the media and advertising industry will be supplemented by articles from Profile Publishing publications such as AdMedia and Fastline. 

 MacDonnell describes XS-Media's website as "New Zealand's first mainstream commercial media online one-stop-shop," and is confident it will secure the recognition and support of his industry.

 Proximity effect 

 This week's big news in the advertising world is that leading direct marketing agency Aim Direct has joined Proximity Worldwide - the world's first customer relationship management agency and part of the BBDO group. Aim Direct has become AIM Proximity, reflecting the agency's move beyond traditional direct marketing to a global crm approach, integrating on-line and off-line media. 

 "The model we've created integrates interactive with relationship marketing, and we believe it will prove more powerful than a purely direct marketing or interactive network," says Simon Hall, the London-based chairman of Proximity Worldwide. "We now have a clicks and mortar agency network worldwide." 

 Proximity itself is just two months old, but already rates as the most creative international agency group in the International Direct Marketing Association awards. 

 Rubbing noses with the best 

 Tourism New Zealand's 100% Pure campaign has beaten 600 other entries to win a prestigious international prize. The 100% Pure New Zealand Hongi image picked up the gold medal at the Federation Nationale des Offices de Tourisme et Syndicats d'Initiative (FNOTSI) awards in Cholet, France. 

 In addition to winning the overall prize, the image took top honours in the Heritage/Cultural Image section. 

 Life as a motorist 

 Directions, the Automobile Association's in-house publication, has been relaunched as a lifestyle magazine. The AA says the new-look mag has been given a complete overhaul, with new writers and columnists ready "to showcase our land and our lives." 

 Along with photo essays, profiles on holiday destinations and gardening advice, readers can score some fishing tips from Graeme "Gone Fishin" Sinclair. Oh, and just so consumers don't confuse the mag with Metro, there'll be one or two features on motoring issues. 

 Monteiths has a second helping 

 Monteith's Brewing Company has confirmed its sponsorship of the annual Hokitika Wildfoods Festival for another three years. The 2001 festival will take place on 10 March next year, when the organisers, Westland District Council, expect around 15,000 people to descend on Hokitika - four times the usual population of the area. 

 Guests looking forward to some wild tastes are unlikely to be disappointed by a menu of gourmet bushtucker that includes huhu grubs, wild venison kebabs, snails in sauce, smoked eel sushi and much more. Anyone for a drink? 

 In sickness and in health - not 

 Young & Rubicam is pulling out of the New Zealand operations of its specialist healthcare communications company, Sudler & Hennessey, with the agency's NZ managing director, Peter Scutts, saying Y&R wants to focus its energy and resources on mainstream brand and retail work. The healthcare communications field is apparently looking a little sick, so to speak. 

 Suck it and see 

 STA Travel staff are pounding the pavements as part of the company's BIG OE @ COST street campaign. Bearing lollipops labelled "Does your job suck?" they will target young professionals, students and backpackers, offering 25 individuals the opportunity to buy a return trip to London for $1,599 return. The idea seems sweet enough, but why, we wonder, would the young ones want to return if their jobs suck so much? 

 Clear as 

 Saatchi & Saatchi claims its latest advertising campaign for the Smirnoff vodka brand is "about to challenge the definition of outdoor billboard advertising" by using a transparent installation. The new billboards consist of huge, illuminated, clear acrylic signs, with the sentence: "Let's make one thing perfectly clear" emblazoned on the transparent surface. A bottle of Smirnoff punctuates the message. The campaign is the work of Damon O'Leary, Basil Christensen and John McCabe.

 The Macquarie Alpha Quant Fund has its first major institutional client, with a committed investment of $80 million. 

 After reviewing Air NZ's rights issue, the Securities Commission decided it would be inappropriate to intervene in the offer process. Air NZ raised the ire of many in the market place last Wednesday when it issued a profit warning on the final day of trading for its $NZ284 million rights issue. The Stock Exchange market surveillance panel is examining this. 

 The Alliance Group says improved market demand, a lower exchange rate and heavier stock numbers combined to lift producers' returns by 24% for lamb and 47% for beef in the year to September.

 The Australian Stock Exchange will establish a new company, ASX Supervisory Review, to oversee the ASX's market monitoring role. ASX managing director Richard Humphry says the new company will be a subsidiary of ASX but would have responsibility for overseeing the supervision of the market. "The idea is to have an external body... which will have a majority of independent directors and the power to supervise us," he says. The new body will also oversee supervision of listed companies where the ASX may have a conflict of interest. 

 The Reserve Bank of Australia declared that bank fees for credit cards, debit cards and ATMs are higher than necessary, increasing pressure on the banks to allow greater competition in the fee system for these transactions. The RBA's statement, which follows similar pressure from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, says the onus is on financial institutions to smarten up their act by lowering fees and introducing more efficient arrangements. 

 Australia's forecast economic growth rate is expected to be revised up from 3.75% to 4% in today's mid-year fiscal statement. The increased growth rate will fuel a bigger budget surplus that will be used to boost infrastruture spending, including A$1 billion-plus on roads 

 News Corp shares fell 6% after directors told analysts that its operating income would not exceed $A3.54 billion. The news came as the company reported a first quarter net profit before abnormals of A$259 million, A$8 million above last year. Growth in News Corp's filmed entertainment business was largely offset by a large downturn at the Fox television group in the US. 

 The Australian dollar struggled to recover to US52 cents on Monday as the Reserve Bank confirmed it had been actively intervening on several ocasions recently to encourage the currency's stabilisation against record lows. In its semi-annual report on monetary policy the RBA said the Aussie dollar was the major inflation risk and would push inflation to the top of its 2%-3% target band next year. 

 WYCHERLEY AT LARGE 

 Jim's People's Bank is evolving from nightmare to reality as Prime Minister Helen Clark pays off her Alliance partners. So what will the Bank be called? What will its modus operandi, its lending criteria, be? How will it be funded?. These key questions beg answers. Here's some help, Jim. 

 l Lending criteria: Prime targets: people, companies or ethnic groups desperately in need of money and unable to raise it anywhere else. Repayment will not be a prime requisite. Neither will security. A good idea will suffice as a business plan. 

 l Modus operandi: Make it up ad hoc as you go along. 

 l Funding: Taxpayers will sell assets or borrow to raise the readies and be prepared to write the money off later. 

 So what is the taxpayers' potential liability? The only information available is that the total losses to the shareholders will not exceed the $5 billion or so lost the last time the government got involved in the banking/ lending business. 

 Good luck Jim. You'll need it. Right now you look and sound like David Tua in his pre-fight rituals. Odds are your bank will be washed up like a tua on the beach. 

 US stand-off spooks global markets 

 Jenny Ruth 

 As Wall Street tanked over America's inability to elect a president and after a string of company warnings of lower earnings, the New Zealand stock market for once appeared a tranquil haven. 

 While the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 4% over the week and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 13%, New Zealand's benchmark Top 40 index fell only two points to 1977. 

 Poor earnings from Hewlett-Packard on Monday compounded Dell Computer's warning last week of weakening sales and Walt Disney's report of slowing advertisement sales. 

 "The New Zealand market as a whole represents good value and we certainly haven't had the excesses of the US," says David Price, a broker at Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 Even a disappointing result yesterday from market heavyweight Telecom failed to unduly dampen spirits, although Telecom itself shed 16 cents to $5.76 over the week and was behind the Top 40's fall. The company accounts for about 25% of the index. 

 Telecom's first quarter profit fell 23% to $161 million, reflecting both the costs of its AAPT purchase and slowing mobile sales. 

 Nevertheless, uncertainty in the US is having an impact. Derek Wickenden, a broker at Cavill White, says the market's mood is "hesitant" and that the best-performing stocks are those of a defensive nature, such as casino operator Sky City. 

 Sky City shares rose 23 cents to $7.60 over the week. 

 "You wouldn't want to be bouncing out and buying shares left, right and centre until we know what's happened" in the US election," Wickenden says. 

 "The market can take good news and it can take bad news but it can't take uncertainty." 

 Price says Lion Nathan's strength also reflects a desire for relative safety. 

 "It's a good defensive stock with good cash flows and that's what people are looking for at the moment," he says. The brewer's shares climbed from $5.06 a week ago to $5.40 late yesterday. 

 Last week, Lion Nathan reported a 2.7% rise in net profit before one-offs of $A123.7 million while sales rose 12% to $A1.6 billion. The company wrote down its Chinese breweries by $A120 million. 

 Craig Robins, a broker at Salomon Smith Barney, says the writedown was positive and there will be potential buyers at the written down price. 

 "They may be looking at resolving that in the not too distant future," he says. Also helping the stock were the company's upbeat comments of progress in the Australian market. 

 A positive annual meeting also helped winemaker Montana Group, now 28.3% owned by Lion Nathan, as did its over-subscribed $125 million notes issue made to help pay for its purchase of Corbans Wines. The shares rose from $3.25 a week ago to $3.35 late yesterday. 

 "The market's very positive about the Corbans purchase," Robins says. 

 Montana, New Zealand's largest winemaker, is paying $151 million for Corbans, the number two player, and assuming $3 million of its bank debt. 

 Resins manufacturer Nuplex also benefited from upbeat comments at last week's annual meeting. Chairman Fred Holland told shareholders profit in the first four months of this year is "well ahead of the same period last year." 

 His only disappointment with the past year was the lacklustre performance of the company's shares, Holland said, pointing to the Nuplex's record of more than 10% annual growth in profit during the last 10 years. 

 Nuplex shares rose from $3.14 a week ago to $3.33 late yesterday. They have risen from as low as $2.60 earlier this year but this time last year they traded as high as $3.70. 

 Forest products company Carter Holt Harvey at last showed signs of life, climbing from $1.68 last week to $1.76. 

 Price says further evidence of global industry consolidation helped the stock - the industry is widely viewed as needing rationalisation. 

 "Carter Holt has been a laggard. The stock's starting to perform and we would expect that to continue," he says. 

 US-based Weyerhaeuser is offering $US5.3 billion for Willamette Industries in a bid to unite two of the largest forest products companies in the Pacific Northwest. 

 By contrast, Fletcher Challenge's forestry shares took a beating after shedding their rights to the company's two-for-one rights issue of preference shares priced at 25 cents each. The new shares convert to ordinary shares after five years. 

 The forestry shares fell from 35 cents a week ago to 27 cents late yesterday. 

 Fletcher Energy was little changed ahead of the Commerce Commission's decision, expected by Friday, on Shell's revised plan to take over the company. The energy shares fell from $8.24 to $8.17 over the week. 

 Price says investors are nervous ahead of the commission's decision but that soaring heating oil prices in the US are helping to support the stock. 

 Heating oil has risen 31% since the end of last month amid concerns about low inventories heading into the US winter. 

 Distinctly out of favour this week was Tourism Holdings, which fell from $2.16 to $1.90. 

 Investors were upset that the company lowered its forecast profit for this year from $26.8 million to just $21 million. The company said a poor first quarter was hit by the political upheavals in Fiji, a disappointing ski season, rising fuel costs and depressed trading in Australia during the Olympics. 

 "You would think that with the dollar where it is, these guys should be benefiting. It's certainly disappointing they're not delivering in this environment," Robins says. 

 The $Kiwi remained becalmed near its record lows, slipping from 39.85 US cents a week ago to 39.70 late yesterday. 

 "The currency market's in a state of flux, not knowing which direction to take and that's because of the uncertainty around the US election," says Greg Ball, foreign exchange manager at the Bank of New Zealand. 

 While there has been some pressure on the US dollar, as would be expected given the situation, every time other currencies have rallied against it, particularly the euro, people have been selling into the rally. 

 "If it had been any other country, you would've seen the currency being tanked," says Peter Cavanaugh, associate director at Bancorp Treasury Services. 

 A good part of the reason the US dollar hasn't suffered is that "irrespective of who's in the White House on 20 January, [Alan] Greenspan will still be chairman of the Fed[eral Reserve]," he says. 

 The $Kiwi is just one of a basket of currencies, including the Australian dollar and the euro, that are suffering from US dollar strength. That reflects the much stronger US economy. 

 Intervention by the European Central Bank to buy euros also had little impact. 

 Comments by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane that he won't raise interest rates in an "ad hoc" attempt to defend the weak Australian dollar also didn't help. 

 That was reflected in the $Kiwi's rise from 75.60 Australian cents last week to 76.15 cents late yesterday. 

 Still, "those countries that have tightened monetary policy, for whatever reason, have tended to see their currency sold off anyway," Ball says. 

 Cavanaugh says Macfarlane's comments made currency dealers of the world think, "Oh good, more fresh meat." 

 The bond market was a clear beneficiary of the US electoral confusion, piggy-backing on stronger US bonds as investors sought safety. 

 The July 2009 bond yield fell from 6.69% a week ago to 6.61% late yesterday while the 90-day bank bills eased from 6.64% to 6.63%. 

 The Fed's open market committee was due to meet overnight but no one in the market was expecting any change in US interest rates. 

 Joe Tooman of NZ Guardian Trust says there's a reasonable chance the Fed will remove its bias towards tightening, given clear signs US growth is moderating, but given the tight labour market, it's unlikely to turn to easing rates at this point. 

 INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSWEEK FROM THE REUTERS WIRE 

 APEC leaders talk the talk 

 APEC ended its annual leaders' summit in Brunei with an upbeat assessment of the region's prospects and a broad statement on the benefits of free trade. The leaders of the 21 Asia Pacific countries praised globalisation but avoided specific commitments on a new round of multilateral trade talks. APEC officials say growing doubts about the merits of globalisation threaten to put APEC seriously out of step with many of its people. 

 Daewoo declared bankrupt 

 Korean automaker Daewoo was declared bankrupt by creditors after the labour union rejected demands for job losses and pay cuts, complicating efforts to find a buyer for the company. Creditors are trying to stem losses set to top $US2 billion this year as they try to make Korea's second largest car maker more attractive to buyers, of which General Motors and Fiat are the leading contenders. 

 US presidential election turns sour 

 Election officials in Florida's Palm Beach county ordered an unprecedented recount by hand of the hundreds of thousands of votes cast in last week's US presidential election. The second re-count follows an initial statewide recount which slashed Republican candidate George W Bush's lead over Democrat Al Gore from 1,700 to just 327 votes. Who becomes president depends on which party carries Florida, an outcome which should be known by Friday when the handcount is finished and absentee ballots, which traditionally favour the Republicans, are tallied. But dialogue between the two camps became increasingly bitter after Al Gore vowed to fight the Florida result in court, citing a confusing ballot paper in Palm Beach which Democrats say caused many of their supporters to mistakenly vote for far right conservative Pat Buchanan. 

 The political gridlock has thrown Wall Street into a tailspin with big drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index. With no quick resolution likely, the erratic trading is expected to continue and it appears to have significantly slowed investment in US shares. Some pundits are predicting the financial markets may have the final say in the election result, forcing the parties to come to an agreement if they drop too severely. 

 Oil producers maintain pressure 

 OPEC has left output targets unchanged, focusing instead on future cuts to match an expected slowdown in demand and prevent a drop in oil prices early next year. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to meet again in Vienna in January to review output. 

 Cooling US economy eases rate fears 

 Analysts expect a report to be released today will show the US economy has cooled, prividing little reason for the Federal Reserve to alter its course on interest rates. They predicted the US consumer price index would increase 0.2% in October, compared to an 0.5% increase in September. 

 Steady as she goes for ECB 

 The European Central Bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged after a report, to be released later this week, will show no change in consumer prices during October, predict analysts. The ECB has lifted rates seven times in the past year to try to restrain inflation as oil prices soared and the euro lost a quarter of its value against the dollar. Now there are signs that the high oil prices coupled with the higher borrowing costs are beginning to cool growth in the 11 nations sharing the euro. 

 China can't join WTO just yet 

 China appears unlikely to gain entry into the World Trade Organisation this year. WTO director-general Mike Moore said it could take "weeks or months" before China's accession, in the face of ongoing disagreements over legal issues. Some of the critical areas to remain unresolved include trading rights, anti-dumping rules, non-tariff trade barriers and legal safeguards. 

 Hong Kong share trading goes online 

 Hong Kong stockbrokers can offer online trading after changes to the Hong Kong stock exchange's trading system. Initially only 32 brokers will offer online trading but another 200 are expected to join early next year. HKex managing director David Friedland predicted half of all retail securities in Hong Kong would be traded online within one year. 

 Bank exposes private parts 

 Credit Suisse Group accidentally posted confidential details of prominent clients' accounts and addresses on a publicly accessible web site, reported the Australian Financial Review. The Swiss bank said the data had been inadvertently posted on an insecure test section of its internet banking site. A German daily newspaper reported that British actor Roger Moore and German pop star Udo Juergens were among the clients affected. 

 Fourteen convicted smugglers were sentenced to death in the southern Chinese city of Xiamen. Further death sentences could follow as China's biggest corruption investigation in 50 years continues. The trials, which began in September, centre on a smuggling racket in Fujian province involving cars, fuel, cigarettes and other goods with an estimated value of $A12.2 billion. A number of prominent state and city officials were among those sentenced to death. 

 Merrill Lynch said it doesn't consider itself in the individual securities business, as the company seeks to attract rich clients and manage their money. "We're in the weath management business," sais Head of Merrill's brokerage business E. Stanley O'Neal. "We do not even consider ourselves to be in the retail securities business anymore." 

 F&P's management blames Korean dumping, analysts blame the F&P management 

 Jenny Ruth 

 Fisher & Paykel's recently announced losses were not due, as the daily press reported, to stiff competition. 

 It's one-eyed to blame the competitors for price-cutting and the Koreans for dumping appliances on this market when most of the damage was done by F&P management. 

 A monumental blunder in F&P's forex cover left it unable to take full advantage of better export returns - in $Kiwi terms - when the $Kiwi fell to US40 cents and, on the flip side of this double whammy, it had to pay more for its raw materials when the $Kiwi fell against the greenback. 

 Some are now calling for heads to roll. "Why hasn't someone been fired over that?" asks one analyst. "In any other company you would lose your job." 

 Another analyst suggests replacing the entire board would be the best way to improve shareholder value. Look at the track record: "management only gets it right one year in five," he says. 

 While the newspaper headlines focused on the company's accusations of Korean dumping in the New Zealand and Australian whiteware markets, the currency position did far more damage to the whiteware division, now renamed the appliances division. 

 More than a year ago, Fisher & Paykel expected the $Kiwi to rise, so it hedged its Australian and US sales forward two years at about 50 US cents and 80 Australian cents. 

 And it didn't hedge its imported raw materials, mostly steel and plastics. 

 If the company had won its bet, it would have locked in the benefit of a low exchange rate for its sales and its imported raw materials would have become progressively cheaper. 

 Instead, the $Kiwi has fallen to below 40 US cents and about 76 Australian cents. So F&P loses on both sides of the equation. 

 That much was already known. The impact in the year ended March wasn't pretty - a $14.3 million turnaround on the previous year's currency position. 

 At 31 March, its foreign exchange forward contracts were $2.7 million out of the money and its foreign currency options agreements were $7.8 million in the red. 

 Bad enough, but the impact in the latest six months was horrendous. 

 The appliance division's sales rose 9.9% to $324.7 million in the six months ended September but its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) fell 36% from $15.3 million in the first half last year to just $9.7 million. 

 That's because the profit margin fell from 5.2% of sales in the previous first half to just 3%. 

 The company says, in the latest six months, cutting prices to meet the Korean competition cost it $4.5 million in trading profit. Covering its Australian and US sales cost it another $4.8 million in lost profits. 

 But, by far the biggest impact was the increase in its materials costs, which was mainly currency related. Most of its imported materials are priced in US dollars and the company had only limited hedging cover. That cost it a further $11.4 million in trading profit. 

 If the whiteware division had avoided just half those extra costs, the operating profit would have at least matched last year's. 

 The division's erosion of margins "is nothing to do with the performance of the whiteware division. It's to do with the corporate division, the guys who do the hedging," says Gary Baker, an analyst at ABN Amro. 

 As he sees it, the company would have been better off had it hedged its inputs as well as outputs, which would have at least locked in its margins, or even by not hedging at all. 

 While its US whiteware sales are tiny so far, most of the healthcare division's sales are in US dollars and, if unhedged, could have offset the whiteware division's cost increases. 

 "They undid their own natural hedge," Baker says. 

 The whiteware division sold 18,800 units in the US in the latest six months, a 55.4% increase on the same six months a year earlier. But in $Kiwi terms they rose 39.6% to $32.6 million. 

 The healthcare division's sales rose 17.3% to $80.2 million - that was even after hedging at 50 US cents.

 EXCLUSIVE: Psion Chairman Says Co Will Break Even In '00

 ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- Psion Plc (U.PON) will still manage to break even this year and return to profit growth next year, the company's Chairman David Potter told Dow Jones Newswires. 

 Exchange rate woes, rising component prices, and restructuring and acquisition costs have recently plagued the company and caused it to issue a profit earning last month, but Potter expects revenues at the U.K. information technology group's two largest units to grow strongly and profitability to increase next year. 

 "Analysts are saying that we'll probably break even, and we're comfortable with these expectations," Potter said Wednesday. 

 "We'd even do quite well at the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and operating profits level," he said, "but we have to take charges of amortization of goodwill and our share of the costs of Symbian into account," referring to the U.K. mobile phone software company in which it owns 28%. 

 The company issued a warning in late October, saying that the year's profit would be "well below" consensus forecasts of GBP6.68 million. In 1999 Psion posted before tax profits of GBP4.5 million. 

 The company cited the weakness of the euro, increased component costs and costs associated with the almost-final acquisition of Teklogix International Inc., a provider of wireless data communication and integration systems. 

 Analysts acknowledged these difficulties at the time but were also concerned about Psion's Connect division, which produces modem cards for personal computers. 

 "We warned analysts in February that this market segment was going to come under pressure," said Potter. "Actually it came under less pressure and more slowly than we thought". 

 Connect is being restructured at a cost thought to be about GBP2.5 million. 

 "Some analysts say that we should have acted more aggressively, more quickly. This might be a fair comment," he conceded. "I wouldn't dispute that, but I don't think we've been negligent either." 

 Potter said he expected Connect to be profitable next year. 

 "Psion is in a restructuring and reformulating phase," he said, adding that he thought growth would be substantial in 2001. 

 Turning to growth-drivers in the year ahead, Potter said "next year we'll see substantial growth in revenue driven by Psion Computers and a whole range of products as well as in the Teklogix enterprise. 

 "The two biggest parts of our business are going to grow strongly next year," he said. "Profitability should improve." 

 He said spending on research and development this year will be 30% of total revenue. "The board thinks it's wise to invest very heavily in long-term development," he said. "We'll continue to do this through next year because the opportunities are terrific." 

 But he added that spending levels as a proportion of revenue will start to decline only in 2002. 

 "We'll be looking for a higher level of profitability then. Symbian should be moving in to profit," he said.

 Economic Slowdown Weighs On Retailers' 3Q >HD WSM SPLS

 LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Quarterly reports from several major retailers Tuesday seemed to confirm that a slowing economy is weighing on earnings in the sector. 

 "That is the key theme of the week we are hearing from a number of retailers," said Daniel R. Wewer, retail analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 

 "They are cautious because of the economy. In retailing, the second half of October and first half of November have been soft, and that was before the election noise began to slow things down," he said. 

 Home Depot Inc. (HD), the nation's largest home-improvement retailer, posted third-quarter net that matched Wall Street's lowered expectations. A month ago, the company issued its first profit warning in five years, saying that lower lumber and building materials prices would hurt its bottom line. 

 In a conference call, Home Depot President and Chief Executive Arthur Blank said the company was seeing some evidence of growth slowing in recent weeks. 

 Meanwhile, Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) posted third-quarter net of 4 cents a share, a month after it warned Wall Street that earnings would only be between 4 and 6 cents a share. Prior to the warning, the consensus analyst projection had been 18 cents a share. 

 Williams-Sonoma said earnings in the quarter were hurt by lower-than-expected sales from fall and early holiday catalog mailings, higher catalog advertising costs and depressed margins in the retail division due to increased promotional activity and higher freight costs. 

 Following their earnings reports, shares of Home Depot and Williams-Sonoma both rose, though both stocks remain well off their highs. 

 Shares of Staples Inc. (SPLS), however, which also reported earnings Tuesday, fell in heavy trading. Although Staples hadn't previously issued a profit warning, its third-quarter net missed expectations, and the company warned that the fourth quarter would also fall short. 

 "The downturn in the economy, combined with our aggressive growth plans, hurt our business. With a strong management team in place, we're managing our way well through a difficult environment," said Thomas G. Stemberg, Staples' chairman and chief executive. 

 "Staples is a very complex company with a lot of moving pieces, and there are some ongoing concerns about their North American stores maturing," said Mark D. Mandel, analyst with Robinson-Humphrey. 

 Still, Deutsche Banc's Wewer says there's no reason to think Staples might lose its No. 1 spot in its niche. 

 If anything, he said, "They'll solidify their position because Office Depot (ODP) and Office Max (OMX) are closing stores," he said. 

 Mandel said the company's dot.com business, Staples.com, is operating fine, but some investors are worried that the startup costs have drained cash away from other, healthy parts of the company. Staples.com isn't expected to be profitable until late next year, he said. 

 Mandel also noted a rising inventory shrinkage rate in the latest quarter, representing theft of electronic products like cell phones. "They've not controlled that properly," he said. 

 "They are struggling, but it's a combination of a real poor economic environment and some execution issues that contributed to a disappointing third quarter," Mandel said.

 Campbell first-quarter profits fall 13 percent

 CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - First-quarter earnings at Campbell Soup Co. fell 13 percent due to increased marketing spending on its U.S. soup business and Pepperidge Farm snack foods. 

 For the three months ended Oct. 29, Campbell reported net income of $204 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with $235 million, or 54 cents per share, for the same period a year ago, the company said Wednesday. 

 The results exceeded Wall Street's lowered expectations of 45 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Camden-based Campbell had issued a profit warning in September, saying that first quarter earnings would be 6 cents to 8 cents per share below estimates at the time. 

 Operating earnings were down 18 percent for the company's biscuits and confectionary division and down 9 percent for the soups and sauces division. 

 Net sales for the quarter increased to $1.78 billion from $1.77 billion in the year-ago period. 

 "They're pursuing the right strategies, but the soup category's been so tough lately," said Romitha Mally, a packaged-foods analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co. "I think it's still too early to say" whether Campbell's latest turnaround plan will work. 

 Mally, whose company has issued a hold recommendation for Campbell's stock, said its new product launches and 14 percent increase in its soup advertising budget over last year's first quarter were both positive moves. She said it's too soon to tell whether those efforts will revitalize the company but noted that after five quarters of lagging soup consumption, the latest quarter shows improvement. 

 First-quarter global soup volume was up 4 percent. Soup consumption in the United States, where Campbell has 70 percent of the wet soup market, rose 3 percent, said David W. Johnson, president and chief executive officer. 

 "The real key here is how sustainable are these consumption trends," Mally said. 

 She noted that sales of ready-to-serve soups in general have been growing, while sales have been declining for Campbell's condensed soups, which bring in 60 percent of the company's total U.S. soup revenues. 

 Sales of Campbell's beverages, particularly V8 Splash, were down, but the Godiva Chocolatier and Pepperidge Farm brands both had strong sales growth. 

 The company said it expects earnings per share for its 2001 fiscal year to be flat compared with the previous year. 

 Campbell's other brands include Franco-American and Prego pasta sauces. Newly introduced products include Giant Goldfish and Goldfish Grahams crackers, Spritzers cookies and new lines of crackers and soups sold overseas. 

 Shares of Campbell were up 67 cents to close at $30.48 a share Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Big Retailers' Bottom Lines Suffer as Consumers Tighten Purse Strings

 Several big U.S. retailers posted sluggish weak third-quarter results amid a slowdown in consumer spending. 

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a modest 5.8% rise in fiscal third-quarter earnings, and J.C. Penney Co. swung to a loss. Home Depot Inc. said profit rose 13%, but sounded a cautious note about future sales. Staples Inc.'s net income declined 8.5%. 

 The retail sector has suffered in recent months as higher interest rates and gasoline prices have led consumers to curb their spending. That in turn has prompted many retailers to lower their prices. 

 But Tuesday's earnings reports weren't as disappointing as some analysts and investors were expecting. 

 Indeed, shares of most of the retailers gained ground. In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Wal-Mart rose $2.75 to $48.25, Penney added 38 cents to $11, Home Depot gained $2.81 to $40.19 and Target Corp. advanced $2 to $28.19. However, Staples dropped 50 cents to $10.88 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Wal-Mart, Bentonville, Ark., said Tuesday that net income totaled $1.37 billion, or 31 cents a diluted share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with $1.29 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results met a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The world's largest retailer said sales climbed 13% to $45.68 billion from $40.43 billion. Same-store sales, or those at stores open at least a year, rose 4.9%. 

 "We are pleased that in a difficult quarter we were able to achieve record sales and earnings," Lee Scott, Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, said in a prepared statement. "We gained market share and generated good earnings growth in a challenging retail environment." 

 The company said sales at its Wal-Mart Stores unit, including Supercenters, rose 11% for the quarter, while sales at the Sam's Club warehouse membership unit increased 9.3%. 

 Penney Swings to a Loss 

 J.C. Penney posted a loss for the quarter ended Oct. 28, but the Plano, Texas, company performed better than analysts expected. In the last two months, the company twice warned it would post a third-quarter loss due to lower sales. 

 Penney's loss totaled $30 million, or 15 cents a share. Excluding the effects of noncomparable items, the loss totaled $23 million, or 12 cents a share. Wall Street anticipated the company would record a loss of 14 cents a share, according to First Call. 

 In the year-earlier quarter, Penney posted net income of $142 million, or 51 cents a share. 

 Revenue fell 1.2% to $7.74 billion in the latest period from $7.83 billion. 

 Penney said sales in department stores open at least a year dropped 3.7% in the latest period and catalog sales declined 5.4%. E-commerce sales, which are included in catalog sales, climbed to $73 million from $20 million. 

 Meanwhile, gross margin fell, though Penney didn't quantify the drop. The retailer blamed the drop in gross margin on increased markdowns associated with clearing inventory. 

 Same-store sales at its Eckerd Drugstore chain rose 9.1%, but the division had an operating loss of $63 million. Eckerd's lower-margin pharmacy sales climbed 15%, but sales of higher-margin general merchandise fell 1%. 

 Home Depot's Net Rises 

 Atlanta-based Home Depot said profit for the third quarter ended Oct. 29 rose 13%, meeting analysts' lowered expectations. 

 The chain of home-improvement stores said net income rose to $650 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, from $573 million, or 25 cents a share, in the third quarter of last year. 

 Despite the stronger earnings, the company said its bottom line was hurt by lower prices for lumber and building materials. It added that a strong year-earlier performance made for a tough comparison. In the third quarter of last year, hurricanes and year-2000 related sales boosted the company's revenue. 

 Sales rose 17% to $11.55 billion in the latest quarter from $9.88 billion. Sales in stores open at least a year rose 4%. 

 In addition, Home Depot said it is cautious about its sales outlook for the fourth quarter, but repeated that it expects earnings of $1.16 to $1.17 a share for the full year. 

 The company stunned investors in October with its first profit warning in more than five years. It lowered its estimate to about 28 cents a share for the third quarter, and indicated it expected to earn about 26 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Analysts subsequently lowered their estimates for both quarters. 

 Markdowns Hurt Target 

 Meanwhile, Minneapolis-based Target reported earnings fell 7.3% as higher inventory markdowns outweighed a rise in revenue. 

 The company said net income for the quarter ended Oct. 28 declined to $215 million, or 24 cents a diluted share, from $232 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. However, the latest results were a penny a share higher than investors expected. 

 Revenue climbed 8.3% to $8.58 billion from $7.93 billion as same-store sales increased 2.9%. However, Target's gross-margin rate felt the impact of higher markdowns. 

 "Our current outlook for the holiday season is consistent with our expectation of low double-digit growth in [earnings per share] for the full year," Bob Ulrich, Target's chairman and chief executive, said in a prepared statement. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call anticipate the company will post earnings of $1.39 a share for fiscal 2001. 

 Staples Sees Profit Fall 

 Staples issued a pessimistic outlook for its fourth quarter. The company, based in Framingham, Mass., recorded net income of $84.7 million, or 19 cents a diluted share, for the quarter ended Oct. 28 compared with $92.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 The results missed Wall Street's estimates by two cents a share. The office-supplies retailer also warned it is likely to miss Wall Street's expectations for the fourth-quarter earnings per share of 31 cents. 

 Sales rose 17% to $2.8 billion from $2.39 billion a year earlier. However, pure-retail same-store sales edged only 4% higher. 

 "Given the tough retail climate, our results are respectable, although not up to our usual standards," Thomas G. Stemberg, the company's chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement. "The downturn in the economy, combined with our aggressive growth plans, hurt our business." 

 The company said results in North American stores were hit by lower consumer spending, competitive pricing, labor and shoplifting pressures, costs associated with the company's new market entries and a new distribution center that isn't yet operating at capacity.

 No Respite For News As US Trade Tanks Again

 Faith in Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corp faces another major test this week as investors digest last week's full-year profit warning and a fresh Wall Street  plunge on Friday. 

 The most influential stock on the Australian equity market, representing one-tenth of the All Ordinaries index's market capitalisation, fell more than 10  per cent to $17.84 on Friday, its lowest level since January, and well below its $28 peak in March. 

 The latest fall wiped $8 billion off its market capitalisation, although the stock's American depositary receipts fell just US50c to $US371/2 that night, following reports that US television audiences were up as people tuned into the latest on the presidential election saga. 

 This could limit damage to the Australian securities when the local sharemarket opens today. However, inspired by US election jitters and earnings concerns, Nasdaq's 171.4 point, or 5.4 per cent, plunge to 3029 on Friday, combined with a 231.3-point fall to 10,602.9 by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is expected to unnerve local investors and send News Corp's share price  tumbling once again. The Nasdaq fell to its lowest level this year. 

 ``News will remain under pressure,'' one fund manager said. ``I don't think it will take quite the same hit it did last week, but unless Rupert Murdoch can pull off another asset play like the Sky Global Networks satellite spin-off the share price will no longer be ruled by its assets, but its earnings. If that's the case it's not a good scenario, because earnings growth is obviously slowing.'' 

 Broking house Credit Suisse First Boston said News' unusual decision to give a detailed assessment of the earnings outlook for the full year reflected the management's desire to ``set a base of expectations which it can exceed over the  course of 2001, rather than face the risk of quarterly disappointments''. 

 The investment bank has cut its full-year earnings forecast by $130 million to $1.42 billion but said the management's forecasts allowed for a ``healthy incorporation of conservatism''. 

 JB Were & Son was less charitable, saying the September quarter results were poor quality; moving its short-term recommendation to ``reduce''. 

 Much of last week's slide was due to long-term News bull, Merrill Lynch analyst Ms Jessica Reif Cohen, downgrading her recommendation on the stock from ``buy'' to ``neutral'' and her target of the price of the ADRs from $US90 to $US66. News's first quarter figures showed a 10 per cent drop in earnings due to  lower audiences and advertising pressures and lower than expected full-year forecasts. 

 Elsewhere, market attention will focus on Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting. Economists expect the Fed to leave US interest rates unchanged at 6.5 per cent as data pointing to a slowdown in growth continues to mount. 

 However, HSBC senior economist Mr Grant Fitzner believes the Fed's bias towards controlling inflation will remain.

 Activists see danger in Blues' link :  `Creeping conversion' to for-profit status feared

 Consumer advocates are warning regulators in four Northwestern states that the proposed affiliation between Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois Inc. and Portland, Ore.-based Regence Group may jeopardize the charitable assets of the not-for-profit Blues in their states. 

 Consumers Union in San Francisco and Community Catalyst in Boston have asked insurance commissioners and attorneys general in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah to ensure that the transaction uniting Health Care Service Corp., the operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in Illinois and Texas, with Regence, parent of the Blues in the Northwest states, doesn't permit a transfer of charitable assets across state lines. 

 Activists warn of a repeat of events following the 1997 merger of Blues plans in Nevada and Colorado. Two weeks after that merger, the Colorado plan filed to convert to for-profit status. The plan created a charitable foundation, as required by law, but the foundation benefited Colorado residents at the expense of those in Nevada, the consumer groups say. 

 Health Care Service Corp. and Regence Group, which announced an affiliation in August, insist they intend neither a merger nor a for-profit conversion. They say the insurers will remain independent, sharing only administrative services through a headquarters in Chicago. 

 "The linkage will be at the board level," said a spokesman for Health Care Service Corp. "We are not moving assets, and we are not merging assets," he said. 

 The consumer groups, however, fear that the affiliation is the first step toward a merger and for-profit conversion. 

 "We are concerned that this arrangement actually constitutes a `creeping conversion' to a for-profit corporation that, if unchecked, could harm . . . consumers," the groups told regulators. Until the groups see documents defining the relationship, they will continue to insist on careful monitoring, said Scott Benbow, a health policy analyst for Consumers Union.

 Legal Challenges to Florida Ballots

 I am insulted that George W. Bush or anyone else is telling the Gore campaign to back off, admit a Bush victory and let the country "begin its healing." There are many of us who studied the candidates carefully and cast our ballots with confidence that our votes would matter. Now 19,000 of those votes have been denied in Florida because of ballot inadequacies. Far from allowing us to heal, a Bush victory decision at this point would cause me to believe that we are going forth into the next four years with 19,000 people having lost their ability to have a democratic voice and, as a result, the rest of us as well. 

 Only by taking every legal measure to find the true winner can we eliminate a doubt that would split this country for the next four years.

 I was initially skeptical about the "confusing ballot" theory, but from the accounts of distressed Florida voters tearing up their mismarked ballots, etc., it is becoming increasingly clear that many Florida voters really did mistakenly cast ballots for Pat Buchanan while attempting to vote for Al Gore. In view of this, if Bush does indeed win in Florida, thereby winning the presidential election, it would be appropriate for him to go down in history as "the accidental president."

 First Gore said we need to respect the voting process as it stands. Then, apparently because the election is not going the right way, he supports a lawsuit to redo the election. I've seen the ballot as published on the Internet and it was clear. This is a smoke screen and if people made mistakes, they ought to have checked their ballots before submitting them. They could've gotten a new ballot. Would the Democrats be so supportive of Republican voters? I don't think so. The nation should not have to pay for the mistakes that people make. If mistakes were made, grow up and live with them.

 If this year's race for the White House is decided in a courtroom rather than the ballot box, it renders the argument of "my vote doesn't matter" a fact. No matter how close the Florida recount is, it should decide the election. Whether the margin is one vote or 1,000.

 The 2000 election that pinned two baby boomers together for the first time did not disappoint. The self-absorption that exists with both the Gore and Bush camps is embarrassing for us all. I am sad to say it, but Bush and Gore need to learn from Richard Nixon. When Florida is declared, the candidates should accept the result and be ready to consider the country as a whole and not their personal agendas. They are only hurting our nation and making the cynics more cynical.

 On the eve of the last Veterans Day of the 20th century, the American electorate offered its own poll in this historic election. The winners: Hillary Clinton, the memory of Mel Carnahan and, most importantly, the power of a single vote. The losers: the media, the Florida elections board and the stature of the electoral college. The undecided: Bush and Gore. This is the most compelling election I've witnessed in my lifetime. Does it get any more riveting than this?

 Ames Plans to Close 32 Stores, Including Three in Western New York

 Ames Department Stores has announced plans to close three Western New York stores as part of company-wide downsizing effort that will see a total of 32 stores shuttered in early 2001. 

 The closures, which will affect 2,000 Ames employees, were detailed Thursday as the retailer forecast an unexpected yearly loss due to higher energy prices and an interest-rate caused slowdown in customer spending. 

 Locally, Ames will close stores at 3270 Sheridan Drive in Eggertsville and 4271 Lake Ave. in Blasdell, as well as the store at 3955 Vineyard Drive in Dunkirk. 

 Mary McCabe, spokeswoman for the Connecticut-based discount chain, said under-performing stores were targeted for closing. In the case of the Western New York stores, location was also a part of the litmus test. 

 "In the wake of our acquisition of Hills, in some cases we ended up with stores too close together. That was part of the consideration for the Buffalo area stores," McCabe said. 

 Approximately 100 local workers will be affected by the store closings, which will take place in early February, following post-holiday liquidation sales. Ames executives pledged to make an attempt to find jobs for the displaced workers at its other stores. 

 In November 1998, Ames announced a $330 million deal to buy Hills Stores Co., creating the fourth largest U.S. discount retail chain. As part of that takeover, Ames closed eight area Hills stores and converted the remaining 10 to the Ames format. All three of the local stores earmarked for closure are former Hills locations. 

 The company will have 447 stores remaining after the planned store closings, an action that is expected to add 50 cents to next year's earnings, the company said. 

 No other store closings are planned, said Joe Ettore, Ames chairman and chief executive. 

 Word of the store closing came as Ames warned investors that it expects to lose about $1 a share in the fiscal year ending in January, a dramatic difference from analyst forecasts of a 51 cent per share profit. 

 The company's stock took a beating, dropping $1.81, or 39 percent, to close at $2.78 a share Thursday. 

 Ettore said higher interest rates and energy prices have crimped the spending of its customers, who tend to be middle income and lower middle-income families. 

 "When a customer is feeling the pinch with the dollar, they also watch what they spend," Ettore said in a statement regarding Ames' financial pressures. 

 Ames isn't the only retailer to disclose a loss or make a profitwarning. Discount retailers Kmart Corp. and ShopKo Stores Inc. said Thursday they had losses because of price markdowns and slowing sales. 

 In addition to the three New York stores, Ames will close 29 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Indiana and Massachusetts. All but one of the soon-to-close stores is a converted Hills store.

Secure Horizons to Freeze Membership in 24 Calif. Counties

Secure Horizons, the nation's largest Medicare HMO, said Thursday it will freeze membership next year in 41 counties nationwide, most of them in California.

The announcement that new members will not be accepted in 24 California counties, among them Riverside, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Kern, Alameda and Contra Costa, came as Secure Horizons' parent company reported disappointing results for the third quarter, though they beat estimates.

Santa Ana-based PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. also said it would implement dramatic premium hikes in 2001, ranging from 10% to 25%, for its 3 million non-Medicare members.

PacifiCare, which had originally been projected to earn $1.90 a share in the third quarter before issuing a profit warning, instead reported net income of $5.2 million, or 15 cents a share. And that figure was inflated slightly by the inclusion of a one-time credit, without which income would have been $1.4 million, or 4 cents, said acting President and Chief Executive Howard Phanstiel.

Revenue rose 14% to $2.9 billion from $2.5 billion. In the year-ago third quarter, the company earned $69.3 million, or $1.54 a share.

"We're obviously very disappointed with our third-quarter results," said Phanstiel, who had been serving as chief financial officer before the abrupt departure of the company's CEO, Robert O'Leary, last month.

In October, PacifiCare signaled that it would either break even for the quarter or lose up to 10 cents a share as a result of rising medical costs, news that sent the company's stock plunging and prompted the resignation of O'Leary after just three months on the job.

On Thursday's news, which showed earnings slightly better than those October projections, PacifiCare's stock gained 15% in after-hours trading to $12.25. The results were released after the close of regular U.S. trading. The shares had finished the regular session up 44 cents at $10.69 on Nasdaq.

In the weeks since O'Leary's departure, remaining officials have been scrambling to develop a turnaround plan for the company, which is struggling to reinvent itself after the health-care market forced expensive changes to its business model.

PacifiCare, which relied for years on a system that forced hospitals and doctors' groups to absorb all of the financial risk of caring for patients, now must switch to a new approach, in which PacifiCare absorbs the risk and providers are paid for each procedure they perform.

That exacerbates the financial strain on the company's Medicare business, because the federal government pays a limited amount for each member every month, and PacifiCare can no longer simply expect hospitals and doctors to absorb any extra costs.

In addition to increased costs incurred by the changing business model, the company's bottom line has been affected by continued bankruptcies and financial instability among the physician groups with which it subcontracts to provide care for members.

To that end, PacifiCare set aside $24 million in reserves for what it called "provider insolvency and uncollectable provider loans." Included in the reserves are $9.7 million meant to cover the value of a loan made to Southern California's largest medical group, KPC Medical Management, due to what Phanstiel called a "higher probability" that it will not be repaid.

Phanstiel said the company had not yet decided whether it would dramatically change or exit its Medicare business as part of the new turnaround plan, other than freezing enrollment beginning in 2001 in 41 counties in California, Texas, Colorado, Washington and Oregon. PacifiCare covers 1.1 million Medicare members under its Secure Horizons plan.

Phanstiel said the company expects to lose some members as a result of its plan to raise premiums in 2001, although just over half have signed on for next year despite the hikes. The biggest concern, however, is that those members who choose to pay the higher premiums and stay with PacifiCare might be the sickest members, many of whom cannot switch to other health plans because of preexisting conditions.

 AMERICA'S fear of technology stocks is catching. The slump on the hi-tech Nasdaq market is leading to a sell-off in London. That may be positive news for 'old economy' stocks as they return to favour. But it is causing burnt fingers among techno fans. 

 The market showed size doesn't matter. Heavyweight Autonomy, which has only just listed in London, dived 415p to 3580p. Mighty fibre-optic cables group Bookham Technology crashed 313p to 1826p, unnerved by the profit warning from Nortel, one of its major customers. In July Bookham peaked at 5302p. 

 Freeserve fell 13p to 147p, NetBenefit 

 was off 45p at 315p, Baltimore fell a further 38p to 485p. A senior analyst said: 'Investors are being asked to bet on the future. They are starting to find comfort in companies which are making profits today.' 

 The impasse in the US elections left world markets in limbo. The Footsie, over 60 points adrift at one time, recovered some ground to end 35.2 lower at 

 6442.2. The decision to leave interest rates unchanged was expected. 

 The latest round of propping up by the European Central Bank left the euro slightly firmer against the pound at 60.25p. Against the dollar, the pound moved up to $1.4230 with dealers concerned that it might drift down to $1.40. 

 Among Footsie stocks, BT was walloped 39p to 749p despite restructuring plans. EMI spun 32p higher at 544p, with a large block of shares quickly mopped up, on continuing hopes that German music group Bertelsmann may bid. It was 799p in January. 

 Web designer Tadpole Technology rose 4p to 60p as one big punter staked his reputation on the shares hitting 250p. Of more immediate concern is the prospect of an early rights issue around 40p. 

 Nosey buying pushed up engineer Glynwed, famous for its Aga cookers, on continuing hopes of a bid around 270p. The shares, 162p last month, gained 13p to 214p as over 3.3m changed hands. 

 Luxury liners group P&O Princess Cruises has found the going choppy since demerging from the old ports business in October. The shares ended the first day's trading at 294p, but have continued to fall, off another 3p to 252p on third-quarter results showing an 8pc rise in operating profits. 'People are still getting to grips with understanding our business,' 

 THINK a company will receive a bid but don't want to risk buying the shares? Richard Wollenberg, financier and boss of Cardiff Property (unchanged at 485p) has backed a web-site, betswap.com. It allows punters to place bets with each other on the likeli-hood of a takeover bid for a company within a set time. It is all part of the frenzy in online betting which yesterday saw Sportingbet.com seek a move from Ofex to Aim. Floated at 70p the shares were suspended at 177p and could resume over 200p. said chief executive Peter Ratcliffe. No such problems understanding pubs chain WD Wetherspoon, up 14p at 312p on a frothy 32pc rise in sales in the 13 weeks to October 29 or 6pc on a like-for-like basis. 

 Wine-bar chain Yates also produced profits ahead of forecasts, following a September warning. Broker Peel Hunt says the shares, 8p off at 147p look cheap but are unlikely to do much until the post Christmas trading statement. 

 Kingfisher's plans to demerge its Woolworth and Superdrug chains got a lukewarm reception. Surprisingly, the shares were up 24p at 432p. One story was that a bidder could get more value by breaking up the group. Don't hold your breath. 

 House broker Credit Suisse First Boston was singing the praises of Car-phone Warehouse, after first-half profits of #8m and progress in breaking into Europe. Even so, the shares fell 2p to 184p. 

 Nightclub operator Kingfisher Leisure, which has just repelled an attempt by rebel investors to sack the chairman because of its poor performance, is on course for better than expected first-half profits. The shares bucked up 2p at 561/2p. Stockbroker Walker, Crips, Weddle, Beck reported higher half-time profits. The shares were unchanged at 200p, but have nearly doubled this year.

 Jobs, US poll king-hit Aussie.

 WEAK October jobs data and the teetering possibility of a Bush win in the United States presidential race dealt the Australian dollar dual king hits yesterday, knocking it back to US52.20. The election uncertainty also helped cause choppy stockmarket conditions, though News Corp and diversified industrial Brambles, whose prices were hit for other reasons, were largely responsible for pulling down the local bourse. The All Ordinaries fell 18.3 points to 3279.9 with media and telco stocks badly battered, but banks once again weathered the storm to come out glowing and setting new record highs. Local volatility was in step with New York, where the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 183.74 points to 3232.05 on concerns slower growth would eat into consumer demand. The Dow Jones was buoyed slightly by drug, tobacco and chemical stocks - all positive on the likelihood of an industry-friendly Bush win - but closed down 45.12 points at 10,907.06. 

  However, currency markets took no comfort whenever Bush looked like a White House shoe-in, since Republicans are thought less likely to support central bank intervention to rescue ailing currencies. As a result, both the euro and the Aussie were pressured down considerably from Wednesday peaks, with the euro down to US85.28 yesterday. Locally, limp October jobs data also helped knock another quarter of a cent off the already sliding Australian dollar to US52.20 yesterday afternoon. And a talk by Reserve Bank governor Ian Macfarlane did little to help, though the currency began to move up again when European trading opened last night. Mr Macfarlane said the main reason for the local dollar's fall was the rising US dollar, and another the tendency for foreign exchange markets to "overshoot". And he made it clear the RBA had no intention of attempting to push up the local currency by departing from setting monetary policy based on its view on inflation over the medium term. Suncorp Metway senior foreign exchange dealer Martin Richardson said the jobs figures - employment fell 5100 despite expectations of an 18,000 rise - prompted the market to factor out further interest rate hikes. "It's just another negative weight on the dollar for the moment. It only managed to stay above the US53 mark for a short period," he said. Locally, Brambles plummeted $3.92 in early trade after Wednesday's profit warning but later clawed back to close $3.82 off at $44.80. Qantas also fell 40 to $3.48 after it went ex-dividend.

 The sharemarket lost ground for a second consecutive day after a fall on Wall Street in response to a poor News Corporation first-quarter result and uncertainty surrounding the presidential election. 

 On Wall Street on Wednesday night, the inconclusive election helped cause the  Nasdaq Composite Index to fall 5.4 per cent to 3231.73, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 1.6 per cent to 1409.28. 

 Following the US lead, the S&P/ASX 200 Index yesterday fell 20.7 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 3333.5 - 1.2 per cent below the record close on Tuesday. Seventy-two of the index's stocks fell, while 107 rose. 

 The broader All Ordinaries Index fell 0.6 per cent to 3279.9. 

 Much of the slide was due to News Corp, which said fiscal first-quarter profit to September 30 had fallen 10 per cent because of lower ratings at its Fox television network. ``Fox didn't do very well in the ... quarter,'' said Nasima Simjee, an analyst at Fiduciary Trust. 

 News Corp ordinary shares fell $1.29, or 6.1 per cent, to $19.98, bringing its two-day drop to 10 per cent. The preferred shares fell 96.8 cents, or 5.4 per cent, to $17.02. Apart from the Fox result, News said it expected to postpone the float of its satellite company, Sky Global Networks, until the first quarter of next year. 

 Brambles Industries, the world's largest storage pallet hire company, fell $3.82, or 7.9 per cent, to $44.80, bringing its two-day decline to 14 per cent. 

 It warned on Wednesday that first-half earnings might fall short of last year's $180.4 million because of lower returns at its equipment rental unit. 

 Growth in its Chep pallet business, Cleanaway industrial services unit and Recall records management division was ``being offset by a deterioration in the global equipment rental market'', said company secretary Doug Corben in a statement to the stock exchange. 

 The profit warning added to investor concerns that the economy's pace of growth was slowing. 

 ``The weakness in the economy is flowing through into stocks,'' said Simon Conn, an equities manager at Investors Mutual in Sydney. 

 Telecommunications stocks fell following reports that Richard Branson's Australian mobile telephone business Virgin Mobile would not bid in the 2.1 gigahertz high-speed wireless spectrum auction in 2001. Companies likely to bid included Telstra, Vodafone Group and Optus, the reports said. 

 ``Once they have bought it (the spectrum) they have got to implement it, which is a huge capital expenditure cost,'' said Investor Mutual's Mr Conn. 

 Telstra fell six cents to $6.50, while Cable & Wireless Optus fell five cents  to $4.06. 

 Running against the overall decline, bank stocks reached records as investors  bet financial stocks would not disappoint on earnings. National Australia Bank rose 39 cents, or 1.4 per cent, to $28.89, Commonwealth Bank lifted 31 cents, to  a record $30.20 and ANZ added 13.9 cents to $14.73, also a record. 

 Foster's rose a cent to $4.63 after reports that the company might create a separate entity, such as a property trust, for its $370 million Australian Leisure and Hospitality Group to improve its debt-to-equity ratio and concentrate on its core operations. -- with BLOOMBERG 

 SUMMARY: Media giant News Corp and key blue-chips Brambles and Qantas dragged  down the stockmarket, despite a strong banking and resource sector. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index closed 20.7 points lower at 3333.5. The broad-based All Ordinaries Index lost 18.3 points to close at 3279.9.

 Maytag Chief Steps Down, Citing Board Differences 

 After just 15 months at the helm of Maytag, Lloyd D. Ward, its chairman and chief executive, resigned abruptly, citing differences with the company's board. 

 Mr. Ward, 51, who at the time of his appointment last year was just the second black executive to head a major United States corporation, ended a brief but rocky tenure at Maytag during which profit growth eroded and the company's shares dropped nearly 62 percent from their peak in July 1999.

AMES PLANS TO CLOSE 32 STORES, INCLUDING THREE IN WNY

Ames Department Stores has announced plans to close three Western New York stores as part of company-wide downsizing effort that will see a total of 32 stores shuttered in early 2001. 

The closures, which will affect 2,000 Ames employees, were detailed Thursday as the retailer forecast an unexpected yearly loss due to higher energy prices and an interest-rate caused slowdown in customer spending. 

Locally, Ames will close stores at 3270 Sheridan Drive in Eggertsville and 4271 Lake Ave. in Blasdell, as well as the store at 3955 Vineyard Drive in Dunkirk. 

Mary McCabe, spokeswoman for the Connecticut-based discount chain, said under-performing stores were targeted for closing. In the case of the Western New York stores, location was also a part of the litmus test. 

"In the wake of our acquisition of Hills, in some cases we ended up with stores too close together. That was part of the consideration for the Buffalo area stores," McCabe said. 

Approximately 100 local workers will be affected by the store closings, which will take place in early February, following post- holiday liquidation sales. Ames executives pledged to make an attempt to find jobs for the displaced workers at its other stores. 

In November 1998, Ames announced a $330 million deal to buy Hills Stores Co., creating the fourth largest U.S. discount retail chain. As part of that takeover, Ames closed eight area Hills stores and converted the remaining 10 to the Ames format. All three of the local stores earmarked for closure are former Hills locations. 

The company will have 447 stores remaining after the planned store closings, an action that is expected to add 50 cents to next year's earnings, the company said. 

No other store closings are planned, said Joe Ettore, Ames chairman and chief executive. 

Word of the store closing came as Ames warned investors that it expects to lose about $1 a share in the fiscal year ending in January, a dramatic difference from analyst forecasts of a 51 cent per share profit. 

The company's stock took a beating, dropping $1.81, or 39 percent, to close at $2.78 a share Thursday. 

Ettore said higher interest rates and energy prices have crimped the spending of its customers, who tend to be middle income and lower middle-income families. 

"When a customer is feeling the pinch with the dollar, they also watch what they spend," Ettore said in a statement regarding Ames' financial pressures. 

Ames isn't the only retailer to disclose a loss or make a profit warning. Discount retailers Kmart Corp. and ShopKo Stores Inc. said Thursday they had losses because of price markdowns and slowing sales. 

In addition to the three New York stores, Ames will close 29 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Indiana and Massachusetts. All but one of the soon-to-close stores is a converted Hills store.

 WSJ.COM WRAP: Best Buy Tumbles 42% On  Profit Warning

 WSJ.com Roundup 

 MINNEAPOLIS -(Dow Jones)- Best Buy Co.'s (BBY) shares fell sharply after it lowered its earnings outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, blaming the softening economy and increasing competition for driving promotional costs higher. 

 In early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Best Buy shares slid $21.75, or 42%, to $30.63. 

 The consumer electronics retailer said it now expects earnings of about 27 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ends in November, and 90 cents a share for the fourth quarter, ending in February. 

 Analysts were looking for earnings of 44 cents a share for the third quarter and $1.02 a share for the fourth, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Best Buy said in September that it was comfortable with the third-quarter estimate of 44 cents a share, and that $1.03 a share, the estimate at the time for the fourth quarter, was "in the range." Last year, the retailer earned 37 cents a share in the third quarter, excluding accounting charges, and 78 cents a share in the fourth quarter. 

 Best Buy issued a statement Thursday saying that store traffic remains strong and same-store sales - sales in stores open at least a year - are up 5%, as it had expected. However, the company said, more promotional activity will lead to reduced profitability and lower gross margins as "retailers fight to gain market share in a more cautious consumer environment." Best Buy sells personal computers and entertainment software and appliances, and said it remains confident that its operating model, market position and employees will help it "take the appropriate actions to respond to current market conditions." Rival consumer-electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc. (CC), a unit of Circuit City Group, said late last month that soft sales in virtually all of its product categories would lead to lower same-store sales.

 Profits fall leaves bitter taste for Tate & Lyle

 TATE & Lyle, the world's biggest sugar and sweeteners company, today reported a sharp fall in first-half profits. 

 The firm also said that it had agreed to sell its loss-making Western Sugar as part of a review of its United States sugar operations. 

 The group went on to warn that trading conditions have not improved since its annual meeting in late July and there had been a further deterioration in US sugar markets. 

 It said that it was difficult to see a second-half improvement in group results. As a result it has signed a conditional deal to sell its beet processor Western Sugar to the Rocky Mountain Sugar Growers Co-operative while it continues to explore options for its cane sugar refiner Domino, although any speedy resolution has been delayed by the worsening conditions in the US sugar market. 

 Tate & Lyle said it was suffering "unprecedentedly" poor market conditions which had resulted in continuing losses in US sugar. 

 "Trading conditions have not improved since the annual general meeting and in US sugar there has been a further deterioration in recent weeks," said group chairman David Lees in a results statement. 

 "If current conditions persist, it will be difficult in the second half of this financial year to improve on the results for the first half." 

 The gloomy news came as Tate & Lyle posted a 46 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the 27 weeks to September 30. 

 The GBP 127 million figure for the corresponding period last year plunged to become GBP 68m for this period. 

 The business had been hit hard by over-capacity of beet and sugar cane and also vicious price-cutting in the market, Tate & Lyle said. 

 Sir David said the company's US sugar business was a high priority, adding: "Our response to these circumstances is to intensify our focus on cost reduction and cash management." 

 Food industry analysts believe Tate's plunge will mean months of misery for shareholders. 

 Said one: "Tate is beset by profit warnings, and today's further warning means Tate's long-suffering shareholders will have to suffer some more." 

 In early trade today shares in the group fell five per cent, dropping 11p to 235p.

 Brown U.: COLUMN: Why I am proudly voting for Pat Buchanan

 PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- On Election Day, it is imperative that we establish the quality and nature of the choices before us. It is my view that this election year has fundamentally denied the American people any real choice in what direction this nation is going. No matter who gets elected, more immigrants will illegally flood this country, free trade will spread, the United States will continue to intervene in foreign wars, government will grow bigger, and Roe v. Wade will remain on the books. On my side of the political spectrum, I have been horrified by the Republican Party's leftward slump at the behest of moderate conservatives. I am a hawk eye with moderates -- they have sold out the conservative movement and ever since they recaptured the Republican Party in 1992 with Bush Sr., the Republican Party has been losing elections. The moderate impulse must be flushed out of every bush and exorcised out of every doleful Republican. 

 To properly explain why I would commit the unthinkable and vote for Pat Buchanan requires a brief summary of George W.'s campaign. I saw warning signs that Bush was a moderate from the start when he commenced his campaign in 1998 by professing faith in what he called "compassionate conservatism." This campaign slogan revealed that he cared more about looting for votes than defending conservatism. By summer 1998, Bush already had a list of positions and statements that hardly classified him as a conservative. He refused to comment on polarizing issues like the Kosovo conflict, had reneged on tax cut pledges, would not commit himself to a litmus test on Supreme Court justices, and openly pandered to the Hispanic vote by adopting soft positions on Puerto Rican statehood, immigration and bilingual education. Moreover, this trumped-up alternative to Clinton had also equivocated on his drug use and had a shady financial past (like making a huge profit on the Texas Rangers at the expense of taxpayers). Most conservatives were taken aback. Senator Bob Smith left the party in the summer and Pat Buchanan commanded the October 1998 revolution that registered him at 15 percent in the polls as a third-party candidate. The campaign overhaul compressed Bush's diffuse message to just a few points, hitting home the advantages of tax cuts and calling for Social Security reform. Bush even hobnobbed with the likes of Pat Robertson, Ralph Reed and Jerry Falwell. Conservatives took the bait and ran with it all the way to the convention and the debates. 

 Despite the high hopes placed on Bush by conservatives, the fact remains that the substance of his campaign has remained unchanged since Day One. Bush has simply sugar-coated his moderate positions with the rhetoric of a conservative. Consider Bush's convention speech and more recently, the debates. In both cases, Bush communicated a message that included a belief in small government, individual enterprise, and an outsider's approach to Washington. His actual positions hardly reflect these themes. 

 Bush's "bold tax cut" is riddled with problems. First, it is years behind the cutting edge of tax-cut mania. Now the flat tax is in vogue. Hate to break it to you George, but Reagan broke the ice with tax cuts 20 years ago. Not only is Bush's tax cut puny, but its small size makes Bush unworthy to assume the rhetorical mantle of Reagan, as even Gore has a tax cut proposal. It is the positive equivalent of a slap on the wrist. 

 Bush's Social Security proposal is even more demented. He extols the values of privatization but only supports a partial privatization. Bush brags that even though Social Security is the untouchable third rail of American politics, you have to touch it to fix it. But what sort of a repairman leaves a job half done? Furthermore, Bush affirms that while he will return money to the people, he will also tell them how to spend it. What ever happened to "trusting the people?" One sees the same pattern with other issues like education. Bush claims to believe in local control, but his platform removes the 1996 plank that would eliminate the Department of Education and asks for increased education spending. 

 Faced with the above facts, I am voting for Pat Buchanan. Unlike most timid conservatives, I am unencumbered by the "a vote for a third party is a vote for Gore" crotch for several reasons. One, there comes a time when one must protest a party that ignores conservatives three election cycles in a row, especially when the differences between the two major parties are only superficial. Two, a vote for Pat Buchanan and his Buchananized Reform Party will create a conservative watchdog party that will exert external pressure on Republican moderates. 

 Buchanan, in contrast to Bush, is "unapologetically" pro-life and has explicitly stated that he will only appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court. Considering that three out of four Bush appointees to the Texas Supreme Court upheld abortion rights, I do not buy the argument that Bush will likely appoint pro-life justices since he has refused to evaluate Supreme Court nominees based on the views concerning abortion. Moreover, Buchanan does not need to chum with Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell to confirm his credentials as a conservative: he has an impeccable record on what he calls the "culture war" (critiquing an amoral culture, opposing gay marriage, etc.) and is extremely conservative on fiscal issues. He supports a trillion dollar tax cut in the form of a flat tax and would abolish the Department of Education. Moreover, Buchanan demonstrates political courage in single-handedly taking on the whole conservative establishment in his outspoken opposition to globalism. If Ralph Nader is a "citizen in full," then Pat Buchanan is a patriot in full. He calls for putting "America First" and worries that supporters of illegal immigration, free trade and interventionism are betraying American workers and selling out America to "some godless New World Order." 

 And of course, unlike Bush, Buchanan can even speak in complete sentences. In fact, very good sentences -- his rhetorical skills are rivaled in this century only by Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy. Furthermore, his 30 years of experience in Washington, both as a close presidential advisor to Nixon and Reagan and as a columnist, make him the most qualified individual running for president. As he puts it, he was attending presidential summits while Gore and Bush were in college (or even more to the point, while Bush was sniffing cocaine, Buchanan was writing speeches like the "Silent Majority speech"). He has also proven himself as a candidate. In 1992, he ran as the personification of the conservative backlash against Bush's tax hikes. In 1996, he ran as a full-fledged candidate, winning several primaries, including the New Hampshire primary, and coming in second to Bob Dole overall -- in spite of an antagonistic Republican establishment, Steve Forbes' millions and other conservative challengers like Alan Keyes. 

 Most conservatives care more about winning this year then about reaffirming conservatism. Consquently, Buchanan has stagnated at 1 percent. No major conservative figure has defended him and most of the rank and file conservatives turn a blind eye to his candidacy. No one will stand up for him. Today I feel honored that I have the opportunity to vote for him and will be proud of my decision decades from now.

 QUIET gains were made by a subdued Australian share market yesterday, ahead of today's Melbourne Cup and the US presidential election. 

 Share price rises in News Corp, AMP, Telstra and Publishing & Broadcasting contributed to the all ordinaries index closing 12.5 points higher at 3279.0. 

 Baker Young associate director Mark Potter said despite light trade the market had a "reasonable" day. 

 "We saw some more strength in the financials, but the resources were a bit mixed. The telcos are an improving area after being bashed throughout September and October." 

 "The US election is going to keep investors on the sideline until we get a result there," Mr Potter said. 

 AMP led the insurance sector higher, its share price up 20c to $17.70, while QBE added 17c to close at $9.17. 

 The banking sector continued to perform solidly as investors were attracted to its high-yielding profile and positive outlook. 

 Commonwealth Bank of Australia climbed 27c to finish at $29.85 while Westpac, ANZ and St George also posted gains. 

 Mr Potter said telco majors Telstra and Telecom NZ had also performed well. 

 "A lot of money is going back into those safety havens again," he said. 

 Telstra closed up 11c at $6.47, Hutchison added 8c to $2.83 and Telecom NZ was up 13c at $4.46. 

 Publisher John Fairfax Holdings tumbled almost 5 per cent yesterday as analysts cut their profit forecasts following Friday's warning. The share price lost 20c to $4.03, following Friday's 22.5c decline. 

 Emerging biotechnology company Peptech gained 11c to $1.02. 

 "There are strong rumors of a royalty deal between Peptech and major German pharmaceutical group BASF, to be announced shortly, relating to a drug for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease," Mr Potter said. 

 Meanwhile, the Australian dollar also experienced a lift, closing at US52.78c from the previous close of US52.34c.

It was a pre-election rally for the blue chips, but a sell-off among the big tech stocks pushed the NASDAQ in the red. With George W. Bush slightly ahead in most polls, some investors bought stocks they think would do well under a Bush presidency.  Microsoft rallied nearly 2 percent on the hope that Bush would be gentler to  Microsoft and wouldn't force a software giant to break up. Pharmaceutical companies, including Merck,  Eli Lilly and  Pfizer, all rallied. Investors bet they would benefit from fewer price restrictions under a Bush White House.

 NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market opened weaker on Tuesday, though signs of life were emerging in the investment-grade primary market, with several companies hoping to raise cash. 

 In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between corporate bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, weakened about one basis point, while high-yield, or junk, bond prices fell about one-half point, traders said. 

 AT&T, LEVEL 3 WEAKEN 

 Traders said AT&T Corp.'s debt weakened marginally, one day after Standard & Poor's cut its long-and short-term ratings two and one notches each, to "A" and "A-1." Cuts were expected. 

 Level 3 Communications Inc.'s junk-rated notes fell about two points after the telecommunications provider's chief executive said in a letter to stockholders he remains "very comfortable" with the company's $320 million fourth quarter revenue estimate. 

 The Broomfield, Colo.-based company's 9.125 percent notes maturing in 2008 were bid at about 75 cents on the dollar, while its 11 percent notes maturing the same year were bid around 85 cents on the dollar, traders said. 

 Meanwhile, PSINet Inc.'s notes extended a recovery less than one week after the Internet access and Web-hosting services company issued its second profit warning in two months and warned of cash-flow problems. Its 10.5 percent notes maturing in 2006 were bid Tuesday at about 39 cents on the dollar, up from about 33 cents at their trough last week. 

 UNITED WE FALL, DIVIDED WE RISE 

 With voting for the U.S. presidential and congressional elections under way, many investment banks and economists have been weighing in on how bond markets and investors will react to various election scenarios. 

 A Republican sweep of the White House and Congress, they said, could trigger deep tax cuts, leading to a cut in the U.S. budget surplus, a need for the government to sell more debt or retire less, and lower bond prices. 

 A Democratic sweep, they said, could trigger smaller tax cuts but more spending, leading to a cut in the U.S. budget surplus, a need for the government to sell more debt or retire less, and lower bond prices. 

 Divided government, which has existed in the United States for all but two of the last 20 years, would make it harder for either party to fully enact its economic plans, perhaps putting less pressure on the surplus. 

 As UBS Warburg LLC put it in a new report, "the more control the winner achieves of Congress, the greater will be the reaction." 

 MORE SUPPLY 

 Investment-grade bond sales on the forward calendar come from Consumers Energy , $250 million; Energy East Corp. , $500 million; Motorola Inc. , $1 billion, Navistar Financial Securities Corp. , $400 million, and NiSource Finance Corp. , $2 billion. 

 Junk bond sales are expected from Hercules Inc. , $375 million; Resolution Performance Products LLC, $150 million, and TravelCenters of America Inc., $200 million. 

 Ten-and 30-year Treasuries rose 1/32 and 2/32, respectively. Their yields were 5.840 and 5.881 percent.

And this additional testament today for the virtues of critical thinking, courtesy of the California Voter Foundation. The non-profit, non-partisan group sent out an e-mail today warning folks to beware of last-minute political disinformation via the Internet as the election looms. The foundation said it's worried about one mass e-mailing in particular, one that warns recipients that due to high projected voter turnout, the election will be spread out over several days, with Democrats voting Tuesday, Republicans Wednesday. In case you run into Homer Simpson today, tell him it's not true.

 The internet's naming system is about to be overhauled by a tiny non-profit-making private firm almost unknown beyond its Californian home. 

 Icann -- the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names & Numbers --will publish a report on Wednesday on bids to create new domain name suffixes to join dot.com, dot.net and dot.org as top-level domains, or TLDs. A final decision on which names will be allowed to become part of the internet will be made by Icann's board on 16 November. 

 Icann's 12 employees have received 45 applications to suggest and run the new TLDs, each enclosing the required non-returnable fee of $50,000. 

 These include the World Heath Organisation's proposal of a dot.health suffix and a rash of firms wanting to institute dot.sex and dot.xxx names. Bidders range from Net giants such as Lycos to a consortium of museums. Decisions on who gets to re-name the Net, and how, will be taken by Icann's board. It is chaired by former reporter and securities analyst Esther Dyson, now a venture capitalist named by Fortune magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in the US. She will need all her influence and experience to keep the world's technology firms happy. 

 Certainly not everyone is content with Icann's power. Michael Froomkin, a professor at the Miami School of Law, says the US Department of Commerce could be using Icann's private status to prevent scrutiny of its decisions. Icann insists it is independent and unbiased, but many European registries have protested against the fees it levies. 

 Yet beyond legal academia and the Net registration business, Icann's decisions have so far met with almost blanket apathy. An internet election to Icann's board saw the winning European candidate -- German former hacker Andy Mller-Maguhn -- triumph with just 5,948 votes. The African candidate polled 130 votes. 

 If a tiny, self-selecting turnout from the many millions who use the internet worldwide did not lead to a distorted election, campaigning by Der Spiegel magazine and Die Zeit newspaper for German citizens to register to vote certainly did. 

 Icann's chief financial and policy director Andrew McLaughlin said the organisation was concerned by the way the election worked and future votes would be run differently. 

 But he insisted: "Icann is vastly more transparent than any similar organisation you can name." 

 With the creation of a new tranche of names the stakes are getting higher and uncertainty about Icann's role and its rules is becoming commercially significant. It has faced legal claims regarding its right to institute dot.biz and dot.web domains. The announcement of the successful bids is likely to see more lawyers' letters arriving in California. Virtual Internet, an Aim-listed British domain name firm, wants to launch dot.pro as a unique suffix for professionals. Accountants, medics and lawyers accredited by their trade organisations would qualify. 

 Chief operating officer Tom Turcan said: "It's about making it easier for people to find the companies or individuals they are looking for." Virtual Internet is bidding in a joint venture with US naming firm Register.com as RegistryPro. 

 A consortium including Lycos, SK Telecom, 7DC of Korea and OnlineNIC of China is also bidding for the dot.pro suffix. Even if Virtual Internet triumphs, it does not know what strings will be attached. Turcan admitted he had no idea whether Icann would demand that dot.pro be opened up to the entire world at once or if trademark holders would have first refusal. 

 Turcan could not give any timetable or budget for the project and acknowledged that RegistryPro had no formal links with trade bodies. Third parties would be invited into RegistryPro if costs grew too great but Turcan admitted Virtual Internet could yet withdraw its application. While Virtual Internet has fought back from a June profit warning to post a 355 percent increase in turnover for nine months to July against the same period in 1999, investors will be keen to know just how much RegistryPro will cost to establish. 

 Much hangs not only on Icann's awards of contracts to run new names but its regulation of the winners. Dyson's position as one of America's most powerful women seems assured. Icann's status as an anonymous part of a consensus administration, however, looks more vulnerable.

 PSINet drags telecoms down.

 Internet access group PSINet has had a rough ride on the U.S. corporate bond market, taking telecoms down, but in general spreads inched in early. Nancy Leinfuss in New York reports. 

 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market opened Friday's session mixed in light trading while the spotlight shifted to new supply, traders said. 

 "We opened up a tad wider in front of the numbers but then we came back in and even traded a few tighter," said one high-grade trader, referring to Friday morning's jobs data 

 The U.S. Labour Department said the U.S. unemployment rate held at 3.9 percent in October while average hourly earnings, a gauge of wage-level inflationary pressures, rose by 0.4 percent. Non-farm payrolls increased by 137,000 in October. 

 Spreads to U.S. Treasuries were quoted one to two basis points tighter across the board in light volume, while junk bond prices were quoted flat, with the exception of telecoms issues, which weakened by 1/2 point, traders said. 

 "There's a bit of a negative tone in the market, but for the most part it's been quiet," one trader said. "Telecoms are under pressure, people are still focused on PSINet which has been very volatile," he added. 

 PSINET 

 PSINet Inc.'s bonds sank after the Internet access and Web-hosting service provider reported a big loss, cut its outlook and said it was mulling its options on Thursday. 

 The company's bonds fell by about one-third after the company issued its second profit warning in two months. It lost $1.4 billion in the third quarter, largely because of writedowns. Its 10.5 percent notes maturing in December 2006 which were bid at between 32 cents and 34 cents on the dollar, down about 17 cents from Wednesday. PSINet sold them last Nov. 24 at 100. 

 The Ashburn, Va.-based company said cash on hand slipped to $1 billion at the end of the third quarter from $1.5 billion at the end of June, and added that Chief Operating Officer Harold (Pete) Wills resigned as part of a management reorganization. 

 PSINet warned that fourth-quarter results would be worse than previously expected, with company executives citing slowdowns in its Internet access and consulting businesses. 

 DEBT SALES 

 Two companies sold debt Friday morning. 

 Allegheny Energy Inc. sold $135 million in debt in a reopening of an existing issue, said lead manager Goldman Sachs on Friday. The firm issued 7.75 percent in A3/A rated five-year notes at a spread of 170 basis points. 

 In addition, fiber optic maker Corning Inc. said on Friday it had priced its 30 million share offering of common stock at $71.25 per share. Underwriters of the offering were granted an overallotment option of up to 4.5 million of Corning shares. 

 Corning also said it had priced the offering of approximately $2.7 billion in convertible debentures due Nov. 8, 2015 at an initial price of $741.923 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. 

 Combined net proceeds of the two offerings will result in about $4.1 billion for Corning. The company plans to use a portion of the proceeds to fund the purchase of up to $3.6 billion previously announced acquisition of Pirelli S.p.A.'s 90 percent interest in Optical Technologies USA Corp. 

 Both offerings were underwritten and lead-managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

 UPCOMING HIGH-GRADE DEALS 

 Southern California Edison will sell $1.35 billion of a two-part debt sale as early as Friday, dealers said. The private sale is expected to include about $1 billion of three-year fixed-rate notes and $350 million of one year floating-rate notes, dealers said. 

 Chase Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc. are arranging both sales, market sources said. 

 NiSource Inc. , a Merrillville, Ind.-based utility company, also plans to privately sell $2 billion to $2.5 billion of debt next week via Credit Suisse First Boston, market sources said. The firm completed its merger with Columbia Energy Group eight months after the $6 billion combination was first announced. 

 HIGH-YIELD ISSUES 

 Two deals remain on the calendar for this week's business: CanWest Media Inc. , C$800 million equivalent (US$523 million) and Grohe Holdings GmbH, 200 million euros ($172 million), dealers said. 

 Meanwhile, for the latest measured week, the sector saw investors pull $69.1 million cash from U.S. junk bond mutual funds, said sources citing AMG Data Services.

Stocks close mixed in selective buying

NEW YORK - Buyers moved selectively back into the stock market Thursday, snapping up financial and technology issues after Wednesday's dip. Selling in basic materials and retailing stocks left the overall market mixed.

The Nasdaq composite index rose 95.63 to 3,429.02, while the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 18.96 at 10,880.51.

The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 7.10 to 1,428.32.

The market seemed in search of a direction a day after the Dow and Nasdaq fell on a mix of profit-taking and a profit warning by WorldCom. Tech issues led the gainers, with Intel up $1.81 at $46.69 and Sun Microsystems rising $3.19 to $109.06.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.38 billion shares, compared with 1.43 billion on Wednesday.

The Russell 2000 index rose 11.79 to 506.97.

-- Oracle Corp. stock tumbles in wild trading

SAN FRANCISCO - Oracle Corp.'s stock plunged in wild trading Thursday before the world's second largest computer software company denied speculation that its respected chief financial officer, Jeff Henley, was leaving.

When the Redwood Citybased database software company called the speculation ''totally unfounded,'' shares rebounded somewhat, though ended the day at $29.56, down $1.81, or 6 percent.

Nearly 148 million shares of Oracle traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, which confirmed that at least one trade was voided but would not say why. In that trade, shares were priced at $22.25, or about $10 below the opening price.

Excluding that trade, Oracle's low point for the day was $27.25.

Oracle has been the target of frequent rumors in recent months, reflecting the high anxiety about tech stocks. In early October, the stock plunged by 12 percent on unsubstantiated rumors that a once-bullish analyst was about to downgrade the shares.

-- Priceline.com laying off 16 percent of work force

NORWALK, Conn. - Priceline.com, the Internet-based, name-your-own-price system for travel and other services, is cutting 16 percent of its work force and said that chief financial officer Heidi G. Miller is leaving after only eight months on the job.

The Norwalk-based company made these announcements in conjunction with its thirdquarter earnings report, in which it reported a loss of one cent per share. The results met lowered analyst expectations.

After closing at $6.84, up 65.6 cents, in regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of Priceline slipped to $5.19 during the after-hours session.

Priceline said it was laying off 87 people from its 535-member work force. The layoffs and other changes would result in a fourth-quarter charge of about $9 million.

The company also said Miller was leaving to ''pursue opportunities and apply her talents in a more established business environment.'' Bob Mylod, the senior vice president of finance, will replace her.

Miller joined the company earlier this year, leaving behind the CFO slot at banking giant Citigroup.

-- Aon Corp. plans to cut 3,000 jobs in next year

CHICAGO - Insurance underwriter Aon Corp. plans to cut 3,000 jobs in the next year to improve efficiency, officials said Thursday as they announced slightly higher thirdquarter earnings.

The cuts represent about 6 percent of Aon's work force and are mostly expected in the company's Insurance Brokerage subsidiary.

''As I've said many times, we are not an efficient business currently,'' chairman and CEO Patrick Ryan said during a teleconference with investors and analysts.

Ryan said that was due partly to rapid growth and acquisitions the company has made in the last year - moves he said will require the company to restructure and eliminate duplication of effort in the next five quarters.

Shares of Aon closed down $7.44, or 18 percent, to $33.19 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Aon, which is based in Chicago, currently employs about 50,000 people worldwide.

-- More United trouble: mechanics end talks

CHICAGO - Mechanics at United Airlines suspended contract talks Thursday, saying they want more senior company officials involved.

''Until this company gets serious and places officials at the bargaining table who are able to complete these negotiations, we're wasting our time here,'' said Scotty Ford, lead negotiator for the union representing 15,000 United Airlines mechanics.

Thursday's action by mechanics for the Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based airline renews the threat of more labor unrest at the world's largest carrier. A standoff with United pilots led to a summer of thousands of flight cancellations and delays.

The pilots reached a contract agreement with United in late August which ended the worst of United's flight turmoil. The airline's delays, though improved, continue to be the longest in the industry.

Buyers moved selectively back into the stock market Thursday, snapping up financial and technology issues after Wednesday's dip. Selling in basic materials and retailing stocks left the overall market mixed.

The Nasdaq composite index rose 95.63 to 3,429.02, while the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 18.96 at 10,880.51.

JACKSON, MISS.  

Shares of WorldCom slid to the lowest level in nearly two years as it joined AT&T in disclosing even more weakness in long distance, an ailing business they both hope to conceal by creating a separate tracking stock.  

The latest in a series of profit warnings from the top long-distance carriers came as WorldCom detailed its widely expected plan to segregate its healthier business-related operations from its struggling MCI-brand calling and Web access operations.  

The new tracking stock, which will pay a dividend, is expected to be distributed to WorldCom shareholders during the first half of 2001. The tracker will be called MCI and trade under the symbol MCIT.  

The announcements Wednesday by WorldCom were strikingly similar to those made just a week ago by AT&T, which also slashed its profit forecasts again as it unveiled similar plans to issue a tracking stock to represent its consumer business.  

But unlike AT&T, which insisted that its plan to break into four companies didn't mark a sudden reversal in strategy, WorldCom said it is trying to rectify some strategic mistakes.  

"One of the things that WorldCom has suffered with over the last little while is our perception in the market place of not knowing where we're headed," said Bernie Ebbers, president and chief executive.  

But, he added, "There is potential and opportunity to go back to where we were, and that's the reason we've done what we've done."  

Analysts, stung by the company's missed forecasts, were encouraged by the new plan, but remained leery.  

WorldCom's stock took another plunge after Wednesday's announcements, sliding $4.81 a share to $18.94 in heavy Nasdaq trading, a loss of 20 percent.  

WorldCom's sharp reduction in profit forecasts on Wednesday was "well beyond what (Wall Street) had been expecting," said David Burks, an industry analyst with J.J.B. Hilliard W.L. Lyons in Louisville, Ky.  

WorldCom, like AT&T and Sprint, has been battered by long-distance price wars and new competition from wireless phones and technology that enable calls to be placed over the Internet.  

Analysts said WorldCom is hoping to contain that weakness within the new tracking stock so it won't tarnish the financial performance of the company's more profitable business of transporting data for companies.  

"Investors tend to have a short investment horizon and when you have short revenue growth, investors will exit," said Drake Johnstone, an analyst with Davenport & Co. in Richmond, Va.

 Nov. 1-MAR-By Nicola Clark, BridgeNews Paris-Nov. 1-The CAC-40 recovered from a mid-afternoon dip to close marginally higher Wednesday as gains by several key old-and new-economy titles 

 were offset by sales of index heavyweight France Telecom SA after a fourth-quarter profit warning from U.S. fixed-line operator WorldCom Inc. The benchmark index ended up 0.18% at 6,409.05 points, its first close above 6,400 in a month. 

 * * * Volume was average, despite the All Saints Day holiday. Just over 3.5 billion euros worth of CAC-listed shares changed hands, with advancing shares outpacing decliners 23 to 15 and two ending unchanged. France Telecom ended 1% lower at 122.00 euros, off a mid-afternoon low of 118.60 euros hit after WorldCom said its fourth-quarter profits are likely to be between just 34-37 U.S. cents a share, down sharply from analysts' forecasts 

 of around 49 cents. WorldCom cited competitive price pressure, the strong dollar and consumer preference for wireless communication. France Telecom, despite its rapid expansion into wireless, still derives most of its revenues fro1/2 fixed-line services, an area where French regulators are also trying to force down rates and foster more competition. Meanwhile, telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel SA trimmed earlier losses to finish just a touch lower (-0.3%) at 71.70 euros. The group's shares were thrown on the defensive in the morning after analysts at Goldman Sachs sharply lowered their price target on the share Wednesday to 85.00 euros from 110.00 euros on expectations that sales will slow in the short term, despite continued strong fundamentals. Media-to-water conglomerate Vivendi SA and its pay TV subsidiary Canal Plus SA advanced, given a lift by the news of the online music deal between Germany's Bertelsmann and U.S. Internet file-sharing group Napster. Both French groups are set to merge with Canada's Seagram Co. Ltd.-owners of Universal Music-before the end of this year and themselves have plans to market and sell music online. Vivendi shares climbed 2.1% to 86.50 euros, while Canal Plus added 1.9% to 173.70 euros. Semiconductor maker STMicroelectronics NV also gained ground, adding 0.9% at 60.00 euros and IT services/management consultants Cap Gemini Ernst & Young finished as one of the CAC's best performers, gaining 2.6% to 192.90 euros. Cap Gemini announced Wednesday that it has launched a new joint venture with Cisco Systems of the U.S. as part of an alliance formed earlier this year. Among traditional shares, auto maker Renault SA extended Tuesday's gains to close 2.2% higher at 59.90 euros, while energy giant TotalFinaElf SA rose 1.4% to 171.00 euros. Supermarket retailer Carrefour SA added 1.8% to 81.5o euros and defense-to-communications group Lagardere SA climbed 2.7% to 68.70 euros. End Copyright 2000 Bridge Information Systems Inc.

 WorldCom Issues  Profit , Revenue  Warning , Announces Creation of Tracking Stock

 CLINTON, Miss. -- WorldCom Inc. lowered its revenue and earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2000 and full year 2001, citing continued competitive pressures, increased spending and other economic factors. 

 Investors weren't pleased with the news. At 4 p.m. EST  on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of WorldCom (WCOM) tumbled $4.81, or 20%, to $18.94. 

 Also Wednesday, WorldCom, as expected, announced it will create a tracking stock for its slower-growth businesses and focus the core company on higher-growth sales of data services to business customers. 

 WorldCom, which traditionally has concentrated on the business market, will separate its consumer-focused businesses into a separate tracking stock sometime early next year. The tracking stock will bear the "MCI" name and will include WorldCom's consumer long-distance, wholesale and Internet dial-up businesses, the company said. It will trade under the symbol MCIT. 

 WorldCom's existing stock will represent the company's high-growth data, Internet, Web hosting and international businesses. 

 WorldCom's restructuring is the telecommunications industry's second in a week. Last Wednesday, AT&T Corp. (T) announced its plans to break the company into four separate businesses, including a tracking stock for the consumer long-distance business. 

 Tracking stocks are designed to represent the results of a unit without actually owning the underlying assets of the operation. 

 Both companies are feeling severe pricing pressure from falling long-distance prices and fierce competition from the regional Bell-telephone companies. While the consumer business is considered a cash cow for both WorldCom and AT&T, it also is a slow-growth business that doesn't produce the kinds of returns that sales of data and Internet services bear. 

 In its profit warning, WorldCom said it now projects fourth-quarter consolidated cash earnings -- defined as earnings excluding acquisition-related expenses -- of between 34 cents and 37 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting fourth-quarter earnings from operations of of 49 cents a share. 

 The company also forecasts full-year 2001 consolidated cash earnings of between $1.55 and $1.65 a share, compared with analysts' estimate of $2.13 a share. WorldCom said the 2001 estimate includes the impact of the Intermedia/Digex transaction. In September, WorldCom agreed to acquire Intermedia Communications Inc., a Tampa, Fla., competitive local exchange carrier, for nearly $3 billion in a deal that gives WorldCom Intermedia's 55% equity interest in Digex Inc. (DIGX), a Beltsville, Md., Web-hosting concern. 

 WorldCom said its earnings are being hurt by increased spending on growth initiatives such as Web hosting and Internet-based virtual private networks, as well as lower revenue-growth expectations and increased employee spending. 

 The company expects revenue growth of between 7% and 9% for the fourth quarter. Under its new tracking-stock reporting format, the company said it anticipates revenue from its MCI business to remain flat, while its core WorldCom business is expected to post revenue growth of 12% to 14%. 

 WorldCom expects consolidated revenue for the full year 2001 to grow at the same 7%-to-9% rate, with MCI revenue remaining flat or declining by up to 2% and WorldCom revenue climbing 12% to 15% for the year. 

 The company anticipates compound annualized revenue growth of 14% to 16% through 2005. 

 WorldCom said "intense" pricing pressures, unfavorable foreign-exchange rates and consumer shifts to wireless technologies are hurting revenue growth. 

 Under the tracking-stock plan, which has been approved by WorldCom's board, WorldCom shareholders will receive one MCI share for each 25 shares of WorldCom held "immediately prior to the tracking stock distribution WorldCom currently has about 2.87 billion shares outstanding. 

 Bernard J. Ebbers will remain WorldCom's president and chief executive, while Scott Sullivan will remain the company's chief financial officer. MCI's management team, which will report to Mr. Ebbers, will be named in the coming weeks. The WorldCom board will govern the activities of both WorldCom and MCI. 

 The company said the MCI stock will initially pay a quarterly cash dividend of about $75 million, or $300 million a year, and will initially be allocated $6 billion in debt. WorldCom's remaining debt of about $17 billion will be allocated to the WorldCom stock. 

 WorldCom expects to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission before the end of 2000. The company will hold a shareholder meeting to vote on the plan in the first half of 2001, and distribute the MCI stock shortly thereafter. No regulatory approvals are expected to be required.

Better drug for ADHD



Good news for kids with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD): The Food and Drug Administration has approved a once-daily
drug--Concerta--to treat ADHD. Concerta contains the same active
ingredient found in Ritalin but in a form that lasts 12 hours.



"Many kids with ADHD must take Ritalin three or four times a day, but
since Concerta lasts longer, they won't need to take a d rug at school,"
says Peter Jaksa, Ph. D., president of the National Attention Deficit
Disorder Association. Concerta may also eliminate the behavioral peaks
and valleys many children experience with the shorter-acting Ritalin.

germ protection.

Urine becomes an odorless gel in the leakproof bag. A pack of four is
$7.99; go to
www.WhenNatureCalls.com, or call 888-924-6665.



Tooth paste can damage teeth!



Too much fluoride can discolor kids' teeth, but you won't see the
damage for years. A child who overdoes fluoride during the preschool
years--when tooth enamel is forming--can end up with white or brown
flecks on his permanent teeth, according to David G. Pendrys, D.D.S.,
associate professor of dentistry at the University of Connecticut Health
Center in Farmington.



To keep your child's teeth white:



* Supervise brushing, and make sure only a pea-size amount of
toothpaste is used.



* Encourage him to spit out, not swallow, the toothpaste, and watch
for him to do it.



* Avoid flavored toothpaste, such as bubblegum or cherry, which might
encourage swallowing.



--Patricia Curtis



LEAVE YOUR KIDS ALONE!



Encouraging your child with comments and suggestions while he plays
may not benefit him, according to a new study. "We were shocked to find
that the more involved the parent was in her child's play, the less
creative the child became," says Dale Grubb, Ph.D., associate professor
of psychology at Baldwin-Wallace College near Cleveland. One reason:
"Parents often equate support with direction, and kids who are too
directed when they're trying to create something may worry that they'll
make a mistake and disappoint Mom," explains Grubb. "As a result, they
become afraid to take creative risks."



Provide imagination-sparking materials such as modeling clay, and skip
the "helpful" suggestions. Instead, ask "What can you make with this?"



EASIEST COSTUMES EVER!



Turn your kid into a werewolf, tiger, or alien in an instant with
reusable stick-on Magic Masks. They combine the look and safety of face
painting with the ease of traditional masks. Available at Kmart for
under $5.

MOTHERS & SHAKERS: They teach girls how to fight



In response to a series of local sexual assaults, Peggy Barrett, 52,
and Deborah Weaver, 44, of Cambridge, MA, created LEAP (Lifetime
Empowerment Awareness Program) to teach girls ages 8 to 14 basic
self-defense and safety skills. The free classes, which pair college
students as mentors to younger girls, are also intended to increase
girls' confidence. "We wanted to give girls a sense of their own
personal power," says Weaver. For more information, write to: Girls'
LEAP, 15 Perry St., Cambridge, MA 02189.

down? Use your stereo! Don Campbell, author of The Mozart Effect for
Children, says these Mozart tunes work best:

How to raise an HONEST CHILD



Catch her fibbing? Try these truth-provoking tactics from Sal Severe,
Ph.D., author of How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too!



1 If you catch your child in a lie, tell her she has 15 minutes to
think about it. This gives her time to reflect and come clean on her
own.



2 Instead of lecturing, challenge your child to come up with reasons
why dishonesty is wrong. This helps kids internalize values rather than
just parrot them back.



3 "Be honest yourself," says Severe. "Fess up immediately if your kids
catch you in a lie, and let them know that you're working on being
honest even when it's hard, just like they are."

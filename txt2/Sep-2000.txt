After warning that its third-quarter profits would fall short of Wall Street expectations, DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler side said it will not meet a $2 billion cost-cutting target this year. The automaker said Thursday that 2000 profit-sharing payments for 92,000 U.S. workers will not come close to last year's record payouts that averaged $8,100. That news came a day after the German-American company warned that its Chrysler unit would report a loss of about $531 million for the current quarter, in contrast to a profit of $880 million last year.

Lowly loonie valued at 66.51 cents US; Analysts point to speculators, foreign bondholders, U.S. election fever for slide

Toronto -- That's the lowest in four months as the loonie closed at 66.43 cents US on May 30. In mid-May, it had plummeted 1.1 cents over one five-day period and closed at 66.19 on May 24 -- its lowest point in 10 months.  

Analysts are pointing to speculators, foreign bondholders and U.S. election fever for the Canadian currency slide.  

But, "truth be told, there's no particular reason for the Canadian dollar to have tumbled this week," says Avery Shenfeld, senior economist and currency specialist at CIBC World Markets.  

"It's simply a matter of fact that it's been weak for the past month or so."  

The Canadian dollar, still known inaccurately as a commodity-based currency, was joined by the Australian and New Zealand dollars in declining in the last few days, as base metal and oil prices weakened.  

"A more important question is, why has the Canadian dollar been so weak this year?" Shenfeld said. "That goes back largely to the fact we borrowed a lot from the rest of the world five or 10 years ago and, as those bonds mature, the foreign holders are converting the proceeds back into their home currencies -- U.S. dollars, euros or yen.  

"With Canadian interest rates below those in the U.S., they're not inclined to buy new Canadian bonds with the money."  

In the first half of the year, Shenfeld said, there was at least a $10 billion reduction in foreign holdings of Canadian bonds.  

On the markets yesterday, key technology issues slumped again after a profit warning from Apple Computer.  

The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index slipped 53.96, or 0.52 per cent, to 10,377.92 -- 1,011 points below the all-time high reached Sept 1. That's an 8.9 per cent drop since that big day.  

Market leader Nortel Networks dropped $3.70 to $90.35, for a loss of $29.90, or 25 per cent, in September. But wireless device maker Research In Motion, boosted by investors' faith in its BlackBerry pager, leaped $24.50 to $149.  

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92, nearly wiping out a 196-point gain of the day before. The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.5 to 3,672.82 and the Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51.  

The western-based Canadian Venture Exchange gained 19.87 points to 3,565.25, up 19.87 points but down about 40 on the week.  

On the loonie's decline, Shenfeld described as "small potatoes" the Bank of Canada's decision this week to buy an unstated quantity of euros to help prop up the European currency. But speculators did fuel the fire when the Canadian currency began to struggle.  

"I don't think we're going to get appreciably weaker than this, because there is no real motivating factor right now for foreigners to sell Canadian dollars," Shenfeld said.  

"But it's going to be a while before the Canadian dollar is, by any historical standards, anything but weak."  

A low dollar is a plus for exporters, but a negative for Canadians every time they buy an imported product or shop outside the country.  

Twelve of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The oil and gas sector was the biggest gainer, up 1.93 per cent. The industrial products group, containing Nortel, was the biggest decliner, falling 2.26 per cent.  

Advancers outnumbered decliners 583 to 507, with 302 unchanged in trading of 123.7 million shares worth $2.93 billion. The TSE 100 fell 4.32 to 646.74.  

In New York, stocks fell sharply after Apple's earnings warning revived anxiety about corporate profits.  

During a volatile month, stocks failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies, including Apple and Intel, warned that their profit reports would disappoint.  

The market got a brief respite Thursday, but Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75 US, a nearly 52 per cent loss.  

Gateway fell $9.04 to $47, Hewlett Packard was off $9.13 at $97, Lucent slipped $1.19 to $30.56 and chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56.  

An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2.69 to $41.31. But many other old-economy stocks appeared less affected by the Apple announcement. Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $6.79 to $63.50 on rumours it might be the latest financial services company to be acquired.  

Among the most active CDNX companies, Qnetix Inc. rose 13 cents to 28 cents, Unique Broadband 37 cents to $3.43; Aqua-Pure Ventures fell 10 cents to 30 cents, Hilton Petroleum 10 cents to 30 cents.

 US stocks are spoiled by one bad Apple.

 US STOCKS gave up over half of Thursday's 195-point gain, largely as a result of computer manufacturer Apple's profits warning. 

 Apple issued the warning late on Thursday, and it had an effect similar to that of Intel last week. The difference is that last Friday the market recovered and closed up. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 101.97 points, or 0.94 per cent, to 10,721.28. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 14 points, or 1 percent, to 1,444. 

 Apple warned of weaker sales and earnings, and this spurred skittish investors to dump technology shares. Shares lost half their value. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index and high-tech blue chip shares both slid on the news from Apple, the latest in a raft of companies to lower earnings expectations. 

 Apple's warning helped burst Thursday's bubble of euphoria when Wall Street celebrated consumer products giant Procter & Gamble's disclosure that it stood by its financial outlook for fiscal 2001. 

 The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 72 points, or 1.91 percent, at 3,706. 

 Apple said late on Thursday fourth-quarter earnings would fall as much as 33 per cent below expectations because of slower-than-expected sales in September. 

 Apple shares tumbled 27-9/16 to 25-15/16 after plunging to a 14-month trough of 25-7/8, dragging down other tech stocks with them. 

 Computer hardware makers were sharply down, with the American Stock Exchange's computer hardware index losing a whopping 12.91 percent. 

 Meanwhile, the blue-chip Dow was plagued by losses in its technology components like Hewlett-Packard, which slumped 8-3/4 to 98-1/8, chopping nearly 50 points of the index. 

 Bryan Piskorowski at Prudential Securities said: "It's just a confirmation that we're not through pre-announcement season just yet, and as more negative news hits the tape, it's casting a pall over trading in general." 

Profit jitters shook other sectors as well. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, the world's largest airline, made a profits warning. UAL stock slumped by up to 7 percent, said it expects a third-quarter loss from flight cancellations, delays and higher costs for jet fuel and wages. 

 UAL stock fell 2-3/8 to 41-5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, exerting gravity's pull on other airline stocks as well. US Airways Group, which is being bought by UAL, was off 1-3/4 to 30-1/8. Delta Air Lines Inc. slipped 2-13/16 to 43-3/8. 

 Oil services shares provided one pocket of strength. The American Stock Exchange's oil index rose 1.03 percent. 

 Trading conditions were choppy, with Friday marking the last day of the third quarter, traders said. 

 "It's especially tough at the end of the quarter where fund managers are doing some window dressing and that seems to exaggerate some of the price movements," said Peter Gottlieb, vice president and portfolio manager at First Albany Asset Management. 

 "Window dressing" often occurs at the end of a quarter when money managers pack their portfolios with the quarter's winners and dump the losers, helping exaggerate the market's moves. 

 Wall Street reacted coolly to the latest personal income and spending data. The US Commerce Department reported personal income rose 0.4 percent in August versus July's 0.3 per cent gain, while spending rose 0.6 percent following a similar gain in July. Economists on average had predicted a 0.3 per cent rise in income and a 0.5 per cent gain in consumption. 

 US Treasuries rose on Friday as investors balancing their holdings ahead of month-and quarter-end bought longer-dated Treasuries that had been sold off earlier this month. 

 A steep slide in US equities also helped to boost shorter Treasuries following Apple's warning. Investors sometimes use easily-traded government securities as a safe haven to temporarily park their money when equities suffer steep drops. 

 Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capita, said: "The (Treasury) market has a fairly good tone to it again." 

 Wright said a combination of lower oil prices, a rebound in the dollar against the euro on the heels of the Danish No vote against the European common currency and month-and quarter-end buying were helping lift longer-dated Treasury prices. 

 "Some of the portfolio managers may need to do a little bit of (duration) extension buying ... to get themselves back to neutral," Wright said. 

 By lunchtime, 10-year Treasury notes were 10/32 higher at 99-24/32. Their yield fell to 5.78 per cent. 

 Thirty-year bonds were 11/32 higher at 105-13/32, yielding 5.86 per cent. Five-year notes rose 5/32 to 103-21/32, yielding 5.83 percent, while two-year notes were up 2/32 at 100-2/32, yielding 5.97 per cent. 

 Traders said shorter-dated Treasuries benefited from a lack of intervention on the euro's behalf on Friday by the world's industrial powers. A week ago, shorter Treasuries came under pressure when major central banks sold dollars and bought euros in a concerted intervention.

 US Treasuries up as stocks fall, quarter-end nigh.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries rose at midday on Friday as investors balancing their holdings ahead of month-and quarter-end bought longer-dated Treasuries that had been sold off earlier this month. 

 A steep slide in U.S. equities also helped to boost shorter Treasuries following an after-hours profit warning on Thursday from Apple Computer Inc.. Investors sometimes use easily-traded government securities as a safe haven to temporarily park their money when equities suffer steep drops. 

 "The (Treasury) market has a fairly good tone to it again," said Gemma Wright, director of market strategy at Barclays Capital. 

 Wright said a combination of lower oil prices, a rebound in the dollar against the euro on the heels of the Danish No vote against the European common currency and month-and quarter-end buying were helping lift longer-dated Treasury prices. 

 "Some of the portfolio managers may need to do a little bit of (duration) extension buying ... to get themselves back to neutral," Wright said. 

 Duration is a measure of a portfolio's sensitivity to underlying interest rates. 

 The market mostly ignored economic reports released on Friday morning, including a rise in the Chicago Association of Purchasing Management's September Midwest purchasing managers' index (PMI), which jumped to 51.4 in September. 

 The index was sharply higher than the consensus forecast of 48.5 and the 46.5 reading registered in the prior month. Readings below 50 suggest a contraction. 

 The prices paid component jumped to 66.7 from 58.6 in August, which analysts said was mostly a result of the recent surge in oil prices. 

 David Myers, fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities, said that the Chicago PMI suggested "we're going to have to wait and see with NAPM (on Monday) regarding what's happening in the economy right now" and muted some of the trading. 

 Earlier, the U.S. Commerce Department said August personal income rose by 0.4 percent, after a 0.3 percent rise in July, while spending rose 0.6 percent, matching July's rise. The numbers were 0.1 percentage point higher than average forecasts. The PCE price index was unchanged following a 0.2 percent rise in July, good for inflation-wary bonds. 

 By noon (1600 GMT) 10-year Treasury notes were 10/32 higher at 99-24/32. Their yield, which moves inversely to the price, fell to 5.78 percent. 

 Thirty-year bonds were 11/32 higher at 105-13/32, yielding 5.86 percent. Five-year notes rose 5/32 to 103-21/32, yielding 5.83 percent, while two-year notes were up 2/32 at 100-2/32, yielding 5.97 percent. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.2 percent at 10,690 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq index dropped more than 2 percent to 3,699. Apple Computer had lost more than 50 percent of its value at $26 a share. 

 Traders said shorter-dated Treasuries benefited from a lack of intervention on the euro's behalf on Friday by the world's industrial powers. A week ago, shorter Treasuries came under pressure when major central banks sold dollars and bought euros in a concerted intervention. 

 On Thursday Denmark voted against adopting the euro, dealing another blow to the currency that is down more than 25 percent against the dollar since its birth in January 1999. 

 Early on Friday, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Robert Parry said the Fed had exercised caution in the latest spate of interest rate hikes because it was highly uncertain about its economic forecasts. 

 The Fed last raised rates, by half a percentage point, to 6.50 percent in May. 

 The University of Michigan said its final September consumer sentiment index fell to 106.8 from 107.3 in August.

 Stock market blues? The fault may be in the stars.

 (Updates with final closing figures for the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 in the last two paragraphs) 

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - If your investments aren't turning in a stellar performance, the fault, dear Investor, may not be in the stocks you pick, but in the stars. 

 That's what financial advisers who use astrology, the study of how planetary positions influence life on earth, would have you think. 

 Financial astrologers chart the planets as well as stock prices and draw up horoscopes for individual companies and the New York Stock Exchange to gain an investing edge. 

 The NYSE, also known as the Big Board, was born May 17, 1792, under a buttonwood tree. Perhaps it's no accident that the world's largest and richest stock exchange was born under the astrological sign of Taurus, the bull. 

 So what should you be doing with your money, now that we have had the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in Mars? 

 "There is an October scare," says Henry Weingarten of The Astrologers Fund, Inc. "The market is not finished correcting. There is considerable risk." 

 But to find out ahead of time the exact date the stars say the market scare will be over, you must subscribe to Weingarten's weekly market newsletter on the Web (http://www.afund.com). 

 The heavens also augur an election-related rally soon, according to Robert Hitt, a financial astrologer who says futures traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange consult him. 

 WATCHING THE PLANETS ELECTRIC 

 "We have a powerful alignment of planets coming next week that is extremely energetic in political power," says Hitt. 

 Mars, Pluto and Jupiter are lining up in a T square at the same time the Federal Reserve meets on Tuesday to consider what to do about interest rates. Later in the day, the schedule calls for the first televised presidential debate pitting the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, against the Democratic contender, Vice President Al Gore. 

 If the rally isn't strong enough to resolve the market's technical problems, a downward trend in prices "could accelerate viciously," says Hitt, who operates AstroEcon Financial Astrology and Technical Analysis (On the Web, click on: http://www.astroecon.com). 

 Hitt believes investors will have a ripe buying opportunity about mid-2001 because of a market correction that could be as severe as a 40 percent drop, based on astrological patterns. 

 "People who have maintained their cash positions will be able to buy incredible bargains," he says. 

 HOROSCOPE FORETOLD KODAK'S FALL 

 Eastman Kodak stock fell sharply this week after a dismal profit warning. Some in the market were caught off guard. But Weingarten, author of "Investing by the Stars," wasn't among them, saying he wasn't surprised because it was foretold in the company's horoscope. 

 "Kodak doesn't have a good chart. It was not an out-performer," Weingarten says. 

 So which charts look good? Goodyear Tire , General Electric , General Motors and IBM . Telecommunications companies are due for a turnaround, the astrologer says. 

 He recommends that you reposition your portfolio from growth stocks to value stocks that can endure as the economy slows down. 

 "You want to get into things that actually earn money and have some sort of dividend," says Weingarten. 

 Weingarten says the future holds a downturn for the dollar by as much as 8 percent against other currencies, so it's best not to be fully invested in the United States. 

 Financial astrologers say studying past market events and the stars' positions can help serve as an early warning system of future trends since patterns repeat. 

 Astrology also can provide a key to investors' psychology. 

 Financial astrologers say top-name hedge fund managers and authors of market newsletters use them but won't acknowledge it because there is still a stigma about astrology. 

 "The scientists can't prove it, so they say it doesn't exist," Hitt says. 

 Mainstream financial advisers also are sceptical about investing by the stars and say you can't eliminate risk. 

 "The best you can do is to identify current trends, ask yourself if the trends are rational, position your portfolio to participate in the trends and pray they continue," says Hugh Johnson, chief investment strategist at First Albany. 

 No one can guess what the future has in store, Johnson adds. 

 On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 173.14 points, or 1.60 percent, to finish at 10,650.92. For the week, the Dow was down about 196 points, or 1.81 percent. For the year, the blue-chip average was off 7.4 percent. 

 The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index slid 105.50 points, or 2.79 percent, to end at 3,672.82. The Nasdaq was down almost 131 points, or about 3.4 percent for the week, and off 9.74 percent for the year. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 21.78 points, or 1.49 percent, to close at 1,436.51. For the week, the S&P 500 was off 12 points, or 0.84 of a percent. For the year, the S&P 500 was down 2.23 percent.

 Nasdaq election rally forecast.

 Investors who hold stocks quoted on the US Nasdaq index will be relieved to hear analysts are increasingly positive about its short-term prospects. 

 One of Wall Street's most influential technical analysts, Mr Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities, has this week suggested the Nasdaq will shake off its September blues and rally by more than 20 per cent in the short term. Mr Acampora has been telling his clients that he has set a near-term target for the Nasdaq composite index of 4,563. The last time the Nasdaq composite rose above the 4,500-mark was last April, when it hit a session high of 4,572, but closed sharply lower at 4,223. "My conclusion is that we've made a low. We've never changed our optimism long term," referring to Friday's dramatic decline to as low as 3,614. "I think we are starting a pre-election rally right here, which should be followed by a honeymoon rally. So I think we've seen the worst of it for a while." Mr Acampora did not give a specific time frame for his "near-term" forecast. 

 Last month he reiterated that he sees the Nasdaq composite near 6,000 by June 2001, adding he was not revising his forecast that the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average may hit 12,500 to 13,000 by year end. In his latest note, he said last Friday's technology stocks battering was basically a "panic day" - when prices go down dramatically and sometime during the day reverse, and subsequently the market closes at or near the high of the day. 

 On Friday, the Nasdaq finished at 3,803, the session high, after a wide and deep sell-off sparked by a profit warning from the world's leading chip-maker Intel. Analysts blame higher interest rates, soaring energy costs and a weaker euro currency for corporate America's earnings worries. An important factor in his forecast, Mr Acampora said, was the fact that none of the averages made new lows, but rather held above their previous support levels. "I expect a very dramatic upturn. The crisis, whether it be interest rates, currencies, or energy, has been abated at least for the short term," he added.

Newscast: Past summer's airline problems and pilots strike mean drop in United stock value

DAVID BRANCACCIO, anchor:   

For those travelers put out by all the  United Airlines flight cancellations this summer due, in part, to overcrowded airports and a pilot contract dispute, revenge is a dish best eaten cold. That cold dish came today in the form of a profit warning from United that knocked the stock value of the airline's parent corporation down 4 1/2 percent. From WBEZ in Chicago, Jody Becker reports.   

JODY BECKER reporting:   

Didn't make it to  Disney World the day you expected to over the summer? It won't come as much of a surprise then that  United Airlines' parent, UAL, is warning stockholders they'll be posting a third-quarter loss today, which they expect to follow up with further losses in the fourth.   

Hundreds of delayed flights, all-time high salaries written into pilots' contracts and the rising cost of jet fuel sent UAL's shares down about 6 percent in early trading. And now word from UAL chairman and CEO James Goodwin that last month's tentative settlement with pilots will result in higher-than-expected costs in other labor contracts.   

This time last year, United's quarterly earnings were $3.75 a share. But Wall Street analysts predict all the turbulence that hit United this year means the airline may not even peak at the 97 cents a share forecasted for this year's third and fourth quarters. In Chicago, I'm Jody Becker for MARKETPLACE.

 Wall Street Stocks Fall On Earnings Warnings From Apple.

 NEW YORK, September 29 (Xinhua) - Apple Computer's warning of disappointing earnings sent Wall Street stocks lower Friday after the market made a strong comeback in the previous session. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650. 92 points, erasing most of the 195-point gain Thursday. 

 Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50 at 3,672.82 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 21.78 at 1,436.51. 

 Stocks fell sharply on Apple's profit warning. The computer maker announced late Thursday that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall far below analysts' estimates because of weak sales in September. 

 The fresh warning made investors nervous with corporate earnings again. The disappointing earnings warnings from a number of companies, combined with the high oil prices and the weak European currency, hit the market heavily for most of September. 

 Apple Computer closed the session down 27.75 U.S. dollars at 25. 75 dollars per share, a nearly 52 percent drop. The sell-off spread to the other tech stocks, driving down the Nasdaq composite and other indexes. 

 Among the tech stocks which fell sharply were Gateway, Hewlett Packard, Lucent Technologies and Intel. 

 But Apple's announcement did not affect old-economy companies. Retailer Kmart moved up and Procter & Gamble was unchanged. 

 Chemical maker DuPont also closed up while many energy issues rose as well. 

 The NYSE index fell 4.71 at 663.04 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 2.44 at 521.37. But the American Stock Exchange index rose 14.51 at 954.31. 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New York Stock Exchange with 1,480 up, 1,437 down and 431 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume declined to 1.12 billion shares from 1.18 billion in the previous session.

 * [WORLD MKTS WATCH ECB AND THE FED] Both the European Central Bank (Oct. 5) and the Federal Reserve (Oct. 3) will gather to plot the course of monetary policy amid speculation that recent euro weakness may force the former to again hike interest rates to stem the euro's slide. The first round of concerted intervention to support the euro has so far succeeded in stabilizing the single currency, but some analysts argue a complimentary dose of ECB monetary tightening is also needed to reinforce exchange rate stability. Exchange rate pressures alone, however, are insufficient to force such drastic action, others said, and the current stability argued for the ECB to stay the course. 

 * [US SHARES HIT HARD BY APPLE] U.S. shares ended Friday sharply lower tripped up by a profit warning from Apple, which raised new worries over corporate profits. Apple was cut in half, down 27 13/16 at 25 11/16 [AAPL] in very heavy volume. The company warned late Thursday that weak September sales and poor demand for its G4 Cube would put third quarter earnings in the 30 to 33 cent range vs. the 45 cents that were expected. The Nasdaq composite finished down 105.50 to 3,672.82 or 2.8 percent, while the Dow Industrials were down 173.14 at 10,650.92 - down 1.76% for the week. Volumes were active. Bear Stearns rose 5 155/256 to 62 5/16 [BSC] as new rumors peg it as a takeover partner. 

 * [US TREASURIES SEE SLIGHT GAINS] U.S. Treasuries enjoyed only muted gains Friday despite seeing some month-and quarter-end index buying as well as a "flight" trade from a sluggish equity market, market sources said. The Rosh Hashanah religious holiday thinned many trading rooms, casting a quiescent tone over fixed-income trading activity Friday afternoon, traders said. 

 * [CHICAGO PURCHASERS SEE GAINS] In Friday morning's key economic release, the Chicago Purchasing Managers' index rose above the watershed 50.0 mark to 51.4 in September from 46.5 in August, and well above median estimates of 48.0, suggesting that the economy is not heading towards a recession any time soon. Prices paid were 66.7 versus 

 58.6 in August, most likely a reflection of higher oil prices. 

 *    [US PERSONAL INCOME UP LESS THAN SPENDING] U.S. personal 

 income in August rose 0.4%, with personal spending up 0.6%. However, that rate at with wages and salaries grew declined to an increase of 0.3% from 0.5% in July. The jump in August consumer spending was financed by a decline in the savings rate as savings declined by 0.4% to the lowest since monthly records were begun in 1959, sources pointed out. Real PCE now stands 1% above the 2Q average, or +3.9% on a seasonally-adjusted basis, compared with +3.1% PCE in the 2Q GDP. 

 * [US SLIGHTLY FIRMER IN US TRADING] The euro ended marginally firmer vs. the dollar Friday amid concern central banks would reappear to intervene on the single currency's behalf following Thursday's rebuff by Danish voters. The day following its rejection by Danish voters, the euro reversed early losses to close marginally firmer on the day amid fears central banks would be prodded into action should the level be pressured too heavily, traders said. Participants were impressed by the euro's resiliency and some looked for modest gains in the week ahead. 

 * [EU-US TALK AS FSC DEADLINE ARRIVES] Top U.S. and European Union negotiators, in the third day of talks in Brussels, are trying to broker a deal to delay one to two months the Oct. 1, World Trade Organization deadline for further changes in the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation tax mechanism, officials said. The scheme was found in violation of global rules by a WTO dispute panel in October 1999 that was upheld in a WTO Appellate Body ruling in February of this year. Failure to broker a deal could prompt the EU to set in motion after Oct.1 new WTO legal proceedings, which could culminate in the slapping of multi-billion punitive tariffs against U.S. exports. 

 * [US AUTO DEALERS SAY SEPTEMBER WAS STRONG] U.S. auto dealers report September sales were strong, even allowing for a seasonal slowing, and Ford dealers report minimal ill effect from the Firestone tire debacle. Some say overall sales might have been stronger had factories not further cut back on popular leasing programs that in months and years past spurred record-breaking demand for new cars and light trucks. Automakers have reduced leasing programs on worries that off-lease vehicles are glutting the used car market, driving down the residual value of older cars and making new ones tougher to sell. But some have heard scuttlebutt that automakers will resume leasing programs in October, giving in to consumer demands that could lead to a fourth quarter sales surge. 

 * [EU OFFICIALS PLAY DOWN IMPACT OF DANISH VOTE] EU finance ministers and central banking officials at the ECOFIN in Brussels played down the impact of the Danish rejection of EMU membership on the euro and on EU integration. 

 - The Euro Group said in a statement issued before their meeting in Brussels that it and EU finance ministers respected the Danish decision but regretted it, adding that the decision did not close the door to later participation in the euro area. - German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said he thought the Danish decision was "regrettable" but saw no impact from it on the euro as the Danish GDP only amounts to 2.7% of total euro-zone GDP. However, he acknowledged that the rejection will have a negative impact on prospects for the UK and Sweden joining EMU. He added, "We are certain that Denmark will find its way to the euro-zone, maybe not now but some day in the future." - French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius, in his role as head of the Euro Group, said the Danish rejection does not change the outlook for the euro or for the Euroland economy, nor rule out Danish membership in the future. Fabius said before the meeting he retained "strong confidence" in the euro despite the vote. - Swedish Finance Minister Bosse Ringholm said the prospects of Sweden adopting the euro would not be influenced by the Danish rejection. Swedish Economics Minister Marianne Jelved said there would be no changes in the government and that she hoped the vote would not influence voters in Sweden and the UK. - Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm rejected any idea that Denmark's vote against joining EMU was a vote of no confidence in the euro. He also said he did not expect the euro to come under pressure after the vote. (Stories ran 06:53,07:09,07:14,07:40,07:42,08:00,09:07,09:47 10:01, 10:23,11:05 GMT) 

 * [DENMARK HIKES RATES] The Danish central bank announced that it hiked its key 14-day lending rate by 50 bps to 5.60% in order to support the krone. It also said, "Denmark's fixed exchange rtae policy will be maintained." It said it raised rates to avoid uncertainty about the krone's exchange rate after the public's rejection of EMU entry.

 July, the national statistics office reported. (Story repeated 07:25

 *    [ITALY TRADE SURPLUS SHRINKS] The non-EU trade surplus in 

 August declined as the country sucked in higher priced oil imports, the national statistics agency reported. Italy posted a non-EU trade surplus of L2.565 tln in August, compared with L3.490 tln in August 1999 and L2.865 tln in July. (Story repeated 11:12 GMT)

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - U.S. shares were ending Friday sharply lower tripped up by a profit warning from Apple, which raised new worries over corporate profits. 

 Apple was cut in half, down 27 13/16 at 25 11/16 [AAPL]. The company warned late Thursday that weak September sales and poor demand for its G4 Cube would put third quarter earnings in the 30 to 33 cent range vs. the 45 cents that were expected. 

 The Nasdaq composite was down 84.50 at 3,693.82 or 2.2 percent, while the Dow Industrials were down 77.46 at 10,745.79. Volumes were active. 

 Dealers and analysts said they were surprised by the degree of reaction in the stock and also its spillover into the market, evidence of the level of jitters that Intel's warning last week caused. 

 Apple's annual revenues of nearly $8.0 billion are a tenth of IBM's and a fifth of Compaq's. IBM was down 4 5/16 at 110 15/16 [IBM], Compaq down 0.86 at 27.39 [CPQ], Gateway down 7.21 at 46.79 [GTW] and Dell down 2 at 30 11/16 [DELL]. 

 Intel was down 2 7/16 at 42 [INTC] amid reports shipments of its new Pentium 4 processors will be delayed. The company said it plans to ship the chips by year's end. 

 UAL Corp was also sharply lower, falling 2 3/8 to 41 5/8 [UAL] after it warned of a third-quarter loss due to cancellations, delays, fuel and wages. 

 Economic data in the session had little effect. Personal spending was mostly as expected, rising 0.6 percent in August with personal income up 0.4 percent. Spending continues to outpace income and has pushed the savings rate to its lowest rate ever of minus 0.4 percent. 

 Mexican cement company Cemex said it would buy rival Southdown of Houston for $73 per share, pushing Southdown up 16 81/256 at 71 3/16 [SDW]. 

 Bear Stearns rose 5 155/256 to 62 5/16 [BSC] as new rumors peg it as a takeover partner.

 * [DANES TURN DOWN THE EURO] European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg late Thursday pledged that the ECB would continue to cooperate with the Danish central bank despite the defeat of Danish referendum on euro-zone membership. Shortly after results of the Danish referendum showed a 53% to 47% decision against joining the euro, the ECB issued a statement as follows: "I have taken note of the decision taken by the Danish electorate in today's referendum. I acknowledge the decision by the Danish people not to apply for the adoption of the euro as their currency. I wish to emphasise that this will not in any way affect the co-operation between Denmark's Nationalbank and the European Central Bank." 

 * [EURO-DOLLAR IS HOLDING ABOVE $0.8800.] Fear of central bank intervention has a prevented a push lower in reaction to the Danish vote. Earlier, it touched a low of $0.8780 as the election results became apparent. But when further selling failed to take hold, it rebounded quickly back above $0.8800. Another push lower below $0.8800 later in the morning was on the back of euro-sterling selling. Dollar-yen is holding around Y107.85 after failing to break Y108.00 for the third time. It has been fairly well-supported this morning as dealers unwind short positions taken in anticipation of increased yen demand for fiscal half year-end. Japanese exporters have been the main sellers of dollar-yen at levels starting at Y107.90. 

 * [HOUSING STARTS IN JAPAN FELL 3.8% IN AUGUST] on the year to 103,554 after falling 0.8% in July and 1.2% in June, the Construction Ministry said. Starts for single-family dwellings declined 4.3% after falling 8.7% on the year in July. Multi-unit construction starts rose 2.7% after rising 31.4% in the previous month. 

 * [THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FELL 1.4% ON THE YEAR] in September in Tokyo and was down 0.8% on the year in August in all of Japan, the Management and Coordination Agency reported. The CPI rose 0.3% on the month in September in Tokyo and was flat on the month in August throughout Japan. 

 * [JAPANESE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FELL TO 4.6%] in Ausgust from the 4.7% recorded in July, the Management and Coordination Agency reported. The ministry said the number of unemployed fell 3.1% from the previous year while the number of employed fell 0.5%. 

 * [JAPANESE HOUSEHOLD SPENDING BY WAGE-EARNER HOUSEHOLDS FELL 2.9%] on the year in August, the Labor Ministry reported. It was the fourth straight month of spending declines. Real income was down 0.3% on the real while the seasonally adjusted propensity to consume fell to 69.7% from 71.3% in July. 

 * [NEW CONSTRUCTION ORDERS AT JAPAN'S 50 BIGGEST] construction companies fell 5.4% on the year in August after falling 6.8% in July, the Construction Ministry reported. 

 [FROM THE US THURSDAY:] 

 * [US STOCKS JUMP, BUT AFTER-HOURS APPLE WARNING CASTS PALL] U.S. share prices rose sharply Thursday as several companies said they would meet third quarter expectations, quieting nerves some in a still cautious market. The Dow Industrials rose 209.48, or 1.97 percent, to 10,837.84. The more volatile Nasdaq Composite rose 3.01 percent, up 110.08 to 3,766.38. Index component Procter & Gamble helped the Dow, rising 5 to 67 after saying it would meet quarterly profit and revenue expectations and breaking a string of disappointments. Then, after the close, an unexpected earnings warning from Apple Computer cast a new pall over the equities scene that may fully register on Friday. 

 * [CRUDE OIL DROP BOLSTERS US TREASURIES] A drop in crude oil prices bolstered the 30-year Treasury bond Thursday while a late surge in the Dow Jones Industrials capped upside potential in the front end. The 30-year bond was up 7/32 at 5.88% at 3:05 p.m. EDT while the 10-year note was 1/32 higher at 5.81% and the newly-auctioned September two-year note was unchanged at 6.00%. After earlier setting a one-month low at $30.58 a barrel on Thursday, November NYMEX crude oil futures were down 79 cents to $30.68 per barrel by mid-afternoon. 

 * [US TELLS TIPS HOLDERS CPI ERROR NO BOON] The Treasury Department formally told bondholders the U.S. government won't be making up any losses holders of inflation indexed securities, known as "TIPS," may have suffered because the CPI was a tad lower than it was supposed to be. "According to the regulations governing both marketable and nonmarketable inflation-indexed securities and Series I Savings bonds, calculations of principal value and interest payments or redemption values are not adjusted if previously reported CPI figures are revised," the Treasury statement said. 

 * [US 2Q GDP REVISED TO 5.6%] In Thursday's economic data, second-quarter GDP was revised higher than expected, to +5.6%, but more surprising was the revision to the PCE deflator, up 2.1% from the previously-reported +2.3%. Still, market sources said that the GDP report was "old news" and that most softer data didn't dampen the economy until July so had virtually no market impact. 

 * [US GOVT ENDING FISCAL YEAR WITH NO FOLLOW-ON BUDGET] With the final day of the government's fiscal year at hand, congressional Republicans and the White House accused each other of being responsible for the fact the next fiscal year's budget won't be ready by Saturday. The Senate passed legislation late Thursday that keeps government running next week, 96-0. Earlier in the week the House passed its version nearly unanimously. And Clinton left no doubt that he'll sign it into law rather than trigger a shutdown of most of government. 

 * [SURVEY SAYS FED WON'T CHANGE BIAS NEXT WEEK] The Fed will leave its tightening bias untouched and its federal funds rate target at 6.50% when board members emerge from the FOMC meeting Oct. 3, despite signs of an economic slowdown, Market News concluded in a survey of 27 primary dealers. "The only thing they're going to do is meet and talk," said Paribas Corp. chief economist Brian Fabbri. "They'll leave the statement (relatively) unchanged ... it just may not read as one-sided as it has in the past," he said. Only two economists in the Market News International survey expect the Fed to change the bias from tighten to neutral. 

 * [BRAZIL KEEPS RATE STEADY] Encouraged by the stability of domestic and international markets and continuing economic growth, Brazil's monetary policymakers decided to hold interest rates steady, but concern over future trends in oil prices prompted them to raise their inflation estimate, the Central Bank announced Thursday. 

 * [IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR HORST KOEHLER] praised the joint central bank intervention to support the euro last Friday but said the euro's future value will depend on whether or not European nations pursue structural reforms. Koehler said "it was right that the ECB intervened," but added that "intervention is no panacea." He said, "The intervention demonstrated the maturity of the ECB" and showed the forex markets that the monetary authorities are "in command." (Story ran 10:59 GMT)

 On Wall Street, share prices drifted in a narrow range on Wednesday before finishing with modest losses amid growing concerns over faltering corporate earnings. 

 Traders said early gains were wiped out by resurfacing fears of more warnings that corporate profits would miss Wall Street estimates. 

 The Dow Jones industrials edged down 2.96 points to close at 10,626.69 on 1.1 billion shares traded. 

 The Nasdaq was down 32.80 points at 3,656.30. 

 The market fluctuated through most of the session, with investors unable to find a clear direction in the market. 

 Sentiment had been affected by a number of warnings from big US firms that their earnings would be lower than anticipated because of higher costs for energy and raw materials and the exchange-rate effects of the slumping euro. 

 Nervousness was heightened after the Internet discounter Priceline.com warned its third-quarter revenue will fall below analyst expectations due to a shortfall in the sale of online airline tickets. 

 Kodak was again under pressure, falling another four percent a day after a 25 percent plunge in the wake of its profit warning.

 * [DANES TURN DOWN THE EURO] European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg late Thursday pledged that the ECB would continue to cooperate with the Danish central bank despite the defeat of Danish referendum on euro-zone membership. Shortly after results of the Danish referendum showed a 53% to 47% decision against joining the euro, the ECB issued a statement as follows: "I have taken note of the decision taken by the Danish electorate in today's referendum. I acknowledge the decision by the Danish people not to apply for the adoption of the euro as their currency. I wish to emphasise that this will not in any way affect the co-operation between Denmark's Nationalbank and the European Central Bank." 

 * [EURO SLUMPS IN US TRADING] The euro slumped to new session lows vs. the dollar late Thursday afternoon in North American trading as it became more apparent the Danish referendum to join EMU was headed for defeat, as was confirmed late in the day. The euro slipped to new session lows near $0.8777 after holding in a narrow $0.8800 to $0.8860 range. The issue of adopting the euro is a very complex one to try to put across in a popular referendum, the Danish Finance Minister Morgens Lykketoft advised U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair shortly after it emerged Thursday evening that the Danish people have voted 'no' to the single currency. 

 * [US STOCKS JUMP, BUT AFTER-HOURS APPLE WARNING CASTS PALL] U.S. share prices rose sharply Thursday as several companies said they would meet third quarter expectations, quieting nerves some in a still cautious market. The Dow Industrials rose 209.48, or 1.97 percent, to 10,837.84. The more volatile Nasdaq Composite rose 3.01 percent, up 110.08 to 3,766.38. Index component Procter & Gamble helped the Dow, rising 5 to 67 after saying it would meet quarterly profit and revenue expectations and breaking a string of disappointments. Then, after the close, an unexpected earnings warning from Apple Computer cast a new pall over the equities scene that may fully register on Friday. 

 * [CRUDE OIL DROP BOLSTERS US TREASURIES] A drop in crude oil prices bolstered the 30-year Treasury bond Thursday while a late surge in the Dow Jones Industrials capped upside potential in the front end. The 30-year bond was up 7/32 at 5.88% at 3:05 p.m. EDT while the 10-year note was 1/32 higher at 5.81% and the newly-auctioned September two-year note was unchanged at 6.00%. After earlier setting a one-month low at $30.58 a barrel on Thursday, November NYMEX crude oil futures were down 79 cents to $30.68 per barrel by mid-afternoon. 

 * [US TELLS TIPS HOLDERS CPI ERROR NO BOON] The Treasury Department formally told bondholders the U.S. government won't be making up any losses holders of inflation indexed securities, known as "TIPS," may have suffered because the CPI was a tad lower than it was supposed to be. "According to the regulations governing both marketable and nonmarketable inflation-indexed securities and Series I Savings bonds, calculations of principal value and interest payments or redemption values are not adjusted if previously reported CPI figures are revised," the Treasury statement said. 

 * [US 2Q GDP REVISED TO 5.6%] In Thursday's economic data, second-quarter GDP was revised higher than expected, to +5.6%, but more surprising was the revision to the PCE deflator, up 2.1% from the previously-reported +2.3%. Still, market sources said that the GDP report was "old news" and that most softer data didn't dampen the economy until July so had virtually no market impact. 

 * [US GOVT ENDING FISCAL YEAR WITH NO FOLLOW-ON BUDGET] With the final day of the government's fiscal year at hand, congressional Republicans and the White House accused each other of being responsible for the fact the next fiscal year's budget won't be ready by Saturday. The Senate passed legislation late Thursday that keeps government running next week, 96-0. Earlier in the week the House passed its version nearly unanimously. And Clinton left no doubt that he'll sign it into law rather than trigger a shutdown of most of government. 

 * [SURVEY SAYS FED WON'T CHANGE BIAS NEXT WEEK] The Fed will leave its tightening bias untouched and its federal funds rate target at 6.50% when board members emerge from the FOMC meeting Oct. 3, despite signs of an economic slowdown, Market News concluded in a survey of 27 primary dealers. "The only thing they're going to do is meet and talk," said Paribas Corp. chief economist Brian Fabbri. "They'll leave the statement (relatively) unchanged ... it just may not read as one-sided as it has in the past," he said. Only two economists in the Market News International survey expect the Fed to change the bias from tighten to neutral. 

 * [BRAZIL KEEPS RATE STEADY] Encouraged by the stability of domestic and international markets and continuing economic growth, Brazil's monetary policymakers decided to hold interest rates steady, but concern over future trends in oil prices prompted them to raise their inflation estimate, the Central Bank announced Thursday. 

 * [IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR HORST KOEHLER] praised the joint central bank intervention to support the euro last Friday but said the euro's future value will depend on whether or not European nations pursue structural reforms. Koehler said "it was right that the ECB intervened," but added that "intervention is no panacea." He said, "The intervention demonstrated the maturity of the ECB" and showed the forex markets that the monetary authorities are "in command." (Story ran 10:59 GMT) 

 * [THE EURO-ZONE POSTED A TRADE SURPLUS] with the rest of the world of E4.9 bln in July, compared with E12.1 bln a year earlier, according to preliminary data from Eurostat. Import growth in the three months to July of 30.4% on the year exceeded export growth of 20.2%. (Story repeated 11:12 GMT) 

 * [ITALIAN UNADJUSTED RETAIL SALES IN JUNE] were above forecast, rising 2.5% on the year, the largest increase since December 1999, the state statistical office reported. An ISTAT spokesman said discounting helped boost sales. Meanwhile, hourly wages were unchanged on the month in August, with the year-on-year rate at 1.8%, which was down from 2.0% in July. The data suggest that there are still no signs that the oil-driven rise in inflation over the last year is feeding significantly into wage settlements.(Stories repeated 11:12 GMT) 

 * [THE NORWEGIAN CENTRAL BANK RAISED ITS FORECAST FOR EX-OIL GDP] this year by 50 bps to 2.25% in its Q3 inflation report. But past interest rate hikes, a fall in petroleum investment and labour market constraints would be factors slowing growth in the two years ahead, Norges Bank said. It left unchanged its 2000 inflation forecast. (Story repeated 11:12 GMT) 

 * [JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ROSE 3.3%] in August from July and was up 8.3% a year earlier, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. Shipments rose 3.7% on the month in and were up 9.0% over the previous year. Inventories rose 0.1% compared with July and 0.3% over the same month a year ago. MITI said its survey of production expectations showed manufacturers see production falling 2.5% in September and flat in rising 1.7% in October.

 Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal 
 DaimlerChrysler U.S. unit to post $528-million loss Company expects to shore up bottom line by ratcheting up a cost-cutting campaign

 DaimlerChrysler AG confirmed that its U.S. unit, once the envy of the American auto industry for its profitability, will post a $528-million (U.S.) third-quarter operating loss even as the U.S. auto market continues to boom. 

 The auto maker said that outsized spending on consumer incentives and new product launches at the former Chrysler Corp. will drag down the entire company's results for the year. Pretax profit for DaimlerChrysler this year, excluding one-time items, will be about $6.16-billion, the company said, 40 per cent below last year's level of $10.4-billion. 

 Another factor weighing on the German-based company's operating profit, when converted to U.S. dollars, will be a weakening euro. After including non-recurring items, such as proceeds from the sale of non-automotive assets, DaimlerChrysler said its net income for 2000 will be "significantly higher than last year." 

 Given that DaimlerChrysler's other businesses, particularly its Mercedes-Benz unit, are performing well, the big question for the company will be how to improve the situation at the former Chrysler Corp. heading into 2001. 

 DaimlerChrysler shares rose slightly after yesterday's profit warning, reaching $45.94, up 94 cents, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had sunk to new lows in the past two weeks on market expectations of a third-quarter loss at the U.S. unit. 

 DaimlerChrysler said it expects its U.S. unit will turn an operating profit in the fourth quarter. For the full year, it sees the U.S. unit with an operating profit of $1.76-billion, which would be well below last year's $5.2-billion. 

 DaimlerChrysler in part expects that it can shore up its U.S. unit's bottom line by ratcheting up a cost-cutting campaign that the company began several months ago. Spending on future cars and trucks has been "recalibrated," and competitive bidding among its suppliers has "substantially increased," the company said. 

 But DaimlerChrysler also hopes to start selling more of its vehicles to consumers at top dollar. The company said it is considering boosting production of its hot-selling PT Cruiser, which has been flying off dealer lots. 

 And the company is banking on being able to trim discounts on its highest-volume product, its minivan, as it rolls out a redesigned version this fall. 

 The profit warning wasn't the only blow suffered by DaimlerChrysler's U.S. unit yesterday. Thomas Gale, the 57-year-old veteran Chrysler design chief who oversaw the styling of such hits as the Dodge Ram pickup truck and the PT Cruiser, confirmed that he will retire at year's end. Mr. Gale's exit, the latest in a line of departures by U.S. executives since Germany's Daimler-Benz AG bought Chrysler in 1998, means the DaimlerChrysler management board will shrink to 12 members, just three of them Americans.

 While Bay Street may still be a couple of months away from ski season, investors on Canada's largest exchange have already been down the equivalent of a double black-diamond slope this month alone. 

 Yesterday, it suffered another steep fall. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index slumped 228.6 points to close at 10,250. The benchmark index is now down more than 1,100 points from the high of 11,388.80 it touched on Sept. 1. Year to date, however, it's up almost 22 per cent. 

 In New York,the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.96 points yesterday to end at 10,628.36 as blue-chip stocks Eastman Kodak Co., Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. struggled. 

 The Nasdaq Stock Market's tech-heavy composite index dropped 32.8 points to 3,656.3. On-line retailer Priceline.com Inc. was one of Nasdaq's big losers, sinking 42 per cent to $10.75 (U.S.) after issuing a profitwarning. 

 But 3Com Corp. headed in the opposite direction, adding 22 per cent to $17 in the wake of its better-than-expected quarterly-earnings report. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.64 points to 1,426.57. 

 On the Canadian venture exchange, the junior high techs pulled the CDNX up 0.77 points to 3,535.7. 

 On Bay Street, the gold and precious minerals sector was the TSE's top-gainer, rising almost 3.5 per cent on the back of the rising price of gold in New York. 

 One of the gold sector's biggest players, Franco-Nevada Mining Corp., hasn't given up hope for its recently nixed merger with South Africa's Gold Fields Ltd. The Toronto-based miner said it will talk with some of Gold Fields' executives at a pending international gold show. Franco-Nevada gained 65 cents (Canadian) to $15. 

 Barrick Gold Corp., Bay Street's biggest gold company, advanced 80 cents to $23.25. 

 The TSE's technology-based industrial products sector took it on the chin, posting a loss of 5 per cent. Sector and market-mover Nortel Networks Corp. tumbled $6.80 to $88.70. Investors are jittery about the company's future earnings. 

 JDS Uniphase Corp., Research In Motion Ltd., Celestica Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc. also helped mire the subindex in the red.

 (Updates futures in graph 4, adds durable goods in graphs 6, 7, comment in graph 8) 

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Stocks were expected to have a bright start on Wednesday, recovering from a rash of warnings from high-profile companies that profits would fall short of Wall Street forecasts. 

 "We should start to rally back," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Weatherly Securities. "There is a belief that the market has discounted the worst-case scenario when it comes to third-quarter earnings." 

 Stocks fell Tuesday after photo film maker Eastman Kodak Co. cut its profit outlook for the third quarter. Kodak's warning added to fears that soaring oil prices and the weakness of the euro currency will pressure U.S. corporate profits. 

 But Wall Street expects a bounce early in the session as investors return to buy cheapened stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for December were up 7.30 points at 1,450.30, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures were up 57.50 points at 3,675.00. 

 "The futures look a little higher, but the question is: 'Can we go the distance?'" said Larry Wachtel of Prudential Securities. "Lately the mood is so subdued and cautious that there is a tendency to sell into strength. All you can do is predict an oversold bounce and hope for the best." 

 The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that U.S. durable goods orders in August rose by 2.9 percent compared with a downwardly revised decline of 13.1 percent in July. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast that durables would rise by 2.7 percent after declining by a previously reported 12.4 percent in July. 

 "This doesn't change things much for the Fed," said David Wyss, research director at Standard and Poor's. "We had a little bit of a reversal from the previous month. It looks like we still have a slowdown out there, and the Fed's pretty happy with it." 

 Among issues to watch Wednesday, the European Commission said that it cleared plans by Dow component Boeing Co. to buy the satellite and components businesses of Hughes Electronics Corp. 

 On Tuesday, shares of Boeing closed at $66-1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, and shares of Hughes closed at $36-1/2 on the NYSE. 

 FleetBoston Financial Corp. is in talks to buy Summit Bancorp , a move that would expand its presence in the Northeast, the Wall Street Journal reported. Stock of Fleet closed at $38-11/16 on the NYSE, while Summit ended $30-5/8 on the NYSE. 

 Japanese cellular-phone leader NTT DoCoMo and America Online Inc. said Wednesday they made a deal to develop and market mobile Internet services. Shares of AOL closed at $55.60 on the Exchange. 

 U.S. fiber optics company Corning Inc. said Wednesday it would buy Italian cable firm Pirelli's 90 percent stake in its optical components and devices business for as much as $3.6 billion, expanding Corning's reach into Europe. 

 Stock of Corning closed at $322-7/8 on the NYSE. 

 Belgium's Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV , the speech recognition software maker, said Tuesday after the market closed that third-quarter earnings and revenues would fall short of analysts' expectations. Shares closed at $14 in Tuesday's Nasdaq trading. 

 Medical device maker Becton Dickinson and Co. warned Tuesday after the market closed it will scrap programmes that boost sales to distributors, a move it said will push fourth-quarter profits below expectations. Shares finished at $24-5/16 Tuesday on the NYSE. 

 Computer networking equipment maker 3Com Corp. on Tuesday reported a fiscal first-quarter operating loss that was far narrower than analysts' expectations. Its shares ended at $13-15/16 on Nasdaq. 

 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 176.83 points, or 1.64 percent, to end at 10,631.32, with Kodak accounting for almost half the drop. Kodak stock dropped $14-5/8 to a nearly six-year low of $44-3/8. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 11.82 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,427.21. 

 Meanwhile, the technology-packed Nasdaq Composite Index fell 52.12 points, or 1.39 percent, to 3,689.10.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday, with Internet shares taking some of the hardest hits, amid lingering worries about corporate profits. 

 Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell more than 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 holding, pushing the yield up to 5.816%. The 30-year bond dropped nearly 3/4, yielding 5.899%. 

 The dollar edged lower. It traded at 88.33 cents to the euro and 107.37 yen to the dollar, compared with 88.28 cents to the euro and 107.59 yen to the dollar late Tuesday in New York. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 32.80, or 0.9%, to 3656.30, erasing a 61-point gain seen earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.96 to 10628.36, its third straight decline. 

 Investors were rattled after Priceline.com, the name-your-price online auctioneer, warned that third-quarter revenue will fall short of analysts' estimates because of weak sales of airline tickets. Its shares plunged $7.89, or 42%, to $10.75 by 4 p.m. EDT. 

 The warning shook the Internet sector, sending shares of Amazon.com, eBay, Yahoo! and America Online broadly lower. 

 Kodak, whose profit warning sent the market tumbling Tuesday, fell another $1.94 to $40.13, extending Tuesday's nearly $15 decline. Fellow Dow industrial components Boeing and Honeywell also fell. 

 In the tech sector, Microsoft lost $2.06 to $60.63 and Dell Computer fell $1.19 to $32.44, weighing on the Nasdaq. 

 However, 3Com rose $3.06, or 22%, to $17, after the computer-networking company posted a narrower-than-expected loss late Tuesday.

 The Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed it will revise and raise previosuly reported Consumer Price Index data because of a newly unearthed measurement problem. 

 The corrections, however, will have little impact on the "general pattern of consumer price behavior this year," the bureau said. For example, the bureau said the revision raised the CPI for the period of December 1999 through August 2000 to 2.7% from the originally reported 2.6%. 

 "The revisions to the CPI correct an error recently discovered in the software used to calculate the residential rent and owner's equivalent rent components of the index," the agency said. The glitch was first reported by the Washington Post, which said the revision could push the CPI higher by 0.1 to 0.3 percentage point over the past 12 months.

 Exodus Communications, resurrecting a deal that was aborted two months ago, is in advanced discussions to acquire Global Crossing's GlobalCenter unit for about $6.5 billion in stock, according to people familiar with the matter. 

 Given the history of on-again, off-again discussions, the talks could very well fall apart, these people warned. However, both boards were scheduled to discuss a potential deal late Wednesday evening. 

 Should a deal be clinched, it would be the latest signal of rapid consolidation among companies that specialize in supporting and managing Web sites for other businesses.

 Coca-Cola adjusted its estimates for third-quarter and full-year volume growth, moving the former a little higher and the latter a little lower. 

 Coke expects world-wide sales volume to rise 4% in the third quarter, at the high end of its earlier estimate of a 3% to 4% increase. But the company also said it expects a 5% gain for the year, coming in at the low end of its previous full-year prediction of 5% to 6% sales growth.

 Stocks Lose Ground as Profit Worries Impair Confidence

 NEW YORK -- Stocks closed mostly lower Wednesday, with Internet shares taking some of the hardest hits, amid lingering worries about corporate profits. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 32.80, or 0.9%, to 3656.30, erasing a 61-point gain seen earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.96 to 10628.36, its third straight decline. 

 Other major indexes finished mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 0.64 to 1426.57, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index inched up 1.22 to 656.05 and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks gave back 1.76 to 508.13. 

 Investors were rattled after Priceline.com (PCLN), the name-your-price online auctioneer, warned that third-quarter revenue will fall short of analysts' estimates because of weak sales of airline tickets. Its shares plunged $7.89, or 42%, to $10.75 by 4 p.m. EDT. 

 The warning shook the Internet sector, sending shares of Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Yahoo! (YHOO) and America Online (AOL) broadly lower. The Dow Jones Composite Internet Index fell 3.8%. 

 Alan Ackerman, executive vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock & Co., said a high level of anxiety exists in the wake of recent earnings warnings. 

 "Many market players have been bruised and burned by the market's volatility and in particular the shock created by earnings [warnings from firms] such as Eastman Kodak and Priceline," Mr. Ackerman said. "There's plenty of flotsam and jetsam around, or wreckage in the form of earnings disappointments." 

 Kodak (EK), whose profit warning sent the market tumbling Tuesday, fell another $1.94 to $42.56, extending Tuesday's nearly $15 decline. Fellow Dow industrial components Boeing (BA) and Honeywell (HON) also fell. 

 Mr. Ackerman noted that the market may stabilize with stronger earnings reports, "but in fact we have a market that continues to be nervous, concerned with the three E's: energy prices, the euro and earnings." 

 The rising cost of oil and the sagging euro, which hurts companies that do a lot of business in Europe, have been cited by several firms as pressuring their bottom lines. However, the euro has stabilized following last week's concerted intervention by central banks around the world, and crude-oil prices have pulled back a bit since the U.S. said it would release some oil from its emergency reserve. 

 Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons, said investors are just riding out the week until the third quarter ends Saturday, bringing to a close the so-called confessional season when companies issue profit warnings. 

 "The market is in a 'do-nothing' kind of mood, [where investors think] it's too late for me to sell and too early for me to buy," he said. "There is a decent level of despair as the market gets close to the bottom." 

 Mr. Goldman added that he sees the market's slide this month as a buying opportunity, particularly among technology stocks. 

 In the tech sector, Microsoft (MSFT) lost $2.06 to $60.63 and Dell Computer (DELL) fell $1.19 to $32.44, weighing on the Nasdaq. Semiconductor stocks gave up earlier gains to trade mostly lower, although Intel (INTC) inched up 56 cents to $43.88. 

 However, 3Com (COMS) rose $3.06, or 22%, to $17, after the computer-networking company posted a narrower-than-expected loss late Tuesday. 

 In economic news, orders for durable goods rose by a solid 2.9% in August, reflecting stronger demand for airplanes, electronics and industrial machinery, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Economists had expected a 2.5% increase. 

 Outside the U.S., European shares closed mostly higher, as telecommunications and technology stocks returned to favor. In the Asian-Pacific region, markets closed mixed, with stocks falling in Tokyo but rising in Hong Kong. 

 In major market action: 

 Stocks closed mostly lower. On the Big Board, where 1.16 billion shares traded, 1,506 stocks advanced and 1,343 declined. On the Nasdaq market, 1.94 billion shares changed hands. 

 Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell more than 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 holding, pushing the yield up to 5.816%. The 30-year bond dropped nearly 3/4, yielding 5.899%. 

 The dollar edged lower. It traded at 88.33 cents to the euro and 107.37 yen to the dollar, compared with 88.28 cents to the euro and 107.59 yen to the dollar late Tuesday in New York.

But first, let's do the numbers.   

The anxious stock market lost more ground over profit worries today. The Dow Jones industrial average lost just fractionally about 3 points, but the slumping NASDAQ went down about 32 points, 9/10ths percent. Internet stocks did not help there. The S&P 500 closed down just a bit.   

Analysts say investors remain nervous about the gloomy profit outlook for a growing list of companies. There was more fallout from  Kodak's profit warning yesterday.  Kodak shares lost another 4 percent today.   

Shares in the World Wrestling Federation closed down about 2 1/2 percent, just before the WWF issued a profit warning this afternoon. They're not going to blame the euro and high oil prices are they?   

A profit warning from  Priceline.com. The name-your-own-price people brought down a bunch of Web shares. Priceline plunged more than 42 percent. You can just hear pitchman Shatner yelling, `Market, I've got to have more power!'

Word of the Supreme Court's ruling helped lift  Microsoft stock yesterday. But the market as a whole remained mired in a slump. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 176 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 10,631. The S&P 500 dropped 8/10ths of a percent; while the NASDAQ gave up 1 1/3rd percent. Part of the problem was yet another profit warning from a corporate heavy-hitter. This time it was photography powerhouse,  Eastman Kodak. Pete Enderlin is with the investment bank, Ryan, Beck. He admits that  Kodak is struggling to redefine itself in a digital age, but he says new technology isn't shuttering the company.   

Mr. PETE ENDERLIN (Ryan, Beck): Last year when digital cameras sales really sort of broke through and started to accelerate, film sales picked up. And they've been pretty strong so far this year. It's really not clear why their sales have dipped recently.   

GLASER: According to Enderlin, the euro is partly to blame for  Kodak's troubles. The weakness of the single European currency against the dollar is taking a toll on revenues from  Kodak's European operations.

 Euro edges up in sluggish trade as Danish referendum looms

 TOKYO, Sept 27 (AFP) - The euro edged up against the dollar and yen in quiet Tokyo trade Wednesday ahead of a Danish referendum on whether to adopt the troubled common currency. 

 The euro traded at 0.8861 dollars around 6:00 p.m. (0900 GMT), up from 0.8827 dollars in New York and 0.8779 dollars in Tokyo late Tuesday. 

 The euro traded at 95.43 yen, up from 94.93 yen in New York and 94.21 yen here Tuesday afternoon. 

 "Those who sold the euro yesterday and earlier today tried to cover their short positions, which raised the euro a bit," said Daiwa Bank dealer Nobuaki Kubo. 

 "But we have not seen any active euro-buying as investors were cautious ahead of the Danish referendum," Kubo said. 

 Amid a shortage of fresh leads after last Friday's central bank intervention, investors were now focused on Thursday's referendum of Danish voters. 

 "If the result of the vote turns out to be a rejection of the euro, the euro will be sold," said Sanwa Bank dealer Mitsuru Sahara. 

 But "investors are very cautious of more intervention," he added. 

 Commerzbank foreign exchange manager Ryohei Muramatsu agreed the referendum was fuelling intervention fears. 

 "The market is still nervous about intervention, especially with the Danish poll. If the euro is sold sharply, we may expect intervention," he said. 

 Opinion polls are predicting a cliffhanger result in Denmark, which like Britain has traditionally been sceptical about the European project. 

 "Intervention fears seemingly (are) the only factor supporting the euro/dollar," research house IDEAglobal.com said in Singapore. 

 "However, high oil prices and further US equity market volatility will lead the market to question how long the Fed (Federal Reserve) is likely to continue proping up the euro/dollar," it said. 

 The dollar bought 106.69 yen, against 107.58 yen in New York and 107.32 in Tokyo late Tuesday. 

 Lower share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange had prompted modest selling of the yen against the greenback in the morning, but the yen later recovered on profit-taking, Sanwa's Sahara said. 

 The Nikkei-225 share index lost 288.67 points to close at 15,639.95, following heavy falls on Wall Street sparked by a profitwarning from Eastman Kodak Co. 

 In Singapore trade, the US dollar fell to 1.7404 Singapore dollars from 1.7444, 46.17 Philippine pesos from 46.27, and 8,780.00 Indonesian rupiah from 8,853.00. 

 The greenback also weakened to 1,112.135 South Korean won from 1,119.05 and 42.025 Thai baht from 42.54. But it rose to 31.301 Taiwan dollars from 31.2895.

 TOKYO, Sept 27 (AFP) - The euro was hovering against the dollar in quiet Tokyo trade Wednesday ahead of a Danish referendum on whether to adopt the troubled common currency. 

 The euro traded at 0.8823 dollars around 2:00 p.m. (0500 GMT), down slightly from 0.8827 dollars in New York but up from 0.8779 dollars in Tokyo late Tuesday.

 Lower share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange prompted modest selling of the yen against the greenback in the morning, Sanwa's Sahara said. 

 The Nikkei-225 share index fell 194.17 points, or 1.2 percent, to close Wednesday morning at 15,734.45, following heavy falls on Wall Street sparked by a profit warning from Eastman Kodak Co.

A profit warning from  Eastman Kodak threw the markets out of focus.  Kodak joins a growing list of companies, including  McDonald's and  Goodyear Tire & Rubber, that are bracing investors for disappointing profits.   

(Graphic on screen)   

Eastman Kodak (EK) down 14.50 to 44.50   

CHRISTOFOROUS: It certainly wasn't a pretty picture for  Kodak. That stock plunged 25 percent, its biggest drop since the '87 stock market crash. The photography giant warned that third-quarter earnings will miss the mark because of the falling euro and weak film sales. Now  Kodak's sell-off accounted for almost half the Dow's 176-point drop.   

Not even good news from  Microsoft was enough to bring out the bulls. Shares of  Microsoft did rise more than a dollar on the day. The Supreme Court rejected a government request to immediately review the  Microsoft antitrust case, sending it back to the Court of Appeals. Now this is seen as a victory for  Microsoft since the Appeals Court has traditionally been more sympathetic toward the company. And industry watchers say it will most likely delay efforts to break up the software giant.

Guess? Inc. (GES)   

down 9.94 to 9.88   

CHRISTOFOROUS: Investors did beat up on shares of Guess? jeans. That stock sank 50 percent after the company said a difficult retail environment will cause third- and fourth-quarter earnings to come in below estimates.   

And despite higher oil and gas prices, Americans are confident about the economy. The Conference Board's monthly survey showed consumer confidence rose to a near record in September. Optimism about job security boosted the outlook for the rest of the year.

 Wall Street Stocks Fall On Earnings Warning From Kodak.

 NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) - Wall Street stocks fell again Tuesday as a profit warning from Eastman Kodak increased worries about investment returns in a slowing economy. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 175.82 at 10,632. 33 points, extending its loss of 39.22 points Monday. 

 Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 53.27 at 3,687.80 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.90 at 1,430.13. 

 The market plunged after Kodak announced that its third-quarter earnings will be below the expectations because of rising material costs, weakness in euro, the common European currency, and other factors. 

 The latest warning of disappointing earnings hit both blue chips and tech shares. Investors got concerned about investment returns after the first batch of companies warned earlier this month that their earnings in the third quarter will not meet the Wall Street expectations. 

 Concerns about the price of oil and the weakening euro in the recent days intensified worries about corporate earnings and investment returns. The price of sweet crude was 31.53 U.S. dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, down nearly seven dollars last week but worries about its effect on corporate profits remained. 

 While stocks of manufacturers and retailers were lower, energy issues were higher. Among them were Halliburton, Exxon Mobil and Enron. 

 Some tech issues also moved higher. Microsoft rose after the Supreme Court ruled that the software maker's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in lower court. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm was also higher. But Intel fell for the third consecutive session after the chipmaker issued a profit warning late Thursday. 

 The NYSE index fell 4.65 at 654.83 and the American Stock Exchange index fell 0.56 at 928.45. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.49 at 509.89. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-6 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,604 down, 1,284 up and 487 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume increased to 1.09 billion shares from 977.53 million in the previous session.

 PARIS (mktnews) - Euro-zone bonds traded near their lows in negative territory late Wednesday morning, as stocks recovered from a weak start and amid uncertainties about the Danish referendum and wariness about the euro, players said. 

 -The Dec bund opened 8 ticks higher at 105.18 and set a day's high of 105.25 as European stocks opened on a weak tone following the profit warning from Eastman Kodak Co. Tuesday, which hit US stocks. At 10:14 GMT, the Dec bund traded at 104.96, just above the day's low of 104.93. 

 -Although a close result is likely in the Danish referendum on EMU entry, odds are for a "no" vote, said a London trader. Thus, there is still a risk of a euro sell-off on Thursday, which will cap any attempt by EMU bonds to rebound. 

 -Between risks of a "no" vote and uncertainties about forex interventions, players are not expecting the euro to provide any clear direction today. It traded at high end of Tuesday's range around $0.8860. 

 -Dec bund strong resistance seen at 105.45. Stops are reported around 104.78/104.80 with next support at 104.65. 

 -Germany announced earlier Wednesday it would auction a total of E41 bln of securities in 4Q, including E10 bln new 10-yr and E5 bln new 30-yr. 

 -Players reported some selling in 30-yrs and 10-yrs because of the auction. 

 -The 10-yr traded at 5.281% late morning Wed., with the spread vs the 2-yr at 22 bps, wider from from Tuesday, as the 10-year underperformed following an auction. 

 -A Paris primary dealer said there was some selling of the 30-year as the new supply was not expected. The German 10/30-yr spread widened nearly 3 bps to 34 bps after the announcement, and continued around 36 bps. 

 -Recent poor German inflation figures are seen curbing any potential for a decline in yields at the long end, analysts said. Any renewed equities' weakness could trigger further curve steepening, they added.

 Lernout and Hauspie remains upbeat despite troubles

 BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Beleaguered speech recognition software company Lernout and Hauspie said it was upbeat about its future Wednesday even though its share price continued to fall. 

 The Belgian-based company, which has U.S. headquarters in Burlington, Mass., had issued a third-quarter profit warning on Tuesday. 

 Jo Lernout, co-chairman and co-founder of the Belgian company, said that the speech technology market "has taken off." L and H is a world leader in speech recognition and translation software. 

 At a news conference, Lernout played down fears the company could soon fall victim to a takeover bid and denied reports of accounting irregularities which have led to months of decline in L and H's share price. 

 Lernout pledged to provide transparency and regain investor confidence, noting the company has already asked KPMG to make a full audit of the company's entire first half year results. 

 Last week the company said at its U.S. headquarters that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had started conducting an investigation of its financial statements. 

 On Tuesday, L and H issued a statement announcing that third-quarter revenues and earnings will "fall short of analyst expectations" with an estimated net loss of between $ 165 million to $185 million before goodwill amortization. 

 The company makes products that, among other things, allow people to use their speaking voice to dictate documents and control their computers. It also makes translation software and software that reads text documents on a computer out loud. 

 In mid-August, the company announced it would commission an audit after concerns were raised about its Korean division's financial results during the first two quarters of 2000.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A profit warning from Eastman Kodak dragged blue-chip stocks lower Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index erased early gains and joined the downdraft as earnings jitters lingered. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 176.83, or 1.6%, to 10631.32, after slipping 39.22 Monday. The Nasdaq composite skidded 52.12, or 1.4%, to 3689.10 after dropping 62.54 in the previous session. 

 But Joseph DeMarco, managing director of HSBC Asset Management Americas, said despite the recent litany of earnings warnings, the market should stabilize when the earnings reports actually start coming in. 

 Many companies have cited the weak euro and rising oil prices in warnings about earnings for the quarter that ends Saturday. But the euro has recovered about three cents to the dollar since the Federal Reserve and other central banks intervened last week to support the sagging currency. And oil prices have dropped about $6 a barrel from recent 10-year highs after the Clinton administration Friday said it would tap the government's emergency oil supplies.

 Computer-networking company 3Com late Tuesday reported a narrower-than-expected loss for its fiscal first quarter and said it wrapped up a restructuring effort. 

 3Com, which spun off its fast-growing Palm hand-held computer unit in July, said sales fell 23% to $933.8 million but that number includes sales from discontinued businesses. Sales from continuing operations rose 20% to $806.3 million. 

 3Com said it is on or ahead of schedule to meet the objectives it set in March, including the exit from three businesses, work force reductions and a new inventory model, each of which the company said it has completed. Analysts had been waiting to see whether 3Com's remaining businesses could establish a track record of growth.

 Analysts at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have expanded a list of metropolitan areas that face a risk from overbuilding in commercial real estate to 13, adding Denver, Fort Worth, Texas, Jacksonville, Fla., Sacramento, Calif., and Seattle. 

 Atlanta, Charlotte, N.C., Dallas, Las Vegas, Orlando, Fla., Phoenix, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City remain on the list. Expansion of the list came despite tighter standards for inclusion. Under the tougher standards, Nashville, Tenn. was taken off the list. 

 The additions come as the FDIC - recalling how the real-estate market crashed in the late 1980s after some markets overheated - warned banks about having too much exposure to commercial construction in their loan portfolios.

 France's Aventis instructed seed distributors to halt sales of its Starlink corn hybrids, a variety of genetically engineered corn that isn't approved for human consumption. Sales won't resume until it receives clearance from the Environmental Protection Agency. 

 The move is intended to restore public confidence that the grain, genetically engineered to kill an insect, won't enter food channels. The grain is approved for domestic animal feed and nonfood industrial uses only. 

 On Friday, Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris, voluntarily recalled all of the taco shells it sells under the Taco Bell Home Originals name after tests confirmed the presence of StarLink in samples.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A profit warning from Eastman Kodak dragged blue-chip stocks lower Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index erased early gains and joined the downdraft as earnings jitters lingered. 

 Bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note gained nearly 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 holding, pushing the yield down to 5.804%. The 30-year bond added nearly 5/8 to yield 5.854%. 

 The dollar weakened. It traded at 88.28 cents to the euro and 107.63 yen to the dollar, compared with 87.44 cents to the euro and 107.72 yen to the dollar late Monday in New York. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 175.82, or 1.6%, to 10632.33, after slipping 39.22 Monday. The Nasdaq composite skidded 51.31, or 1.4%, to 3689.91 after dropping 62.54 in the previous session. 

 Dow industrial component Eastman Kodak tumbled $14.88, or 25%, to $44.13 by 4 p.m. EDT after the camera and film company said weak September sales growth will contribute to less-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. Kodak's decline accounted for 88 points of the drop in the industrial average. 

 The industrial average also was pulled lower by losses in retailers Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores. Brokers and financial stocks lost ground as well, with J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs Group and Lehman Brothers Holdings all losing ground. 

 The Nasdaq composite had been up nearly 55 points in morning trading, but an afternoon slide in technology stocks pulled the index into the red. Intel, Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase helped pull the index lower. 

 Some tech stocks managed to buck the weak trend. Palm gained $3.25 to $55.50 after posting better-than-expected earnings late Monday, adding that it's having difficulty keeping up with demand for its popular hand-held computer devices. 

 But printer maker Lexmark International plunged $15.31, or 29%, to $37.25 as it scaled back its earnings forecasts for the third and fourth quarters, citing disappointing sales.

 Pirelli, Italy's biggest tire and cable manufacturer, is close to selling part of its fiber-optic telecommunications business to Corning of the U.S. for more than $3 billion, people familiar with the talks said. 

 Pirelli's board was meeting on the deal late Tuesday, and the transaction is likely to be announced Wednesday. Pirelli is expected to get all or most of the money from Corning in cash, people familiar with the matter said. 

 The deal would continue the rationalization of a key part of Pirelli's business. Over the last year, the company has moved to bolster its cable and systems divisions in order to compensate for the slower growth and narrowing margins in its tire business.

 In a bid to win regulatory approval for Deutsche Telekom's proposed acquisition of VoiceStream Wireless of the U.S., the German government has reassured Washington that it is committed to selling its entire stake in the former state telecommunications monopoly. 

 In July, Deutsche Telekom agreed to pay more than $40 billion to purchase VoiceStream. In August, it agreed to another U.S. purchase, paying more than $5 billion for Powertel, a wireless operator that fills a gap in VoiceStream's coverage in the Southeastern region of the U.S. 

 U.S. law prohibits a U.S. telecommunications company from being bought by a foreign company that is more than 25% government-owned.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A profit warning from Eastman Kodak pushed blue chips lower Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index surrendered morning gains as earnings jitters lingered. 

 Bonds were mostly higher. The 10-year Treasury note was unchanged, yielding 5.83%. The 30-year bond was up more than 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 holding, pushing the yield down to 5.88%. 

 The dollar weakened. It traded at 88.16 cents to the euro and 107.52 yen to the dollar, compared with 87.44 cents to the euro and 107.72 yen to the dollar late Monday in New York. 

 At noon EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 124 points at 10684, after slipping 39.22 Monday. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.70 to 3740.50 after dropping 62.54 in the previous session. 

 Dow industrial component Eastman Kodak tumbled $12.31, or 21%, to $46.69 after the camera and film comapny said weak September sales growth will contribute to less-than-expected earnings in the third quarter. Kodak's decline accounted for about 73 points of the drop in the industrial average. 

 The industrial average was also pulled lower by losses in retailers Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores, as the S&P Retail index dropped 2.6%. Brokers and financial stocks were also lower, with Dow components J.P. Morgan, American Express and Citigroup all losing ground. 

 Elsewhere, printer maker Lexmark International plunged $14.12, or 27%, to $38.44 as it scaled back its earnings forecasts for the third and fourth quarters, citing disappointing sales.

 The Supreme Court declined to hear Microsoft's appeal of a landmark antitrust verdict, deciding instead to allow an appeals court a first crack at the case. 

 The decision marks a big win for Microsoft, which had argued that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was the appropriate venue. That court ruled in the company's favor in a previous antitrust case. The government wanted the high court to handle the appeal under the Expediting Act, a little-used statute that allows important antitrust appeals to move directly to the Supreme Court. 

 District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in June ordered Microsoft split in two after concluding that the world's biggest software company violated federal antitrust laws. Judge Jackson's orders are on hold pending Microsoft's appeal.

 Consumer confidence rebounded slightly in September as the strong job market continued to offset the effects of higher oil and gasoline prices. The consumer confidence index rose 1.1 points to 141.9, but still remained considerably lower than the record 144.7 registered in January and May, the Conference Board said.

 Cummins Engine warned it will report lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings because of a "substantial downturn" in the North American heavy-duty truck market and weak European currencies. The maker of diesel engines also said its filtration business has been hurt by the weaker truck market, which has reduced demand for parts.

 Kodak Says 3rd-Quarter Earnings Will Miss Forecasts Because of Weak Sales

 ROCHESTER, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- Eastman Kodak Co. said it expects third-quarter earnings to miss expectations because of slow September sales, weak foreign currencies and high raw-material costs. 

 The world's largest photography-products concern expects third-quarter earnings to fall about 20 cents to 25 cents a share below its previous target range of $1.56 to $1.66 a share. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting Kodak to earn about $1.60 a share. In the year-earlier period, the company posted net income, including charges, of $235 million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $3.58 billion. 

 In a conference call, Kodak Chief Financial Officer Robert Brust also said the company expects sales in the quarter to be $200 million to $300 million lower than it had expected because of across-the-board weakness. 

 Mr. Brust said the guidance assumes that lower film sales made up a majority of the shortfall. While Kodak has seen weakness in Europe for some time because of the dollar's strength against the euro, Mr. Brust said the company is looking for reasons behind the slowdown in U.S. sales. Slowing sales to retailers may signal they are lowering inventories, "but we don't know," he said. 

 Shares of Kodak (EK) tumbled on the profit warning, dropping $14.87, or 25%, to $44.13 at 4 p.m. EDT Tuesday in the pit of the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "Our third-quarter business plans required strong September sales growth to enable us to successfully offset the earnings pressures of a rising dollar, increased raw material costs and higher levels of digital investment," Mr. Brust said in a prepared statement earlier Tuesday. 

 Kodak joins a slew of major companies, including Gillette Co., Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and DuPont Co., that have warned that the dollar's strength against foreign currencies, especially the euro, will hurt earnings. 

 Companies that export into Europe find that their dollar prices, when converted into euros, look high, compared with those of local rivals. 

 Kodak also said that if current sales trends persist and world-wide economic growth continues to slow, it may have to lower its fourth-quarter earnings expectations as well. The company will provide an updated view on its fourth quarter when it announces third-quarter results on Oct. 18. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expect Kodak to earn about $1.44 a share in the fourth quarter and $5.64 for the fiscal year. The company recorded fourth-quarter net income of $475 million, or $1.50 a share, and fiscal 1999 net income of $1.39 billion, or $4.33 a share. 

 The Rochester, N.Y., company has been trying to remodel its business by shifting its focus to digital products, such as cheaper, lower-quality digital cameras, along with a broad restructuring involving cuts in costs and jobs. 

 Earlier this month, Kodak reorganized the management of its $7 billion consumer-imaging division, replacing Robert J. Keegan with Daniel P. Palumbo as president of its largest business unit. Mr. Keegan resigned to become president and chief operating officer of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.

 U.S. Officials Face Tricky Crosswinds In Piloting Economy --- Currency, Oil and Tech Shocks Give Fed and Treasury Pause --- `Stop Admiring Goldilocks'

 How do you pilot a rocket ship to a soft landing?   

 That's the question U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers now confront in managing the U.S. economy.   

 To date, policy makers have been remarkably successful in engineering a modest economic slowdown, thus lowering the odds of inflation. But as last week's turmoil in the stock, oil and currency markets shows, holding the slowing ship on course won't be easy, especially as investors keep expecting their fast ride to continue. They haven't taken well to disappointment.   

 It's a bewildering moment in the life of the U.S.'s longest boom ever. No longer is the economy expanding at the torrid 6% pace of the past year. Instead, it seems to be growing at a more-than-respectable 3% to 4%. Consumers still are buying new cars and homes, just not as rapidly as before.   

 American companies still are thriving, too. But with wages and oil prices rising, their power to boost their own prices limited and their European earnings under pressure from the weak euro, many are finding themselves unable to boost profit as sharply as in recent years.   

 Intel Corp., for example, said last week that its third-quarter revenue would be up 3% to 5% from the second quarter, down from its previous forecast of 9% to 10% growth. DuPont Co. said earlier this month that its 2000 earnings wouldn't hit its bullish target of 17% to 20% growth, but would instead rise at a still-healthy 10% to 14%. In short order, investors delivered a drubbing that cost Intel a quarter of its market value. And DuPont's stock has fallen 16% since the company scaled back its projection.   

 That's in large part a reflection of just how inflated expectations had become. Intel, which in the early 1990s traded at a price of only 11 or 14 times earnings, rode the technology boom to trade at 45 times earnings before its revenue warning walloped the stock on Friday. Companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. are trading at more than 100 times earnings. Implicit in those stock prices is the expectation that their profit growth will continue at its breathless pace, or even accelerate.   

 Now those assumptions may be crumbling. The current quarter "is a bit of a watershed," says Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. By his reckoning, it will be "the first quarter since the (end) of 1998 that earnings will actually come in below expectations." Overall, analysts are lowering their forecasts for profit growth next year to 10.6%, down from an average growth forecast of 12.7% in June and from 18% for this year, according to IBES International.   

 Declining expectations are already having some impact. This year is shaping up to be the market's worst since 1990, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index basically flat through Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite Index both off by about 6%.   

 Then there's the dollar. It has been so strong lately, especially against the euro, that Mr. Summers on Friday joined his European and Japanese counterparts in intervening in currency markets to try to take some steam out of its ascent. He acted only after repeatedly refusing European pleas to do so and stressed that he continues to support a strong dollar.   

 In part, that's because U.S. officials haven't forgotten the first half of the 1980s, when the country's trade deficit was widening steadily and the dollar was soaring, much as it is today, only to crash precipitously, helping to trigger the stock-market collapse of October 1987.   

 For now, the dollar remains solid because foreign investors still are eager to bet on a superior performance by the U.S. economy. But if their perceptions change, says Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, "the dollar would drop like a rock."   

 The recent jump in oil prices has further blurred the picture. With oil an ever-shrinking part of the U.S. economy, the risk of rising prices is less than it was two decades ago, but it still adds to the volatile environment. Among other things, it complicates Mr. Greenspan's task, since the potential inflationary impact makes it harder for him to cut interest rates if economic growth slows too rapidly. And oil prices do pose a huge risk to America's trading partners, threatening to damp demand for U.S. exports at the same time U.S. consumers may be cutting back.   

 "Oil prices are perhaps the largest cloud in a relatively blue sky of the global economy," Mr. Summers said over the weekend at a meeting of world financial leaders in Prague. "Seeing oil prices fall would certainly maximize the prospects for continued global growth," he added.   

 On Friday, just hours after the euro rescue operation, U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration announced its decision to release 30 million barrels of oil from the government's emergency reserve in an effort to head off price spikes.   

 Last week's turmoil ended in relative calm. The Dow Jones industrials rose 81 points Friday, while oil prices fell more than a dollar, and the euro rose. But the preceding few days were a clear reminder that the effort to get the economy's growth "just right" won't be easy.   

 "Now is the time to stress what could go wrong," economist George Perry said at the Prague meetings over the weekend. "It's time to stop admiring Goldilocks and begin worrying if there's a big bear out there."   

 Whether the U.S. economy can surmount these obstacles will depend largely on just how new its vaunted New Economy proves to be. Rapidly rising productivity -- measured in output per man-hour -- has been the main engine of the current prosperity, reflecting the benefits of new technology. If productivity continues its ascent, the economy may be able to stay on course, satisfying both the inflation-fighting demands of the Fed and the high expectations of investors. How much room exists for productivity to rise "is the most important question that we are confronted with," Mr. Greenspan told the U.S. Congress last week.   

 The Fed chairman said he was an optimist: "Clearly we have a good way to go" in reaping the gains from the computer and telecommunications revolution, he added in his testimony.   

 But the economy's performance may also depend on the public's continued confidence in the men at the helm: Messrs. Greenspan and Summers.   

 The veteran Mr. Greenspan continues to be the darling of Wall Street, having so far this year raised interest rates just enough to calm inflation jitters, but not so much as to stir fears of recession.   

 The Treasury secretary also has won plaudits for his first year in office but has been largely untested since he replaced the widely respected Robert Rubin last year. And Mr. Summers had a rocky week last  week. The former Harvard economics professor had strongly advised Mr. Clinton against tapping the oil reserve, in part because of the potential for market distortions. His advice was rejected, and he was forced to issue a crow-eating statement on Thursday suggesting that in such "a rapidly evolving situation" some use of the reserve "could be appropriate."   

 Witnessing the Treasury secretary's change of tune, Rudiger Dornbusch, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, also in Prague, observed: "Rapidly evolving circumstances . . . are (the) famous last words of someone who has lost his virginity."   

 But Mr. Summers had a better day on Friday in his effort to intervene in foreign-exchange markets. Shortly after the move, the euro rose from a record low of 84.4 cents Wednesday to above 90 cents shortly after the intervention, for the first time since early this month, before stabilizing at 87.8 cents. But the euro's modest gain didn't appear to shake the dollar's underlying might.   

 Indeed, Mr. Summers was upbeat on Friday about policy makers' ability to help the economy weather the current storms. "One of the virtues of our economic strategy in recent years" -- larger budget surpluses, stronger banks and the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility -- "has been an increase in the economy's resilience," he said. But that resiliency now faces its greatest test since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.   

 Through the late 1990s, the U.S. economy grew rapidly without fostering worries of straining capacity. In fact, when the Asia crisis spread, the Fed cut interest rates to keep the good times rolling. Last year, however, policy makers grew concerned that the economy's fast growth clip would trigger inflation, which could undermine the U.S.'s long-term well being.   

 So Mr. Greenspan started pushing up short-term interest rates last year, trying to slow the economy down a bit, without bringing the expansion to a halt. But it's hard to fine-tune a major economy with such precision. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr. Greenspan's misjudgment helped bring about a recession.   

 These days there are signs that the Fed's rate increases have had an impact, though it's still uncertain whether that impact has been too much, too little, or just right. The consensus of forecasters surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter is that the U.S.'s inflation-adjusted gross domestic product growth will slip from the second quarter's 5.3% annual pace to 2.9% in the third quarter, then rebound to 3.6% in the fourth quarter.   

 Consumers, whose wealth has grown less markedly this year because of the stagnant stock market, seem to have curbed their shopping binge a bit. "Higher oil prices could help restrain spending even further," says Chris Varvares of Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis, "as people delay or cancel planned purchases of things like clothing because they're paying more at the pump."   

 Interest-rate-sensitive sectors, such as housing and autos, in particular, already are experiencing a slowdown in demand. The U.S. National Association of Home Builders predicts that new-home demand will fall to 820,000 units next year from 907,000 last year. "That would seem to be a big drop, but would still be the highest number of any year between 1982 and 1997," says Michael Carliner, an economist for the trade group.   

 General Motors Corp., meanwhile, has trimmed fourth-quarter production plans by 4%, halving production of its Cadillac Eldorado and laying off 200 workers in Lansing, Michigan. Ford Motor Co. has slowed output of F-Series pickup trucks in Louisville, Kentucky. DaimlerChrysler AG is reducing manufacturing plans for its Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles.   

 Mickey Truck Bodies, a High Point, North Carolina, maker of aluminum van bodies and trailers, is feeling the slowdown more acutely. For the past four years, the company has enjoyed annual sales growth of 20% to 30%. But higher interest rates and energy costs have recently reduced customer demand by 20% from year-earlier levels. "I've been in this business a long time, and I've never seen such a ramp-up and then have it tumble so quickly," says Dean Sink, the company's president.   

 While many companies' revenues are stagnating or even declining, their costs are starting to rise. Union Pacific Railroad Inc., based in Omaha, Nebraska, has been hit by the double-whammy of rising fuel and labor costs. A 55% spike in diesel prices in the first half of the year, followed by a jump of about 30% in the past few months -- is pushing its operating costs up by 10%. The railroad also expects health-care premiums for its workers to rise 14% to 20% this year.   

 At the same time, workers are beginning to have more power to push up wages. Embattled tire maker Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. was forced to give its union members raises of as much as 10% a year as the price for avoiding a strike. Pilots at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines negotiated instant 20%-plus raises, with four years of 4% increases to follow. The U.S. Labor Department's employment cost index, which reflects benefits and wages, rose 4.4% in the year ended June 30, the most recent for which figures are available. That's the biggest annual jump in nine years.   

 When demand throughout the U.S. economy was soaring earlier this year, a few companies were able to pass those costs on. Now, however, the Fed concludes in its most recent survey of regional economic conditions, released last week, that "despite rising costs for inputs, competitive pressures prevented manufacturers in most districts from raising prices."   

 Slowing global consumer demand, rising costs and minimal pricing power: As it has been in the past, that could be the formula for a severe profit crunch. Yet many analysts and investors believe that a continuous cycle of high-tech-led productivity increases has made the U.S. economy less vulnerable to such a threat.   

 Over the past year, the big economic surprise has been that productivity gains have accelerated. This has allowed many companies to absorb rising fuel and labor costs without hurting earnings. Economywide, labor costs per unit of output fell by 0.4% in the second quarter -- the first year-to-year decline in 16 years -- even as compensation cost per worker accelerated.   

 Part of the reason why can be seen at Darden Inc.'s Olive Garden restaurants, where high-tech cash registers help managers figure out how many workers are really needed at different times of the day. The machines also send diners' orders directly to the cooks, cutting down on the trips servers need to make to the kitchen. As a result, the company's labor costs as a percentage of revenue have fallen by as much as 0.8% per quarter -- even as health-care costs per worker have risen 10% this year, up from 6% last year, and wages have risen 5%. Earnings per share for the latest quarter jumped 31%, nearly twice the growth analysts had expected.   

 These sorts of efficiency gains enable the economy to keep growing, without the threat of inflation. As a result, "The U.S. is not landing," says Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor, "It is just flying lower."   

 Lured by the prospect of increased productivity, companies have continued to invest in high-tech equipment, and such investments have helped support the broader economy's growth, even as other sectors have softened. Ed Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, says that industrial production for nonhigh-tech goods has been flat this year, while "high-tech production is off the charts -- for telecommunications products, computers and semiconductors it's up 53% year over year." The "slowing Old Economy could actually increase competitive pressures to spend more on New Economy goods because companies are desperate to increase productivity, cutting costs and offsetting falling demand," he says.   

 Still, Intel's disappointing disclosure last week was just one of a handful of recent signs that demand for the building blocks of the Internet economy may not be as unlimited as current stock prices assume. Stocks of telecom-equipment makers, such as Lucent Technologies Inc., have gotten clobbered recently amid concerns that growth in demand for their products is slowing. Qwest Communications International Inc., for example, expects to boost spending on telecommunications infrastructure equipment next year by just $500 million, well short of this year's $2 billion increase. Sprint Corp. delivered its own scare to the market last week with a warning that slower-than-expected cell phone subscriptions growth would nick earnings.   

 Even where demand remains strong, it may not be quite strong enough to justify the huge expansion in capacity driven by investor enthusiasm. "The great desire to buy tech stocks at any price has led to overcapacity and too many competitors in these businesses," says Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist newsletter. "There are too many people in wireless, too many bidding for the wireless spectrum, too many people building out fiber-optic networks."   

 MIT's Mr. Dornbusch expects only a "gradual sell-off" of stocks and the dollar as reality sets in, with a limited impact on the economy. But he acknowledges it could get worse. "If people cannot accept an earnings fall, then growth falls, the dollar falls, everything falls," he says. "It could be ugly."

 NEW YORK, Sept 26 (AFP) - Stocks moved sharply lower Tuesday as jitters over earnings spread to all sectors a profit warning from blue-chip stock Eastman Kodak. 

 The Dow Jones industrials slid 176.83 points (1.64 percent) to close at 10,631.32 and the Nasdaq fell 52.11 points (1.39 percent) to 3,689.11. 

 The broader Standard and Poor's 500 declined 11.82 points (0.82 percent) to 1,427.21. 

 Kodak said Tuesday that September sales are likely to fall short of planned levels, resulting in lower than anticipated third quarter earnings. 

 The photographic giant also said that "if current sales trends persist and worldwide economic growth continues to slow, a downward revision to fourth quarter earnings expectations may be necessary." 

 Kodak is the latest among US companies to warn that earnings may fall short of expectations for the third quarter, largely due to the impact of the slumping euro and higher costs for energy and raw materials. 

 One of the 30 Dow components, Kodak shares plunged 14-5/8, or 25 percent to 44-3/8, their lowest level in a year. Kodak alone accounted for half of the drop in the Dow index. 

 Dealers also said that adding to worries for the broader market was Lexmark, which fell 15-5/16 to close at 37-1/4 after warning its third-quarter and fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected due to slow inkjet cartridge sales and the weak euro. 

 Dealers said the two warnings fuel ongoing concerns over corporate profits in an environment of slower US growth, high energy prices and a  weak euro, as the market approaches the third-quarter earnings season. 

 "We're seeing increasing concerns about third-quarter earnings," noted Barry Hyman, market strategist at Weatherly Securities. "Everything is being marked down now. It looks like there was mass dumping of weak stocks today as we near the end of the third quarter." 

 Pharmaceutical shares were caught in the downdraft despite positive comments from Merrill Lynch: Johnson and Johnson slipped 1- 7/16 a 94-7/16, Merck shed 15/16 to 71-1/2, Bristol Myers 1/4 to 57- 3/16 and Pfizer 1/4 to 43-7/8. 

 Tech shares were also under pressure. Intel, which roiled the markets with its own profit warning last week and tumbled 20 percent, fell another 1-15/16 to 43-7/16 dollars. 

 Elsewhere in the sector, IBM was off 2-3/8 to 119-5/16, Hewlett- Packard 3-1/16 at 98-1/4 and Cisco Systems 2-1/4 to 54-15/16. 

 Microsoft was among the few shares to hold up during the selloff, helped by a US Supreme Court decision rejecting a fast-track appeal of the government's antitrust case. 

 Microsoft shares ended the day up 1-3/8 at 62-5/8. 

 Among financials, Chase Manhattan fell 1-7/16 to 46-1/16 dollars, Bank of America 1-3/16 to 53-13/16, JP Morgan 3-11/16 to 164-1/16 and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 3-7/8 to 88-9/16. 

 On the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond eased to 5.799 percent from 5.833 percent Monday and on the 30-year bond to 5.852 percent from 5.891 percent.

 Wall Street Stocks Fall on Earnings Warning From Kodak (RPT With Corrections).

 NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) - Wall Street stocks fell again Tuesday as a profit warning from Eastman Kodak increased worries about investment returns in a slowing economy. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 176.83 at 10,631. 32 points, extending its loss of 39.22 points Monday. 

 Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 52.12 at 3,689.10 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 11.82 at 1,427.21. 

 The market plunged after Kodak announced that its third-quarter earnings will be below the expectations because of rising material costs, weakness in euro, the common European currency, and other factors. 

 The latest warning of disappointing earnings hit both blue chips and tech shares. Investors got concerned about investment returns after the first batch of companies warned earlier this month that their earnings in the third quarter will not meet the Wall Street expectations. 

 Concerns about the price of oil and the weakening euro in the recent days intensified worries about corporate earnings and investment returns. The price of sweet crude was 31.53 U.S. dollars a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange today, down nearly 7 dollars last week but worries about its effect on corporate profits remained. 

 While stocks of manufacturers and retailers were lower, energy issues were higher. Among them were Halliburton, Exxon Mobil and Enron. 

 Some tech issues also moved higher. Microsoft rose after the Supreme Court ruled that the software maker's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in lower court. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm was also higher. But Intel fell for the third consecutive session after the chipmaker issued a profit warning late Thursday. 

 The NYSE index fell 4.65 at 654.83 and the American Stock Exchange index fell 0.56 at 928.45. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 5.49 at 509.89. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-6 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,604 down, 1,284 up and 487 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume increased to 1.09 billion shares from 977.53 million in the previous session.

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET COVERAGE:   OK Kodak (URL: http://www.kodak.com/)  is not the only stock making waves today. 

 TONY GUIDA, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET COVERAGE:  Let`s get a closer look at that from Rhonda Schaffler.  She`s on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. And Rhonda, even though Kodak`s taken about 70 points out of the Dow, there`s plenty of other problems around. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  That`s right.  It really is less than picture perfect.  When you go beyond Kodak and see some of the groups that are struggling. Technology stocks, we`ve got to point out, day after day what we`re seeing here on the big board, is the most actively traded stocks are tech or telecom related by and large.   They continue to trend lower. Micron Technology (URL: http://www.micron.com/) one of the few exception in that group. You also have weakness in financial stocks today and some of the pharmaceuticals, so there`s a lot of selling out there and it`s one reason why the Dow -- you know even when you take Kodak out of it, it just can`t make any headway. In fact it continues to drift toward session lows. Another thing going on here beyond Kodak is just this general worries about profits that do not go away. We`ve got a couple of more companies that were out with warnings today. Kodak trading at a new 52-week low as will all of the stocks that we`re going to be showing you momentarily and the first one we`re going to talk about is Lexmark International (URL: http://www.lexmark.com/) . Profit warning from this one sending that stock tumbling. Lexmark basically saying that its third and fourth quarter will be lower than expected and the reason for that is an inventory bubble it says of ink-jet cartridges and also weakness in the euro one of those ongoing themes in this particular reporting season. PaineWebber, Bear Stearns cutting estimates on Lexmark which as you can see is down sharply. 

 Another stock down sharply, in fact pretty much losing half of its value give or take a couple percents today, is Guess ? (URL: http://www.guess.com/) .  This too out with a profit warning saying for the third quarter expect 35 to 38 cents a share rather than the 44 cents that Wall Street was betting for and a struggling retail environment is what Guess cited.  That stock getting pounded today.  Media General (URL: http://www.media-general.com/) is another stock that is selling off sharply. It warned its third quarter earnings will be  in a range of 30-40 cents and the street was looking for 51 cents.  It`s an industry wide advertising slump.  That particular stock also getting pounded. You can see it`s one of those here trading in dollars and cents,  now down nearly $5.50 a share at about 43 1/2. DLJ cut its rating on the stock to market perform from buy. 

 All these earnings warnings we keep talking about, something to keep in mind.   According to First Call, a couple minute ago I spoke with them, the number of warning and the trimming of estimates no more or less this quarter than what we normally see.  So this is all very normal.  Maybe you might not find the market`s reaction to it comforting, but it`s very normal. The earnings are coming in.  There are reductions in estimates and a number of profit warnings are coming in as you would expect and right now according to First call, the estimate for the third quarter is 16 1/2 percent earning growth. Chuck Hill says it`ll probably come in closer to 19 percent.  So just keep that in perspective as we watch the market slump off here every day.  Tony, Bill. 

 TUCKER: Yes, that is what we`ll do.  We`ll sit up here and chant the little mantra Rhonda.  It`s normal, it`s normal, it`s normal, it`s normal. 

 SCHAFFLER:  Well, it`s September too.  That`s the problem.  Other people say this was just such a month, it gives everyone the willies here, that they want it to be over and we`re now going to come into end of month, end of quarter buying and selling on portfolios.  We`ve had a  loss of losing stocks this month and  if people want to write them off the books,  they`ll have only a couple days to do that. So it should be an interesting rest of the week here. 

 TUCKER: All right Rhonda. Rhonda Schaffler at the New York Stock Exchange.

 - Price Chopping Along Supply Chain As Circuit City Exits Appliance Business - Soft 3Q Expected But Some Hope For Recovery Before Year's End - No Slowdown Reported At Retail Level, Which Benefits From Low Prices 

 By Gary Rosenberger 

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - Household durables manufacturers say Circuit City's exit from the appliance business and unusually mild weather in the Northeast are having big repercussions on factory shipments and pricing. 

 The biggest hit was on room air-conditioners, where mild weather descended on its most important markets, but no major appliance was spared this summer, they say. 

 To compensate, manufacturers are price-chopping at wholesale and cutting back on production to stave off inventory buildups. 

 Retailers confirm they've seen prices slashed at wholesale and that they're passing the savings to consumers, who for the most part are out in force. 

 While the industry has entered a period of gloom after an unexpectedly brisk first half of the year, some manufacturers foresee a recovery possibly before year's end. 

 The unanticipated loss of Circuit City compelled Whirlpool and other manufacturers to issue profit warnings in late August, said Christopher Wyse at Whirlpool Corp. in Benton Harbor, Michigan. 

 Wyse said despite the second half slowing, Whirlpool's original expectations of a 2% to 3% increase in shipments from a record '99 remain essentially unchanged. 

 Whirlpool's profit warning in late August stated that Whirlpool would lose 120 days of expected shipments to Circuit City, affecting between 250,000 and 300,000 units, Wyse said. 

 That creates "a strong, competitive pricing dynamic" for as long as it takes Circuit City's competitors and new entrants into the appliance business to take up the slack, he said. 

 "The appliance industry is traditionally very competitive - there have been negative price trends throughout the year," Wyse said. He would not offer further specifics on the extent of the price drops. 

 "I don't want to leave your readers with a sense of gloom and doom," he added. "We are expecting to return to more normal levels of performance by the end of the year and expect to enter next year with good momentum." 

 Wyse noted some positives in an otherwise down market - potential growth prospects from Lowes (now the nation's second-biggest appliance retailer), Home Depot's entrance into the appliance business and Walmart's announcement that it would test market major appliances. 

 Best Buy, Circuit City's nearest competitor, has recently agreed to procure Whirlpool's KitchenAid lines, suggesting it already is taking up some of the slack, Wyse said. 

 At the retail level, there appears to be no noticeable slackening in appliance spending, retailers said. 

 Sears, the nation's largest appliance retailer, said it expects same-store sales to increase in the low-single digits for the month and home appliances are the "leading category." 

 Robert Cremer, who owns Aronson Furniture, Appliances and Electronics in Chicago, said he sees no economic slowdown from the standpoint of floor traffic. 

 "We have not seen any sign of a slowdown," he stated flatly. If anything, "floor traffic has increased" as his store expands into more brand name appliance lines. 

 Cremer, who belongs to a large buying group, said he has "seen some deals coming down the pike that are very, very interesting and that we certainly want to take advantage of." 

 He said some of the savings goes into maintaining gross profits while the rest gets passed on to consumers as the competitive situation dictates. 

 "Shipments have slowed in July and August with numbers down versus last year," said Evan Barrington of the Stevenson Company in Louisville, Kentucky, a market research firm devoted to household appliances. 

 "There have been two key factors over the last couple of months, with the first being that consumer spending has slowed some from the frenetic pace of the first half," he said. 

 The second factor, of course, is Circuit City's announcement it was getting out of the home appliance business. Circuit City blamed tight margins and said floor space would be better served with consumer electronics that people could carry out of the store. 

 Barrington estimates that Circuit City's departure left a $1.5 billion dollar hole for manufacturers to fill in. "Once Circuit City made the announcement, they immediately stopped taking shipments," he said. But Barrington does not view the impact as long-lasting. 

 "In the short term Circuit City has all this product on the floor and in warehouses that it's getting rid of and not replacing," he said. "Eventually consumers will have to get their appliances from somewhere - so in terms of overall production, Circuit City's exit shouldn't matter." 

 He too noted that Home Depot, Lowes and, to a lesser extent, Walmart have the potential to expand their market positions in home appliances. 

 "Home Depot is being a formidable competitor - they've made lots of progress over the last year or so and they're tied into the remodeling market," he said. 

 Walmart's future in appliances is a bit more murky because at this stage they're only test marketing, Barrington said. 

 "Is Walmart in a position to sell large appliances? Most stuff you buy at Walmart you fit into a shopping cart and take to your car - you can't do that with a refrigerator," he said. "But if they get serious they would change the landscape of the industry." 

 Barrington "suspects" that Circuit City's appliance business for now will go to Sears, Best Buy, Lowes and a number of regional players. 

 According to the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers factory shipments for the six major home appliances - ranges, dishwashers, refrigerators, washers, dryers and freezers - were down 8.2% in August and 6.7% in July. 

 When room air conditioners and microwaves are added on overall industry shipments were down 4.9% in August and 9.8% in July. 

 The July numbers were skewed higher by the poor performance of room airconditioners, while by August the airconditioning season is over, Barrington said. 

 The Commerce Department is scheduled to release August durable goods orders Wednesday, Sept. 27 at 8:30 a.m. EDT. Durable goods orders were down 12.4% in July after a 9.2% rise in June.

 U.S. Says Firm-Dollar Policy Is In Place Despite Intervention --- Joint Statement Makes Clear ECB Initiated Euro Rescue --- Treasury Secretary Set Conditions on U.S. Role Before Friday's Swoop

 PRAGUE -- The U.S. finally joined Europe in attempting to rescue the beleaguered euro, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wants everyone to know that boosting the 11-nation common currency doesn't mean he's abandoning the strong-dollar policy that has been a mainstay of Clinton administration economic policy for the past five years.   

 In the first U.S.-supported intervention in currency markets since Mr. Summers became secretary, the U.S., Europe, Japan, Britain and Canada bought euros Friday, stopping -- at least for one day -- the 21-month-old currency's tailspin.   

 The euro had fallen to 85.73 U.S. cents Friday morning, and was already rising when the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and the European Central Bank intervened, pushing the currency up to 90.40 cents. By late trading in New York, the euro had slipped a bit, to 87.84 cents.   

 The intervention came 15 years to the day after G-7 economic officials met at the Plaza Hotel in New York and agreed, successfully, to push down the U.S. dollar. But U.S. officials prefer parallels to the June 1998 U.S. move to help Japan boost the yen, which left the dollar in a strong position against the currencies of other major trading partners. For the moment, Mr. Summers seems to have pulled off his tightrope walk, if investor reaction is any guide. The dollar rose Friday against the yen, trading at 108.03 yen compared with 106.67 yen late Thursday.   

 The G-7 said it acted out of "shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy." But Mr. Summers made sure the Europeans agreed that their announcement would say that the action took place "at the initiative of the European Central Bank," a loud hint that the U.S. is willing to help, but doesn't want to undermine its strong-dollar stance. The administration credits that dollar policy for helping restrain inflation, attracting foreign investors and preventing the red-hot American economy from glowing white. Plus, the U.S. economic team was undoubtedly eager to avert any possibility -- however small -- that an official move to boost the euro at the dollar's expense might spark a larger flight from the greenback by investors worried about the huge U.S. trade deficit.   

 After a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Prague Saturday, French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius argued the move should reassure those in policy circles and financial markets dismayed at the contradictory signals European officials have sent during the euro's steady descent from a high of around $1.18 shortly after its creation in January 1999. "This all shows us the statements of Europeans can't be taken lightly," Mr. Fabius said.   

 Mr. Summers' decision to join the European action, taken in consultation with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, added the credibility that markets craved. And G-7 officials made clear they were willing to intervene again if circumstances warranted.   

 "The real surprise is that . . . the U.S. was on board," said Joachim Fels, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. economist in London. "And that makes me very confident that the move will be effective in putting a floor under the euro both against the dollar and the Japanese yen. It was the right move at the right time."   

 The Europeans, loath to seem like a charity case, spread the word around financial meetings in Prague that the U.S. agreed to their request because the Clinton team believe the weak euro presents a threat to the U.S. stock market. Several American companies, including Intel Corp., have blamed the euro's fall euro for disappointing profits.   

 A German Finance Ministry official, who asked not to be named, said he believed Intel's profit warning late Thursday and the fall in U.S. stock markets the following day "helped make the point."   

 "The U.S. realized that they have to have a balanced policy, a strong-dollar policy, but they also have to take into account profits and equity markets, and what the euro could do to them," he said.   

 Actually the decision had been taken hours before the Intel news went public. And while U.S. officials weighed those broad considerations, their choice appears based mostly on a belief that the global economy would be better off if Europe -- because of its economic importance -- had a more stable and stronger currency and if their policy makers acted in a way that inspired confidence instead of confusion.   

 "The U.S. is seen in Europe as being anti-euro," said economist Rudi Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Not supporting the currency would confirm everything the Europeans believe about the U.S."   

 The big test of whether the central banks have succeeded comes when markets open this morning. Wim Duisenberg, president of the ECB, talked of an "orderly reversal" of the euro's movements, while other G-7 officials were more vague about what constitutes victory and stressed that the important thing was to signal investors that government won't stand aside indefinitely.   

 "If you stabilize it, that's a good thing; if you reverse some of it, that could be construed as a good thing," said one senior G-7 official. "Nobody is under the illusion that such an action by the central bank is going to dictate the exchange rate."   

 The Europeans began talking about intervention Sept. 9 at a gathering in Versailles, France, and then began courting Washington Tuesday. U.S. officials launched a series of conference calls among themselves to figure out whether it made sense to join in, should the Europeans ask. On the line were Mr. Summers, Mr. Greenspan, Peter Fisher of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy Geithner, undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, and Assistant Treasury Secretary Ted Truman. One thing that made them especially cautious about risking intervention was uncertainty about why the euro was falling so fast, and, therefore, whether intervention would work.   

 On Thursday afternoon European time, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, an Italian member of the ECB executive committee, called Mr. Fisher, and Mario Draghi, director-general of the Italian Treasury and a key figure in euro issues, called Mr. Geithner. Both Europeans indicated that they thought it would make sense to act soon. After all, intervention ahead of the G-7 meeting Saturday would catch markets unaware and boost its effectiveness.   

 "Had they not done it, the big story out of Prague and in financial markets would have been the breakdown in cooperation between the U.S. and EU, because it was clear the Europeans . . . were going to make this a huge issue here," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.   

 Around midday Thursday in Washington, as Mr. Greenspan was testifying on Capitol Hill and Mr. Summers was seeking House Majority Dick Armey's backing for debt relief for poor nations, their aides hastily arranged another conference call, this time discussing conditions the U.S. would demand in return for its participation in the euro-rescue operation. One item on the list was that the announcement must specify the move was the Europeans' idea.   

 Mr. Greenspan then took a call from Mr. Duisenberg, who said the ECB wanted to intervene the next day -- just after 7 a.m. Washington time -- and to secure U.S. support. Mr. Greenspan laid out the U.S. conditions, and Mr. Duisenberg assented. The Europeans then contacted their Japanese, Canadian and British counterparts to let them know the U.S. was game, and U.S. officials confirmed with their own calls.   

 The joint central-bank action on Friday -- buying $3 billion to $5 billion of euros, according to Deutsche Bank estimates -- certainly achieved the element of surprise. And the move gives Mr. Summers a chance to take a final step out of the shadow of his predecessor, Robert Rubin, a former trader beloved on Wall Street.   

 The Clinton administration has now carried out eight major foreign-exchange interventions, and Mr. Summers -- in earlier jobs at Treasury -- was influential in Mr. Rubin's decisions. Yet traders still wondered how he would handle the moment when it came. "Both for Larry and for the ECB it is in a sense a first test in the area of foreign-exchange intervention," said Harvard Prof. Jeffrey A. Frankel, a former Clinton economic adviser. "In both cases they would have stood to lose some face or credibility if it didn't work."   

 Now "people will stop asking the question about whether he has the same credibility with the markets that Rubin did," Mr. Frankel said.   

 It was the credibility issue that was key to the European decision, as well. Euro-zone officials worried that investors and voters were losing confidence in the monetary union, an especially sensitive subject, with the Danes slated to vote Thursday on whether to throw in their lot with the collective currency, and popular discontent with the euro surfacing in Germany.

 U.S. Efforts to Steady Markets Signal Tricky Landing Ahead --- Currency, Oil and Tech-Stock Shocks Give Fed and Treasury Pause --- High Expectations Are Making the Task All the More Difficult

 How do you navigate the soft landing of a rocket ship?   

 That's the question Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers now confront in their management of the U.S. economy. To date, they've been remarkably successful in engineering a modest slowdown. But as last week's turmoil in the stock, oil and foreign-exchange markets demonstrates, keeping that slowing ship on course won't be easy, especially since investors here and abroad keep expecting a continuation of the economy's stellar performance, and take disappointment badly.   

 It's an extraordinary and bewildering moment in the life of the longest boom in U.S. history. Growth in the U.S. economy is clearly moderating, but not precipitously. No longer is the U.S. expanding at the torrid 6% pace of earlier this year -- the kind of growth seen mainly in developing countries. Instead, it seems to be growing at a more-than-respectable 3% to 4% rate. Consumers are still buying new cars and new homes, just not with the same abandon as earlier in the year.   

 American companies are still thriving too. But with wages and oil prices rising, European earnings under pressure from the weak euro, and pricing power for their own products limited, they aren't able to boost profits at the frantic levels of recent years. The "shock" from Intel Corp. last week was that its revenue would rise a solid 3% to 5% in the current quarter, down from the 9% to 10% previously forecast. DuPont Co. said earnings growth this year won't hit its bullish target of 17% to 20%, but still will reach 10% to 14%.   

 In an economy built on wildly optimistic expectations for the future, even these sorts of minor adjustments can prove jarring. In short order, Intel lost a quarter of its market value. And DuPont stock is down 16% since the company unveiled its earnings outlook earlier this month.   

 That's in large part a reflection of just how inflated expectations had become. Intel, which in the early 1990s traded at a price of only 10 or 15 times earnings, rode the technology boom to trade at 45 times earnings before its revenue warning walloped its stock Friday. Companies like Cisco Systems Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. are trading at more than 100 times earnings. Implicit in those unprecedented prices is the expectation that profit growth will continue at its breathless pace, or even accelerate.   

 Now those assumptions may be crumbling. The current quarter "is a bit of a watershed," says Doug Cliggott, U.S. investment strategist at J.P. Morgan. By his reckoning, it will be "the first quarter since the fall of 1998 that earnings will actually come in below expectations." Overall, analysts are lowering their outlook for profit growth next year to 10.6%, from the 12.7% prediction in June, and from the 18% growth expected this year.   

 Falling expectations are already having an impact. This year is shaping up to be the U.S. market's worst since 1990. The S&P 500 is basically flat through Friday, while both the Dow and Nasdaq are off about 6%.   

 Then there's the dollar. It has been so strong lately, especially against the euro, that Mr. Summers Friday joined his counterparts from Europe and Japan in intervening in currency markets to try to take some oomph out of its ascent. He did so only after repeatedly refusing European pleas, and stressed that he continued to support a strong dollar.   

 Indeed, U.S. officials are acutely aware that when it comes to currencies, what goes up may also come down. They haven't forgotten the experience of the 1980s, whose first half was a time -- much like now -- of widening trade deficits and a soaring dollar, and whose second half was marked by a precipitous crash in the dollar that helped trigger the stock-market collapse of October 1987.   

 For now, the dollar remains solid because foreigners are still eager to bet their portfolios on America. Mr. Summers's biggest nightmare is a sharp reversal in that psychology -- especially at a time when investors may also be rethinking the future of the American tech boom. If perceptions of the relative superiority of the U.S. economy change, says Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, "the dollar would drop like a rock."   

 Further soiling the economic outlook, oil prices have taken to the skies just as the economy is landing. With oil an ever-shrinking part of the U.S. economy, the risk of rising prices is less than it was two decades ago. Still, that too adds to the volatile environment. Among other things, rising oil prices complicate Mr. Greenspan's task, since their potential inflationary impact makes it harder for him to cut interest rates if demand slows too much.   

 On Friday, just hours after the euro rescue operation, the Clinton administration announced it was going to get into the oil business as well, releasing 30 million barrels of oil from the government's emergency reserve in an effort to head off price spikes.   

 Last week's turmoil ended in relative calm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Friday up 81 points, while oil prices fell more than a dollar and the euro rose. But the frantic few days were a clear reminder that the effort to get the economy's growth "just right" won't be easy.   

 "Now is the time to stress what could go wrong," economist George Perry told a group at the IMF meetings in Prague over the weekend. "It's time to stop admiring Goldilocks and begin worrying if there's a big bear out there."   

 Whether the U.S. economy can navigate these risky times will depend largely on just how new its vaunted new economy proves to be. Rapidly rising productivity -- the economic output per man-hour in the economy -- has been the main engine of the current prosperity, reflecting the benefits of new technology. If it continues its ascent, the U.S. economy may be able to continue on course, satisfying both the inflation-fighting demands of the Federal Reserve and the high expectations of investors in U.S. stocks and currency. How much further productivity can rise "is the most important question that we are confronted with," Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week.   

 The underlying optimism, while a bit shaken lately, has stayed strong. Mr. Greenspan, for one, sounds upbeat. "Clearly we have a good way to go" in reaping the gains from the computer and telecommunications revolution, he added during his recent testimony.   

 The course of the U.S. economy may also depend on continued confidence in the men at the helm: Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Summers.   

 The veteran Fed Chairman continues as the darling of Wall Street, having so far this year raised interest rates just enough to calm inflation jitters, but not so much as to stir fears of recession.   

 The Treasury Secretary has gone relatively untested in the year since he took over from the venerated Robert Rubin, and he had a rocky week last week. The former Harvard economics professor had vehemently counseled Mr. Clinton against using the oil reserve, in part because of potential market distortions. His advice was rejected, and he was forced to issue a crow-eating statement suggesting that in such "a rapidly evolving situation" some use of the reserve "could be appropriate."   

 Witnessing the Treasury Secretary's changing attitude on oil sales and currency sales, which he attributed to changing circumstances, MIT economist Rudiger Dornbusch, also in Prague, quipped: "Rapidly evolving circumstances ... are famous last words of someone who has lost his virginity."   

 But Mr. Summers had a better day Friday in his effort to intervene in exchange markets. Shortly after the move, the euro rose from a record low of 84 cents toward 90 cents -- a level not visited since early September -- before stabilizing at a somewhat lower level.   

 Indeed, Mr. Summers was upbeat about the ability of policymakers to help the U.S. economy weather the current storms as he headed to Prague himself Friday afternoon, for a weekend meeting with Mr. Greenspan and their Group of Seven counterparts. "One of the virtues of our economic strategy in recent years" -- larger budget surpluses, stronger banks and the rock-solid credibility of the Fed in fighting inflation -- "has been an increase in the economy's resilience," he asserted.   

 That resiliency now faces its greatest test since the Asia crisis of 1997-98.   

 The Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates by nearly two percentage points over the past year, and there are clear signs that the hypercharged growth of the past two years has moderated. The consensus of forecasters surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter sees inflation-adjusted gross domestic product growth slipping from the 5.3% annual pace in the second quarter to a 2.9% rate in the third quarter, and then rebounding to 3.6% in the fourth quarter.   

 Consumers, whose wealth has grown less robustly this year because of the stagnant stock market, seem to have curbed their shopping urges a bit. "Higher oil prices could help restrain spending even further," says Chris Varvares of Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis, "as people delay or cancel planned purchases of things like clothing because they're paying more at the pump."   

 Feeling the hit particularly are interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and automobiles. The National Association of Home Builders sees demand for new homes falling to 820,000 units next year from a whopping 907,000 last year. "That would seem to be a big drop, but would still be the highest number of any year between 1982 and 1997," says Michael Carliner, an association economist.   

 General Motors Corp. has trimmed fourth-quarter production plans by 4%, slashing production of its Cadillac Eldorado in half and laying off 200 workers in Lansing, Michigan. Ford Motor Co. has slowed output of F-Series pickup trucks in Louisville, Kentucky. DaimlerChrysler AG is scaling back manufacturing plans for its Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs.   

 Mickey Truck Bodies, a High Point, North Carolina, maker of aluminum van bodies and trailers, is feeling the slowdown more acutely. For the last four years, the company enjoyed annual sales growth of 20% to 30%. But higher interest rates and energy costs have recently pushed customer demand down 20% below year-earlier levels. "I've been in this business a long time, and I've never seen such a ramp up and then have it tumble so quickly," says Dean Sink, the company president.   

 While top-line revenues for many companies are flattening or even declining, bottom-line costs are starting to rise.   

 Omaha-based Union Pacific Railroad Inc. has been hit by the double-whammy of fuel and labor costs. A 59% spike in diesel prices in the first half of the year -- then another jump by one-third over the summer -- is pushing total operating costs up by 10%. The railroad also expects health-care premiums for its workers to rise 14% to 20% this year, a burden many big companies are facing.   

 On the wage side, workers are feeling an increase in their bargaining power. The embattled tire maker Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. was forced to give its union members raises of up to 10% per year as the price for avoiding a strike. Pilots at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines negotiated instant 20%-plus raises, with four years of decent 4% raises to follow. The Labor Department's employment cost index -- measuring both benefits and wages -- rose 4.4% in the year ended June 30, the most recent figure available, the biggest annual jump in nine years.   

 When demand throughout the economy was soaring earlier this year, a few companies were able to pass those costs on. Now, though, "despite rising costs for inputs, competitive pressures prevented manufacturers in most districts from raising prices," concluded the Fed concluded in its most recent survey of regional economic conditions, released last week.   

 Slowing consumer demand around the world, rising costs, and minimal pricing power. That could be -- and has been in the past -- a formula for a severe crunch in profits.   

 Yet many analysts and investors continue to believe that a virtuous cycle of high-tech-led productivity increases has made the U.S. economy less vulnerable to such a threat.   

 The big surprise in the economy over the past year has been that productivity gains have continued to accelerate beyond the elevated late-1990s levels. These new efficiencies have allowed many companies to absorb even the current rising fuel and labor costs without hurting earnings. Economy-wide, labor costs per unit of output fell by 0.4% in the second quarter -- the first year-over-year drop in 16 years -- even as compensation cost per worker accelerated.   

 Cash registers at Darden Inc.'s Olive Garden restaurants help managers figure out how many workers are really needed at different times of the day. The machines also transmit orders directly to the cooks, cutting down the time servers have to go back and forth to the kitchen. As a result, labor costs as a percentage of revenues are falling by up to 0.8% per quarter -- even as health-care costs per worker are rising 10% this year, up from 6% last year, and wages are rising 5%. Earnings per share for the latest quarter jumped 31% from the year-earlier period, nearly twice the pace analysts had expected.   

 These sorts of efficiency gains enable the economy to keep growing, without threatening inflation. As a result, "The U.S. is not landing," says Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's finance minister. "It is just flying lower."   

 The prospects of higher productivity have also persuaded companies to keep spending on high-tech equipment, and such investment has helped support the U.S. economy's growth, even as other sectors have softened. Ed Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, says that industrial production for non-high-tech goods has been flat this year, while "high-tech production is off the charts -- for telecommunications products, computers and semiconductors it's up 53% year over year."   

 He argues, in fact, that the "slowing Old Economy could actually increase competitive pressures to spend more on New Economy goods because companies are desperate to increase productivity, cutting costs and offsetting falling demand."   

 Still, last week's disappointing Intel report was just one of a handful of recent signs that demand for the building blocks of the Internet economy -- and all the wonderful implications for the U.S. economy as a whole -- may not be as unlimited as current stock prices assume. Telecom equipment makers like Ciena Corp. have seen their stocks hit over concerns that sector is slowing. For example, Qwest Communications International expects to boost spending on telecommunications infrastructure equipment this year by just $500 million (575 million euros), compared with an increase of $2 billion last year. Sprint Corp. gave its own scare to the market last week with a warning that slower-than-expected cell phone subscriptions would nick earnings.   

 And even where demand remains strong, it may not be quite strong enough to justify the huge expansion in capacity driven by investor enthusiasm. "The great desire to buy tech stocks at any price has led to overcapacity and too many competitors in these businesses," says Fred Hickey, editor of the high Tech Strategist newsletter. "There are too many people in wireless, too many bidding for the wireless spectrum, too many people building out fiber optic networks."   

 Mr. Dornbusch is betting that the fallout in the stock market will be modest as reality sets in, with only a "gradual sell-off" in stocks and the dollar, and limited impact on the economy. But he acknowledges it could get worse. "If people cannot accept an earnings fall, then growth falls, the dollar falls, everything falls," he says. "It could be ugly."

 U.S. Insists Dollar Policy Remains Unchanged --- Treasury Chief Set Conditions for Euro Rescue

 PRAGUE -- The U.S. finally joined Europe in attempting to rescue the beleaguered euro, but Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wants everyone to know that boosting the 11-nation common currency doesn't mean he's abandoning the strong-dollar policy that has been a mainstay of Clinton administration economic policy for the past five years.   

 In the first U.S.-supported intervention in currency markets since Mr. Summers became secretary, the U.S., Europe, Japan, Britain and Canada bought euros Friday, stopping -- at least for one day -- the 21-month-old currency's tailspin.   

 The euro had fallen to 85.73 U.S. cents Friday morning, and was already rising when the Group of Seven major industrialized nations and the European Central Bank intervened, pushing the currency up to 90.40 cents. By late trading in New York, the euro had slipped a bit, to 87.84 cents.   

 The intervention came 15 years to the day after G-7 economic officials met at the Plaza Hotel in New York and agreed, successfully, to push down the U.S. dollar. But U.S. officials prefer parallels to the June 1998 U.S. move to help Japan boost the yen, which left the dollar in a strong position against the currencies of other major trading partners.   

 For the moment, Mr. Summers seems to have pulled off his tightrope walk, if investor reaction is any guide. The dollar rose Friday against the yen, trading at 108.03 yen compared with 106.67 yen late Thursday.   

 The G-7 said it acted out of "shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro for the world economy." But Mr. Summers made sure the Europeans agreed that their announcement would say that the action took place "at the initiative of the European Central Bank," a loud hint that the U.S. is willing to help, but doesn't want to undermine its strong-dollar stance. The administration credits that dollar policy for helping restrain inflation, attracting foreign investors and preventing the red-hot American economy from glowing white. Plus, the U.S. economic team was undoubtedly eager to avert any possibility -- however small -- that an official move to boost the euro at the dollar's expense might spark a larger flight from the greenback by investors worried about the huge U.S. trade deficit.   

 After a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Prague Saturday, French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius argued the move should reassure those in policy circles and financial markets dismayed at the contradictory signals European officials have sent during the euro's steady descent from a high of around $1.18 shortly after its creation in January 1999. "This all shows us the statements of Europeans can't be taken lightly," Mr. Fabius said.   

 Mr. Summers' decision to join the European action, taken in consultation with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, added the credibility that markets craved. And G-7 officials made clear they were willing to intervene again if circumstances warranted.   

 "The real surprise is that . . . the U.S. was on board," said Joachim Fels, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. economist in London. "And that makes me very confident that the move will be effective in putting a floor under the euro both against the dollar and the Japanese yen. It was the right move at the right time."   

 The Europeans, loath to seem like a charity case, spread the word around financial meetings in Prague that the U.S. agreed to their request because the Clinton team believe the weak euro presents a threat to the U.S. stock market. Several American companies, including Intel Corp., have blamed the euro's fall euro for disappointing profits.   

 A German Finance Ministry official, who asked not to be named, said he believed Intel's profit warning late Thursday and the fall in U.S. stock markets the following day "helped make the point."   

 "The U.S. realized that they have to have a balanced policy, a strong-dollar policy, but they also have to take into account profits and equity markets, and what the euro could do to them," he said.   

 Actually the decision had been taken hours before the Intel news went public. And while U.S. officials weighed those broad considerations, their choice appears based mostly on a belief that the global economy would be better off if Europe -- because of its economic importance -- had a more stable and stronger currency and if their policy makers acted in a way that inspired confidence instead of confusion.   

 "The U.S. is seen in Europe as being anti-euro," said economist Rudi Dornbusch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Not supporting the currency would confirm everything the Europeans believe about the U.S."   

 The big test of whether the central banks have succeeded comes when markets open this morning. Wim Duisenberg, president of the ECB, talked of an "orderly reversal" of the euro's movements, while other G-7 officials were more vague about what constitutes victory and stressed that the important thing was to signal investors that government won't stand aside indefinitely.   

 "If you stabilize it, that's a good thing; if you reverse some of it, that could be construed as a good thing," said one senior G-7 official. "Nobody is under the illusion that such an action by the central bank is going to dictate the exchange rate."   

 The Europeans began talking about intervention Sept. 9 at a gathering in Versailles, France, and then began courting Washington Tuesday. U.S. officials launched a series of conference calls among themselves to figure out whether it made sense to join in, should the Europeans ask. On the line were Mr. Summers, Mr. Greenspan, Peter Fisher of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy Geithner, undersecretary of the treasury for international affairs, and Assistant Treasury Secretary Ted Truman. One thing that made them especially cautious about risking intervention was uncertainty about why the euro was falling so fast, and, therefore, whether intervention would work.   

 On Thursday afternoon European time, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, an Italian member of the ECB executive committee, called Mr. Fisher, and Mario Draghi, director-general of the Italian Treasury and a key figure in euro issues, called Mr. Geithner. Both Europeans indicated that they thought it would make sense to act soon. After all, intervention ahead of the G-7 meeting Saturday would catch markets unaware and boost its effectiveness.   

 "Had they not done it, the big story out of Prague and in financial markets would have been the breakdown in cooperation between the U.S. and EU, because it was clear the Europeans . . . were going to make this a huge issue here," said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.   

 Around midday Thursday in Washington, as Mr. Greenspan was testifying on Capitol Hill and Mr. Summers was seeking House Majority Dick Armey's backing for debt relief for poor nations, their aides hastily arranged another conference call, this time discussing conditions the U.S. would demand in return for its participation in the euro-rescue operation. One item on the list was that the announcement must specify the move was the Europeans' idea.   

 Mr. Greenspan then took a call from Mr. Duisenberg, who said the ECB wanted to intervene the next day -- just after 7 a.m. Washington time -- and to secure U.S. support. Mr. Greenspan laid out the U.S. conditions, and Mr. Duisenberg assented. The Europeans then contacted their Japanese, Canadian and British counterparts to let them know the U.S. was game, and U.S. officials confirmed with their own calls.   

 The joint central-bank action on Friday -- buying $3 billion to $5 billion of euros, according to Deutsche Bank estimates -- certainly achieved the element of surprise. And the move gives Mr. Summers a chance to take a final step out of the shadow of his predecessor, Robert Rubin, a former trader beloved on Wall Street.   

 The Clinton administration has now carried out eight major foreign-exchange interventions, and Mr. Summers -- in earlier jobs at Treasury -- was influential in Mr. Rubin's decisions. Yet traders still wondered how he would handle the moment when it came. "Both for Larry and for the ECB it is in a sense a first test in the area of foreign-exchange intervention," said Harvard Prof. Jeffrey A. Frankel, a former Clinton economic adviser. "In both cases they would have stood to lose some face or credibility if it didn't work."   

 Now "people will stop asking the question about whether he has the same credibility with the markets that Rubin did," Mr. Frankel said.   

 It was the credibility issue that was key to the European decision, as well. Euro-zone officials worried that investors and voters were losing confidence in the monetary union, an especially sensitive subject, with the Danes slated to vote Thursday on whether to throw in their lot with the collective currency, and popular discontent with the euro surfacing in Germany.   

 "It's partly that they're in the early stages of this historic experiment and the ECB needs to establish some credibility as a new institution," said Mr. Frankel. "Wherever in the world you're talking about having a speculative run on a major currency it could cause some major problems."   

 The disjointed government response in Europe to the recent surge in oil prices, and the subsequent protests across the continent, have put additional public pressure on European politicians. "It is without a doubt that not having a common reaction to this (oil prices) is very negative, and the same can be said for our reaction to the euro," said Ernst Welteke, president of the Bundesbank.   

 Recent opinion polls show that a majority of Germans are against exchanging the mark for the euro, as planned in January 2002.   

 But there were also sound economic reasons for the Europeans and Americans to want a stronger currency in Europe. A weak currency discourages investors from putting their money into Europe, and, although there's no sign of it yet, could cause inflation through rising import prices. Euroland consumer prices fell slightly to 2.3% in August, from 2.4% in July and core inflation, which excludes volatile energy prices, is just 1.3%.   

 "There is a bit of uncertainty in the air," said Nicholas Stern, chief economist of the World Bank. "And uncertainty is not great for growth. The euro and oil are doing that, so that's why intervention was a good thing."   

 Furthermore, Turkey, Argentina, Poland and other countries whose currencies move with the dollar were having a hard time selling their goods in Europe because the weak euro made their exports more expensive.

 Wasn t there a time, earlier this year, when everyone was thinking about joining an Internet startup? Professionals of all sorts, from lawyers to accountants to doctors, were dreaming about the possibilities of a job with an Internet company. The Internet was the thing to do, career-wise. A friend stopped me on the street one day, almost frantic, wanting the scoop on the hottest e-companies. It didn t matter what a company did, apparently, as long as it had those two magic words associated with it Internet and startup. How fast things change. Now, the buzz about startups isn t quite the same. These days, you re a lot more likely to hear about layoffs, and a lot less likely to hear about high-flying IPOs or stock-option millionaires. Every day, another firm is cutting its staff or ceasing operations altogether. 

  Subscribe to Silicon Alley Daily (www.siliconalleydaily.com) or At NewYork Daily (www.atnewyork.com), two e-mail newsletters covering New York s startup scene, and you ll receive a regular serving of news about layoffs, with headlines employing pinkslips as a verb, as when a company  pinkslips 50 (employees, that is). Should this be viewed as a virtual  stop sign, if you re thinking about joining an Internet startup? Or is it just a cautionary signal, like one of those  slow signs, warning you to proceed with care? To be sure, it is not an easy time to make a decision about joining an Internet company, especially one that s just at the startup stage, without much of a track record. But it is, ironically, a better time to make such a decision than it was a year ago. The reason? Now, it would be hard to ignore the risks involved in taking a job with a startup. The allure is still there, whether for stock-option riches or a taste of the startup spirit, but it is tempered by the realization that not every company will turn a profit, or even survive two or three years past its launch. How do you evaluate a startup? Begin by learning how the company is being funded. Is its cash coming from the co-founders bank accounts and credit cards? If the company is still being funded by its founders or angel investors, rather than venture capitalists (VCs), then the company is still at an exceptionally risky stage. Joining so early may have the potential for enormous rewards, but it increases the uncertainty, too. Funding from VCs, typically in the millions of dollars, or tens of millions, buys more time to develop the business. Even so, all venture funding is not created equal. If you re seriously considering joining a startup, you need to look beyond the dollar amount coming from VCs. Ideally, the company is not just receiving cash, but cash from VCs who are able to help guide the company in the right direction. What is the track record of the VCs funding the startup? Have they funded other winners? If so, the startup is likely to have a better chance, as VCs often help their companies with connections, partnerships and the like. The company s leadership matters, too. Is this a startup with a CEO who inspires trust? Or would you be wary of handing the CEO the keys to your car? Startups need strong leaders to move them forward people with passion, drive and a single-minded focus on success. Anything less, and the company is likely to founder. Be sure to learn about the competition the company faces, too. Is the company entering an arena that s already overcrowded? Is it tackling a market that s large enough to support the firm, even with intense competition? And, given everything you know, do you believe the business has a reasonable chance of success? Needless to say, it is easy enough to find reasons not to join a startup. The stress, the long hours, the risks. But it is a challenge, and these days, working at a startup  even one that fails  is a badge of honor.

 BRUSSELS --  Make up a short list of the factors hurting the euro before Friday's big exercise in central bank intervention and you end up with a long list. 

 The Europeans, it was said, spoke with a multitude of voices about their single currency, with some of them expressing delight that it had fallen so far. Why, if that was the case, should others buy in? 

 Compared with a high-octane, high-tech U.S. economy, Europe looked pedestrian and backward. As one Frankfurt trader put it, in the United States a rate of economic growth of 3 per cent was counted as a slowdown whereas in Europe it was seen as the arrival of a boom. Even though the currency had lost much of its value, Europeans continued to put their fast-devaluing euros into U.S. equities and into buying U.S. companies, a fair indication of where they saw value. 

 Then there was the confused politics of the old continent. Governments that had just managed to get their budgets into surplus were apparently so unsure of themselves that, as soon as they faced public protests over fuel taxes, they started giving the surpluses away. 

 As well, there were the political tests that a currency that had 11 member nations and needed to attract others had to contend with -- such as Denmark's referendum Thursday on whether it wants to join and subsequent referendums in Sweden and Britain. 

 Add it all up and Europe's single currency, which started life less than two years ago at $1.17 (U.S.) and had sunk to 85 cents, seemed to be a uniquely bad investment. Moreover, the main cause of the fall was not speculative. Last year, capital flight out of the euro zone and, mostly, into the United States was $123-billion and, in the first six months of this year, there was a further $58-billion outflow. 

 Given these kinds of movements, it was (a) scarcely surprising the euro had been a one-way bet and (b) scarcely credible that the European Central Bank (ECB) could save it. Speculators might get burned. But there were not many of them. And, unless the euro was turned around very impressively indeed, European investors were unlikely to change their minds and start keeping their money at home. 

 This, some 48 hours after the central banks started buying euros and selling other currencies, remains the core of the problem. Yes, the interveners achieved surprise. Yes, they chose a perfect day when Wall Street and Nasdaq were hit by a profit warning from Intel Corp. And, yes, probably the euro has reached an all-time low and will not go back to 85 cents again. But, beyond that, it is pretty hard to know what has been achieved for the long term since nothing has been done to shorten the long list of negatives attached to the euro. 

 Revealingly, in his statement on the intervention, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said both that Washington's policy on wanting a strong U.S. dollar had not changed and that Europe had changed and was embracing structural reforms. 

 The interpretation that was put on the first remark was that, if U.S. policy had not altered, then the intervention was not likely to be sustained. After it, the euro gave up its early gains. The interpretation put on the second remark was that it was both accurate and patronizing; the best hope for the euro is if a U.S. Treasury Secretary praises European economic management. 

 When the U.S. dollar depreciated after the Plaza Accord of 1985 and, again, in 1995 when it had fallen substantially against the Japanese yen, it required intervention over several months to bring about any real change. The same is true now. Central banks have drawn a line in the sand at an 85 cents euro. Now they have to follow up with sustained buying of euros and selling of other currencies. 

 This is where the U.S. attitude is pivotal. Are the Americans going to stick with this exercise even though they want a strong dollar and do not want the higher inflation and higher interest rates that would come from any substantial dollar depreciation? It is not clear that they are ready for a long campaign in support of the euro. On the other hand, it is abundantly clear that the markets are going to test their willingness to stand shoulder to shoulder with the ECB. Friday's events were a partial success. But the war for the euro promises to be a war of attrition.

 Donlon sent back to USA to help lower costs at Chrysler

 DaimlerChrysler has sent a top financial executive back to North America as it tries to cut costs at its struggling Chrysler operations. 

 The company sent Jim Donlon back to Chrysler group headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, as senior vice president and controller. 

 Donlon, 53, was Chrysler Corp.'s controller before the company was acquired by Daimler-Benz in 1998. He was named corporate controller for D/C and moved to the company's German headquarters in Stuttgart. 

 Known for his cost-cutting skills, Donlon returns to the Chrysler group at a time when D/C North American boss Jim Holden is trying to cut $2 billion from his operations. 

 Donlon's reassignment followed a series of intense meetings in Auburn Hills conducted by D/C's Chief Financial Officer Manfred Genz. Insiders say Donlon was designated for the task by Chairman Jurgen Schrempp 

 "Jurgen Schrempp wants to have Donlon on this crucial job in a difficult time," said a D/C executive. "He trusts Donlon a lot." 

 The Chrysler group has relied on aggressive consumer incentives to drive unit sales and market share gains, while investing heavily in product launches. 

 Second-quarter operating profit was down 12 percent from a year ago to $1.1 billion. The company issued a profit warning for the third quarter. 

 "We knew things would be tough at Chrysler, but we didn't know it would be this tough," said a source close to D/C's management board in Stuttgart. "The price war in the USA has increased in intensity and we did not anticipate it." 

 Chrysler will introduce three new models within five months. Two of them, the Voyager minivan and the Jeep Grand Cherokee, are key to the company's profitability. 

 Chrysler was forced to sharply increase incentives on the current Voyager, Jeep Cherokee and Stratus. 

 The popular PT Cruiser can't make up the difference because Chrysler can't build enough to satisfy demand. 

 "The main problem at Chrysler is the mismanaged product life cycles," said a DaimlerChrysler executive in Germany. 

 "This is an historic problem, nothing which arose suddenly. There has always been this zig-zag performance at Chrysler, which almost inevitably ended in tears for the company." 

 Compared to Chrysler, product cycles at Mercedes-Benz are carefully balanced, he said. 

 "When one model declines, another is introduced to keep customers inside the brand," said the insider. 

 "When A-class sales slow down we can compensate with rising C-class sales. We have recognized this problem of life cycle management at Chrysler and now it is Holden's job to tackle it. 

 "Schrempp has given him the chance to bring the company back on track, and certainly also the time to do so." 

 In other personnel changes, Rainer Schmuckle replaces Donlon as corporate controller in Stuttgart. 

 Schmuckle is currently Chief Financial Officer of Adtranz, D/C's rail company. 

 Donlon replaces Jurgen Walker, 50, who has been named president and CEO of DaimlerChrysler Financial Services, N.A., LLC. 

 Walker replaces Darrell Davis, 61, who becomes senior vice president for service and parts for Chrysler. 

 This newly created position combines service and parts operations into a single group and eliminates the position of vice president for Mopar parts held by Lawrence Baker, 58, who plans to retire at the end of the year. 

 Davis also takes over some duties from John MacDonald, 55, whose title changes from senior vice president of sales and service to senior vice president of sales and field service. 

 Davis will manage global service and parts issues, including warranty and recall; MacDonald will oversee Chrysler's sales and dealer service operations.

 US Money Week Ahead: Euro, Oil And Stocks At The Helm

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Econonmic data will take a back seat for the Treasurys market this week, as participants remain fixated on Europe's fight for its embattled currency, the worldwide wrangling about oil prices, and the profits of U.S. companies. 

 Though they agree that developments outside the bond market could have significant effects on Treasurys, analysts are cautious in forecasting the direction of the bond market this week. 

 Most agree that any reaction will be mitigated by a fatigue among bond investors, which has put them on the defensive after several weeks of rough, choppy and counterintuitive moves. 

 Even some of the biggest risk takers on Wall Street note that they don't want to find themselves on the wrong side of a market movement. Action in recent weeks has been largely dictated by external events, making any bets excruciatingly risky. 

 "The bond market is caught in limbo, unable to take advantage of moderating growth and new downside (economic) risks," analysts at Salomon Smith Barney in New York said in a research report. 

 If economic fundamentals were in the driver's seat, the increasingly convincing prospect of slower growth for the U.S. would likely cause bonds to rally. 

 A major part of those fundamentals has to do with the slowing profits of U.S. companies. Last Thursday, a profit warning from chipmaker Intel put the stock market into a temporary panic. 

 The ever-resilient equities market was able to pick itself back up, but investors are not without their bruises. They are likely to be more sensitive to lower earnings reports going forward, and that is likely a supportive factor for shorter-maturity notes and bills. 

 "Sluggish corporate earnings and slower growth get people starting to think the Fed's next move might be an ease," said Steven Saslow, executive managing director at HSBC Securities in New York. That, he said, would help to justify the fact that the two-year note is trading a full 50 basis points below the Fed funds rate. 

 Offsetting that strength, however, will be new supply on the short end, which will likely push rates slightly higher. On Wednesday, Treasury will auction $10 billion in two-year notes. 

 However, most still agree that bonds will be led this week largely by factors outside the market itself. 

 Specifically, sustained strength in oil prices could continue battering longer-dated securities because of their sensitivity to inflation. That might happen despite ongoing buybacks of Treasurys, which have kept yields on long-dated securities artificially low since the beginning of the year. 

 "The rise in oil prices to their highest levels since the Persian Gulf War is raising questions about a much less desirable outcome for inflation and growth," added the Salomon economists. 

 Last week's concerted effort by the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, Bank of England and European Union to try to shore up the euro will also play a role in the U.S. bond market this week. 

 With many analysts expecting further intervention, short-dated Treasurys might get weaker, since much of central banks' dollar holdings are in the form of Treasurys, and more intervention could mean more selling of short-dated Treasurys. 

 Additionally, the prospect of any move toward a weaker dollar raises the prospect that the U.S. might become a less attractive destination for the world's investment capital. 

 "You could have a situation where the capital inflows to the U.S. might slow a bit," said Joe LaVorgna, U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. 

 LaVorgna went on to say that would put an additional strain on the U.S. economy, because it could mean the U.S. might eventually not be able to finance its bulging trade deficit. That, he said, could make the economy far more susceptible to higher oil prices, and spark a period of slower growth with rising inflation. 

 With the interplay of forces inside and outside of the bond market producing only a sketchy idea of price action, market watchers and investors are wary of making distinct market calls. 

 "The best argument we could make is that the curve continues to steepen, but these situations are too complicated to predict with any accuracy where the market is going to go," said Saslow. 

 Meanwhile, data will only give slight clues about the economy and are unlikely to move markets. 

 On Tuesday, the Conference Board is slated to release its Consumer Confidence Index. On Wednesday, the Census Bureau will report on durable goods orders, while Thursday will bring yet another revision of second-quarter gross domestic product. Friday, the government will report on personal income and outlays for August. 

 "It's all of little consequence because it's all so backward looking," said LaVorgna. "People are fixed on trying to figure out the future right now, and its very unclear."

 Mukul Munish and Clara Li report. 

 Hope for hi-techs While Intel Corp issued a profit warning late last week, sending stock markets around the world into a spiral, strategists and technology analysts forecast a more stable outlook for stock markets, in general, and technology stocks, in particular, this week. 

 The world's top chip-maker shocked the market last Thursday when it announced its third-quarter sales growth would be far short of analysts' forecasts. Intel lost 22 per cent on Friday, cutting billions off its market value. Intel fell 17 per cent for the week and was the biggest drag on leading US indices. 

 There were signs investors remained optimistic about technology stocks, however. The Nasdaq Composite Index recovered from an early decline of as much as 5.6 per cent on Friday, closing with a loss of just 0.66 per cent for the day and 0.82 per cent for the week. 

 "The market's been much more resilient than we might have thought," Invesco GT Technology Fund manager Jay Nakahara said. 

 Investors were not ready to abandon semiconductor stocks, Mr Nakahara said, even after Intel said slower demand in Europe would limit its sales growth to between 3 per cent and 5 per cent in the third quarter. Analysts had forecast as much as 10 per cent growth. 

 Some of Intel's problems did not pertain to the chip industry in general, Mr Nakahara said. 

 Celestial Asia Securities research director Herbert Lau Chung-kwan said: "Intel may have set expectations too high. We are likely to see across-the-board recovery (this) week, just like we had a overall sell-off (last) week." 

 Mr Lau said the Nasdaq recovered steadily in the later part of Friday's trade on positive news that United States President Bill Clinton was to use the country's strategic oil reserves to curb the rising oil prices and a surprising intervention by leading central banks to prop a sliding euro. 

 "On the backdrop of the overseas market, we expect a strong rebound in the Hong Kong market in the beginning of (this) week, especially on the fact that Hong Kong has had a serious drop of 10 per cent to 20 per cent last week. Tech stocks have suffered badly in the past week. A rebound is more likely this week," Mr Lau said. 

 Pacific Challenge Securities research director Alan Hutcheson was more cautious on technology stocks. 

 "The panic selling for tech stocks is going to stop, but I don't think there is going to be a huge rebound, given that the (Mass Transit Railway Corp initial public offering) will start (this week)." 

 "People are more likely to be cautious," Mr Hutcheson said. 

 Semiconductor stocks in the US and other leading markets have performed well this year. 

 Edward D Jones & Co chief market strategist Alan Skrainka said: "Is the long-term outlook for technology bright? The answer is yes. Are tech stock prices now more in line with industry fundamentals and risk? We now think the answer is yes." In the wake of Intel's warning, Mr Skrainka boosted the weighting of technology to 24 per cent from 22 per cent in his model portfolio. 

 Mr Hutcheson said the present level of valuations for Hong Kong technology stocks looked reasonable and it was a good time for investors interested in bargain hunting to step into the buying arena once again. 

 Mr Lau said technology stocks such as Pacific Century CyberWorks and China Mobile, which had been oversold last week, were expected to bounce back. 

 "It looks like the sell-off (of CyberWorks) will stop at some point (this) week. Also, (chairman) Richard Li (Tzar-kai) indicated on Thursday that there might be some share buy-back," Mr Lau said. 

 "For China Mobile at the current price level, it looks like the selling is a bit overdone." 

 China Mobile lost 15.34 per cent last week, while CyberWorks has lost almost 46 per cent since merging with Cable & Wireless HKT on August 17. 

 Prior to Intel's warning, investors in the SAR and US were already concerned about the impact of higher oil prices and the weak euro on corporate earnings. 

 In the US to date, 206 companies have warned they will not meet analysts' profit forecasts for the third quarter. 

 "If this holds, we're headed for a worse-than-normal quarter for pre-announcements," First Call research director Chuck Hill said. 

 Analysts forecast third-quarter earnings growth of 16.7 per cent for S&P 500 companies - while First Call said that in July growth was seen at 18.8 per cent.

 Kansas City wheat and Chicago wheat, corn and soybean futures prices closed higher Friday as weather factors boosted the market. 

 Kansas City Value Line stock-index futures and Isdex Internet stock-index futures also closed higher. 

 In grains, soybean futures rose on speculation that a frost expected in the Midwest next week could damage crops in the early stages of fall harvest. While much of the crop has matured, some plants aren't yet fully developed and might not survive a cold spell, agronomists said. 

 Meanwhile, strength in the euro against the U.S. dollar also boosted U.S. grain futures prices. The euro's sharp increase, after coordinated intervention by the world's major central banks, could help U.S. exports by making them less costly. 

 Wheat futures got some support from speculation that rain forecast for this weekend will miss some of the driest areas in Texas and Oklahoma. Seeding of winter wheat, a major crop in Kansas, too, has been delayed in some areas because of dry conditions. 

 New York cotton futures closed mostly higher, with the October contract settling at 63.45 cents a pound, December at 63.54 and March at 65.33. 

 The Kansas City Value Line and Isdex closed higher after trading down sharply early in the day. Stocks, particularly technology issues, fell sharply early in the wake of an Intel profit warning, said Kansas City trader Paul Dow. 

 But bargain hunters found lower prices attractive, and many stocks staged a comeback, he said. 

 The Kansas City Value Line stock-index cash settled up 200 basis points at 1,127.79. The Isdex cash settled up 1,748 basis points at 805.18.

 FTSE 250: 6,645.1 (-58.2); FTSE SmallCap: 3,425.7 (-45.7) 

 After 12 losing sessions out of the past 13, one of the longest downside sequences that even the oldest of old market hands could recall, it was about time the FTSE 100, the London market's benchmark, staged a rally. 

 That it did, but only just, and only after a massive and concerted bout of intervention in foreign exchanges by central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England. Coming in the wake of a global market tumble, which owed everything to the profit warning issued by Intel, the world's biggest computer chip manufacturer, the move was well-timed to bolster stock markets, London included. 

 News of the euro intervention electrified markets, which took another fearful hammering at the opening as market-makers chopped their dealing prices in an attempt to head off any wholesale selling by the institutions. By the end of a frantic trading session, the FTSE 100 had just scrambled into positive territory to finish 6.7 higher at 6,205.9. At its lowest, the index plummeted 124.1 to 6,075.1, with many market bears forecasting a decline to below 6,000. 

 But it was a close-run thing, as the index shifted from blue to red and back during the final 10 minutes of trading, incorporating the auction which sees brokers enter unfulfilled buys and sells. The closing gain for the 100 index was in sharp contrast to the further weakness that swept across the rest of the market. 

 Although closing well off their lowest levels, the rest of the main FTSE indices were still left with hefty losses. The 250 index fell 58.2 to 6,645.1, having plunged below the 6,600 level at its worst. The SmallCap, meanwhile, lost 45.7 to 3,425.7 after hitting a low point of 3,421.4. The Techmark 100 finished 51.21 off at 3,646.05; at its worst of the session, the index touched 3,532.80. European markets got precious little help from Wall Street, however, where the Dow Jones, which closed before the Intel profit warning was announced on Thursday, dropped 143 points not long after the opening, before staging a minor rally. 

 Over the week, the 100 index fell 211.4 points, or 3.3 per cent, while the 250 dropped 310.1, or 4.5 per cent.

MARKETS GULP AT INTEL NEWS, RECOVER; BARGAIN HUNTERS HELP INDEXES BOUNCE BACK FROM CHIPMAKER'S REVENUE WARNING

Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of another profit warning by a bellwether company - this time chipmaker Intel Corp.

Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session.

Broader stock indicators also closed lower, but well above their lows for the day.

The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology-focused index fall 214 points at one point. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72.

"We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a little bleak this morning," said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago.

News that the seven largest industrial nations had stepped in to help buoy the ailing euro currency, as well as strong speculation throughout the day that the Clinton administration planned to dip into the nation's oil reserves to ease rising energy prices - a speculation eventually borne out - helped offset the near panic caused by Intel's profit warning.

Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three issues in recent weeks - earnings, the decline in value of the euro, and rising energy prices. The "Big Three," he called them.

All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each condition affects the other.

In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the pinch in their European operations.

Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter revenues to fall below expectations. The company specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker results.

The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most widely held stocks.

Shares of Intel traded hands at breakneck speed on the Nasdaq market. Volume reached 304 million, shattering the all-time daily Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is 38 million shares.

"We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too high," said Gallagher.

Intel's shares closed down $13.55, or 22 percent, to $47.94.

Technology investors began fleeing the market in after-hours trading Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at Friday's opening.

Intel led the way, but other technology stocks also felt investors' wrath. Dell Computer dropped $2 to $35.94 and Applied Materials fell $3.50 to $70.

With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their expectations.

Strength in a handful of blue-chip sectors, including utilities and drugs, helped stanch the selling momentum that threatened to overwhelm the markets early in the session.

The utilities sector, which has served as a haven for frightened investors all year, was led by Duke Energy, up $1.25 at $75.88. Pharmacia Corp., up $3 to $59, helped lift the drug sector.

Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.17 billion shares, well ahead of Thursday's pace.

The Russell 2000 index rose 4.47 to 518.82.

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.02 percent. Germany's DAX index was up 0.86 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.06 percent.

 WHILE Intel is a constituent of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the effect of its profit warning on the tech-heavy Nasdaq was more pronounced than on the main market. 

 The company is the world's biggest chip-maker and its statement of lower-than-expected revenue from Europe as a shadow over the whole technology sector. "There is concern about what some people say is improper guidance from Intel, concern that there may be other companies that provided improper guidance," said George Rodriguez, senior vice president at Guzman & Co. 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq was down 40.63 points, or 1.07 percent, at 3,787.97, after dropping almost 6 percent earlier. 

 Tech heavyweights led the Nasdaq lower. Dell lost 3-1/8 at 34-13/16; Cisco Systems dropped 1-3/4 to 59-3/8; Oracle Corp. slid 7/8 to 78-1/16; and Apple Computer Inc. shed 4-1/2 to 52-3/16. 

 SG Cowen analyst Tia-min Pang said he had downgraded the semiconductor equipment industry, cutting his investment ratings on six stocks. Semiconductor giant Applied Materials was off 6 at 67-1/2.

 SANTA CLARA, Calif. - Giant computer chip maker Intel Corp.'s plans to remake itself into a new-world Internet parts supplier have been tripped up by old-world problems of profits and production. 

 Amid signs the world economy is slowing, Wall Street now is questioning whether Intel and other bellwether companies can be nimble enough to keep the good times going even during the bad. 

 Under the leadership of chief executive Craig Barrett, Intel's stock had been basking in the glow of plans to transform the 32-year-old company from the PC components business to a supplier of Web-enabling parts for everything from the hot handheld computer market to large computer servers and cellular phones. 

 The stodgy company still wears its corporate blue and gray colors like a badge of pride in a sector where jeans and T-shirts are more common, but most analysts had believed in Intel executives' proclaimed blueprint for success. 

 Many were reassessing their opinions Friday, a day after Intel warned that its third-quarter revenues will be far below expectations because of weak demand for PCs in Europe. 

 One after another, analysts revised downward their expectations for company quarterly profits and revenues as Intel's stock tumbled 22 percent on the Nasdaq to $47.94 - well off its 52-week high of nearly $76 and trimming Intel's market value by more than $90 billion. 

 Volume reached 304 million, shattering the all-time one-stock Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. 

 Stocks staged a notable recovery after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of the profit warning by Intel. 

 Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session. 

 Broader stock indicators also closed lower, but well above their lows for the day. 

 The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology-focused index fall 214 points at one point. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72. 

 "We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a little bleak this morning," said Al Kugel, investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 

 "Clearly, Intel's decision to start to diversify away from the PC market is the right decision, but it's going to take time," semiconductor analyst Quinn Bolton at CIBC World Markets said. 

 "More than 80 percent of their sales are still PC-related, and that raises concerns that they and the entire semiconductor industry are going to be hurting over the next while if the softening spreads from Europe to Asia and the U.S." 

 Intel spokesman Tom Beermann said all the company's key markets outside Europe remain stable, and several PC retailers in the United States said Friday that they have not noticed a sales slump. 

 "It's a very healthy industry," said spokesman T.R. Reid of Dell Computer Corp., saying the company expects overall market demand for PCs to grow anywhere from 15 to 18 percent this year. 

 Wall Street has been in a quandary for weeks about how best to gauge external problems in companies that derive much of their revenues from overseas sales. 

 Oil prices that are nearing all-time highs, fluctuating currencies and political instability abroad are factors that traditionally punish multinational companies' profits, but that model has been thrown off kilter somewhat by the unexpected productivity gains of the Internet economy. 

 Mike Volpi, chief strategy officer at Internet equipment provider Cisco Systems Inc., just this week noted that a months-long shakeout in the technology sector actually seems to have accelerated orders for his company's products. 

 "Intel has very long coattails; anytime they make a ripple in the water, it has an incredible effect with everyone else," analyst Mark Margevicius of Dataquest noted. "But even though this may be causing a bit of turbulence, there's just too much momentum here and in other factions of the technology industry ..." 

 Intel, Microsoft Corp., Dell and others in the past year have come to realize that the maturing market for PC sales threatens their profits - and dominance. Each has been scrambling to cash in on the rise of the Internet by offering "product and service solutions" for businesses and consumers. 

 The idea is that even with a saturated PC market, many of the same pieces of hardware and software, with slight modifications, can be used in Web-enabled devices. 

 Dataquest expects world PC sales to slow sharply by 2002 even as microprocessor shipments more than double to 1.42 billion.

Toronto -- "Intel got hurt pretty badly, but investors have focused on the fact that you can't blanket the industry when one company reports problems."  

Intel's shares closed down $13.55, or 22 per cent, to $47.94 US on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Volume reached 304 million, shattering the daily Nasdaq record of 172 million set by Oracle Corp. in 1997.  

But the Nasdaq composite finished down just 25.11 points at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology-focused index fall over 210 points at one point.  

The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index lost 34.97 to 10,566 - down almost 500 points on the week - but tech leader Nortel Networks gained $1.45 to $98.90 as a wave of bargain-hunters stepped in.  

New York's Dow Jones industrial average closed up 81.85 at 10,847.37 after the blue-chip index dropped more than 140 points early in the session. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.33 of a point at 1,448.72.  

The western-based Canadian Venture Exchange dropped 11.16 points to 3,606.03, off 54 points this week. The Canadian dollar closed at 67.18 cents US, down 0.09 from Thursday's close.  

"The level of fear was perhaps too exaggerated," Piticco said. "The lesson that we've learned is that you buy on the selloffs, buy on the dips. We saw that very aggressively in the U.S., and we even saw it in Canada."  

Piticco said the TSE ended up in negative territory mainly because oil and gas stocks suffered through day-long speculation that the United States would dip into its oil reserve to curb fuel prices - as was announced when markets closed.  

He said the stock market is still vibrant despite September's customary cool-down.  

In New York, stocks staged a remarkable recovery after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of Intel's profit warning late Thursday. News that the seven largest industrial countries had stepped in to help buoy the euro, Europe's main currency, helped offset the near-panic caused by that warning.

NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of another profit warning by a bellwether company - this time chipmaker Intel Corp.

Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session.

The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72.

Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of Thursday's trading session that it expects thirdquarter revenues to fall below expectations. The company specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker results.

The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the atmosphere of panic.

The Russell 2000 index rose 4.47 to 518.82. Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.02 percent. Germany's DAX index was up 0.86 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.06 percent.

 U.S. Treasuries up - stock fears trump euro intervention.

 NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries seesawed higher on Friday morning as sliding stock markets sparked a flight to bonds, overriding the negative impact of intervention by the world's industrial powers to boost the euro. 

 Trading was volatile as the fixed-income market was sucked into a whirlwind of competing forces in the equity, oil and currency markets. 

 Treasuries were lifted overnight after a profit warning from U.S. chip maker Intel Corp. hurt global equities, spurring safe-haven buying of bonds. 

 But those gains were largely erased after European, Japanese, Canadian and U.S. monetary officials stepped into the foreign exchange market to support the ailing euro. 

 Then the market did another about-face as equity concerns returned to the limelight. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 1 percent and the Nasdaq composite index plunged more than 5 percent at the opening bell. 

 Two-year note yields briefly fell below 6 percent for the first time in nine months. 

 "There is so much money in the equity market and it can be pretty fickle and it's very fast. People get nervous and the spillover is pretty great," said Bill Kirby, co-head of governments trading at Prudential Securities Inc. 

 "We are seeing a flight to quality. The intervention in Europe put a little pressure on our market. That was part of the downtrade as they raise some dollars to buy euros," Kirby said. 

 In morning trading, benchmark 10-year notes rose 6/32 to 99-14/32, yielding 5.83 percent. Thirty-year bonds gained 10/32 to 104-26/32, yielding 5.90 percent. 

 Five-year notes lost 2/32 to 103-14/32 yielding 5.89 percent, while two-year notes were up 2/32 at 100-5/32, yielding 6.03 percent. 

 A trader at a U.S. primary dealer said a lasting turnaround in the euro may entice European investors who have parked money in Treasuries to avoid euro currency losses to repatriate funds. 

 "Lack of currency intervention until now seems to have brought investors from Europe coming into the front end of the Treasury market. You might expect them to flee," the trader said. 

 While equity concerns predominated on Friday, dealers remained fixated on the stubbornly high price of crude oil, which has fanned inflation fears and pressured longer-dated Treasuries. 

 NYMEX crude oil futures were softer below $34 a barrel as U.S. administration officials appeared to close ranks behind plans to release a limited amount of oil from the U.S. strategic reserves.

 WRAPUP 1-Euro techs thumped by Intel shock.

 LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - European technology stocks were pounded by indiscriminate selling on Friday after U.S. semiconductor giant Intel warned weak European demand for its microprocessors would hit third quarter revenues. 

 Although analysts said Intel's problems were company-rather than than industry-specific, the DJ Stoxx technology index .SX8P) slumped 4.9 percent, and at one point was back to May levels. 

 Names such as Ericsson and Siemens headed blue-chip decliners with losses of over five percent and European chipmakers such as French-Italian STMicroelectronics toppled. 

 "It's a domino effect. Intel is a huge volume player, the biggest chipmaker in the world, so people think that if they have problems they must be industry orientated and want to get out of everything," said Titus Menzies, technology hardware analyst at BNP Paribas in London. 

 "I think more likely people will come to terms with the fact that this is company orientated and shares in other firms should pick up," he added. 

 At 1010 GMT STMicroelectronics had trimmed earlier losses of around 10 percent to show a loss of 4.6 percent, while Germany's Infineon was down 7.3 percent despite parent Siemens saying it expected record profits in its 1999/2000 business year. 

 Britain's ARM Holdings fell 7.4 percent and semiconductor equipment maker ASML was down 8.9 percent while Irish tech firm Parthus dropped 7.73 percent. 

 London stockmarket newcomer ARC International Plc dropped 5.02 percent. The microchip designer gained more than 100 percent to 428p on its Thursday debut. 

 OVERESTIMATED 

 In a highly nervous trading environment, technology shares led Thursday's stock market slump amid heightened fears that high oil prices and a weak euro would derail profit growth. 

 Analysts said those jitters were leading investors to overplay Intel's situation on Friday. 

 "Over the last five or six years Intel has always suggested that the third quarter of every year would be flat. This is the first when they said it would be a lot stronger, and I think they probably overestimated," said Menzies at BNP-Paribas. 

 "I think they issued this profit warning so that analysts would downgrade their estimates and when the figures do come out they will probably beat expectations. The fourth quarter should be stronger, especially as Christmas comes in," he added. 

 Several dealers said they expected the sell-off to bottom out by the end of the morning ahead of Wall Street's open. 

 "The flows are actually quite thin, which is exacerbating the problem, but we think this afternoon we may see clients coming back in to pick up cheap deals. Already anything which lost over 10 percent is coming back a bit," said one dealer.

 0209 GMT - U.S. Treasuries extended their overnight rally on Friday in unusually brisk trading as a slide in U.S. equities sent investors scampering to the safety of fixed-interest debt. - A profit warning late Thursday from tech bellwether Intel caused the Nasdaq futures contract to dive by its limit of 92 points or 2.4 pct, on top of a 1.7 pct drop in the cash market. - Bond prices had already been rallying on a retreat in oil prices after Vice President Al Gore pledged to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. - U.S. light crude on Nymex is trading at $33.71 a barrel for November delivery, down $1.53 from Wednesday's close. - All of which helped the 10-year note climb 5/32 to 99-13/32 to yield 5.83 pct, on top of a 13/32 rise overnight. - The two-year also gained by 3/32 to 100-6/32, yielding 6.01 percent, while the five-year was unmoved at 103-15/32 to yield 5.88 pct.

 LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasuries prices rose in London on Friday, adding to gains made the previous day, after a profit warning from U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp hit stock markets and sparked a flight to bonds. 

 Prices at the long end of the yield curve added to gains in Tokyo and dealers and analysts said they could rise further. 

 "It is inevitable that the U.S. equity market will open weaker this afternoon and that is very supportive for the bond market," said Gianpaolo Mosconi, bond analyst at Sanwa International. 

 Intel's surprise warning on third quarter revenue hit Nasdaq index futures , following a 1.76 percent fall in the cash index . 

 U.S. Treasuries prices, which had rallied in New York after a sharp fall in the price of oil, rose further in Tokyo as the Intel warning hit stock markets. 

 "We think there will be gains across the board in both the short and long end of the U.S. Treasuries curve," said Mosconi. 

 "But I think we could see the curve steepening as the short end should benefit the most." 

 At 0940 GMT, the long bond was trading at 104-28 to yield 5.90 percent, compared with 5.91 percent in New York and 5.90 percent in Tokyo. The 10-year note was yielding 5.83 percent, compared with 5.85 percent in New York and 5.83 percent in Tokyo. 

 The two-year note yield stood at 6.03 percent, after 6.06 percent in New York. 

 The T-bond future on a/c/e was 12/32 higher at 98-15 and the T-note future was 11/32 higher at 100-00. 

 T-notes were outperforming German Bunds with the 10-year yield gap narrowing by four basis points to 68 from Thursday's European close. The 10-year dollar swap spread widened by two basis points to 118 from the U.S. close. 

 "Stocks have played a big part in the short end this morning which has caught a bid," said a London trader. 

 He said the T-bond future could close towards 99 but he did not think there would be a further very large rally. 

 "Unless we see a massive downward move in the S&P, which is unlikely, I do not think we are going to see a massive rally," he said. 

 BNP Paribas said in a note the Federal Reserve could change its monetary policy stance at the October 3 meeting of its rate-setting Open Market Committee as a result of pressure on U.S. companies. 

 "We expect the yield curve to continue to steepen on Friday, with the increased volatility in recent weeks most likely persuading the Fed to move to neutral on October 3," it said. 

 Oil prices fell in New York as U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said President Bill Clinton was nearing a decision on releasing oil from the U.S. strategic reserve to rein in prices. 

 U.S. crude, which dropped sharply on Thursday, edged down further to $33.95. 

 No key U.S. data releases were due on Friday.

 Investors sick and tired of this daily roller coaster called Wall Street ought to listen to Bellevue's Dick Russell. 

 "Watch soap operas. Don't watch CNBC," Russell said of the financial network that has become investors' TV station of choice during stock-market hours. 

 Russell is president of Ariston Capital Management, an operator of one mutual fund for convertible securities in general and another solely for Internet convertibles. 

 A convertible is a bondlike security that under certain conditions can be exchanged for shares of the same company's stock. 

 "I think what investors should do is focus on the long term," Russell said. "Find growth industries, investigate them and buy them for the long term. I can't tell from one day to the next where our industries, our positions are going to go. But over the long term, stock prices and convertible prices will track earnings." 

 And virtually nothing clouds the long term, which will include even more technological advances than already have occurred. Russell buys heavily into that, seeing such areas as the Internet build-out and biotech development in heavy growth modes. 

 Yesterday was another good one to avoid the short term. After two days in which the Nasdaq composite index climbed while the Dow Jones industrials fell, the two major benchmarks reversed themselves. 

 "I can't explain that," Russell said, sticking to his long-term focus. "We're not trying to time the market, because it has become very volatile. We're focused on huge growth industries. A lot of that is in technology." 

 Among favored stocks in Russell's funds are Analog Devices, TriQuint Semiconductor, Vitesse Semiconductor, EMC, Veritas Software and Getty Images. 

 Concerned that personal-computer sales were slowing, Russell recently sold Intel, the biggest chip maker for PCs. He may not be a timer, but his timing was superb. After a profit warning late yesterday, Intel stock traded down more than $13 at one point. 

 Microsoft, with a major foot in the same business, immediately dropped nearly $4 after regular trading. Since Intel and Microsoft are Dow members, and since each $1 change equals 5.9 Dow points, the drop just by those two alone could account for more than 100 points. 

 A ripple effect would dampen almost all semiconductor, software and other computer-related stocks. 

 The Old Economy Dow gained 77.60 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,765.52. The Nasdaq fell 68.57 points, or 1.8 percent, to 3,828.87. 

 With such undercurrents as high oil prices, a slowing economy and shrinking corporate profits filling the air, investors act confused. Throw in a semiconductor warning and all bets may be off. 

 Boeing traded at its highest price ever, $60.69, and closed at its highest close ever, $60.13, up $1.06. The stock already had galloped well ahead when the company this week said cash flow would be even better than expected. Boeing is a Dow-industrials stock, as is Microsoft. 

 But the Redmond software producer went the other way, down 6 cents to $64.19 at the close of regular trading. 

 Many of yesterday's losers were today's winners, and vice versa. But a few stocks authored separate stories. TTM Technologies, a Redmond circuit-board maker, sold its first shares to the public yesterday at $16. Today, the shares leaped 40 percent, up $5.94 to $20.94. 

 PhotoWorks vaulted 24 percent, up 75 cents to $3.88, after it arranged a deal to handle photofinishing for users of the well-known Yahoo! Web navigator. 

 Alcide, a Redmond maker of disinfectants for the animal-health market, reported financial results. The stock jumped $6, or 40 percent, to $21. 

 Cell Therapeutics executed a successful stock sale at $38. Fresh cash is a plus for biotechs. The stock bounced $5 to $44.25. 

 Other risers, mostly making up day-before losses: Nextel Partners, up $1.38 to $24.38; Coldwater Creek, up $2 to $35.25; WatchGuard Technologies, up $2.63 to $49.75; click2learn, up 81 cents to $13.38; Pixelworks, up $3.38 to $39.50; and Stancorp Financial Group, up $2.38 to $41. 

 Semiconductors were dumped again. Micron Technology sank $3.94 to $62.50, Lattice Semiconductor fell $3.94 to $58, and TriQuint Semiconductor gave back $2.63 to $40.50. 

 Getty Images sank $4.25 to $32.38 even though the Seattle-based image provider will all but fill Time magazine with Olympics photographs. 

 Among other sliders were InterNap Network Services, off $2.31 to $27.63, and Extended Systems, off $3.75 to $59.

 Investment Column - BPB.

 BPB, ONE of the leading plasterboard manufacturers in the world, is crumbling badly. Yesterday, it confirmed the worst fears of the market with a profits warning that sent the shares reeling. 

 The shares stood at around 395p in May and 300p just three weeks ago, but started to drop after news came from BPB's competitors that the US market is deteriorating. Yesterday the stock took a second blow, falling 33.5p to 206p, as the company bowed to the inevitable and admitted that conditions in the US were poor. 

 This is because new capacity in that market, the world's largest, has led to a dramatic drop in prices. What BPB must explain to its shareholders, is why, in the face of deteriorating market conditions, it paid #230m for Celotex, a US company, in June. BPB is the market leader in Canada but Celotex was its first acquisition in the US, and it came with a 4 per cent market share in that country. 

 The timing of this acquisition is unfortunate, to say the least. Management clearly misjudged the market collapse where prices have tumbled from $160 to $100 per thousand yards of plasterboard in the past few months. 

 BPB also said yesterday that volumes in east Germany and Poland were disappointing, but added that the rest of its markets remained healthy. 

 The warning yesterday from BPB came ahead of its interim figures, due in November. Analysts immediately slashed their full year profit forecasts from #250m to #200m. There is no sign that the US or Germany will improve soon, and there is a distinct danger that more bad news will flow from BPB. 

 The shares may look cheap on a forward multiple of seven but investors should still steer clear.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Intel Corp. cautioned Wall Street that its third- quarter revenues will be far below expectations, making investors nervous that the chip-maker's troubles, attributed to weak demand in Europe, could be a harbinger for the entire high-tech sector. 

Thursday's warning confirmed industry analysts' suspicions that the once-robust personal computer industry is ailing. 

"You could smell this one coming," said analyst Drew Peck of S.G. Cowen Securities Corp. "And the situation is not going to get any better any time soon." 

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker said its revenue for the period ending Sept. 30 will range between $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion, about 3 percent to 5 percent higher than second-quarter revenue of $8.3 billion. 

Industry analysts had been expecting third quarter revenues of $9 billion to $9.1 billion, or 9 to 10 percent higher than the second quarter. 

The first sign of trouble came in July with a report that orders for processors increased by just 5 percent while demand in the overall semiconductor market rose by 45 percent, Peck said. 

The news sent shares of Intel down $12.92, or 21 percent, to $48.06 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Intel finished the regular trading session Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market at $61.48, down $1.58. 

After-hours trading volume on Thursday was heavy, with some 15 million shares of Intel exchanging hands, amounting to more than one- third of Thursday's regular trading volume. 

The stocks of several other high-profile companies also got caught in Intel's downdraft. 

"Clearly, this is going to raise concerns. We already know that the usual seasonal recovery that occurs in the PC market in August has been slow in coming," said analyst Dan Scovel of Needham &Co. in New York. "It will be interesting to see if other people in the PC space are feeling it too." 

Intel attributed the disappointing performance to the troubled European economy.

 POINT OF VIEW: Euro Intervention Came Too Late For Intel

 A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Thanks, central bankers, but a few cents isn't going to bail out the likes of Intel Corp. (INTC) and other U.S. firms whose dollar-priced wares still look mighty expensive to Europeans. 

 The Federal Reserve and central banks in Britain and Japan teamed up to help the European Central Bank in its first-ever intervention in foreign-exchange markets to support the steadily weakening euro. 

 The effort was notable both for its wide participation and its timing just one day ahead of a meeting in Prague of the Group of Seven nations: The world's major powers were clearly sending a message about what they see as the undervalued state of the single European currency. 

 The message probably came too late in the third quarter to help the earnings of firms like Intel, whose warning late Thursday that revenues wouldn't meet expectations sent its stock and that of most other technology firms plummeting Friday morning. 

 Intel, the largest manufacturer of microprocessor chips for PCs and therefore a proxy for the health of the whole computer industry, singled out weak European demand as a culprit. 

 Yet the list of companies that have already cited the euro's precarious state as a factor weighing on upcoming earnings reports is already pretty long - and it's not just a collection of tech names. It includes Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL), Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT), Gillette Co. (G), McDonald's Corp. (MCD) and Dupont Co. (DD). 

 In some cases - take McDonald's, for example - the fact that the euro has given up more than a quarter of its value since its inception as a currency for business transactions in January 1999 is mainly an accounting problem: converting euro-based profits back into dollars hits the bottom line, because the weak euro buys fewer dollars. 

 But Intel and other firms sell their products to corporate customers in dollars, and those customers - like PC makers, for instance - turn around and do the same to other corporations. So a PC that uses a more expensive chip costs more dollars to buy, and corporations that purchase with euros will have to rethink their orders. In other words, demand for dollar-based products is also being affected. 

 This is what separates the Golden Arches from the Tech Titans: Presumably, European McDonald's outfits buy most of their supplies from vendors over there and pay with the local currency. So - with consumers still scarfing down burgers and fries - they aren't more or less affected than any local European firms. (It's only when the money goes home to the bean counters in Oak Brook, Il., that McDonald's suffers.) Intel, on the other hand - and other firms that import dollar-priced materials - gets hit on the demand side AND has to suffer the currency conversion come earnings time. 

 Thus the more than 20% drop in Intel stock on record-breaking volume of nearly 200 million shares by midday Friday. 

 To be sure, the problem goes beyond the headlines - for example, Intel's customers may have over-ordered over the summer, some contend - but even those factors are at least tangentially related to a weak euro: if European companies have to contend with a weak currency - itself at least partially a proxy for an economy that's still not outshining America's - their demand for materials isn't likely to ramp up from here. 

 Meanwhile, the high price of oil isn't helping. Oil, of course, is used in various forms as a raw material for manufacturing, and it and its components are also tagged in dollars. 

 It took an Intel profit warning for investors of all stripes to finally wake up to what a weak euro can mean to the fortunes of the companies they hold in portfolio. And the chipmaker is certainly not the only company selling in Europe that is forced to used dollar-denominated inputs. Indeed, there may be more to come: In a research report this week Merill Lynch argued that the euro's effect on U.S. corporate earnings will be even stronger in the third quarter. 

 Ironically, investors learned this lesson on the same day the euro staged a rally of as much as 4 cents due to the central-bank intervention. 

 But a euro at around 89 cents is still to the dollar is still well below the $1.17 the currency weighed in at at birth, and it's still too weak to save Intel's third quarter.

 G7 Fear Of Global Crisis Outweighs Risks In Intervention

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In jointly intervening to support the euro Friday, the world's financial policy makers embarked on a high-stakes game that pits their credibility against the power of global financial markets. 

 Whether they end up the winners won't be known for some time and will depend, to some degree, on the euro stabilizing. But one thing's certain, market analysts say, and that is that the Group of Seven governments clearly thought that by not acting they would risk a major breakdown in global financial stability. They showed they saw this as a greater concern than the threat to their credibility of the euro failing to rally. 

 "It was a case of short-term credibility versus long-term economic damage," said Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist Mike Rosenberg, who agreed with the central banks that the `bigger risk was not doing anything." 

 The change of heart for the U.S. Treasury was most telling. Until very recently, Treasury officials had suggested they weren't willing to throw good money into currency markets and that intervention rarely worked. What led them to abandon that position, many say, was a confluence of factors that together painted a dangerously unstable picture for the global economy. 


      Twin Threats



There was a risk, says Robert Sinche, currency strategist at Citibank
in New York, that the G7 leaders would be perceived as impotent against
the twin threats of volatility in currency and oil markets. And that
only heightened "the risk of creating further instability in other asset
markets."



`Now, here you have in a 24-hour period, concerted global intervention
to address the volatility in FX markets and the possibility of using the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to address volatility and instability in oil
markets," Sinche said.



With oil prices not far from decade-high levels of around $37.00 seen
earlier in the week, President Clinton ordered a limited release of oil
from the so-called Strategic Petroleum Reserve Friday in an effort to
contain prices. Along with the euro's fall to all-time lows 27% below
its Jan. 1, 1999 launch level, the soaring price of oil is considered a
threat to the ongoing strength of the global economy.



Sinche argued that U.S. officials would have been eager to avoid the
mistakes of September 1987, when German and U.S. "squabbling over the
dollar and the Deutsche mark" and the perception that governments were
unwilling to act pushed the dollar so low that the Fed was forced to
raise interest rates in the currency's defense. Those events were the
catalyst for the October stock market crash , Sinche noted, and this
time around "there was the potential that something similar was about to
develop."



Still, it must have taken a lot for the U.S. to agree to intervene.
The Treasury ran the risk of undermining its so-called strong dollar
policy - which until recently was regarded as a welcome disinflationary
factor in the U.S. and reason for foreign investors to favor U.S.
assets.



More specifically, there is a credibility risk for the Federal Reserve
and for the central banks of Europe, Japan, Britain and Canada, that if
their intervention were to fail and the euro were to return to its
downward track, they would lose their ability to influence markets. In
addition to monetary policy, central banks rely heavily on their ability
to steer markets through the messages they send.



And it would seem that central banks are up against a more potent
force this time than they were during previous currency crises, when
they battled hedge funds and speculators. It's widely believed that the
recent euro's weakness is the result of massive flows of "real money"
from corporations and large institutional investors into the strong U.S.
economy and not of speculative selling.



"It is relatively easy to change short-term and medium-term investment
flows because they respond to price movement," Sinche said. "But a CEO
is not going to change a decision to go ahead with a merger or an
acquisition on a 3% movement in a currency."



G7 officials know this, Sinche said. Instead, what they are likely
trying to do is to stop in its tracks a nascent buildup of speculative
short positions that had begun to appear this week. That was evidenced
by a rise in the Swiss franc against the euro, he said.



They can't stop the corporates, but by delivering a blow to these
early speculators, they can stop "worse things from happening," Sinche
said. "In that sense, we may never know how successful this really was
because we mightn't ever know how bad things would have gotten had they
not acted."



       Intel Is The Final Straw



For the Europeans, the downside was clear - creeping consumer prices
pointed to the risk of imported inflation getting out of control if the
euro weakened further, while the loss of confidence in the currency had
wide political ramifications.



For the high-growth, low inflation U.S., the risks had until recently
been less clear. But this month, exchange rate problems were cited for
the first time by numerous U.S. companies for weak earnings. And when
high-tech giant Intel Corp. (INTC) delivered its third quarter profitwarning late Thursday it brought home the fact that U.S. global
interests were also vulnerable to a weak euro.



"The dollar was getting dangerously overvalued, not just against the
euro but against all major currencies and that meant that if the U.S.
didn't act soon it would face a serious loss of global competitiveness,"
said Deutsche Bank's Rosenberg.



What the Treasury did "was draw a line in the sand," said Rosenberg.
"They were saying `we are not going to let this trend continue to
undermine our competitiveness."'



Where that line lies is still up to the market to decide. Wherever it
is, the leaders of the G7 will be hoping it sticks.

The fallout from  Intel's profit warning has been quick to spread overseas. Technology shares struggled throughout Asia today, dragging Tokyo's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index more than 3 percent. In Europe, London's FTSE, the Paris CAC-40 and the Frankfurt DAX are all off more than 1 percent this morning. None of this bodes well for Wall Street, where ailing technology shares sent the NASDAQ falling 1.7 percent yesterday. The S&P 500 gave up 1/10th of a percent. But the Dow Jones industrial average managed to buck that losing trend, picking up 77 points or 3/4 of a percent to end the day at 10,765.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

Fasten your seat belts because after the bell,  Intel dropped a bomb on the markets. The computer chip giant confessed that third-quarter sales will miss the mark. The company is blaming the shortfall on weak demand in Europe.  Intel said sales will rise 3 percent to 5 percent from the second quarter. That is much less than the 8 percent to 10 percent rise the Street was banking on.   

The reaction was swift.  Intel's stock tanked as much as $13 in after-hours trading. And that could spell big trouble for the markets.  Intel makes up 3.4 percent of the Dow and just about 3 percent of the NASDAQ, so when you have a stock as important as  Intel falling this hard, you could be looking at a major hit for many of the related tech stocks.   

And profit warnings, of course, continue to plague investors. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter got a haircut, the stock down nearly $7 after earnings came in 8 cents below estimates.

 Wall Street Stocks End Mixed After Intel's  Profit Warning .

 NEW YORK, September 22 (Xinhua) - Wall Street stocks ended mixed Friday with blue chips rising while tech shares falling after a profit warning from the world largest semiconductor maker Intel. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 81.85 at 10,847.37 points, extending its gain of 77.60 points Thursday. 

 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 25.11 at 3,803.76 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 0.33 at 1,448.72. 

 The market opened lower today after Intel announced late Thursday that its earnings would miss expectations. The latest warnings added to worries about corporate earnings as the U.S. economy is slowing after six hikes in interest rates in the past 15 months. 

 Intel, both a component of the Dow index and the Nasdaq composite, suffered heavy losses from the profit warning. About 308 million shares of the company changed hands throughout the session, knocking off about 95 billion U.S. dollars in its market value. 

 But the Dow index recovered in the trading and closed higher as investors bought stocks of old-line companies such as financial giant J.P. Morgan and drugmaker Merck. The index fell as much as 144 points early in the trading. 

 The Nasdaq composite made a dramatic rebound late in the session and recovered most of the 214-point loss as investors rushed in the market to hunt for bargains before the closing. Among the tech companies hit heavily were Dell Computer, Cisco Systems and International Business Machines Corp. 

 Intel's warning also hit the Asian stock markets. High-tech shares in Tokyo, Seoul and Hong Kong were lower. 

 But European stock market recovered later from an early selloff mainly because major industrialized nations jolted the currency market with a joint intervention to halt the fall of the euro, the common European currency. 

 The NYSE volume rose 5.11 at 659.34 and the American Stock Exchange index rose 2.19 at 929.94. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.47 at 518.82. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,511 down, 1,363 up and 484 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume increased to 1.16 billion shares from 1.08 billion in the previous session.

 Intel Expects Its Revenue To Be Below Expectations

 SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 21 -- The Intel Corporation warned today that its third-quarter revenues were likely to be below the company's previous expectations, primarily because of weaker demand for the company's microprocessing chips in Europe. 

 The news sent Intel's shares down by 20 percent in after-hours trading. 

 Intel said it now expected revenue for the third quarter to be about 3 percent to 5 percent higher than second-quarter revenue of $8.3 billion. Analysts had predicted growth of 12 to 15 percent. Intel did not forecast third-quarter earnings. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/ Thomson Financial had previously expected earnings of 41 cents a diluted share. 

 Intel made its announcement after the close of the market. Intel shares closed at $61.48, down $1.58, in Nasdaq trading. Intel's stock fell $12.60 to $48.88 in after-hours trading, with 11.7 million shares changing hands, according to Instinet. 

 Analysts said that the shortfall from a bellwether technology company like Intel would probably worsen the recent turmoil among stocks in the sector, and that investors should brace for a big Nasdaq sell-off on Friday. 

 Intel shares had already lost almost 25 percent of their value after Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, downgraded the stock earlier this month. On Wednesday, Mr. Kumar said Intel shares had fallen far enough to represent a trading buy, although he did not change his rating. Today, he said he believed the weakness extended well beyond Europe. 

 ''There is weakness across all the geographies,'' Mr. Kumar said. ''With the exception of Japan, demand fell off a cliff. What that does is create significant inventory overhang, which basically destroys the pricing environment,'' he said, noting that Intel's archrival, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., stands to suffer the most. ''A.M.D. basically becomes road kill, but there will be a huge ripple effect all up and down the semiconductor supply chain.'' 

 Since the introduction of the original I.B.M. PC, Intel had been able to ride computer users' endless desire for more processing power. The spread of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system and the related Office suite of applications drove demand for more powerful processors. Intel could introduce processors at higher prices, and consumers would snap them up. 

 But the climate is different now. The big drivers of demand are the Internet and electronic commerce, neither of which is limited so much by microprocessor power as by bandwidth. Intel is in the bandwidth business, with various networking products, but not nearly to the extent that it is in the processing power business. And on most of today's real-world applications, there is little benefit in upgrading from a 500-megahertz Pentium II chip to a 1-gigahertz Pentium III. Windows ME, the new operating system from Microsoft, does not require more processing power than did Windows 98. 

 Intel said it expected gross profit margin for the third quarter to be 62 percent, plus or minus a point, down from the company's previous expectations. Profit margin is primarily driven by revenues and the mix of product sold during the quarter. 

 However, interest and other income is expected to be about $900 million for the third quarter, up from the company's previous expectations of $800 million. Intel said it expected third-quarter expenses to be up 7 to 9 percent from second-quarter expenses of $2.2 billion, primarily because of higher spending on marketing and research and development in new business areas. 

 For its second fiscal quarter, which ended on July 1, Intel had revenue of $8.3 billion, a quarterly record, up 23 percent from the second quarter of 1999 and 4 percent sequentially. Net income excluding acquisition-related costs was $3.5 billion, up 98 percent from the second quarter of 1999 and up 16 percent sequentially. At the time, Craig Barrett, Intel's president and chief executive, said he expected strong demand to continue into the second half of the fiscal year. 

 [Asian stock markets sank on Friday as technology shares were hit by the profit warning by Intel. In Japan, stocks tumbled, led by semiconductor issues like the chipmakers NEC and Toshiba. By early afternoon, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average had shed 470.33 points, or 2.88 percent, to 15,840.72. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 2.03 percent just after the opening. And regional markets like Seoul and Taipei dominated by technology issues were down about 4 percent to about 6 percent.]

 PARIS (mktnews) - Euro zone bonds opened higher Friday in a futures-led market on firmer euro, weak stock markets and gains in Treasuries overnight, before paring back on the limited euro pick-up and strong German state CPI data, market participants said: 

 -The December bund contract created a gap between Thursday's high of 105.07 and Friday's opening at 105.20, up 26 ticks from the previous close. As stops were triggered around 105.30, the contract set a day's high at 105.45 before returning near the opening level. The German 10-yr yld fell to 5.23% in early trade from a close at 5.266%. 

 -While the euro traded above $0.86 in early trade, it pared ground, pushing EMU bonds down. European stock markets opened lower, however, following the Nasdaq's fall Thursday led by a profit warning from the big U.S. computer company Intel Corp., which is providing support to EMU bonds, players said. 

 -They are also eyeing the German quarterly auction calendar, which, if lower than expected, could bring significant support. The release of Germany's 4Q refinancing program could be today or more likely on Monday. 

 -While weak stocks are supportive, German state CPI data for Sept. are disappointing, players said. The latest report came from Hesse, showing a 0.5% monthly increase for a yearly gain of 2.4%, reinforcing the strong data from Bavaria. 

 -Thus, EMU bond gains are seen capped, especially since Thursday's rebound in the euro, mostly based on rumors of concerted intervention ahead of Saturday's G-7 meeting, may be short-lived. 

 -The Dec bund contract has strong support at 105.0, with the next resistance point seen at 105.47 and 105.70. 

 -The euribor strip proved firmer than the bund Friday morning, with gains ranging from 2.5 bps to 7 bps. The 3-month implied rate of the Liffe Dec 00 euribor contract traded at 5.08% in early trade, compared to a close at 5.12% and 5.14% one week earlier. 

 -Earlier Friday, in-line German PPI data for August were shrugged off.

 TALK FROM THE TRENCHES - INTERVENTION WAKES UP US CREDIT MKTS.

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - Surprise central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market turned what was supposed to be a sleepy Friday into a very active one in the U.S. credit markets. And, if intervention occurs again Sunday night, Monday could be quite exciting as well, sources say. 

 Around 7:15 AM ET Friday, when stocks around the world were tumbling because of Thursday's after hours profit warning from Intel, the European Central Bank initiated a coordinated intervention to prop up the beleaguered euro. The U.S, Japan and France joined in. The Bank of England sold on behalf of the U.K. Treasury, which added a little weight to the action, sources said. The euro jumped from around $0.8750 to $0.9040. 

 It is believed that three rounds of interventions took place before the market settled down. But with each successive round, the euro saw lower highs. It reached around $0.9040 on the first move, $0.8925 on the second and $0.8910 on the third. sources say. It now trades around $0.8800. 

 Treasury Summers pre-G7 statement after the intervention did not do much to help the euro. In fact it might be viewed as disingenuous. Granted the purpose of the statement was to preview the G-7 meeting, and not respond to the market's concerns about foreign exchange intervention. But, really, Larry, how can "our policy on the dollar be unchanged" when the U.S. intervened to sell dollars on Friday? And for market players, the biggest problem is that he keeps reiterating mantra about the strong dollar being in the U.S. best interest. So why did we intervene? 

 And for market players, the biggest problem is that Mr. Summers keeps reiterating the mantra about the strong dollar being in the U.S. best interests. So why did we intervene? 

 At any rate, the G-7 meeting ends Saturday. Foreign exchange players are on guard for the possibility of more intervention Sunday night in the U.S. because it is Monday morning in Tokyo. Historically, that has been a good time to intervene because liquidity is thin. 

 In Friday's move, the ECB did begin the intervention when the euro was already receiving some support because of the diving stock markets. When a currency is going in the desired direction, that is the best time to come in, sources say. 

 In trying to piece together what happened in the U.S. credit markets Friday, here is a blow by blow as best we can figure: 

 1) Treasuries got a bid late Thursday from Intel's after hours 3Q profit warnings. Some central banks sold treasuries into that strength; 

 2) The treasury rally continued in Tokyo hours and buying was concentrated in front end as the Nikkei and Hang Seng plunged over 3%; 

 3) Japanese sellers of agency paper for their September half-year end purposes was seen. There were also buyers of short spread product reported; 

 4) In Tokyo, swap, central bank and real money accounts were said to be selling treasury 2s, 5s and 10s into the strength; 

 5) In London, prices came off the highs as treasury sellers were seen in the front and intermediate areas; 

 6) Mid-morning in London, real money buyers showed up in 5s out to 30s; 

 7) Overnight and in early NY, players who were buying treasuries were also said to be selling agencies on the other side; 

 8) Agency, swap and corporate spreads widened out. On the widening, buyers showed up and spreads came back in the NY morning; 

 9) During the euro-intervention, treasuries were still doing better because of stock weakness. 

 10) Intervention helped stocks in Europe, so treasuries came off the top. 

 Going forward, the world markets are still concerned about the four "E" words: the euro, equity earnings, the U.S. economy and energy prices. 

 Since some of the G-7 countries provided action on the euro, let's see if they can jawbone OPEC into any action on oil. 

 Treasury prices are currently off the session tops. Concerns about a possible rebound in equity prices and the possibility of central bank selling connected with intervention are worrisome to the bond markets. 

 Keep in mind, that foreign exchange settlements are two days after the trade while treasury transactions settle the next day. So bill or short-coupon sales to raise the proceeds for Friday's interventions could take place Monday. Then again, they may have already taken place, some say. 

 All this could prove interesting for next week's two-year note sale. The WI 2Y is holding below 6% Friday. If it is yielding between 5.875% and 5.999% on the day of the sale. Treasury will reopen an old issue instead of issuing a new 2Y. 

 By the way, this is the fifteen year anniversary of the Plaza accord. That is when the U.S. and other industrialized nations met at the Plaza Hotel in NYC to consider ways to lower the dollar. Interesting, isn't it?

 Analysis: Earnings warnings, rising oil prices and a weak euro contribute to a continued downturn in the US stock market averages

 LINDA WERTHEIMER, host: The impact of the falling euro is being felt in the US stock market. Several big American companies have warned recently that the weakness of the euro is making their products more expensive in Europe and that's hurting profits. The latest company to issue such a warning was computer chip maker Intel.  As a result, the company's stock price fell dramatically today.  The Intel sell-off is part of an overall drop in stock prices this month, a decline that's also partly due to rising oil prices.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports. 

 JIM ZARROLI reporting: 

 As soon as trading began this morning, Intel investors started unloading stock, and the company's share price plunged.  By the end of the day, a record 308 million shares had changed hands.  At its worst point, the stock had lost 25 percent of its value, wiping out $100 billion in market capitalization. And the bloodletting soon spread to other tech companies, such as Microsoft, Dell and IBM.  Joseph Lyro(ph) is vice president and head of equity research at Stone & McCarthy.  He says the profit warning that touched off Intel's decline today came at a time when the market is already jittery. 

 Mr. JOSEPH LYRO (Stone & McCarthy):  I think this Intel warning came as the market was already very, very concerned about the actual third-quarter earnings results, which are going to be announced on a steady basis in the middle of October.  And it created a little bit of a stampede, a little bit of a panic out of the tech sector. 

 ZARROLI:  By the end of the day, the market had recovered a lot of ground, but stocks are still down considerably for the month.  The NASDAQ Composite index has fallen more than 10 percent since September 1st, and the other major indexes have lost ground, too.  The drop reflects heightened concern among investors that corporate profits are likely to slow in the months ahead. There's been a lot of evidence lately that economic growth is finally slowing after six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.  Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, says this slowdown has come at a time when oil prices have reached a 10-year high. 

 Mr. MARK ZANDI (Economy.com):  It may undermine consumer confidence. It certainly could undermine business confidence.  It certainly is already cutting into corporate profits, and it could cut into it even more. So this is a growing issue and potentially, under a certain set of circumstances, could be, you know, a not inconsequential risk to the economy. 

 ZARROLI:  The continuing drop in the euro is only adding to investors fears. The decline makes American products more expensive in Europe, which hurts companies that want to sell there. 

 Some economist also worry that the euro's volatility could have a destabilizing effect on US markets.  In recent months, Europeans have snapped up US-based assets, particularly stocks, because they believe they'll make more money here, and that has helped to prop up stock prices.  But when the euro hits bottom and the dollar begins to lose strength again, they could begin to flee.  Bill Meehan is chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. 

 Mr. BILL MEEHAN (Cantor Fitzgerald):  Really, just a slowdown in the funds flowing into the US equity market from Europeans would have a very disruptive effect on the market.  And then, of course, when the market starts to fall, the dollar will fall further. 

 ZARROLI:  And Meehan says that could set off a kind of vicious cycle with prices spiraling downward.  Overall, the US economy remains in good shape, though, and can absorb some blows; even a major spike in energy prices. Still, there are potential risks right now which are causing nervous investors to take a new look at the economic landscape, and they are quick to bail out when companies like Intel report any sign of trouble.  Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

 Dow recovers from Intel  profit warning , Nasdaq still down

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after being dragged down most of the day after another profit warning by a bellwether company - this time chipmaker Intel Corp. 

 Bargain hunters helped the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session. 

 Broader stock indicators also closed lower, but well above their lows for the day. 

 The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the tech-heavy index fall 214 points at one point. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72. 

 "We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a little bleak this morning," said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 

 News that the seven largest industrial nations had stepped in to help buoy the ailing euro currency, as well as strong speculation that the Clinton administration planned to dip into the nation's oil reserves to ease rising energy prices - a speculation eventually borne out - helped offset the near panic caused by Intel's profit warning. 

 The world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter revenues to fall below expectations. The company specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker results. 

 The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, fueling the atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most widely held stocks. 

 Shares of Intel traded hands at breakneck speed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Volume reached 304 million, shattering the daily Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is 38 million shares. 

 Intel's shares closed down $13.55, or 22 percent, at $47.94.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell in early trading Friday, as investors fled the markets in the wake of additional profit warnings by bellwether companies - this time chipmaker Intel Corp. 

 In the first hour of trading, the Dow was down 97.59 at 10,667.94. 

 Broader indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 175.34 to 3,653.53 and the Standard & Poor's 500 was off 21.34 at 1,427.71. 

 The world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter revenues to fall below earlier expectations. 

 Investors began fleeing the market in after-hours trading Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at Friday's opening. 

 The selloff in the United States mimicked actions overseas, where stock prices in both Asia and Europe slumped. 

 With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their expectations. 

 The Russell 2000 index fell 9.39 to 504.96. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.02 percent. In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.53 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.32 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 0.83 percent.

 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Shares of Intel Corp. tumbled nearly 21 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday, after the world's largest computer chip maker warned third-quarter profits would come in below expectations. 

 Intel's plunge dragged down other chip makers, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. at 23-3/4 in after-hours trading on the Instinet brokerage system, down from its close of 27-9/16. Micron Technology Inc. shares traded at 55-1/4 in after-hours trading, down from its close of 62-1/2; Cypress Semiconductor Corp. traded at 41-1/4 down from its 45-15/16 close; National Semiconductor Corp. traded at 40 down from its 42-15/16 close and Texas Instruments traded at 54 down from its close of 57-5/16. 

 The news sparked an immediate sell-off of technology stocks, with Dell, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, IBM and Hewlett-Packard all reporting losses. 

 "This is going to hurt," said Guy Truicko, a portfolio manager with Unity Management Inc. 

 "The Nasdaq is going to test the lows...we had two days ago," he said. 

 Futures on both major U.S. indices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell on the Intel announcement. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 92 points to 3673, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 24.5 to 1445, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 65 to 10,740. The No. 1 chip maker is a member of all three market benchmarks. 

 Intel traded at $48-5/8, down from its close of 61-31/64, a low unseen since early February, on the Instinet electronic trading system. 

 The stock was halted at 1617, when it was down $1-37/64 for the day and resumed trading at 1700 EDT. 

 Citing weak European demand for its microchips, Intel said it expects third quarter revenues to fall below previous forecasts, and now sees a rise of only about 3 percent to 5 percent from second quarter sales of $8.3 billion. 

 "Analysts have been slashing earnings estimates for weeks, so investors shouldn't be completely shocked by this announcement," Truicko said. 

 The Intel warning had an immediate effect on leading technology companies, with Microsoft Corp. at $62, off from its close of $64-3/16. Dell Computer Corp. dropped from a close of $37-15/16 to trade at $33-5/8 on Instinet. Cisco Systems Inc. also fell to $57-1/4, from a close of $61-1/8. 

 International Business Machines Corp. dropped to $123, from $126-1/16 and Hewlett-Packard Co. slipped to $96 from $99-15/16, following the Intel news. 

 After Intel's warning, Dell chairman Michael Dell said the personal computer giant was "still on track" to increase revenues 30 percent this year.

 UK telecoms hit by Sprint warning, funding fears.

 LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - UK telecom stocks fell sharply on Thursday as sentiment was hit by a profit warning from U.S. firm Sprint and concerns about operators' funding needs after a share placing by Energis . 

 Extending losses made on Wednesday, British Telecom tumbled 7.2 percent, Cable & Wireless fell four percent Redstone Telecom fell 9.6 percent and Colt Telecom fell four percent by 1031 GMT. 

 Index heavyweight Vodafone was 2.7 percent lower, confounding the many broker "buy" orders on the former market favourite. 

 Weighing heavily was Wednesday's news from Sprint Corp. that third-quarter profits would suffer from stiff competition in the long-distance telephone market and fewer-than-expected subscribers in its wireless telephone unit. 

 "The profit warning from Sprint shook up the telecoms yesterday and there are concerns about the fund-raising requirements of the operators," said Christian Maher, telecoms analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite Securities. 

 Energis was spared significant selling pressure but was still 3.8 percent lower at 507 pence, after sliding 11 percent on Wednesday in the wake of its 400 million pound placing to fund its Internet activities and European expansion. 

 Cable TV operator Telewest Communications Plc led the table of FTSE 100 losers with a 9.3 percent fall. 

 "The sector is certainly a lot cheaper than it was six months ago but there are some structural concerns that have dragged it down and will drag it down further," said ABN telecoms analyst James Ross. 

 These included the cost of Europe's third-generation mobile phone licences and the Sprint profits warning. 

 VALUATIONS OVERCOOKED 

 "Valuations got very over-cooked in the TMT bull run, they are now reasonable in quite a few sectors," Ross said. 

 "We are not generally that excited about cellular. We think generally people got a bit too carried away in their market expectations," he added. 

 Adding to negative sector sentiment was Deutsche Bank, which said it was cutting its rating on Energis to "underperform" from "market perform" and initiated Cable & Wireless at "market perform". 

 The bank published a report covering the alternative telecommunications carriers and said its analysis confirmed its fears of oversupply in the long-distance segment.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's fiscal third-quarter profit rose 28%, but the results came in well below Wall Street expectations. 

 The financial-services firm reported net income of $1.25 billion, or $1.09 a share, for the quarter that ended Aug. 31, compared with $970 million, or 83 cents a share, for the year-earlier period. 

 Analysts expected a profit of $1.17 a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Net revenue -- total revenue less interest expense and the provision for loan losses --  rose 18% to $6.29 billion from $5.33 billion. 

 -- 

 Ford Motor offered to acquire the 18.5% of Hertz it doesn't already own for $30 a share, or about $597 million. 

 The offer price represents a 24% premium over Hertz's price of $24.25 at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. But it is well below the 52-week high of $51.75 reached on Jan. 19, 2000, and slightly below the $31.19 of four weeks ago. 

 Ford sold the 18.5% minority stake in Hertz in an initial public offering in 1997.

 Jobless claims declined last week to the lowest level since early August, a sign the labor market remains strong. 

 First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 18,000 to 308,000 in the week ended Sept. 16, the Labor Department said Thursday. 

 Economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets expected claims to slip only to 315,000. 

 The previous week's claims were revised to 326,000 from 324,000. 

 Last's week's performance marked the lowest level of claims since the week ended Aug. 5 when they were at 299,000. 

 --- 

 Axa turned in a disappointing first-half performance, as a decline in earnings from its nonlife-insurance and reinsurance businesses offset broad growth in life operations. 

 The French insurer said net profit rose 3.4% to 1.21 billion euros ($1.03 billion) from 1.17 billion euros a year earlier. Analysts had expected net profit of between 1.28 billion and 1.37 billion euros. 

 AXA also said it is pressing ahead with a number of Internet ventures, including online services for auto insurance in France, Germany, Spain, Japan and the U.K. It will also open Internet portals in France, from later this year, and in Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom.

 Major European markets were sharply lower at midday, pulled down by losses in the telecommunications sector as investors reacted to a profitwarning from U.S. group Sprint, and amid general concern about the state of the European economy. 

 In London at midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index shed 122.10 points, or 1.9%, to 6157.80. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index slumped 161 points, or 2.4%, to 6604.23. In Paris, the CAC-40 Index plunged 173.05 points, or 2.7%, to 6232.38. 

 Earlier in Asia, Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 147.26 points, or 0.9%, to close at 16311.05. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index ended down 501.17 points, or 3.2%, at 15164.45.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- American depositary receipts lost ground for the fifth straight trading day Thursday, led by telecommunications and technology issues as Sprint Corp.'s profit warning Wednesday continued to fuel nervousness in the sector. 

 "Telecom stocks got hit hard today," said Jim Cirenza, head of European sales trading at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. "Going into European hours, the Asian markets were down hard and the morale among investors was to sell the telecom shares. And they did." 

 The preliminary Bank of New York ADR Index lost 1.31 points, or 1%, to finish at 137.71. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 77.60, or 0.7%, at 10765.52, while the Nasdaq fell 68.57, or 1.8%, to close at 3828.87. 

 The Nasdaq tried to rally late in the day, but according to Cirenza it was unconvincing to ADR investors. 

 "The market is assuming that Sprint's problems are not company-specific but due to pricing issues in the industry," he said. 

 Receipts of Finnish telecommunications equipment maker Nokia Corp. closed down 5.2% at $41.44. 

 Ericsson finished at $16.42, or 8.8% lower. 

 According to Cirenza, almost every other sector was down in sympathy as the market from August to October usually "has a more difficult time coping with bad news" for lack of cash flow. 

 Besides, Cirenza added, investors aren't convinced that the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are finished tightening interest rates. 

 In other news involving ADRs, Toyota Motor Corp. on Thursday announced production and export data for August, maintaining its position as Japan's No. 1 manufacturer. 

 Toyota's receipts finished 0.9% lower at $78.25. 

 French insurer AXA SA Thursday turned in a disappointing first-half performance, as broad growth in its life insurance operations was offset by a decline in earnings from its non-life insurance and reinsurance businesses in the six months ended June 30. 

 AXA's ADRs closed down 3.9% at $63.88. 

 British Airways PLC and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said Thursday that they have ended their long-running merger talks, blaming complex commercial and regulatory issues surrounding any tie-up. KLM lost 19%, while British Airways finished 5.4% higher. 

 In major European markets, U.K. shares closed down Thursday. The FTSE 100 lost 80.7 points, or 1.3%, at 6199.2. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index fell 82.31 or 1.2% to 6682.92, while the Paris CAC-40 index dropped to 6254.77, down 150.66, or 2.4%, its lowest level since May 29. 

 Overnight in Asia, Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended down 3.2%, or 501.17, at 15164.45, to a 16-week low. Japan's Nikkei fell 147.26, 0.9%, to 16311.05.

 SMARTMONEY.COM: Software That Won't Disappoint

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Allaire (ALLR) took a big hit last week. It lost half of its market value in two days after delivering a severe earnings warning on Thursday. The Web site-development software maker says it may report a loss of 5 cents to 20 cents a share instead of a profit of 7 cents a share, as the Street had been expecting. Allaire Chief Executive David Orfao attributed the embarrassing miss to a seasonal slowdown combined with Allaire's focus on developing new products (apparently at the expense of old ones). 

 Though last week was less traumatic for the tech blue chip Oracle (ORCL), it wasn't fun, either. Shares of the second-biggest software maker in the world slid 10% after it reported fiscal-first-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share. Despite the downdraft, Oracle actually beat estimates by 4 cents a share, increasing its profits by 111% year over year. But investors seemed to take issue with its e-business applications growth and overall revenue figures. 

 It looks as if we're in the midst of another hurricane season for the software sector. New storms seem to brew every quarter, wreaking havoc on stock prices. The potential for damage is so great because software stocks are so highly valued in the first place. There's simply no room for error. 

 Yet some software companies have good reasons to be so dearly valued. These tend to have impressive profit margins which can grow fatter as the business grows. (After all, once the development work is done, successful software programs can be replicated very cheaply.) It's no surprise that the stocks take off like rockets when Wall Street sees fast growth in software. But even a whiff of disappointment can send the rocket stocks plunging. 

 So fishing for solid stocks in the sector is a dangerous business. On the one hand, positive momentum is crucial. On the other hand, if you get in too late, after the swell of momentum has already taken a stock to ear-popping heights, a crash becomes more likely. We looked to balance these concerns. 

 To screen for software this week, we created a recipe that first looks for relatively lowly valued stocks. To find the "bargains" in the field, we calculated software stocks' PEG ratios. (The PEG is the plain old price-to-earnings ratio - price over earnings per share - divided by growth.) This ratio is handy for evaluating software because growth is of the essence. Besides, the group's P/Es are so shockingly high, you'll want to divide by growth to calm your stomach. 

 But that's just the beginning of the screening process. Many stocks are cheap for a reason. For example, the likes of BMC (BMCS) and Compuware (CPWR) are finding the demand for their expertise (in mainframe and enterprise software, respectively) ever weakening. We rejected weak fundamentals and screened for upward sales momentum, instead. We figured investors want evidence that new products are taking off. 

 For sales momentum, we looked to the past year's reports. But we also looked for future-earnings momentum. To that end, we sought out the remaining stocks that have analysts upwardly revising their earnings forecasts. 

 Out of 381 software stocks, we ended up with just seven. The names aren't the usual headline grabbers. Rational (RATL) is the biggest player on our list, with a market cap of $10 billion. Although Rational has climbed in trading pretty consistently as its business grows, it remains in the shadow of the $220 billion gorilla called Oracle. 

 To Web denizens, the most visible of the seven may be Macromedia (MACR). You know those annoying ad banners that flash and twist and show off all that weird animation? Or have you seen those entertainment sites that begin with some fancy multimedia intro? Chances are Macromedia made the software used to craft those inventions. 

 The San Francisco company's Flash and Dreamweaver visual Web tools have become enormously popular. Combined, they account for about half of Macromedia's revenues. While worries about this seasonally slow quarter have weighed on the stock lately, good news appears to be on the horizon. Macromedia released version 5.0 of Flash in August, and it will release an updated version of Dreamweaver later in the fall. 

 Steven Frankel, software analyst for Adams Harkness and Hill, expects Macromedia to generate $99 million in revenue in its second fiscal quarter (which ends Sept. 30), compared to $58 million a year ago. (The company is scheduled to announce its numbers in mid-October.) However, Frankel acknowledges that even those numbers may not be enough to please the markets. "You need to solidly beat your estimates now," he says. "You can't just hit them." 

 While the company might have hot products, Macromedia's stock hasn't exactly burned up the market this year. Part of that, says Frankel, can be attributed to the company's June quarter, when it merely met its earnings estimates. At $65.89, it has fallen nearly 45% off its 52-week high of $118.47 in mid-July. But most analysts are sticking to Macromedia's long-term story. Even if a summer slowdown coupled with weak European sales show up this quarter, the holiday season and beyond look bright. Bright enough to warrant upward revisions in analysts' annual estimates. Thanks to the late summer sell-off, Macromedia has both growth and an attractive valuation. Its P/E ratio of 38.2 relative to projected 2001 earnings is the lowest in our screen results. 

 Another screen survivor, Verity (VRTY), has also had a tough time meeting investors' high demands recently. Last week, the maker of corporate portals exceeded consensus estimates by 6 cents a share. The quarterly profit came to $7.2 million. At the same time, Verity reported 58% revenue growth year-over-year. Yet by Tuesday's close, Verity's stock had fallen 14% in two days. 

 "I believe it's totally an anomaly," says a bullish Bert Hochfeld of Josephthal & Co. This analyst sees a strong sales pipeline promising to grab more market share as the company heads into the next quarter. 

 But even before Verity's recent slump, the stock was relatively cheap. In fact, it showed up on our last software screen in July. Since then, it has inched up 5%, but is still trading below its Internet software peers' levels. Banc of America Montgomery analyst Greg Vogel has a theory about this. He thinks the Veritys of the world are encountering what amounts to "stuck-in-the-middle" syndrome. It isn't an enormous company with tons of visibility or security, like an Oracle or a Siebel (SEBL). Nor is it a hip start-up like Blue Martini (BLUE). "There's an overall neglect of the middle ground. Because of that, the valuation suffers abnormally," says Vogel. 

 Of course, Verity is still trading at a hefty 58 times this year's (upwardly revised) earnings. It's all relative in software. For investors looking to get in relatively late in the game, a relatively cheap company with healthy sales and earnings momentum may be a relatively safe way to go.

 U.S. Blue-Chip Shares Decline On Concerns Over Earnings --- Sprint PCS Leads Drop After  Profit Warning  --- Nasdaq Bucks Downward Trend

 NEW YORK -- Blue-chip shares fell as another spate of earnings worries rattled investors.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished well off its lows of the session, but nevertheless fell 101.37 points to 10687.92. On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners led advancers 1,658 to 1,148, with 513 unchanged.   

 Shares of Sprint PCS closed at $33 (38.73 euros), down $7.81, dropping below the previous 52-week low set Oct. 15, after the wireless communications service provider warned that it would report signing up significantly fewer new customers in the third quarter than Wall Street has been expecting.   

 That warning crunched other wireless service providers, sending shares of VoiceStream Wireless down $8.10 to $103.31 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of AT&T Wireless off $1.69 to $21.94, a 52-week low, and Nextel Communications off $2.69 to $44.31, also on Nasdaq.   

 The warning also served as a broadside across the telecommunications sector. Equipment makers like Nortel, which fell $2.81 to $68.06, and Lucent Technologies, which dropped $1.31 to $35.31, sinking to a 52-week low, finished weaker. Service providers like Winstar Communications fell further, as well; Winstar dropped $2.13 to $17.31 on Nasdaq, reaching another 52-week low.   

 Remarkably enough, though, the broader technology sector stumbled, but didn't drop. The Nasdaq Composite Index even finished the day up 31.84 points to 3897.48. Traders said some upbeat forecasts from select technology names, such as eBay, which ended the session $10.88 higher at $76.56, helped the market staunch the damage.   

 "It's impressive to see the Nasdaq composite come back the way it did, and there could be a little followthrough," said Peter Green, technical strategist at Gerard Klauer Mattison. However, all the fundamental challenges are going to make it difficult for stocks to engineer a classic reversal.   

 More traditional stocks are particularly vulnerable to the factors now vexing the market -- higher oil prices that fan fears of inflation, a euro that continues to slide against the dollar, and pressure on profits, some analysts say.   

 "People will be buying stocks that can continue experiencing earnings growth," said Donald Selkin, chief investment strategist with Joseph Gunnar. "That's technology, especially newer issues."

 Tuesday's rally on Bay Street was almost wiped out as investors took a serious look at rising energy prices and the outlook for corporate profits. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index closed down 101.4 points to 10,813.12. 

 In New York,the Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.37 points to 10,687.92 s 22 of its 30 components ended lower. But Boeing Co. soared 5 per cent to $59.63 (U.S.) after the aerospace giant raised its cash flow estimates for the year to more than $4-billion. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index bucked Wall Street's downward trend, with a late day rally that left it 31.80points higher at 3,897.44. Intel Corp. was one of Nasdaq's big winners, rising 4.5 per cent to $63.06 on a positive research report from a Wall Street analyst. Informix Corp. was a big loser, shedding 10 per cent to $4.63 after an analyst slashed his investment rating on the company's stock. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.56 points to 1,451.34. 

 On the Canadian Venture Exchange, the junior high techs pulled the CDNX down 14.49 points to 3,639.79. 

 Only three of the TSE 300's 14 subsectors closed higher, with the oil and gas grouping leading the pack. The sector closed up 2 per cent as the New York price of crude continued to climb. 

 The technology-laden industrial products sector slipped 1.3 per cent on weakness by Nortel Networks Corp. The network equipment maker, retreated from Tuesday's gain, losing $2.55 (Canadian) to $101.95. Nortel, which makes up more than 30 per cent of the weighting on the TSE, has tumbled this month on fears that a decline in spending by large telecom companies -- a major source of Nortel's revenue -- may be in store. 

 Fellow techs JDS Uniphase Corp. and Certicom Corp. ended lower, but Celestica Inc., Research In Motion Ltd., Cognos Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc. managed to avoid the red. 

 Alcatel SA, the parent company of Canada's Alcatel Networks,is spinning off its fibre-optics unit to help finance some of its other divisions. The company will offer a tracking stock and raise about $12.7-billion (U.S.) with the sale. Alcatel Network's stock on the TSE fell $4.80 to $105 (Canadian). 

 The financial services sector was unable to hold Tuesday's gains. Five of Canada's Big Six banks were down at the closing bell, forcing the sector's index lower. 

 Film and TV production company Alliance Atlantis Communications Inc. was active, gaining $1.85 to $25.10 on speculation it is the sector's latest takeover target. 

 In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, phone company Sprint Corp. fell 5 per cent to $26.81 (U.S.) after becoming the latest company to join the profit-warning club.

 PRI Automation Working To Stem Production Problems - CEO

 BOSTON -(Dow Jones)- PRI Automation Inc. (PRIA), which issued a fourth-quarter profit warning last week, is working to rectify its production shortfall problems, and Chief Executive Mitch Tyson said Wednesday he expects the improvement will pay off over the next two fiscal quarters. 

 The company said last week that revenue for its fourth fiscal quarter ending Sept. 30 will be about $84 million, rather than the anticipated $100 million, and that earnings will be slightly above break-even before special charges. 

 PRI's share prices were hammered on the news and have slipped from about $80 in May to $24.13 Wednesday. 

 The company earned $9.8 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $88.9 million in its third fiscal quarter. 

 Tyson told analysts at the SG Cowen Annual Fall Technology Conference that the revenue shortfall stemmed from problems in the company's Factory Systems Division and "is tied to our inability to ramp up our Turbostocker shipments." 

 Turbostocker is the company's new version of its system used by semiconductor manufacturers to manage the production process. The product was introduced last year. 

 The company has been producing the Turbostocker at low- volume levels until recently. Attempts to shift to high-volume production during the current quarter presented unexpected problems, including design issues, parts supplies shortfalls, and a lack of skilled manufacturing personnel, Tyson said. 

 "While the problems are not simple, including (managing the ) manufacturer supply chain and employee training, none of the problems are impossible to solve or difficult to solve, it's just a question of our doing them," Tyson said. 

 "We have initiated programs to get new suppliers, but unfortunately that wasn't in time to get us through Q4," Tyson said. "But in the (next) two (fiscal) quarters going forward we will have more diversified sources for parts." 

 Tyson said the company is also farming out more subassembly work. It aims to outsource 80% of Turbostocker's production work, up from 40% now. 

 The company also recently made some management changes, hired new managers and is increasing personnel training, Tyson added. 

 PRI is also adding production shifts to increase capacity, working more closely with existing suppliers and adding new suppliers. 

 Tyson said the company expects revenue to grow 45% next year. 


PRI said its orders over past two years have been better than the
industry average and bookings this year should reach $410 million,
leaving a backlog of about $200 million at year end.

 Toronto's technology and bank stocks pushed Bay Street into positive territory as investors went looking for bargain prices following the market's recent slide. 

 Canada's benchmark Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index closed 132.55 points higher at 10,914.52, buoyed by Nortel Networks Corp. The market heavyweight gained $3.40 to $104.50 after shedding $6 during the Monday trading session. 

 In New York,the Dow Jones industrial average lost 19.23 points to 10,789.29, even though the large tech components -- Intel Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines Corp. -- ended higher. 

 Dow component Alcoa Inc. lost $1.19 (U.S.) to $25.81 after saying that rising energy prices and weakening demand will hurt its third-quarter profit. An analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc., however, said the weakness of Alcoa stock may be a long-term buying opportunity for investors. 

 The Nasdaq Stock Market's tech-heavy composite index advanced 139.12 points to 3,865.64. Eight of the 10 companies on the exchange's most-active list were in the black, including: Qualcomm Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp., Oracle Corp., Dell Computer Corp., JDS Uniphase Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. Shares of Barnesandnoble.com Inc. surged 30 per cent to $5.94 after Yahoo Inc. said it is making the on-line book retailer a featured book seller on its mammoth portal, replacing Internet giant Amazon.com Inc. Yahoo rose almost 3 per cent to $108.06, while Amazon.com fell nearly 5 per cent to $40.75. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 15.39 points to 1,459.9. 

 On the Canadian Venture Exchange, the junior high techs boosted the CDNX by 7.26 points to 3,654.28. 

 Of the TSE's 14 subindexes, eight closed higher, led by the industrial products sector, up 2.5 per cent. The technology-laden grouping rose on strength in Nortel and JDS Uniphase Corp. The fibre-optic supplier jumped $12.55 to $159. Fellow TSE tech bigwigs Celestica Inc., Descartes Systems Group Inc., Norsat International Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc. also rose. 

 The TSE's financial services sector gained more than 2 per cent as all six of Canada's large banks ended higher. Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia touched 52-week highs. 

 Biovail Corp. gained $1.60 (Canadian) to $112 on news it has launched phase III clinical trials for a once-daily version of its painkiller Tramadol. Cangene Corp., another Canadian biotech, fell $1.10 to $8.35 after issuing a profit warning. 

 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. gained $5.75 to $78.25 after forecasting its next quarterly results will be better than analysts expect.

 Metal stocks fall with Alcoa.

 NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Metal stocks fell on Tuesday on investor concern that a profit warning from Alcoa Inc. , the world's largest aluminum company, might spread to other producers. 

 Alcoa fell $2-5/8, or 9.3 percent, to $25-5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, after it warned Monday that third-quarter earnings would be well below analyst's expectations. The company blamed the shortfall on higher energy costs and a softening in demand from some industrial markets. 

 Inco Ltd. a large nickel producer, fell 12/16, or 4.5 percent, to $17-5/16, while Phelps Dodge Corp. , the world's second-largest copper producer, fell 3/8 to $42. 

 "It's a very depressed group, and they are all down on the Alcoa preannouncement," said Tim Ghriskey, a portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp., which oversees $130 billion in assets, including holdings in Alcoa. "All metal producers are big consumers of energy, so we would expect all of them to be impacted by high energy costs." 

 October crude oil, trading near 10-year highs, closed at $36.51 a barrel in New York Tuesday. 

 Slowing economies in both the United States and Europe will also "impact the revenues of all these highly economically sensitive companies," Ghriskey said. 

 The Standard & Poor's Aluminum Index fell almost 8 percent. Alcoa accounts for 80 percent of the index, S&P said. 

 Canadian-based Alcan Aluminium Ltd fell 15/16 to $30-3/16, while California-based Century Aluminum Co. fell 1/4 to $12-3/4 on Nasdaq. 

 Steel producers were also hurt by the Alcoa warning, Ghriskey said. 

 USX Corp. US Steel Group fell 1/2 to $16-7/16. 

 "As the U.S. and European economies slow, there will be decreased demand for metals by their primary consumers, the companies that make capital goods," said Ghriskey. "We have already seen some of those companies, like Ingersoll-Rand (Co.) and Rockwell (International Corp.) reporting signs of weakness." 

 Ingersoll-Rand, a diversified manufacturer of products from golf carts to climate control systems, forecast lower-than-expected third-quarter and 2000 operating profits Monday, partly because of lower demand. 

 Rockwell, one of the world's largest industrial automation companies, warned Monday that earnings in the current quarter and next fiscal year will fall short of expectations.

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - U.S. semiconductor shares posted a convincing rebound Tuesday driving the Nasdaq up 3.7 percent, while the other side of the tracks saw basic industry taking a beating following a profit warning from Alcoa, sources said. 

 Flows returned to semiconductors, the center of a lively debate whether and when future capacity increases will trip a decline in prices. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, down 5.2 percent the prior two sessions. jumped 8.1 percent (+77.22 at 1,028.47). 

 Volume at nearly 1.7 billion was heavy on the Nasdaq, which continued its wild swings. The Nasdaq composite, up 139.11 at 3,865.63, had fallen a total of 4.7 percent the prior two sessions. 

 Evelina Tainer, chief economist at Econoday, calculates the standard daily deviation for the Nasdaq year-to-September was 2.90 percent, nearly double last year and by far the highest on record. 

 Volatility in other indexes has been at record levels as well but still sharply lower than the Nasdaq's. The Dow Industrials slipped 19.23 to 1,0789.29, also in active volume, as an earnings warning from metals company Alcoa led to selling in related stocks. 

 Alcoa, down 1 3/8 at 25 5/8 [AA], complained of softening transportation and construction markets as well as higher energy costs. 

 The back-and-forth on the semiconductor controversy is evident at Banc of America Securities, which upgraded Intel and Advanced Micro Devices after downgrading them last week. Intel rose 4 9/16 to 60 3/8 [INTC] and Advanced Micro Devices was up 3 at 30 [AMD]. 

 Sun Microsystems, up 2 7/16 at 117 11/16 [SUNW], said it will acquire server equipment maker Cobalt Networks for $2.0 billion in stock. 

 Conglomerate Ingersoll-Rand, down 4 at 35 [IR], and Papa John's pizza chain, up 3/16 at 22 1/16 [PZZA], both issued disappointing forecasts.

US investors will, once again, be looking for signs this week that the long slow slide of technology stocks has ended.

Concerns about slowing profit growth have hit the sector over the past two weeks, but investors may also be nervous heading into the traditional pre-earnings warning season at a time when the US economy is slowing. Last week, the technology bellwether, the Nasdaq Composite Index, fell 4 per cent. According to the First Call earnings service, technology companies' profits are expected to grow 34 per cent in the third quarter from a year before, down from 46 per cent in the second quarter. Overall profit growth is forecast to slow from 21.4 per cent to 17.6 per cent.

The effects of a slowing economy were illustrated on Friday by computer giant Oracle Corp. It announced that applications software sales rose 42 per cent, 5 percentage points lower than forecast, a shortfall that sent its shares lower.

With the third quarter ending in two weeks, more companies are likely to reveal that they are doing worse than expected, and that could see the Nasdaq come under further pressure.

The old economy is also suffering from the negative sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4 per cent last week.

The state of Wall Street's health will become clearer this week when Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter report their earnings.

Investors hoping for a market rally are unlikely to get help from economic data. No major announcements are planned. The housing starts and building permits figures for August will be published tomorrow. Both are expected to show modest increases. The Federal Reserve's Beige Book will be released on Wednesday.

 Wall Street this week is bracing for more companies warning that soaring oil prices and a strong U.S. dollar will cut into their bottom line. But it's not just oil worrying Wall Street. Europe's common currency last week hit an all-time low, which will hurt U.S. exports or revenues from U.S. companies doing business there. New economic data to be released this week include U.S. housing starts on Tuesday for the month of August, a gauge of the U.S. economy's health. The data, however, are unlikely to move the market, because investors already have digested figures that show the economy is slowing and inflation remains in check. A few companies will release earnings this week, including Wall Street's premier firms, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Bros. The firms are expected to show solid profit growth. 

 Economic reports coming this week: 

 * Wednesday, the Commerce Department will release statistics on the U.S. trade deficit in July. Analysts expect another record to be set. 

 * Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia will report on manufacturing and productivity in the mid-Atlantic region. Evidence is mounting that the Fed's efforts to slow the economy and contain inflation are taking hold.

Group approach to group homes

What do homeless shelters, halfway houses and group homes have in common? The neighbors are usually opposed at first, and the sponsors often don't do a very good job of reaching out to them. The result is a lot of hostility, frustration and confrontration, which, at least in some cases, might be avoided if the two sides sat down together and came to understand each other. A new siting process being pushed by the Capital Area Council of Churches will make that more likely.

The plan was developed by the Center For Alternative Dispute Resolution, an Albany non-profit organization, along with others who have a knowledge of and stake in these matters: municipal officials, service agencies and neighborhood associations. It relies heavily on information-sharing and mediation.

That's considerably different from the typical process, where some state agency or non-profit organization, without warning, announces plans to open a shelter or group home in some residential area. More often than not, the neighbors complain about the process (that they weren't informed, that the sponsors are being secretive and/or arrogant), as well as the substance (they fear the facility will negatively affect their quality of life and property values). The only chance they may have to hear and talk about the plan it is at a public hearing, and by then they may be too distrustful and angry to discuss it rationally.

The plan calls for multiple public hearings to examine issues and concerns; a panel consisting of various interested parties to share experiences and make recommendations; and opportunities for mediation to try to reach a consensus.

This won't work in every case; not everyone will be happy. But even those who don't get their way are more likely to accept the results of a process that they were a part of.

Ford gives up bid for Daewoo Motor

SEOUL, South Korea - Credit banks went back to the drawing board Friday in their struggle to unload the heavily indebted Daewoo Motor Co. following Ford's unexpected decision to withdraw from the bidding process.

Ford's withdrawal also dealt a blow to the reform policies of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who has been billing the sale of the nation's second biggest automaker as a milestone in restructuring his country's debt-ridden industries.

In June, the U.S. automaker won the right to conduct exclusive negotiations to take over the assets of Daewoo, topping joint bids by General Motors Corp. and Fiat SpA of Italy, and by DaimlerChrysler AG and Hyundai Motor of South Korea.

But in a surprise announcement, Ford said it has decided after nearly two months of negotiations against making a final bid for Daewoo Motor.

Briggs & Stratton sees lower Q1 earnings

MILWAUKEE - Briggs & Stratton Corp., a lawnmower engine maker, said that it expects a loss for the first fiscal quarter, much below current earnings estimates, due to increased client inventory levels.

Briggs said it expects a first quarter loss of between 13 and 18 cents a share, compared with earnings of 14 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Net sales for the quarter are also expected to be down 35 to 40%.

Maytag shares fall on Q2 earnings warning

NEWTON, Iowa - Shares of Maytag Corp. fell Friday after the company warned late Thursday that its second half earnings per share may drop 8% to 10% due to Circuit City Stores Inc.'s exit from the appliance business, slow sales at retailer Heilig-Meyers Co. and general softness in the industry.

The third largest large home appliances maker in the U.S. said that it now expects third quarter earnings to be around 75 cents and fourth quarter earnings in the low-to-mid 80-cent range. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. forecast third and fourth quarter earnings of 96 cents and 97 cents, respectively.

McDonalds stock slumps

CHICAGO - McDonald's Corp. stock, mired in a yearlong slump, sank to a 21/2-year low Thursday after the company warned that foreign currency problems would hurt its third-quarter earnings.

Some analysts also said the fast-food giant might have bitten off more than it could chew by continuing to open an average of five restaurants a day this year, mostly abroad, despite slowing sales overseas.

Shares in the restaurant chain fell $1.06, or 4 percent to $26.94 on the New York Stock Exchange in a second consecutive sharp decline reflecting the impact of the euro's slide.

In falling to its lowest closing price since March 1998, the stock is down 34 percent for the year and has lost nearly half its value since reaching an all-time high of $49.56 last November.

"It's kind of a show-me stock," said Mark Kalinowski of Salomon Smith Barney. "They're going to have to show investors they're going to reach the goals they've set for themselves, and right now they're having a hard time doing that."

McDonald's said in a statement Wednesday night after warning analysts of the currency troubles that it remains on target to achieve 10 percent to 15 percent annual profit growth through 2002 - excluding the impact of foreign currencies.

"Importantly, the fundamentals of our business haven't changed," said Jack Greenberg, chairman and chief executive. "Our global business remains solid and growing."

Seven weeks ago, the company called its meager 2 percent second-quarter profit gain - its worst quarterly showing since 1997 - an anomaly and blamed it on foreign currency declines and unusually hot weather in Europe that had carved into summer sales.

Analysts share Greenberg's view of a healthy long-term outlook for the world's largest restaurant company. They are less bullish about the short run at a time when international sales growth has declined and some economies are slowing.

"Worldwide, the company generated about 1 percent volume growth in August," said Howard Penney of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "For McDonald's it's not great, but it's also not a company that's in severe trouble."

Analysts lowered their estimates of third-quarter earnings to reflect the currency situation.

"The euro is a rising concern for a number of consumer companies, and it's a concern for the fourth quarter, too," said Ann Gurkin of Davenport and Co.

"But it's not a negative reflection on McDonald's earnings if you exclude currency. ... On a non-currency basis, international markets are strengthening and their U.S. market is strengthening."

Crowell Weedon analyst Doug Christopher said he thinks the euro is likely to be bottoming out. Coupled with a strong showing by McDonald's at its U.S. restaurants and continuing dominance overseas, he thinks the bottom is almost at hand for the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company's stock, too.

"We don't see it (currency) as something that's going to derail the long-term outlook of the company at all," he said.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Technology stocks led the broader market lower amid fears that corporate earnings will suffer from the slowing U.S. economy, as well as the weak euro and high oil prices. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 78.85 points, or 2% to 3835.01 to end the week off more than 143 points, or 3.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 160.47, or 1.5%, to 10927.00, finishing the week 2.5% lower. 

 Bonds were mixed, with the 10 year Treasury note was down more than 1/4, or $2.50 for each $1,000 holding, bringing the yield up to 5.83%. The 30 year bond fell more than 1 1/8 to yield 5.89%. Shorter-dated securities were slightly higher. 

 The dollar was mixed. It traded at 85.43 cents to the euro and 107.37 yen to the dollar, compared with 86.47 cents to the euro and 107.63 yen to the dollar late Thursday in New York.

 Crude oil prices climbed back near their post-Gulf War high, set earlier this week, amid new tension between Iraq and Kuwait and a hurricane threat in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural-gas prices also climbed, setting another all-time high on worries about possible storm-related supply interruptions. In late trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange, October crude oil jumped $1.48, or 4.3%, to $35.55 a barrel. October gasoline climbed 2.58 cents, or 2.8%, to trade at 96.50 cents a gallon. October heating oil jumped 3.18 cents, or 3.2%, to $1.0390 a gallon.

 Dresdner Bank is close to acquiring New York investment bank Wasserstein Perella, and an agreement could come as soon as Monday, a person familiar with the talks said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the price could run between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion.

 Gavin Casey, who narrowly won approval from shareholders for reappointment Thursday, resigned as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. LSE Chairman Don Cruickshank will assume executive responsibility. Mr. Casey, Mr. Cruickshank, and other top officials of the LSE received a public rebuke on Thursday from the bankers and brokers who own the exchange. Several shareholders were angry over the exchange's failed effort to merge with Deutsche Boerse of Frankfurt to create a pan-European market.

 Deutsche Post, the German postal agency, confirmed that it will buy a majority stake in closely held global express-delivery company DHL International. Deutsche Post will lift its stake in DHL to 51% from 25%. 

 Company officials said Deutsche Post also may buy part of Japan Airlines's interest in DHL if the company is willing to sell. Deutsche Post, soon to be privatized, has been moving to transform itself into a serious competitor in the private-delivery industry.

 AltaVista, continuing its quest for profitability, has completed a realignment of its California operations and reduced its work force by 25%. The loss-laden Internet portal, which is 83% owned by CMGI, said the moves are intended to help its North American operations turn profitable in its fiscal second quarter ending Jan. 31. 

 --- 

 In a conference call with analysts, Maytag's chairman and chief executive dodged questions about a possible takeover of the appliance maker but mentioned possibly forming an alliance with another company - perhaps one that would give Maytag a foothold in Western Europe. 

 Maytag warned Thursday that its second-half results will be much weaker than previously anticipated because of Circuit City Stores's exit from the appliance business and other factors. 

 --- 

 Ryerson Tull, the country's largest steel processor, said it will post a surprise loss for the third quarter and warned volume and profitability will be weaker than expected in the fourth quarter. 

 Ryerson Tull issued a profit warning in May noting its sales volume was plummeting. At the time, the Chicago company held out hope the steel industry's sudden drop-off was a temporary blip instead of a sign of a coming slowdown. 

 A rise in short-term interest rates, as the Federal Reserve tries to slow the economy to a soft landing, has hit the steel industry hard.

 HEARD ON THE NET: NDB Shares Swept Up In Deal Frenzy

 WSJ.com 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- What a difference a week makes. National Discount Brokers Group Inc.'s (NDB) market-making business helped put the company's stock into a tailspin just a week ago, but now it's the fuel for a recovery and excitement on Wall Street. 

 Shares of the Jersey City, N.J., online broker and stock-trading firm, which had plunged 23% to $27.81 Friday following a profit warning, have recovered nearly all of their losses as investors now view the company as a prime takeover target. 

 The stock rose $4.19 to $34.69 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange - up 20% since Friday's rout. The catalyst is NDB's market-making unit. 

 The business, which generates 75% of NDB's revenue, was largely blamed last week when the company unexpectedly warned that it will post a loss for the quarter ended August 31. But investors are over it. This week's new darlings are market makers, which maintain an orderly flow of orders in stocks traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Despite NDB's pains, the business is considered very lucrative. This point was driven home after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said on Monday that it agreed to buy Spear Leeds & Kellogg LP, the fourth-largest market maker, for $6.5 billion. In addition to Spear Leeds, No. 3 Herzog Heine Geduld in June said it agreed to sell itself to Wall Street powerhouse Merrill Lynch & Co. (MER) for $914 million in stock. 

 Formerly known as Sherwood Securities, NDB Capital Markets is No. 8 in the business. Investors are betting that it will be caught up in the wave of consolidation now sweeping the financial-services industry, especially market makers. Securities firms are looking to broaden their sources of revenue by gaining a piece or a bigger portion of the frenzied trading activity on Nasdaq among online investors. 

 Stocks in the handful of remaining independent market-makers also are red-hot. Knight Trading Group Inc. (NITE), Jersey City, the biggest market maker, also saw its stock soar Wednesday on anticipation that it, too, will be a target. The stock jumped $6.63, or 23%, to $36.06 Wednesday on the Nasdaq. 

 Wall Street analysts say consolidation in the business will now put pressure on NDB and other market-making firms to combine if they want to remain competitive. 

 "NDB's size suggests that competition from larger companies will force it to sell," says Scott Edgar, research director at SIFE Trust Fund, a Walnut Creek, Calif., mutual fund that specializes in financial stocks. 

 Wall Street dealers are consolidating as changes in the way stocks are quoted are narrowing their profits. Traditionally, market makers have made money off the spread, or the difference between the buy and sell price in a given stock. The move to quoting stocks in decimals promises to shrink these spreads to mere pennies and cut into their profits. 

 At the same time, big Wall Street firms, which have traditionally catered to institutional investors, are interested in market makers because they offer access to individuals, who account for a big chunk of Nasdaq trading activity. 

 Jim Marks, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, estimates that NDB, one of the nation's biggest online brokers, would fetch a "50% or 60% premium over its market price" in a sale, thanks to the strength of its market-making operation. "This is a firm in a unique position now," he says. 

 He also points to a logical buyer: Deutsche Bank AG. The German banking giant already owns a 16% stake in NDB. "If Deutsche Bank doesn't want to buy NDB, they would have a considerable say in who does," Marks says. 

 Deutsche Bank officials in New York declined to comment. NDB spokesman Matt Messenger also declined to comment. 

 Deutsche Bank reportedly is shopping for a U.S. securities firm - but not necessarily a market maker. Last week the company's name was mentioned as a possible suitor for J.P. Morgan & Co. (JPM), which Wednesday announced it will be sold to Chase Manhattan Corp. (CMB) in a deal that marks the latest in a series of huge transactions in the rapidly consolidating financial-services industry. 

 Stephen Franco, an online-brokerage analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, says that even if it sells for a premium, NDB would likely cost much less to acquire than Knight would. NDB has a market value of more than $728 million heading into Thursday's trading, while Knight is valued at more than $3.6 billion. 

 Speculation about takeovers has lifted the stocks of several firms that specialize in matching stock buyers with sellers on the Big Board. Shares of LaBranche & Co. (LAB), which specializes in maintaining orderly markets in more than 400 stocks listed on the NYSE, rose 5% Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment. 

 While market making can be quite profitable, it is highly sensitive to changes in market conditions. Indeed, NDB said Friday that its first-quarter earnings would be "negatively impacted by adverse market conditions affecting the July performance of the company's Nasdaq market maker." 

 The company said it expects to report a loss of 6 cents to 9 cents a share for its current quarter, well short of consensus expectations of a gain of 9 cents a share. 

 NDB reported net income of $53.5 million, or $3.05 a share, on revenue of $385.8 million in fiscal 2000, which ended May 31, compared with a profit of $21 million, or $1.50 a share, and revenue of $207.9 million in 1999. 

 The company said in a regulatory filing that revenue from market-making operations was $287 million in 2000, a 97% jump from the year before. 

 While NDB's market-making business is seen as its main draw, its stock could also be riding a surge in the online-brokerage sector. Shares of E*Trade Group Inc. (EGRP) and Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD) also rose Wednesday. 

 Despite difficulties in this year's first quarter and a market hungry for takeovers, some observers think that NDB can go it alone, at least for a while longer. 

 Edgar of SIFE says that NDB management's track record has been good until the recent earnings warning, and its chief executive, Arthur Kontos, may be able to persuade his board of directors, most of them NDB employees, that the company can right its ship on its own. 

 "Do they have to sell now or in a couple of years?" Edgar says. "That isn't clear." 

 He isn't waiting to find out. He says his fund sold its 77,600-share stake in NDB last month.

 Bay Street ended its six-day losing streak as investors bought back into the high-techs and showed increased enthusiasm for the high-finance sector. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index closed 192.54 points higher at 10,749.57. 

 Nortel Networks Corp., which accounts for about 30 per cent of the composite's weighting, rose $4.75 to $99.25. The network equipment supplier has been awarded a 31/2-year supply deal worth $155-million (U.S.) with Savvis Communications Corp. Also, Nortel was reiterated as a "strong buy" by an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 In New York,the Dow Jones industrial average lost 51.05 points to 11,182.18. Before the opening bell, Chase Manhattan Corp. put a stop to the latest batch of acquisition speculation, announcing it is buying influential money manager J.P. Morgan & Co. Ltd. for more than $34-billion in stock. J.P. Morgan fell more than 2 per cent to $181.50, while Chase dropped 4 per cent to $50.69. 

 Investors reacted positively to the recent U.S. mergers, pushing the TSE 300's financial services sector up more than 2 per cent. All six of Canada's big banks ended higher. 

 Market heavyweight Hewlett-Packard Co. dropped almost 5.5 per cent to $105 after rival computer components company SCI Systems Inc. issued a profit warning. Investors remain worried that lower demand for parts and equipment may affect profits in future quarters at some of the larger tech companies. 

 Canadian electronics maker Celestica Inc. was also sideswiped by the SCI warning, losing $4.30 (Canadian) to $108.20. 

 The Nasdaq Stock Market's tech-heavy composite index gained 44.38 points to 3,893.89. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up 2.92 points to 1,484.91. 

 On the Canadian Venture Exchange, junior high techs pushed the CDNX 13.91 points higher to 3,627.27. 

 In TSE trading, wireless Internet software firm 724 Solutions Inc. said it will buy Chicago's Spyonit.com for more than $53-million (U.S.) in cash and stock. Spyonit is a privately held company that sorts and retrieves Internet data for mobile-device users. 724 finished up $3.25 to $69.75 (Canadian). 

 Investors digested the reported end of the heated battle for Quebec cable company Groupe Videotron Ltee Wednesday. Just after the closing bell, Quebecor Inc. and its backer, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, said they had beat out Rogers Communications Inc. in the seven-month battle for control of the cable firm. Videotron gained 25 cents to $43.95, Quebecor gained 50 cents to $36.50, while Rogers gained 75 cents to $37.45. 

 Another component of the communications and media sector was active. Cable company Cogeco Inc. shot up $5.25 to $43.50 as speculation abounded that it could be Rogers' next takeover target.

 LAUREN THIERRY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET COVERAGE: Let`s go to Christine Romans at the new York stock exchange and get the h-p story among other stories today; Chris. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there. We`ve had a lackluster performance for the Dow overall all morning, really. It`s off its worst levels of the session, but this is a market that`s fixated on the buzz about this big Chase Manhattan-J.P. Morgan deal and they`re watching both of those shares trade lower. The big decline in J.P. Morgan actually weighing on the Dow here today. The interesting thing is that everyone`s talking about what it means for other parts of the stable sector, but they all point out that there`s been a lot of run-up in some of the stocks and ideas that they could become takeover tags. This is a market that`s pretty much priced in these purchases. So traders closely watching to see how things fare there today. J.P. Morgan shares trade slower as well as chase Manhattan. Now, also watching shares of Hewlett-Packard. It`s a lose or the dow as is Intel. Intel losing on the Nasdaq. Also weighing on the Dow. The whole semiconductor sector trading down here. Taking a look at some of these stocks: . Obviously SCI Systems (URL: http://www.sci.com/) bearing the brunt of it`s own profitwarning, but pulling some others down as well. Lauren.

Inflation deserves a bigger role in markets drama

The pace-setting New York Stock Exchange lost its momentum last week and most of the blame seemed to focus on the effect of profit downgrades rather than fears of tighter monetary policy.

That mood was mirrored in Australia, though the impact was muted; the All Ordinaries eased only 0.4 per cent last week, making it more like the Dow Jones than the broader S&P 500 (down 2 per cent) and the technology-rich Nasdaq (down 6 per cent).

But are investors looking at the right warning signs? While no-one doubts that profit downgrades can have a major impact on high-priced stocks, there is still the danger that investors are ignoring the growing problems with inflation.

Bear in mind that most of the lack of concern is centred in the US, where the strong dollar is moderating inflation. But elsewhere (apart from Japan), weaker currencies are worsening the effect of rising commodity prices, notably oil.

And yet most central bankers and the markets are discounting the rise in commodity prices as a "temporary fluke" says Connecticut currency analyst and manager, Bridgewater Associates.

It plots the rise in commodities against the excess world money supply and suggests the rise in commodity prices is, to some extent, a monetary phenomenon produced by the policies of reflation of the last three years. (Despite the series of small interest rate increases, world money supply is still rising.)

In addition, Bridgewater says, the latest figures show that US consumers are still on a borrowing binge, with their use of credit increasing at 8.5 per cent a year. Only once in the last 30 years has the Fed reduced rates when confronted with rising consumer credit figures and then quickly reversed it.

In other words, unlike the majority of those in the US markets, Bridgewater is fearful of more inflation and worried about potential monetary tightening. The group, in effect, is now presenting the pessimistic or sceptical view of markets.

The most immediate worry remains oil prices. London strategist David Fuller believes the squeeze on supplies is temporary but he warns the risk of an oil shock remains as long as oil prices remain high, let alone move higher.

Perhaps the markets are punting that if the oil shock is bad enough it might threaten another meltdown notably in the non-oil producing Asian economies and that world central bankers would not tighten further, and might even ease.

But, if world markets are betting that there will be no tightening of rates and that inflation is only a temporary blip, and sceptics like Bridgewater fear higher inflation and more monetary tightening, there's potential for someone to be badly wrong.

 Dow Jones Industrial Average: 11,221.76 (-38.11) 

 US stocks closed lower yesterday, with the Nasdaq falling sharply for the third time this week, as investors fretted over how surging oil prices might hurt the US economy and corporate profits. 

 The Nasdaq slid 119.03 points to close at 3,979.32 while the Dow Jones industrials shed 38.11 points to 11,221.76. The Standard and Poor's 500 shed 7.87 points to 1,494.64. 

 Dealers said the continuing high price of crude oil is worrying investors that companies' bottom lines will be hurt. The lead example was given Thursday when DuPont issued a profit warning, blaming mostly crude oil and a weak euro for the shortfall in earnings. 

 Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Weatherly Securities, said: "The price of oil is a consideration that you have to look at; it's one of the impediments to the market."

 This week's imbalance in the daily trends of the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index continued Thursday, but reversed course. 

 This time, the Dow slipped but the Nasdaq index advanced. 

 Rebounds in semiconductor and telecommunications shares pushed the Nasdaq composite index up 85.01, or 2.1 percent, to 4098.35, recovering most of Wednesday's 3 percent drop. 

 Nasdaq volume totaled 1.63 billion shares, as winners topped losers by about a 4-3 margin. 

 Semiconductor leader Intel rebounded from a three-day slump, adding $1.75, to $67.44. Telecommunications stocks received a boost from a report in The Wall Street Journal that AT&T Wireless might merge with Nextel Communications. Nextel gained $2.94, to $53. 

 Meanwhile, so-called old economy stocks were rattled by a profitwarning from chemical giant DuPont, which cited higher energy and raw material costs as well as slackening demand in the United States and the weak euro currency in Europe. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 50.77, to 11,259.87 on New York Stock Exchange volume of 978 million shares. Winners beat losers by a 5-4 margin. 

 DuPont dropped $4.87, to a four-year low, $42.12. The DuPont story resonated among many multinational manufacturers, because it illustrated the quandary of being unable to pass on higher input prices as the U.S. economy slows. Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and Honeywell also lost ground among the 30 Dow stocks. 

 Separately, banking firm J.P. Morgan fell $5, to $163, as the on-again/off-again rumors about the firm being acquired cooled off. 

 Looking at small-company stocks, the Russell 2000 index added 6.50, or 1.2 percent, to 542.82. 

 TRADE FRONT: Financial markets had a muted reaction after the Senate cleared the way for approval of permanent normal U.S. trade relations with China. Final passage is expected next week. 

 "People in the market thought it was a done deal," said Adrian Fu, a Hong Kong-based manager for Investec Asset Management. 

 Labor unions, religious groups and Taiwan supporters lobbied to kill the measure in May, when it won House approval after a bitter fight. Shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange began a sharp rally in May but have stabilized. 

 China Unicom, a major Chinese telecommunications firm that began listing shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, gained 12 cents, to $23.75; China.com, a Hong Kong-based Internet portal, slipped 50 cents, to $17.44. 

 Fu believes trade liberalization furthers a bullish economic outlook for China, especially in the telecommunications, technology and transportation sectors. 

 Greater direct foreign investments to boost China's productivity awaits progress on trade relations, he said, adding that portfolio investments in China require a long-term investment discipline. 

 Perhaps illustrating the point, Oak Brook-based McDonald's and a supplier of toys for Happy Meal promotions on Thursday canceled toy production at a factory in southern China, saying the factory violated McDonald's code of conduct regarding workers. 

 An audit found wage and hour conditions below McDonald's standards as well as poor training and lighting for workers. 

 LOCAL NEWS: Chicago-based advertising firm True North Communications sank $6.50, or 15 percent, to $37.50. TNO's largest client, DaimlerChrysler, said that, to cut costs, it may consolidate its ad agency relationships, now split between True North's FCB Worldwide and Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. 

 Wintrust Financial, a Lake Forest-based banking firm, said late Thursday it will take a $2.7 million hit to third-quarter profits, equal to 30 cents a share, because of fraudulent loan transactions by an independent insurance agency. The company earned $3.3 million, or 37 cents a share, in the second quarter. Wintrust is seeking recovery from the insurance agency, which is based in Florida. Shares were unchanged at $17.50. 

 Chicago-based Click Commerce, a distribution management consultant for electronic commerce, gained 9 percent, to a new high, $37, after the company announced wireless applications of its services. 

 Houseware makers Salton, Mt. Prospect, dropped 11 percent, to $36.25, despite posting fourth-quarter profits that beat Wall Street forecasts. Shares had rallied in August.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Technology stocks skidded Friday, sending the Nasdaq Composite Index back below the psychologically important 4000 mark, as fresh earnings warnings and high oil prices rattled investors. Bonds rose, and the dollar strengthened. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 119.94, or 2.9%, to 3978.41, finishing a week marked by cautionary comments from analysts and profit-taking down 6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 39.22 points, or 0.4%, to 11220.65 Friday, ending the week down 17 points. 

 Other major indexes were mixed Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 8.01 to 1494.50 and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks lost 7.12 to 535.70. But the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index edged up 0.24 to 675.73. 

 "This is sort of an on-again, off-again market," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "Whether we're looking at the overall market or we're looking at sectors like technology ... there are some yellow flags that are showing up." 

 The earnings warnings fueled broader jitters about how well companies will hold up in the second half as the U.S. economy slows in response to the Federal Reserve's string of interest-rate increases. Shares of TRW (TRW) fell $1.44 to $43.81 by 4 p.m. EDT after the auto-parts maker said that its third-quarter earnings would be lower than expected. 

 In addition to the slowing economy, Mr. Johnson said the euro's recent weakness and high energy prices could temper earnings growth in the second half. "The worries about the growth rate of earnings are just starting to expand," Mr. Johnson said. "You can't describe the current environment as 'alarming' -- that would be overstating it -- but 'troubling,' you can." 

 Friday's close marked the Nasdaq composite's first finish below the 4000 mark since Aug. 22. The tech sector -- which showed the strongest gains last month and advanced Thursday -- posted the heaviest declines Friday. The final week in July was the last time the Nasdaq composite and the Dow industrials lost ground during a week. 

 Semiconductor stocks erased the previous session's gains to lead the market lower, with the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index dropping 5%. Bellwether chip maker Intel (INTC), the subject of worries sparked by an analyst's downgrade Tuesday, fell $1.88 to $65.56. Most other tech sectors declined, but the Nasdaq biotech index managed a slight gain. 

 Speedfam-IPEC (SFAM) sank $2.25, or 14%, to $13.81 after the maker of semiconductor manufacturing systems said it expects to post a loss from operations for its fiscal first quarter because of a delay in the delivery of tools. Gadzoox Networks (ZOOX) fell $2.06, or 20%, to $8.25 after the maker of hardware and software for storage-area networks said it will post lower-than-expected second-quarter revenue because of a weak market for one of its products. 

 Meanwhile, shares of National Discount Brokers (NDB) dropped $7.94, or 22%, to $27.44 after the online broker warned it would post a loss in its fiscal first quarter, compared with analysts' estimates of a profit. The warning weighed on shares in the sector, with E*Trade Group (EGRP) and Ameritrade Holding (AMTD) declining, while DLJdirect (DIR) edged higher. 

 Investors found some bright spots Friday, rotating their money into some financial and retail stocks. Dow components American Express (AXP), J.P. Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) all advanced, while Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) also rose. Utility shares advanced to lift the Dow Jones Utility Average to its fourth straight record high, up 2.7% to 386.30. 

 Peter Coolidge, a senior equity trader at Brean Murray, said investors continued to speculate about how much pressure higher oil prices will exert on earnings. Following Thursday's bounce by the tech sector, he said it wasn't surprising that the week's momentum continue to drag the Nasdaq composite lower. 

 "We've seen weakness across the board, especially in technology," Mr. Coolidge said of Friday's trading. "I think it's just some market jitters about the impact of the higher price of oil. We're sort of working out the effects of all of that." 

 Concerns about the broader influence of the high price of oil were aggravated Thursday by DuPont's earnings warning, Mr. Coolidge said. The chemical and textiles company's stock dropped 11% Thursday after lowering its projections for the second half, citing rising oil-based costs among the reasons for the warning. Shares of DuPont (DD) continued lower Friday, dropping 88 cents to $40.94. 

 Energy stocks garnered the market's attention Friday ahead of this weekend's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. OPEC meets Sunday to decide whether to increase output in the wake of rising crude-oil prices, which recently reached their highest level in 10 years but pulled back Friday on profit-taking. 

 Wall Street expects OPEC to raise production by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day. The oil sector, which has been boosted by the high price of oil, moved lower Friday. Shares of Dow component Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 25 cents to $83.50, while Texaco (TX), Chevron (CHV) and Amerada Hess (AHC) also slipped. Oil-services stocks showed weakness, with Halliburton (HAL) and Schlumberger (SLB) trading lower. 

 Outside the U.S., European shares closed mostly lower Friday. In the Asian-Pacific region, markets finished mostly lower. But Japan's Nikkei 225 average rose for the first time in nine sessions, closing up 1.2%. 

 In major U.S. market action: 

 Stocks fell. On the Big Board, where 959 million shares traded, 1,507 stocks declined, and 1,301 advanced. On the Nasdaq market, 1.50 billion shares changed hands. 

 Bonds rose. The bellwether 10-year Treasury note was up more than 1/8, or $1.25 for each $1,000 holding, bringing the yield down to 5.724%. The 30-year bond rose more than 1/4 to yield 5.694%. 

 The dollar rose. It traded at 86.90 cents to the euro and 106.12 yen to the dollar, compared with 87.13 cents to the euro and 105.16 yen to the dollar late Thursday in New York.

 ADR Report: Thin Vol, Down Day With 'No Stories' -Trader

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Investors in American depositary receipts "decided to leave early" Friday, and the ADR market had a rough day on weak volume, said Jim Cirenza, head of European sales trading for J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 

 There were no big stories either, he said, and a general "lack of follow-through on yesterday's (Thursday's) momentum." 

 Just about everything was down, including the lion's share of European telecommunications companies, he added, led by France Telecom, which ended down $8.38, or 6.8%, at $115. 

 French telecom-equipment provider Alcatel also dropped Friday, despite "two very bullish days of presentations" in the U.S., Cirenza said. 

 Alcatel closed at $78.06, down $2.69, or 3.3%. 

 DuPont's profit warning continued to plague chemical stocks, he said, and "disappointing" results from industrial gases group Air Liquide ruled out industrial gas stocks as "a nice place to hide" in the ADR market. 

 On Monday, the only potential bright spot might be the oil sector, Cirenza thought, if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries doesn't raise oil output as much as pundits are looking for. 

 The caveat being, "if oil rallies, it's not good for anyone else," he said. 

 The preliminary Bank of New York ADR Index fell 3.14, or 2.1%, to 146.39. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 39.22, or 0.35%, to 11220.65 and Nasdaq dropped 119.94, or 2.9%, to close at 3978.41. 

 In overseas markets, Hong Kong shares ended weaker Friday as investors sold off Pacific Century Cyberworks Ltd. and other telecommunications stocks, although volume was light throughout the session. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended down 156.50 points, or 0.9%, at 17275.45. Total volume amounted to just HK$7.87 billion. 

 The Nikkei 225 stock average finished higher Friday for the first time in nine sessions, rising 201.09 points, or 1.2%, to 16501.55. The index had lost 880.66 points, or 5.1%, during its eight-session losing streak. 

 London's leading stock index ended lower Friday as gains in the mining sector were outweighed by losses in technology and chemicals stocks. 

 The FTSE 100 closed down 88.5 points, or 1.3%, at 6600.7 after spending much of the day below its 6600 support level. 

 Stocks in Paris closed lower Friday as a negative opening on Wall Street added gloom to a session dominated by negative performances from Old Economy heavy-hitters. 

 The CAC 40 index of the most heavily traded shares ended the day down 131.10 points, or 1.9%, at 6703.36. 

 German shares traded lower Friday, pulled down by sharp declines in Siemens and Bayer. The DAX was down 1.4% at 7267.77, a drop of 105.57 points.

Word of the shake-up helped drive  Mitsubishi Motors' stock up more than 5 percent in Tokyo today. However, on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average's four-session winning streak has come to a halt. A profit warning from Dow member DuPont helped slam the brakes on the blue chips yesterday, sending the Dow down 50 points, or about 4/10ths of a percent, to close at 11,259. High-tech stocks rebounded from their recent losses, sending the NASDAQ charging up 2.1 percent. The S&P 500 gained 2/3rds of a percent. Bond prices took a hit, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury up to 5.74 percent.   

And we've all heard of disposable diapers and disposable napkins, but how about disposable credit card numbers? By the end of this month,  American Express will offer disposable credit card numbers on demand for Internet transactions. The numbers will be available within minutes of request by  American Express customers, who will get the service for free.

Well, tech stocks came back to life after a two-day slide, helping to push the NASDAQ up more than 2 percent. Investors rotated their money out of financial stocks and into the chip stocks and the PC-makers. Take a look at some of the winners:  Intel up 2.6 percent on the day. We had  Sun Microsystems gaining a hefty 5.4 percent, but  MP3.com was the biggest percentage loser, down 21 percent one day after a federal judge ordered the online music distributor to pay $250 million to Universal Music for violating copyrights on its CDs.   

Meantime, Wall Street got a wake-up call. The rising price of oil is now hitting corporate America's bottom line. The chemicals giant DuPont saw its stock hit a five-year low after warning that profit for the year will be below estimates partly because of soaring oil prices, which makes it more expensive for DuPont to do business.

THOSE WERE AMUSING House hearings with the Firestone executives and the Ford executives. At a certain point, very early on, informed observers realized that there had not been as big a bunch of duplicitous weaselers in one room since the last HealthNet board meeting.

It was definitely one of those "I'm laughing on the outside because I'm crying on the inside" kind of deals. The crying part is that we are trusting our personal safety and our public policy to these clowns. Let's try to put on a happy face for the rest of the column.

First we have the Firestone people. Where to start? Perhaps with Masatoshi Ono, the chairman of Bridgestone/Firestone, apologizing to the American people for those rollover deaths and accepting full responsibility.

Apologizing is a big corporate thing now. Extremely advanced, image-conscious companies apologize at the drop of a hat. Plane goes down, the chairman of the airline is right there saying how darned sorry he is. This is supposed to be a change from the previous arrogant stonewalling that marked corporate attitudes in the 20th century.

Well, except that when Ono was questioned, he did not actually admit that he had done anything wrong. Instead, he blamed consumers. It was "a lack of care for the tires. That is my conclusion."

So what was he apologizing for? What was he taking responsibility for? Was he just sort of generically sorry about the dead people, in the way that you or I might regret human misery?

Then there's Jacques Nasser, the weird Australian /Lebanese Ford CEO with the curious accent and the impeccable tailoring. He started things off briskly by saying, "This is a tire issue, not a vehicle issue." At least he didn't apologize.

BUT THERE WERE things he might have been sorry about. Earlier in the hearings, a Firestone official was confronted with a memo written by a Ford executive about a possible recall of tires in Saudi Arabia. The memo said that both Ford and Firestone agreed that the big problem with the proposed recall might be that the U.S. Department of Transportation might get wind of it and ask nosy questions.

Nowhere in the memo did a Ford executive say, "You know, chief, I'm concerned that people all over the world might be dying because of these darned tires. I suspect our recommendations to underinflate them may be compounding the rollover problem. Do we want blood on our hands?"

No, the question was: Do we want red ink on our hands?

But we have had fair warning. We understand that "Quality Is Job One" is a marketing slogan, not a company policy. Ford is not really in the car business; it is in the profit business. Ditto Firestone. Those shocked by that revelation have not been paying attention.

BUT WAIT! SEN. Barbara Mikulski, Democratic stalwart, proposed that the Department of Transportation put inspectors in every tire and auto plant, the way the USDA puts inspectors in chicken plants.

Alas, the DOT does not remotely have the money or the personnel to do that. The reason it does not is that the department's budget was gutted by the Reagan administration and not restored by Clinton or Bush.

Indeed, Sue Bailey, head of the National Highway Safety Administration, pointed out politely that she had sent up a proposal to enact stiffer laws in March, but no senator had even agreed to carry the legislation. That's because the spotlight was elsewhere. Now suddenly everyone's on the safety bandwagon, and everyone will continue to ride it until something else comes along.

 NEW YORK -- High-technology stocks managed to dodge the profit worries that dogged the sector all week and scored gains, but earnings woes did hurt some familiar blue chips.   

 Intel (Nasdaq) rose $1.73 to $67.44 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, as it worked back from two days of selling sparked by an analyst's worries that the chip maker's growth wouldn't meet Wall Street's forecasts.   

 Micron Technology, which caught an earnings-anxiety virus of its own Wednesday, bounced back as well, rising 4.63 to 73.50, while Analog Devices added 5.75 to 96.50, and Applied Micro Circuits (Nasdaq) shot ahead 19.89 to 198.94.   

 Freed from earnings worries, the traditional leadership names in high technology bounced back. Oracle (Nasdaq) rose 1.94 to 91.19 and Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq) climbed 6.31 to 123.94.   

 Worries about slowing earnings growth didn't disappear, so much as they gravitated to other stocks.   

 DuPont fell 5.50 to 41.50, after hitting a 52-week low intraday, after the chemicals company, blaming high raw-materials costs, said its earnings wouldn't live up to the projections of Wall Street analysts.   

 Other chemicals concerns, presumably exposed to the same buildup in raw materials costs, suffered declines, too. Dow Chemical fell 1.75 to 25.69, after hitting a 52-week low intraday, while Rohm & Haas slid 2 to 29.38.   

 "These profit concerns about the Old Economy stocks are the reverse of what we saw earlier this week," said Thomas Galvin, chief investment strategist at New York investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. "We're seeing proof that investors are unwilling to evacuate technology for any long period of time, especially among the leadership names that have been winning throughout the year."   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average, hurt by the decline in DuPont, fell 50.77, or 0.45%, to finish at 11259.87; about 30 points of that loss owed directly to DuPont's fall.   

 J.P. Morgan fell 4.75 to 163, putting further pressure on the industrial average. The financial-services giant rose 5% Wednesday, hitting a 52-week high of 172, on speculation about an acquisition by Deutsche Bank; with those rumors cooling yesterday, investors took profits.   

 Meanwhile, energy stocks, on the rise this week amid hope for continued pricing power on the part of the industry, steadied. Texaco inched up 25 cents to 54.13, while Chevron rose 19 cents to 88.31.   

 The drug sector, in decline all week on concerns about political pressures during the presidential campaigns, bounced back. Merck rose 1.13 to 67, Eli Lilly climbed 1.38 to 68.56 and American Home Products increased 1.88 to 52.88.   

 Earnings jitters sent UAL down 75 cents to 47, after trading near the 52-week low of 45.75 set in March. Analysts at Merrill Lynch and at DLJ cut their earnings estimates for the air carrier. But because many names in the sector already are trading at the bottom of their recent trading range, the sell-off didn't ripple across to other airline stocks.   

 The Nasdaq Composite Index bounced back from the two sell-offs this week, rising 85.01 points, or 2.12%, to 4098.35.   

 Shares of companies making presentations at investment conferences sponsored by brokerage houses moved higher. Storage-management software developer Veritas Software (Nasdaq), for example, rose 4.63 to 123.13 after company officials made a presentation at Credit Suisse First Boston's communications industry conference in Santa Barbara, Calif.   

 Networking technology developer CacheFlow (Nasdaq) added 5.56 to 113, fiber-optic systems maker JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq) rose 3.13 to 119.88 and communications systems developer Phone.Com (Nasdaq) rose 2.69 to 97.13, after officials at each company made presentations at the communications industry conference.   

 Network Appliance (Nasdaq), another presenter at that conference, tacked on 14.13 to 115.75.   

 Next Level Communications (Nasdaq) reached as high as 65 during the session before pulling back to finish down 1.50 at 53.63. The Rohnert Park, Calif., communications-equipment maker fell sharply last month on a Lehman Brothers report that Qwest Communications, Next Level's biggest customer, didn't plan to expand its use of the video digital subscriber line technology that Next Level supplies. Yesterday, Qwest officials said in a conference call that the company hasn't decided whether or not it will expand its VDSL offerings. Qwest fell 2.69 to 48.75.   

 Nextel Communications (Nasdaq) rose 2.94 to 53. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that AT&T Wireless Group has held discussions with the McLean, Va., provider of wireless services about a number of strategic options, including a combination of their businesses.   

 AT&T Wireless eased 50 cents to 25, while AT&T fell 75 cents to 30.50.   

 Retek (Nasdaq) rose 9.25 to 41.38. IBM said it would make an undisclosed equity stake in the Minneapolis provider of inventory management software. IBM rose 2.19 to 133.56, while software developer HNC Software (Nasdaq), which holds an 85% stake in Retek, rose 12.25 to 64.75.   

 May Department Stores lost 1.31 to 22.38. The St. Louis retailer warned that its third-quarter earnings will come up short of Wall Street's targets, owing to disappointing sales last month.   

 Campbell Soup, coming into the session after a 52-week low set Wednesday, moved up 25 cents to 25.13; the food maker delivered fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street's forecasts, though the company also warned that earnings would fall short of expectations for its fiscal first quarter.   

 Dynegy gained 2.25 to 49.75. The Houston energy concern said that the shortage of energy products that have forced prices higher will intensify over the next several years; company officials made the remarks at an energy conference in New York.   

 Houghton Mifflin lost 6.50 to 43.81. The Boston textbook publisher said it would join with Sylvan Learning Systems to form a new online-education company aimed at teachers, adding that the company would incur losses on the venture this year and next.   

 Sylvan Learning eased 6 cents to 14.75.   

 True North Communications fell 5.63 to 38.38 on the NYSE. The Chicago advertising and marketing concern said that DaimlerChrysler, its biggest single client, might name a single ad agency for all its corporate advertising, which suggested that True North could lose the business, or, that it might keep the business, but on less profitable terms.   

 Shares of DaimlerChrysler declined 31 cents to 50.56.   

 Omnicom Group, a rival agency that handles some of DaimlerChrysler's business, also lost ground on the session, falling 1.75 to 80.

 A profit warning from Du Pont and weakness in shares of J.P. Morgan halted the Dow's four-day winning streak Thursday but the Nasdaq rebounded from a recent sell-off amid strength in chip and biotech stocks. "We're seeing healthy rotation into tech stocks again," said Jay Suskind at Ryan Beck & Co. 

 State 

 * Wachovia Bank N.A. said Thursday that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire DavisBaldwin Inc., a Tampa-based insurance agency that specializes in property and casualty insurance services for commercial customers. DavisBaldwin, which also has an office in Orlando, is the largest privately held insurance broker in Florida and ranks 70th in the United States. 

 DavisBaldwin will operate as a subsidiary of Wachovia Bank. Following completion of the transaction, Charles Davis Jr., currently chairman and chief executive officer for  Davis Baldwin, will serve as a consultant to DavisBaldwin and to Wachovia's existing Insurance Services Division. L. Lowry Baldwin, president, will serve as the principal executive officer of DavisBaldwin. 

 Nation 

 * New claims for unemployment benefits edged down last week but were still at a level indicating that the hot labor market is cooling a little, economists said. 

 The number of Americans filing applications to receive unemployment checks fell to a seasonally adjusted 316,000 for the week ending Sept. 2, down by 3,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday. 

 The state with the biggest decrease was North Carolina, down by 8,333. Officials attributed the decline to fewer layoffs in the transportation equipment industry. 

 * DuPont Co., the world's largest chemicals company, warned Thursday that its full-year earnings would come in below expectations because of higher raw material costs, a weak euro and lower sales to the apparel, automotive and industrial sectors. 

 The Wilmington, Del.-based company, which makes textile fiber at a plant near Leland, said it expects to earn $2.85 to $2.95 a share before one-time items for fiscal 2000. It had been forecast earning $3.01 a share. 

 * Qwest Communications International, the nation's fourth-largest long-distance phone company, is cutting 11,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce, to streamline operations after buying U S West. 

 In addition to the cuts, which will affect mostly white-collar positions, Qwest said it will eliminate 1,800 contractor jobs. 

 Chairman and chief executive Joe Nacchio said Thursday the changes will help the company refocus on broadband, Internet, wireless and bundled services. 

 Qwest serves 14 Western states and employs some 71,000 people.

Software firm executive wants shareholder patience

Kitchener -- "This change hasn't been easy," he said. "But the potential of the path we've chosen is far greater than that of the past."  

The 16-year-old software company is in the midst of dividing itself into two separate businesses: MKS Software Inc. will deliver the company's traditional line of interoperability software, while the newly created Vertical Sky will handle all of the company's e-business offerings.  

Howard attributed the recent troubles to transition issues associated with the restructuring.  

MKS issued a profit warning two weeks ago and then abruptly cancelled plans yesterday to release its first-quarter results. The company explained the cancellation by saying it needed more time to finalize the results. But it said the numbers will be in line with the profit warning.  

That warning included a projected first-quarter loss, before a writedown and restructuring charges, of between $2.5 million US and $3.5 million US, or 14 to 20 cents a share, for the three months ended July 31.  

Shares in MKS (TSE:MKX), which dropped $2.25 to $4.40 the day the warning was issued, closed yesterday at $3.26, up one cent.  

Despite Howard's assurances, shareholders expressed concern with several aspects of the company's strategy.  

Pat Valenti of London said MKS executives have failed to effectively communicate the Vertical Sky plan to Bay Street analysts.  

"The point is that somehow, someway, you're going to have to put a better plan together to get U.S. investors and Canadian investors," he said.  

Howard replied that part of the reason for splitting MKS into two distinct businesses was to better explain what the company has to offer.  

He said the Web-content management market that Vertical Sky is going after is projected to grow by 80 per cent a year, reaching $1.6 billion in 2003.  

The market for traditional software management, which MKS Software will continue to pursue, will also grow, albeit at a more moderate pace of 24 per cent annually.  

Howard also noted the company's financial success in fiscal 2000, including revenue of $40.3 million US and net income of $2.6 million US.  

Meanwhile, shareholder Bob Verdun of Elmira took issue with the fact that Howard was the only one of five official nominees for the board of directors who held a significant number of shares in the company.  

Verdun said directors should have a substantial holding in MKS to boost their personal stake in the company's success and to signal a show of faith to the financial markets.  

He was also unimpressed that two of the nominees -- Geoff Mott of Boston and Anthony Hull of California -- did not attend the annual meeting.  

"I'm serving notice that this is a serious breach of respect to shareholders and a significant reason why the market performance is as weak as it is," he said.  

Verdun's remarks earned a round of applause and his sentiments were echoed by two other shareholders.  

In an interview, industry observer Jim Duggan of the U.S.-based Gartner Group said MKS is on the right track with its efforts to separate the two key lines of business.  

But he said he expected the rollout to have gone more quickly, and he questioned the need for such a dramatic reorganization of the overall company.  

"They've got a decent product set, they've got pretty good customer references, and they have a very good idea of what the product ought to do," Duggan said in a phone interview from North Carolina. "Their biggest difficulty, and this becomes the bottom line, is that they've got to communicate the idea well enough to get a really good sales force behind it."

 Chips, Biotechs Fuel Rebound by Nasdaq, But Dow Industrials Slip

 NEW YORK -- Stocks finished mixed Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rebounding amid strength in semiconductor and biotech stocks following two days of heavy losses. Blue chips were weakened, however, by a profit warning from DuPont and an 11% drop in the company's stock. 

 The Nasdaq composite closed up 85.01, or 2.1%, at 4098.35, back up above its starting point of 4069 for the year, after dropping 129.84 points Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 50.77 points, or 0.5%, at 11259.87 after rising 50.03 the previous session. 

 Other major indexes advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.26 to 1502.51, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index edged up 1.03 to 675.49 and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks gained 6.50, or 1.2%, to 542.82. 

 Michael Lyons, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said rotation back into the technology sector following a healthy round of profit-taking helped account for the Nasdaq composite's strength Thursday. Heavy declines by Dow components J.P. Morgan and DuPont overstated the weakness in blue chips, he said. 

 "There is some selling going on there, but not what it appears by looking at the averages," Mr. Lyons said. "The volume seems to be creeping up gradually as we get into the week. ... Investors are participating, and there is money going into the market." 

 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index climbed 3.4%. Bellwether Intel (INTC), battered for two days following a downgrade for its stock, rose $1.73 to $67.44 by 4 p.m. EDT, while Micron Technology (MU), hit Wednesday by a downgrade, rebounded $4.69 to $73.50. National Semiconductor (NSM) rose $2.63 to $46.81 after it released its earnings, which topped Wall Street's expectations. 

 Following a gain of more than 439 points, or 12%, in August, the Nasdaq composite gave back about half of that -- dropping a total of 221 points -- on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Dow industrials, meanwhile, which posted a more modest 7% rise in August, pulled back Thursday following four consecutive sessions of gains. 

 Treasury prices edged lower, weighed down by soaring oil prices and a full calendar of upcoming corporate issuance. In the currency markets, the euro recovered after falling to new all-time lows against the U.S. dollar and the yen, while the dollar also fell against the yen. 

 Blue-chip DuPont (DD) dropped $5.25 to $41.75 after the chemical and textiles company said its 2000 earnings will come in lower than analysts' estimates because of the high cost of energy and raw materials. Meanwhile, electronics and software retailer Circuit City Stores (CC) fell 94 cents to $26.81 after saying that quarterly earnings will be lower than its initial estimates. 

 On Thursday, oil and energy stocks were mixed following recent gains. Crude oil prices rose Thursday to the highest level in 10 years amid concerns about tight supplies this winter. Utility stocks were mostly higher, with the Dow Jones Utility Average edging up to post its third straight record high at 376.16. 

 J.P. Morgan (JPM) sank $4.75 to $163, pulling back from recent gains that came amid speculation it is an acquisition target. Its shares rallied last week, and shot up Wednesday following a report in German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche that Deutsche Bank was in talks to buy the financial-services giant. 

 Peter Cardillo, chief strategist and director of research at Westfalia Investments, said the market's dual personality -- with the Nasdaq composite's technology stocks and many of the industrial average's Old Economy names moving in opposite directions -- remained the theme of the week on Wall Street. 

 "The rotation process that is prevalent in the market will continue as the market continues to try to move higher by the end of the year," said Mr. Cardillo, who noted gains by the industrial average's technology components Thursday helped to outweigh weakness in some other sectors. 

 Among stocks in the blue-chip average, International Business Machines (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HWP) and Microsoft (MSFT) joined Intel in positive territory. Meanwhile, General Motors (GM) rose $1.81 to $75.75 after it said it is close to a decision about what to do with its Hughes Electronics satellite-TV unit. GM is considering options ranging from an alliance to an outright sale. 

 Biotech stocks rebounded from recent losses, while the computer and Internet sectors all contributed to the Nasdaq composite's rise. Computer-storage supplier Read-Rite (RDRT) -- one of the Nasdaq market's most-active stocks -- jumped $2.75, or 35%, to $10.56 after it announced it had formed a fiber-optics company. 

 But shares of MP3.com (MPPP) fell $1.69, or 21%, to $6.19 a day after a federal judge ruled that the online music firm's infringement of Universal Music's copyrights was willful, raising the possibility that the company may have to pay a huge damages award. The company's shares fell 69 cents, or 8%, in regular trading Wednesday immediately after the ruling. 

 In economic news Thursday, the Labor Department reported that U.S. jobless claims fell slightly in the first week of September, but the data still suggest the domestic labor market is softening. Last week was the fourth in a row in which applications were above the 300,000 mark. 

 Outside the U.S., European shares closed mostly higher. In the Asian-Pacific region, chip makers led declines Thursday in South Korea and Taiwan as the markets were pressured by Wednesday's drop by the Nasdaq composite. 

 In major U.S. market action: 

 Stocks finished mixed. On the Big Board, where 973 million shares traded, 1,529 stocks advanced, and 1,262 declined. On the Nasdaq market, 1.61 billion shares changed hands. 

 Bonds fell. The 10-year Treasury note was down 1/4, or $2.50 for a $1,000 holding, bringing the yield up to 5.75%. The 30-year note was down more than 1/8 to yield 5.71%. 

 The dollar was lower. It traded at 87.27 cents to the euro and 105.11 yen to the dollar, compared with 87.02 cents to the euro and 105.94 yen to the dollar late Wednesday in New York.

 PITTSBURGH, Sept. 6 -- The H. J. Heinz Company said today that its second-quarter profit would be lower than analysts expected, and its shares fell nearly 5 percent. 

 Profit in the quarter ending Nov. 1 will be about even with the 68 cents a share Heinz earned in its first quarter, Paul Renne, the company's chief financial officer, said in a conference call. Analysts had expected Heinz to earn 70 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 A 17 percent drop in the value of the euro compared with the dollar over the last year hurt Heinz, which derives a quarter of its sales from Europe. Costs to introduce StarKist tuna in a pouch also will cut profit. Heinz said it expected cost cutting in the second half to help it meet annual estimates. Shares of Heinz, based in Pittsburgh, fell $1.75, to $35.44. 

 Heinz's second-quarter profit forecast excludes results from the Weight Watchers dieting-class business, sold in September 1999. Including the unit, Heinz earned 65 cents a share in the quarter a year earlier. 

 Heinz expects profit for the year to rise 10 percent above last year's $2.57 a share, in line with analysts' forecasts. 

 For its first quarter, ended Aug. 2, Heinz said today that its profit rose to $237.7 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $223.8 million, or 61 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales fell 1.3 percent, to $2.15 billion from $2.18 billion. Excluding Weight Watchers, they rose 3.3 percent. 

 Analysts had expected the company to earn 67 cents a share, according to First Call.

 LAUREN THIERRY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET COVERAGE: For more on what stocks are moving on the big board,  let`s bring in Christine  Romans at the New York Stock  Exchange. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Lauren. Well, the Dow is off of the worst levels of the session, but certainly off of its best levels as well as folks churn through the profit warnings and try to figure out just what it means so early in the confessional season. Let`s take a look at how some of these profit warning companies are faring here. The biggest among them, of course, is DuPont (URL: http://www.dupont.com/) . I`m not going to talk about Internet stocks. I`m going to talk about the profit warning. Dupont is a chemical maker based in Wilmington, Delaware. The company`s warning it now expects earning of $2.85 to $2.95 a share. That in the year 2000. That`s compared to the forecasts of $3.01 a share. There you see it. Dupont, down 4 15/16. So warnings all around for these old economy issues. The only real plus side over here, at least, is that the chip stocks are doing better. So some folks are saying that they`re watching the New York Stock Exchange chips move higher, but for the most part they`re a little rattled by the warnings that have come out so far today.

US Shake-out Would Create Havoc

The Reserve Bank has identified a plunge in historically high US sharemarket prices as the major risk to Australia's financial stability, carrying the potential of a ``rapid realignment'' in world currency markets as wealth and confidence levels tumble.

The warning was contained in an otherwise upbeat annual report for 1999-2000 tabled in Federal Parliament yesterday, which also revealed an end to the central bank's period as Australia's unheralded profit juggernaut.

An $803 million profit, undermined by realised losses on the sale of securities and foreign exchange swaps, will be paid to the Commonwealth Government a huge fall from annual profits of $3 billion and more earned for three consecutive years to 1998-99. The Reserve does not seek profits but its day-to-day activities in managing the Commonwealth's financial affairs tend to generate large returns on its assets of $55 billion.

The report also showed the salary of the Reserve's governor, Mr Ian Macfarlane, rose about $20,000 to between $470,000 and $479,999.

Despite the surge in household indebtedness, the Reserve said the Australian financial system was in a ``healthy condition''.

The US sharemarket, where share price valuations remained ``high by historical standards'', was the major threat to a continuation of the good times.

``Any future US sharemarket instability would probably flow quickly through to sharemarkets in other countries and, if accompanied by large changes in global portfolio allocations, might lead to rapid realignments in currency markets,'' the report says. ``Sustained sharemarket falls would also have a direct impact on financial institutions with sharemarket exposures, and more generally on wealth and confidence in the countries concerned.''

The report revealed that the Reserve had made preparations to intervene directly in currency markets to prop up the dollar in April and May. It never carried out the action but did assist the dollar by meeting $3.3 billion of the Commonwealth's need for $4.9 billion in foreign exchange in 1999-2000 from its own reserves, rather than going to the market to sell dollars for foreign currencies.

 PITTSBURGH -(Dow Jones)- Food maker H.J. Heinz Co. warned fiscal second-quarter earnings will fall short of Wall Street's estimates because of foreign-exchange rates and higher marketing expenses associated with a new product. 

 Heinz, which reported fiscal first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations, told the investment community during a conference call that it expects to earn 68 cents a share in the current second quarter, instead of the 70 cents a share analysts had been expecting, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Heinz expects to meet its goal of 10% growth in per-share earnings for this year. 

 Shares of Heinz (HNZ) dropped $1.75, or 4.7%, to trade at $35.44 at 4 p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day, the stock dipped as low as $34. 

 Pittsburgh-based Heinz told investors it expects the currency issue to ease later this year. The company gets about half of its earnings from international markets and about one-third from Europe alone. 

 Heinz reported flat earnings from operations and a 1.3% drop in sales for its fiscal first quarter, citing divestitures, foreign exchange rates and lower pricing. 

 For the quarter ended Aug. 2, Heinz (HNZ) reported net income fell % to $200.6 million, or 57 cents a share, from $206.7 million, or 57 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 

 Sales fell 1.3% to $2.15 billion from $2.18 billion as divestitures, foreign-exchange rates and weak pricing offset increased volume and acquisitions. 

 Excluding expenses and charges related to the sale of a business and other items, Heinz said it would have posted earnings from operations of $237.7 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $236.9 million, or 65 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. Analysts were looking for earnings of 67 cents a share in the latest period, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Heinz said its businesses generally performed well during the first quarter, with double-digit sales increases in Europe and strong performances by Boston Market HomeStyle Meals and Bagel Bites. 

 The company also said it is preparing to unveil a host of products, including Heinz EZ Squirt ketchup, which will hit the shelves in October in both the traditional tomato red color and "Blastin Green" for children. Other new products Heinz is set to launch are StarKist Tuna in a Pouch, Heinz Microwaveable Soup Bowls in Europe, Smart Ones Bistro Bowls and new Boston Market HomeStyle Meals and soups.

 Delhaize 1H Results Mask Strain Of Retail Consolidation

 BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- At first glance, the picture at ambitious Belgian retailer Delhaize SA (B.DEF) seems clear and bright. 

 But look a little closer and things get cloudy, some analysts say. 

 With 70% of Delhaize's earnings coming from its U.S. unit Delhaize America, which announced first-half results June 29, and profit boosted by a robust dollar, Delhaize seems set to match its 15% EPS growth rate target when it announces first-half results Thursday. 

 But some analysts aren't impressed, pointing out that profit at the retailer would be virtually static were it not for the weak euro. They also say Delhaize America's weak performance may not be an aberration and could be the result of competitive pressure in the U.S. supermarket industry. 

 Nearer to home, Carrefour SA's (F.CAR) recent purchase of rival retailer GIB SA's (B.GIB) GB unit may also challenge Delhaize's growth in Belgium in the short term. 

 This attitude may seem churlish. After all, analysts see Delhaize turning in an average of a 10% rise in current profit to around EUR1.75 per share for the first half. 

 "We've already got Delhaize America (results), which is a big part of the net profit," said Caroline Lauwers, retail analyst at KBC Securities in Brussels, who has an accumulate rating on the stock. Lauwers expects sales to rise 18% with a 13% increase in store openings to 2,200. 

 Nevertheless, "it's mainly currency-driven growth this year," said Maud Watelet, who monitors Delhaize for Vermeulen Raemdonck in Brussels and now rates the stock a buy. Delhaize America's net profit dropped 1.8% in the first half, Fortis Bank said in a report. 

 Fortis rates the stock a buy. "Despite short-term pressure due to the financing of Hannaford and the stiff competitive climate in DZA's markets, Delhaize remains pointed for average three-year EPS growth of 15%," Watelet said. 

 Some say this is too optimistic. 

 Alexandre Jenart at Petercam in Brussels notes that Delhaize usually excludes the impact of currency fluctuations when reporting profit, but will likely include it for the first half. "If they want to reach their target for this year, which is an increase of at least 15% of EPS, they will need the help of the dollar." 

 Delhaize America's mediocre earnings aren't necessarily a temporary blip, some analysts say. Increasing price pressure from WalMart has already hit Albertson, the number two in the U.S retail market, which issued a profit warning on Aug. 23. 

 Delhaize has an ambitious and capable management team, but integrating its recent Hannaford acquisition and battling with WalMart will take all their skill, analysts say. "With the events recently in the U.S., I am much more cautious," said Jenart, who downgraded Delhaize to neutral from add last week. Jenart notes that the stock is "still trading at a discount to its peers." 

 Another, perhaps more distant cloud is Carrefour's purchase of the 72.5% it didn't own in Belgian supermarket chain GB. The chain has been plagued by management problems and restructuring problems but, with a new experienced management team and greater purchasing power, Delhaize's home front could become more vulnerable in the longer term. 

 "Delhaize will have to face the world's number one and two" in its two main markets, said Jenart. 

 Certainly, the next few quarters will be keenly eyed for clues as to how the U.S. battle is going. 

 The price war in the U.S. puts a cloud over the company's performance going forward, said Jenart. "We will have to see how the market will evolve in coming months, but for the time being I've not very optimistic regarding the U.S. market."

 H.J. Heinz Beats 1st Quarter Views But Issues 2nd Quarter  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- H.J. Heinz & Co. (HNZ), citing unfavorable currency translations and higher marketing expenses for one of its new tuna products, said that fiscal second-quarter profits will fall short of Wall Street's current views. 

 The profit warning sent the company's shares down as much as 8.6% earlier Wednesday. 

 Heinz, which had reported fiscal first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations, told the investment community during a morning conference call that it expects to earn 68 cents a share in the current quarter, instead of the 70 cents analysts had been estimating. The company earned 65 cents in the second quarter last year. 

 Despite the profit warning, Heinz has not backed down from its goal of 10% earnings growth for the year. 

 Whether the maker of Heinz ketchup and Star Kist tuna can get there is what the market is currently doubting. Attaining 10% growth for the year would require Heinz to generate substantial cost savings and push new sales during the last six months of the year. 

 "Anytime a company tells investors earnings growth is going to come in the second half (of the year) it makes one cautious," said Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Eric Katzman. The idea is that it puts too much reliance on earnings from a narrowed timeframe. 

 Pittsburgh-based Heinz told investors it does expect the currency issue, which is mostly affecting its European business, to ease as the year rolls on. But the company, which gets about one-half of its earnings from international markets and about one-third from Europe alone, still has a pretty high currency-risk exposure. 

 "Clearly currency is an issue," said Bear Stearns & Co. analyst Terry Bivens. 

 Another prickly point is sales. Heinz is having a hard time sparking top-line growth. In the first quarter, sales actually fell 1%. But increased marketing spending behind the new Star Kist tuna in a pouch, as well as other new products, is supposed to help earnings. And so is some $105 million in cost savings in the second half of the year. 

 Heinz earlier reported fiscal first-quarter profits of $237.7 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $236.9 million, or 65 cents, a year ago. The results edged past Wall Street's expectation of 67 cents. The company said the quarter was helped by what it called "strong sales performances" of frozen foods in North America and Europe and food service in the U.S. 

 Shares of Heinz were recently down $1.88, or 5%, at $35.31 on volume of 1.8 million shares. Average daily trading volume is 891,700 shares. Earlier, they were as low as 34.

 Corporate earnings outlook is being undermined by signs that economy is slowing as summer ends; some stock market analysts are warning that while profit growth will remain strong, current projections for last quarter this year and first next year are too optimistic; employment data released on Sept 1 reinforce view that economy is cooling after six rate increases by Federal Reseve; department stores are warning of weak end to year; surges in prices of crude oil and home heating oil for this winter will cut into consumers' ability to spend; while these factors suggest slower economic growth, good news is that slowdown does not have to be as sharp as in past to be successful in curbing inflation; economy could be growing at brisk pace of 3.5 percent or 4 percent when soft landing occurs, and Federal Reserve could be finished with interest rate increases

 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 With the Fed on Hold, Techs Extend Their Rally

 Technology stocks continued their recent rally last week, and the S&P 500 Index neared its March high amid rising hopes that the Federal Reserve is finished raising interest rates. 

 The Nasdaq rose 191 points to 4234, a 4.7% gain, on strength in such stocks as Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Juniper Networks, all of which hit record highs in Friday's session. The Nasdaq had a good August, rising 11.7% in the month, and extending its rally into Friday, the first day of September, when it gained 28 points. The tech-heavy index now is up 4% this year. 

 "What has become clear is that the economy is slowing and the Fed probably isn't going to tighten again. That has made investors more comfortable," says Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. There was more evidence of moderating economic growth on Friday, when the government reported that payroll employment fell 105,000 in August, partly reflecting the layoff of census workers, while the jobless rate rose to 4.1% from 4%. Auto sales also declined in August. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 46 points, or 0.4%, in the week to 11,238, held back by declines in such blue chips as Coca-Cola, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, Eastman Kodak, Home Depot and Philip Morris. The S&P 500 added 14 points, or 0.9%, to 1520, ending shy of its March high of 1527. The Dow, which rose 6.8% in August, now is down 2.3% for 2000, while the S&P is up 3.5% this year. It advanced 6.2% in August. 

 The renewed preference for technology stocks lately reflects a move out of sectors that once attracted growth-oriented investors, who now dominate the market. Growth investors, for instance, used to like certain big retailers, but another profit warning last week from Gap and bad news from formerly dependable Target underscored that even the strongest retailers are having a tough time in what has been a summer of woe for the industry. Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, the two dominant U.S. retailers, also have disappointed Wall Street in the past month, and their stocks stand considerably below their peaks. Gap fell $3 to $23.50, less than half its 52-week high of 54, while Target declined $2.50 to $24.63. 

 The major consumer stocks also are struggling, including Coca-Cola, which was down $1.75 to $54.25 last week. Bill Pecoriello, the bullish Coke analyst at Sanford Bernstein, cut his 2001 profit estimate to $1.75 a share from $1.79 partly because of the weak euro. Coke's North American soda volume this quarter is expected to fall short of early-summer projections because of cool weather in the East and the impact of price increases. Formerly strong stocks, like PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive, have lost momentum. 

 Some of the major drug stocks have been under pressure, partly reflecting the rising standing in the polls of Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, who now is viewed as industry-unfriendly after his attack on drug companies in his acceptance speech last month. Merck was off $3.75 last week to $69.19; Bristol-Myers Squibb fell $3.25 to $53.25 and Eli Lilly dropped $2.88 to $72.69. Some fear the drugs could be under a cloud until after the November elections. 

 Many growth investors apparently see little alternative to technology stocks, and they are paying ever-higher prices for the likes of Sun, EMC, and Nortel Networks that possess high earnings "visibility," meaning the Street is highly confident of their profit outlooks. 

 Oracle rose $8 to $92.63 last week; Sun added $4 to $128.63; EMC gained $6.25 to $97.38, and Juniper surged $30.50 to $221.63, helped by its addition to the Nasdaq 100 index. As noted in this space earlier this summer, Juniper could get an added boost from a potential addition to the S&P 500. With a $65 billion market value, it's now one of the largest companies outside the index. 

 The valuations on the tech trophy stocks are stunning, given their huge market values. Nortel, EMC, Sun and Oracle each have capitalizations topping $200 billion. Nortel fetches 114 times projected 2000 profits; EMC trades at 127 times projected earnings, and Oracle commands 102 times estimated profits in its fiscal year ending in May. This means that $200 billion companies are supported by just about $2 billion in profits. 

 Juniper, a hot provider of high-end routers, now trades at more than 700 times its projected earnings of 30 cents this year. Byron Wien says he's suspicious that high-multiple tech stocks continue to advance while Old Economy stocks labor, but investors seem happy now to stick with the winners. 

 -- Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio company in the U.S., was down $7.50 to $68.56, hurt by worries about a slowdown in Internet-related advertising-a concern raised by Barron's in a skeptical cover story ("Fading Signal," March 6). Another factor cited was a written remark by Rich Bilotti, the Morgan Stanley media analyst, that growth in broadcast TV ad spending is worse than he had earlier thought. This trend could spill over into radio. 

 Ford Motor dropped $2.50 to $25 on fears about the company's legal exposure to the Firestone tire crisis and other recall-related problems. Ford fans like Nick Lobaccaro, a Lehman Brothers analyst, doubt the impact on Ford will be significant and consider the stock inexpensive at less than seven times projected 2000 profits. 

 Bestfoods fell $1.25 to $69.88, apparently reflecting concerns that its takeover by Unilever at $73 a share could be delayed. The Street had expected the deal to close in October. If there's no antitrust hitch, investors in Bestfoods stand to earn a decent return in the next month. 

 Maytag was off $3.50 to $37.75 following a profit warning by Whirlpool and the absence of any takeover announcement by Sweden's Electrolux. It has been rumored that Maytag and Electrolux are in talks. Nicholas Heymann, the analyst at Prudential Securities, has been the chief advocate of such a combination, and he told clients last week that he still looks for a deal to happen. 

 There are some problems, however, that could prevent it. Given the weakness in Electrolux stock, which fell $2.63 to $25.13 last week, leaving half its 52-week high of 54, the company may be reluctant to pay up for Maytag using its shares. The talk has been that Electrolux is willing to pay about $45 a share, but that Maytag wants over $50. Maytag's directors may fear that they'll be sued if they accept an offer of just $45 -- only 12 times earnings -- given that the stock traded for $70 last summer. Maytag chief executive Lloyd Ward has to be concerned about his legacy. Does he want to be known as the guy who became CEO in 1999 when Maytag stock was $65 and then sold out to Electrolux, an arguably inferior company, at just $45 or even $50? The bullish rap is that the combined Electrolux/Maytag will be a strong competitor to Whirlpool and General Electric. But does Ward want to take that chance? 

 Looking ahead to this week, the Amgen/Transkaryotic Therapies patent trial resumes with some expecting that an important ruling could come from the Boston judge hearing the case. Amgen is seeking to prevent Transkaryotic from bringing to market a version of its top-selling drug, Epogen. The Wall Street consensus is that Amgen will win, but some knowledgeable observers argue that Transkaryotic may prevail given its arguments and the weak case presented by Amgen. 

 General Electric has a regular board meeting Friday, but no decision is expected on the successor to Chief Executive Jack Welch, who retires next April. A decision is due later this year with GE executive Jeff Immelt considered to be the leading candidate. 

 -- Credit Suisse's surprise deal to purchase Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette for $11.5 billion, or $90 a share, gave a further boost to the strong brokerage sector, one of the top-performing groups in the stock market this year. 

 Big winners included Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan, a trio that are widely regarded as prime acquisition candidates. Lehman rose $15 to $148.63; Bear Stearns gained $10.63 to $69.38, and Morgan added $16 to $160. But given the sizable run-ups in these three stocks, there may not be significant further appreciation potential, barring a generous takeover price. 

 The DLJ deal actually caught Wall Street off guard because most observers had assumed that AXA, the French financial-services company that owns 70% of DLJ, and DLJ's brass were happy with their prior arrangement. Surprise was apparent in the sharp run-up in DLJ stock, by $27.38 to $88.50 last week. 

 PaineWebber and DLJ each got about three times book value and 18 times profits. How would those measures apply to Lehman and others? 

 Lehman already trades at close to three times its book value of $51 a share, suggesting limited upside potential. But it's less expensive on an earnings basis. At 18 times profits, Lehman would fetch over $200 a share in a takeover. 

 Indeed, Dick Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, reportedly has said privately that he wouldn't settle for less than $200 a share, a figure that used to be greeted with derision but seems less outlandish now. Lehman employees, who own 35% of the stock, might be happy to get $200, remembering that the stock traded at $25 in the wake of the Russian crisis in 1998, when there were fears that Lehman would fail. At $200, Lehman would be valued at $24 billion, double the takeover prices of PaineWebber and DLJ. 

 There probably are few buyers prepared to spend $24 billion for Lehman. Fuld has reduced Lehman's reliance on bond trading and built its European operations and equity businesses, though it still gets 60% of its revenues from volatile trading. Lehman now boasts a 30% return on equity, not much less than Goldman or Morgan Stanley. 

 Looking at potential buyers, Citigroup is still grappling with integration issues from the Citicorp/Travelers merger and already has critical mass in banking, brokerage and insurance. Citigroup's chief executive, Sandy Weill, also has a history of making acquisitions at reasonable or depressed prices. 

 American International Group's CEO, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, has the high-priced equity to do any brokerage deal, but hasn't been crazy about getting involved in the historically cyclical brokerage industry. 

 Morgan Stanley and Goldman view their firms as superior and probably see little need to engage in big mergers. It's hard to imagine that Merrill Lynch wants to pair up with Lehman, either. Chase Manhattan and Bank of America lack a high-priced equity currency to do major brokerage deals. That leaves potential foreign buyers like Deutsche Bank or ABN/Amro. 

 J.P. Morgan trades for 2.6 times book value and for 14 times estimated 2000 profits. The bank probably would want at least $200 a share to give up its independence. Morgan also has consistently indicated that it believes that it has what it needs to succeed on its own. At $200, Morgan would carry a substantial price tag of $36 billion, limiting the number of potential buyers. 

 Goldman Sachs has been mentioned as a possible buyer of J.P. Morgan, but key Goldman insiders reportedly don't think a lot of Morgan's franchise outside of its huge asset management business. Morgan probably would resist any overture from Chase. 

 A Goldman/Schwab combination has been bandied about, but that seems like a long shot. For starters, Schwab's top management is contemptuous of the Wall Street culture. Schwab's strategy has been to be the Switzerland of financial firms and not forge any major alliances. Goldman may not be eager to do a dilutive merger of equals with Schwab. 

 Bear Stearns President James Cayne has said he wants $120 a share for his firm. That seems a stretch, but $90 could be possible given the firm's consistently solid results and strong clearing business. 

 Looking at asset managers, T. Rowe Price and Franklin Resources have been laggards in a strong group because of weak fund flows. 

 Franklin tacked on $1.75 to $38.81 last week, but it remains below its 1998 high of 55 and trades for 17 times projected 2000 profits. The Johnson brothers, who control Franklin, have long been viewed as unwilling to sell the company, but their attitude could change with the right offer. 

 T. Rowe Price also has prided itself on its independence. But its stock has been an underperformer in recent years. At $45.81, it trades for 21 times 2000 profits. Perhaps it would consider a combination at a generous price.

 The rise of Hollywood's most powerful woman.

 By 6am she's on her treadmill reading scripts. By 8.30 she's in a breakfast meeting. She always returns calls and never complains of glass ceilings (she finds a way around them). Paramount chief Sherry Lansing, the daughter of a holocaust survivor, learned early on that self-pity would never take her through life. Mental toughness would. LAWRIE MASTERSON meets her Sherry Lansing's mother, Margot Heiman, escaped from Nazi Germany as a 17-year-old to make a life in America. At 32 and with two small daughters, she was a widow. Lansing remembers, as a nine-year-old, hearing an uncle tell a grief-stricken Margot that he would take over her late husband's modest real estate business in Chicago, from which money would be provided to support her and her younger sister Judy. But Margot was steadfast. "No," she said. 

  "You will teach me this business." Despite having only a basic education, she quickly learned how to administer buildings owned by her late husband, the victim of a heart attack at 42. She struggled with the complexities of ledgers and tenants who either paid late or not at all, but she succeeded. "I remember going around and collecting the rent with my mother and that's what we lived off," Lansing says. "I remember her disappointment when people would leave without paying and her frustration. I'm not saying I never saw her cry, because I did, but basically she didn't want pity. She just kept moving forward. She used an expression, 'Pull up your socks, don't feel sorry for yourself', and she kept going ahead. "My mother was my strongest influence and my first role model. She was an amazing woman and I miss her every day of my life." The lessons learned from her mother underpin Sherry Lansing's life today, a life of glamor and influence the likes of which most people can only dream and which, in Hollywood, is unprecedented for a woman. Lansing, 56, has been chairman of the Paramount Motion Picture Group for the past eight years. While other women now run major Hollywood studios - Stacy Snider at Universal and Amy Pascal at Columbia - Lansing has been the trailblazer and she remains top of the cutthroat heap. She is, in fact, one of the most powerful women in business - not just showbusiness - in America today. Apart from overseeing all aspects of Paramount's movie operations, she serves on a dozen different boards of organisations ranging from the American Film Institute to the National Conference of Christians and Jews. In a recent Premiere magazine poll of Hollywood's 100 most powerful people, she was the first woman named, ranked equal seventh with Jonathan Dolgen, chairman of Paramount's parent company Viacom Entertainment Group. The two are said to share a balance of power unique among Hollywood's elite executives. An attractive former teacher, model and actress who has striking green eyes, Lansing has been described in the same sentence as being adorable and astonishingly ruthless, capable of handing a mere producer, director or corporate executive his or her head on a platter, but somehow allowing them to leave the room with their dignity intact. "You have to be ruthless in trying to achieve quality," she says. "I hope I've never been cruel in those situations. We've been direct, we've been honest and obviously we've sometimes had to let people go, but we've tried to deal fairly and we have never not done what was best for the movie." She is a multi-million-dollar salary earner who rubs shoulder pads with the top echelon of Hollywood deal-makers, agents and directors. Her signature can green-light movies, authorising the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars and opening the potential of billions in return. In a town which contributes heavily to political fund-raising, Lansing's endorsement is a sought-after prize. She was a voting delegate at the Democratic Party national convention in Los Angeles last month - "I am a big Al Gore supporter and I hope you print that. He is a really good, decent man." Under Lansing's chairmanship, Paramount, one of Hollywood's oldest studios, has produced Academy Award Best Film winners Forrest Gump, Braveheart, Titanic (co-produced with Fox) and Saving Private Ryan (co-produced with DreamWorks). The studio's market share has always hovered near the top. Last year there was no Best Picture Oscar, but Paramount movies such as Double Jeopardy, The General's Daughter and Runaway Bride each topped $150 million at the US box office while The Talented Mr Ripley and Angela's Ashes earned the critical kudos. This year Mission: Impossible 2 bolted past the $150 million milestone in just eight days. Lansing even has a Hollywood power marriage to veteran screenwriter (The Exorcist, The French Connection) and Academy Award-winning director William Friedkin, 60, whom she calls "Billy". There is, she says, no secret to her success. "I mean," she adds, tearing another leaf out of her mother's book, "the real thing is perseverance." Surrounded by several assistants, Lansing has left her offices on the Paramount lot in Hollywood for a couple of hours and is holding court in a room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. She is wearing an impeccable light grey suit over a white T-shirt and has two small, diamond-encrusted hearts at her throat. Her dark hair is neatly coiffed and she sips Evian water from a bottle as she talks articulately and expansively about her life and career. Asked how she overcame the hurdles of being a woman pioneer in what was exclusively a man's world, she replies: "I tried not to think of the negative things. I tried not to think about whatever innuendoes or rumors people were saying about me because that had nothing to do with the work. 'God forbid she should be talented and get a job', you know. "I guess I learned from my mum to keep my focus on the work and what sustained me through those years was that I loved movies more than anything in the world and I wanted to make movies more than anything in the world." Margot Heiman remarried about four years after the death of her first husband, and Sherry and Judy were adopted by their stepfather, Norton Lansing. Academically outstanding, Sherry attended a school for gifted children and earned straight As all the way through to Northwestern University. But every spare moment would find her at the cinemas in Chicago, watching double features and dreaming about somehow being involved in the movies. "I would have to say The Pawnbroker (1965) had a profound effect on my life," she says. "I just remember being so moved by Rod Steiger's performance and I even remember the theatre where I saw it was this little art house near the University of Chicago. I just remember thinking, 'My God, not only can you do something that's beautiful and glamorous like the Audrey Hepburn movies - you know, Roman Holiday and Sabrina - you can also do something that has this underlying social relevance, which The Pawnbroker did. "I was probably in my later years of high school when I saw that movie and it was just like a revelation to me." At 19, Lansing was engaged to marry her high-school sweetheart, who had become a medical student, and her stepfather told her: "Well, that's it. Now you don't have to finish college. You can be a lab technician in his office." Lansing, however, had other ideas. She earned teaching qualifications and moved with her new husband to Los Angeles. For the next four years she taught mathematics and earned extra money by spending her nights reading movie scripts and providing her opinions to producers and studios. When her marriage failed, Lansing moved full-time into showbusiness. She became a model, appearing in TV commercials for Max Factor, among others, and by 1970 she had made her movie acting debut in Loving, starring George Segal and Eva Maria Saint. The same year, she made Rio Lobo with John Wayne, but she almost dismisses that phase of her career. "I'm glad you think I was an actress because, to me, I was really doing a disservice to the word," she says with a broad smile. "I was about the worst actress anybody could be." Lansing concentrated more on examining every nuance of other people's scripts, on which she continued to work part-time, and, after a regular role in a TV series called Banyon, a short-lived private-eye drama starring Robert Forster, she accepted a position as story editor with a company called Wagner International Productions. Her progress through the Hollywood executive ranks had begun. By 1977 Lansing was senior vice-president of production at Columbia Pictures and in 1980 was appointed president of production at 20th Century-Fox, the first woman to hold such a senior position in Hollywood. She was 35. "I remember the headline in the New York Times, on the front page, was 'Ex-model becomes head of studio' and it said a lot to me at that time," she says. "What I remember thinking was that women weren't equal. I don't think it's a perfect world and I guess you can look at it now and say the glass is either half empty or half full. I think it's more than half full now for women. We have come a phenomenally long way in my lifetime and we still have a way to go, but I have to say in all honesty that I think we are becoming increasingly gender-blind." After two years at Fox, disillusioned by a long and bitter battle with the studio's distribution chief Norman Levy (he is said to have walked out on Chariots Of Fire after 20 minutes, declaring it would "Never work for American audiences"), Lansing quit. With former Columbia Pictures president Stanley R. Jaffe, she set up Jaffe-Lansing Productions and the duo made two of the most talked-about movies of the 1980s - Fatal Attraction and The Accused, both of which were based on strong roles for women (Glenn Close and Jodie Foster, respectively). Again, it came down to perseverance. "Every studio passed on Fatal Attraction twice," she recalls. "Every studio passed on The Accused. They did not like the scripts, they did not like the casting we were bringing to them, but then suddenly you get an element that makes it all happen. We were told to give up many, many times, but I actually believe that the best films are the ones that take the longest to get made. What that shows is that somebody had this passion for it and somebody saw something and kept driving at it." In 1991, Jaffe accepted an appointment as president and chief operating officer of Paramount Pictures. Lansing continued producing under her own banner for another year, but eventually her old business partner's repeated overtures became too strong and she moved into her current job, which is said to earn her more than $2 million a year. Originally, however, she declined Jaffe's offers. "I wanted to keep producing and I wanted more of a personal life at the time," she says. "I thought maybe I would finish up a couple of movies (one was Indecent Proposal) and take some time off, then I got lucky and met Billy and got married and things changed, because for the first time in my life I didn't love being on location. I missed my husband and my stepchildren and I wanted to be home. Someone said I was the only person who took this job because I could be home for dinner, and that's really true!" A typical day in the life of Chairman Sherry looks something like this: By 6am she is on her treadmill, but not just to clear the cobwebs. She either reads scripts or is on the phone to New York while she runs. By 8.30 she is in a breakfast meeting, before heading for 5555 Melrose Avenue and her offices on the landmark Paramount lot. For the remainder of her day, she talks budgets, scripts, casting, marketing campaigns and troubleshooting in a variety of meetings, in between watching "rushes" of movie scenes shot that day and taking and returning dozens of phone calls. She is reputed to always return calls and to have the nicest, sweetest "No" in Hollywood. Somehow, Lansing also manages to fit in charity work. One of her pets - in memory of her mother, who died of ovarian cancer at age 64 - is an organisation called Stop Cancer, which funds research. By 7pm, Lansing is either on her way home or, once or twice a week, to an audience test screening of a Paramount film, leaving other studios' films for regular cinemas on weekends. "I try to read a script every night before I go to sleep," she says. "Doesn't it sound like fun? I don't cook at all. That's the truth. I wouldn't know how to do anything in the kitchen." Having gone through years of therapy after the break-up of her first marriage, which she found "suffocating", she says her nine-year marriage to Friedkin has top priority in her life. She is his fourth wife and he has two sons, Cedric, 23, and Jack, 16, from previous relationships. Jack's mother is British actress Lesley-Anne Down (Upstairs, Downstairs), from whom Friedkin went through a bitter and scandalous divorce in 1985. Apart from the anguish and embarrassing publicity, Down claims it cost them almost $2 million in legal fees. With Friedkin's storms behind him and Lansing's emotional scars faded, they have found happiness together. "I am married to a wonderful man who I love dearly," she says. "I have two stepchildren who are really, really important to me and I guess that part of my life is more important to me than anything. "It came to me late in life. I didn't get married (again) until I was in my late 40s and I guess having waited that long to fall in love, having waited that long to be a stepmother, it always has to come first. But if you have a good marriage and you have great kids, which I am blessed to have, they're pretty understanding if you have to work late, but I have found it hard to balance my life. You try to keep the weekends to yourself. You try not to waste your evenings, and so I would say to you that I feel as if I do have a balanced life. I really am home for dinner, you know, but for those two nights a week." On the other hand, warning that she is about to say something that is going to be "really shocking ... really anti-feminist" and prefacing her remarks by stressing she never had children of her own, Lansing then poses a question: Can a woman be a wife, a mother and run a major company? "I'm not talking about working, becoming a very successful executive," she says. "I'm talking about can you run the company and still spend enough time with your husband and children and not have a nervous breakdown in the process? "I mean, I don't know the answer to that question. I've always thought that you could do maybe two out of the three ... that if you wanted to be there for your children when they were little and you wanted to be married, that maybe you should be content. I don't mean this in a bad way and I hope it isn't coming out inappropriately. I actually remember hearing Katharine Hepburn talk about this on Dick Cavett's show when I was, I don't know, 18 or something. "He said, 'Miss Hepburn, you've had this amazing career. I mean, nobody has done more than you have, but you've never been married and you've never had children. How do you feel about that?' And she said, 'I feel just fine. I could not have travelled every place that I've travelled and still taken my daughter to kindergarten, so that's the choice I made'. "And I think keeping that in the back of your mind is, 'OK, although there are women I know who are doing all three. I don't know what their insides are like'. I know I could not have done it." Lansing acknowledges that the so-called glass ceiling still exists, but says in Hollywood it means only one thing: that no woman actually owns a studio. "I feel very good about the role of women in the business and I feel very much like it's no longer a boys' club or a women's club, it's just a talent club," she says. "But most of the women I talk to today don't want to take that step because they're more interested in making movies than in the business aspect. But I guarantee you there is some girl at college today or somebody working at Paramount who says, 'I don't want to be Sherry Lansing, I want to be (her multi-billionaire boss) Sumner Redstone'. Nothing will stop that person, I am convinced of that. "The big problem I think we're facing in the business today is ageism. It used to be that age was experience. Now it's not and I think we have an over-abundant need to go with someone who has never done anything and ignore people who have a body of work that should be respected." That said, Lansing admits she looks forward to what she terms "The third chapter" of her life. "To me, that would consist of a lot of time on the beach and a lot of time doing non-profit work, just completely devoting myself to charities I'm interested in. Maybe a foundation or something like that." In the meantime, there's another movie she especially wants to get made at Paramount. "It's about ... well, an older woman," she says. "That's just the best way to put it. You know, it's about relationships, a kind of romantic comedy on that area and we're developing it now. But that's just today. Tomorrow there will be something else to think about." The talented Sherry Lansing: The Paramount boss can do almost anything - teach, act, model, run a company - but she can't cook. Committed: Glenn Close played Michael Douglas's crazy jilted lover in Fatal Attraction, a movie Sherry Lansing had to fight to get made.

  With The Fed On Hold, Techs Extend Their Rally
  By Andrew Bary



Technology stocks continued their recent rally last week, and the S&P
500 Index neared its March high amid rising hopes that the Federal
Reserve is finished raising interest rates.


 The Nasdaq rose 191 points to 4234, a 4.7% gain, on strength in such stocks as Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Juniper Networks, all of which hit record highs in Friday's session. The Nasdaq had a good August, rising 11.7% in the month, and extending its rally into Friday, the first day of September, when it gained 28 points. The tech-heavy index now is up 4% this year. 

 "What has become clear is that the economy is slowing and the Fed probably isn't going to tighten again. That has made investors more comfortable," says Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. There was more evidence of moderating economic growth on Friday, when the government reported that payroll employment fell 105,000 in August, partly reflecting the layoff of census workers, while the jobless rate rose to 4.1% from 4%. Auto sales also declined in August. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 46 points, or 0.4%, in the week to 11,238, held back by declines in such blue chips as Coca-Cola, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, Eastman Kodak, Home Depot and Philip Morris. The S&P 500 added 14 points, or 0.9%, to 1520, ending shy of its March high of 1527. The Dow, which rose 6.8% in August, now is down 2.3% for 2000, while the S&P is up 3.5% this year. It advanced 6.2% in August. 

 The renewed preference for technology stocks lately reflects a move out of sectors that once attracted growth-oriented investors, who now dominate the market. Growth investors, for instance, used to like certain big retailers, but another profit warning last week from Gap and bad news from formerly dependable Target underscored that even the strongest retailers are having a tough time in what has been a summer of woe for the industry. Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, the two dominant U.S. retailers, also have disappointed Wall Street in the past month, and their stocks stand considerably below their peaks. Gap fell $3 to $23.50, less than half its 52-week high of 54, while Target declined $2.50 to $24.63. 

 The major consumer stocks also are struggling, including Coca-Cola, which was down $1.75 to $54.25 last week. Bill Pecoriello, the bullish Coke analyst at Sanford Bernstein, cut his 2001 profit estimate to $1.75 a share from $1.79 partly because of the weak euro. Coke's North American soda volume this quarter is expected to fall short of early-summer projections because of cool weather in the East and the impact of price increases. Formerly strong stocks, like PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive, have lost momentum. 

 Some of the major drug stocks have been under pressure, partly reflecting the rising standing in the polls of Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore, who now is viewed as industry-unfriendly after his attack on drug companies in his acceptance speech last month. Merck was off $3.75 last week to $69.19; Bristol-Myers Squibb fell $3.25 to $53.25 and Eli Lilly dropped $2.88 to $72.69. Some fear the drugs could be under a cloud until after the November elections. 

 Many growth investors apparently see little alternative to technology stocks, and they are paying ever-higher prices for the likes of Sun, EMC, and Nortel Networks that possess high earnings "visibility," meaning the Street is highly confident of their profit outlooks. 

 Oracle rose $8 to $92.63 last week; Sun added $4 to $128.63; EMC gained $6.25 to $97.38, and Juniper surged $30.50 to $221.63, helped by its addition to the Nasdaq 100 index. As noted in this space earlier this summer, Juniper could get an added boost from a potential addition to the S&P 500. With a $65 billion market value, it's now one of the largest companies outside the index. 

 The valuations on the tech trophy stocks are stunning, given their huge market values. Nortel, EMC, Sun and Oracle each have capitalizations topping $200 billion. Nortel fetches 114 times projected 2000 profits; EMC trades at 127 times projected earnings, and Oracle commands 102 times estimated profits in its fiscal year ending in May. This means that $200 billion companies are supported by just about $2 billion in profits. 

 Juniper, a hot provider of high-end routers, now trades at more than 700 times its projected earnings of 30 cents this year. Byron Wien says he's suspicious that high-multiple tech stocks continue to advance while Old Economy stocks labor, but investors seem happy now to stick with the winners. 

 -- Clear Channel Communications, the largest radio company in the U.S., was down $7.50 to $68.56, hurt by worries about a slowdown in Internet-related advertising-a concern raised by Barron's in a skeptical cover story ("Fading Signal," March 6). Another factor cited was a written remark by Rich Bilotti, the Morgan Stanley media analyst, that growth in broadcast TV ad spending is worse than he had earlier thought. This trend could spill over into radio. 

 Ford Motor dropped $2.50 to $25 on fears about the company's legal exposure to the Firestone tire crisis and other recall-related problems. Ford fans like Nick Lobaccaro, a Lehman Brothers analyst, doubt the impact on Ford will be significant and consider the stock inexpensive at less than seven times projected 2000 profits. 

 Bestfoods fell $1.25 to $69.88, apparently reflecting concerns that its takeover by Unilever at $73 a share could be delayed. The Street had expected the deal to close in October. If there's no antitrust hitch, investors in Bestfoods stand to earn a decent return in the next month. 

 Maytag was off $3.50 to $37.75 following a profit warning by Whirlpool and the absence of any takeover announcement by Sweden's Electrolux. It has been rumored that Maytag and Electrolux are in talks. Nicholas Heymann, the analyst at Prudential Securities, has been the chief advocate of such a combination, and he told clients last week that he still looks for a deal to happen. 

 There are some problems, however, that could prevent it. Given the weakness in Electrolux stock, which fell $2.63 to $25.13 last week, leaving half its 52-week high of 54, the company may be reluctant to pay up for Maytag using its shares. The talk has been that Electrolux is willing to pay about $45 a share, but that Maytag wants over $50. Maytag's directors may fear that they'll be sued if they accept an offer of just $45 -- only 12 times earnings -- given that the stock traded for $70 last summer. Maytag chief executive Lloyd Ward has to be concerned about his legacy. Does he want to be known as the guy who became CEO in 1999 when Maytag stock was $65 and then sold out to Electrolux, an arguably inferior company, at just $45 or even $50? The bullish rap is that the combined Electrolux/Maytag will be a strong competitor to Whirlpool and General Electric. But does Ward want to take that chance? 

 Looking ahead to this week, the Amgen/Transkaryotic Therapies patent trial resumes with some expecting that an important ruling could come from the Boston judge hearing the case. Amgen is seeking to prevent Transkaryotic from bringing to market a version of its top-selling drug, Epogen. The Wall Street consensus is that Amgen will win, but some knowledgeable observers argue that Transkaryotic may prevail given its arguments and the weak case presented by Amgen. 

 General Electric has a regular board meeting Friday, but no decision is expected on the successor to Chief Executive Jack Welch, who retires next April. A decision is due later this year with GE executive Jeff Immelt considered to be the leading candidate. 

 -- Credit Suisse's surprise deal to purchase Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette for $11.5 billion, or $90 a share, gave a further boost to the strong brokerage sector, one of the top-performing groups in the stock market this year. 

 Big winners included Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan, a trio that are widely regarded as prime acquisition candidates. Lehman rose $15 to $148.63; Bear Stearns gained $10.63 to $69.38, and Morgan added $16 to $160. But given the sizable run-ups in these three stocks, there may not be significant further appreciation potential, barring a generous takeover price. 

 The DLJ deal actually caught Wall Street off guard because most observers had assumed that AXA, the French financial-services company that owns 70% of DLJ, and DLJ's brass were happy with their prior arrangement. Surprise was apparent in the sharp run-up in DLJ stock, by $27.38 to $88.50 last week. 

 PaineWebber and DLJ each got about three times book value and 18 times profits. How would those measures apply to Lehman and others? 

 Lehman already trades at close to three times its book value of $51 a share, suggesting limited upside potential. But it's less expensive on an earnings basis. At 18 times profits, Lehman would fetch over $200 a share in a takeover. 

 Indeed, Dick Fuld, Lehman's chief executive, reportedly has said privately that he wouldn't settle for less than $200 a share, a figure that used to be greeted with derision but seems less outlandish now. Lehman employees, who own 35% of the stock, might be happy to get $200, remembering that the stock traded at $25 in the wake of the Russian crisis in 1998, when there were fears that Lehman would fail. At $200, Lehman would be valued at $24 billion, double the takeover prices of PaineWebber and DLJ. 

 There probably are few buyers prepared to spend $24 billion for Lehman. Fuld has reduced Lehman's reliance on bond trading and built its European operations and equity businesses, though it still gets 60% of its revenues from volatile trading. Lehman now boasts a 30% return on equity, not much less than Goldman or Morgan Stanley. 

 Looking at potential buyers, Citigroup is still grappling with integration issues from the Citicorp/Travelers merger and already has critical mass in banking, brokerage and insurance. Citigroup's chief executive, Sandy Weill, also has a history of making acquisitions at reasonable or depressed prices. 

 American International Group's CEO, Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, has the high-priced equity to do any brokerage deal, but hasn't been crazy about getting involved in the historically cyclical brokerage industry. 

 Morgan Stanley and Goldman view their firms as superior and probably see little need to engage in big mergers. It's hard to imagine that Merrill Lynch wants to pair up with Lehman, either. Chase Manhattan and Bank of America lack a high-priced equity currency to do major brokerage deals. That leaves potential foreign buyers like Deutsche Bank or ABN/Amro. 

 J.P. Morgan trades for 2.6 times book value and for 14 times estimated 2000 profits. The bank probably would want at least $200 a share to give up its independence. Morgan also has consistently indicated that it believes that it has what it needs to succeed on its own. At $200, Morgan would carry a substantial price tag of $36 billion, limiting the number of potential buyers. 

 Goldman Sachs has been mentioned as a possible buyer of J.P. Morgan, but key Goldman insiders reportedly don't think a lot of Morgan's franchise outside of its huge asset management business. Morgan probably would resist any overture from Chase. 

 A Goldman/Schwab combination has been bandied about, but that seems like a long shot. For starters, Schwab's top management is contemptuous of the Wall Street culture. Schwab's strategy has been to be the Switzerland of financial firms and not forge any major alliances. Goldman may not be eager to do a dilutive merger of equals with Schwab. 

 Bear Stearns President James Cayne has said he wants $120 a share for his firm. That seems a stretch, but $90 could be possible given the firm's consistently solid results and strong clearing business. 

 Looking at asset managers, T. Rowe Price and Franklin Resources have been laggards in a strong group because of weak fund flows. 

 Franklin tacked on $1.75 to $38.81 last week, but it remains below its 1998 high of 55 and trades for 17 times projected 2000 profits. The Johnson brothers, who control Franklin, have long been viewed as unwilling to sell the company, but their attitude could change with the right offer. 

 T. Rowe Price also has prided itself on its independence. But its stock has been an underperformer in recent years. At $45.81, it trades for 21 times 2000 profits. Perhaps it would consider a combination at a generous price.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In a sign the recent tentative accord between United Airlines and its pilots is affecting the broader industry, some American Airlines pilots urged their colleagues to reject a one-year contract extension in order to negotiate for a better pact. 

 The news has Wall Street analysts worried that wages will rise across the industry, boosting airlines' costs and prompting them to pass them on to travelers through higher air fares. 

 Meanwhile, blaming passenger avoidance at United, its commuter-service partner Atlantic Coast Airlines Holdings Inc. (ACAI) said earnings in the third and fourth quarters will fall short of expectations. 

 The tentative agreement between UAL Corp. (UAL), parent of United, and pilots calls for an immediate raise of up to 28.5% and 4% annual increases over four years, according to the pilots' union. That's above the 15% to 20% initial increases some analysts had anticipated. 

 Such an "industry-leading" deal prompted two local leaders at the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 10,500 pilots, to "send a message that indicated that they had changed their minds on the tentative agreement," said APA spokesman Capt. Jim Philpot. 

 APA Dallas-Fort Worth Base Chairman Phillip Beall and Vice Chairman Jeff Sheets have sent an e-mail to local union members urging them to reject the contract extension, which calls for a 5.6% pay raise by August 2001, Philpot said. 

 About 2,700 American pilots are based at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 

 While the APA's national leaders still support the contract extension, "the economic landscape was dramatically changed" by the United pact, the spokesman said. 

 United's accord is said to cover a whole range of issues other than wages, but "the pay was... the most significant and most obvious in the contract," Philpot said. 

 The results of the ATA ballot, mailed Thursday to members, will be announced Sept. 20. If approved, the contract would be extended to Aug. 31, 2002 from Aug. 31, 2001. 

 Shares of AMR Corp. (AMR), the parent of American, fell 13 cents, or 0.4%, Friday to $32.69. 


            "Domino Effect" Seen Likely



Chris Chiames, spokesman at AMR Corp., defended the extension, calling
it "a positive win-win deal for both the company and the union."



Chiames said American pilots are "compensated much better" than United
pilots, and the proposed wage increases for United pilots would merely
bring their salary "back to industry standards." United pilots took a
15.7% pay cut in 1994 in exchange for a 25% stake in UAL, and their
wages are said to trail those of their peers.



All the same, a "domino effect" from the United accord will "spill
over to the rest of the sector," predicted Brian Harris, analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney in New York. He said pilots at Delta Air Lines Inc.
(DAL) will also look to the pact and attempt to get a better deal.



The impact "will be reflected in higher costs for the airlines going
forward, and they will attempt to pass them on to consumers," he said.



Although major carriers have successfully passed the higher fuel costs
on to fliers this year through three fare increases, "they will not have
as good a success" in raising ticket prices further if the economy cools
off, Harris predicted.



          Earnings At United Express Hurt



In the latest spillover from the string of flight delays and
cancellations at United, Atlantic Coast Airlines earlier Friday issued a
profit warning for the third and fourth quarters. Atlantic, which
operates commuter service United Express connecting with mainline United
flights, said it expects to earn 30 cents to 35 cents a share in the
third quarter, below the 54-cent-a-share consensus analyst estimate
compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial.



Atlantic said in a press release it "experienced lower booking levels
starting in early August following the adverse publicity surrounding
flight cancellations by United Airlines."



"Now that the United system performance is improving, we have begun to
expect... to see improvement in booking and customer acceptance," said
spokesman Rick Delisi.



Still, Atlantic expects the residual effects of United's woes to
continue to hurt its performance into the fourth quarter. It sees
fourth-quarter earnings of 45 cents to 55 cents a share, below the
consensus estimate of 64 cents a share.



With 582 daily departures serving Washington Dulles International
Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Atlantic generates
more than 90% of its revenue from flights operated as United Express.



It also began operating part of the Delta Connection program last
month.



Shares of Atlantic tumbled $3.38, or 11%, to $28.38 on volume of 1.16
million shares, compared with the average daily turnover of about
198,000 shares.



Skywest Inc. (SKYW), another carrier operating United's connection
program, is immune to the problems at the largest U.S. airline, said
Jamie Baker, analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York.



That's because Skywest sells its capacity to United, whereas Atlantic
sells its seats directly to the public, Baker said.



Skywest shares rose 50 cents, or 1%, to $50.19.

 N.Y. Stocks Fall; Techs Slain Again; Nasdaq Back To '98

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- High-technology issues absorbed another thrashing after analysts warned that the spate of profit warnings that have ravaged the sector the last several weeks may not have yet fully accounted for just how weak profits are going to be this year. 

 Shares of Oracle lost $1.50 to $21.69 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, after Banc of America Securities lowered its profit forecast for the software developer. 

 Shares of Extreme Networks fell 1.06 to 24.75, while Foundry Networks sank 88 cents to 12.44, both on Nasdaq, after Lehman Brothers issued downbeat research notes on the two networking names. 

 But the eye-catching warning Tuesday came out of Goldman Sachs. The firm might have been more deliberate about guiding profit estimates lower than some of the other brokerage houses. But it commanded investors' attention Tuesday, cutting profit or revenue goals for some 40 high-technology companies, because, it said, new evidence about the severity of the economic slowdown in the U.S. led the firm to revisit its earnings assumptions. 

 Shares of several of the names Goldman highlighted suffered declines. EMC dropped 3.34 to 41.66. Broadcom fell 9.38 to 53.63 on Nasdaq. Vitesse Semiconductor, which has already been the subject of widespread estimate revisions, lost another 6.81 to 43.56 on Nasdaq. Tibco Software fell 2.38 to 16.38, also on Nasdaq. 

 The accompanying fallout from the earnings worries cost the Nasdaq Composite Index 100.71 points, a drop of 4.36%. Having fallen back to 2207.79, the index stands where it was Dec. 31 - of 1998. 

 "Even with how much these stocks have come down already, we still don't have our arms around the earnings scenario in high technology," Brian Belski, chief fundamental strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said Tuesday. 

 As discombobulated as investors were about high technology, the rest of the blue-chip list wasn't badly harmed Tuesday, allowing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to escape with a loss of just 5.65, or 0.05%, to 10636.88. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,447 issues advancing, 1,594 declining and 228 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,098,622,360 shares, compared with 1,114,529,500 Monday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 633.46, down 1.03. The average price per share fell 6 cents. 

 The session featured another piece of data that showed that, as investors have known, the growth of the U.S. economy, so robust last year, has ground to a halt. A report showed that consumer confidence fell more sharply than economists anticipated in February, dropping to its lowest level since June 1996. 

 But the investors who had been anticipating that weak data would draw the Federal Reserve into the fray found themselves frustrated, as the central bank made no move to cut interest rates, at least not Tuesday. 

 Absent relief from the Fed, investors adopted a defensive posture, either gravitating toward companies  whose sales prospects aren't hurt in a slowing economy, or those whose profits have simply withstood the challenge. 

 Shares of tobacco and food products maker Philip Morris gained 1.76 to 48.26, while Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing added 1.65 to 113, and hospital operator Tenet Healthcare climbed 1.73 to 46.08. 

 Loews, a holding company with operations in, among other lines, insurance, hotels and oil, climbed 3.98 to 106.40; coupled with Monday's 4% advance, the stock reached a 52-week high Tuesday. 

 Markel, a Richmond, Va., insurance concern, gained 4.80 to 174.30, helped by some upbeat comments from Goldman Sachs. 

 The mood in the high-technology sector, though, proved to be poisonous enough that most stocks either ignored or flouted some upbeat comments. Shares of BEA Systems, for example, fell 5.56 to 40.19 on Nasdaq, even though Dain Rauscher Wessels, called the stock a top stock to own in a tough market. Meanwhile, shares of Ariba lost 2.44 to 17.25 on Nasdaq, despite some encouraging comments from Thomas Weisel Partners. 

 That all made it a bit curious, then, that Texas Instruments, which admitted to an upcoming earnings shortfall Monday, would finish higher Tuesday, rising 85 cents to 30. 

 Scientific Atlanta lost 3.95 to 47.25, while Motorola eased 60 cents to 15.29, falling to a 52-week low. The declines came after a report in Tuesday's edition of The Wall Street Journal said that slowing demand for digital television in the United Kingdom will constrain the global market for set-top boxes this year. Both companies make digital set-top boxes. 

 Electronic Data Systems added 1.26 to 62.70. Analysts came away from the computer consulting concern's analyst meeting at its headquarters in Plano, Texas, with an upbeat view of the company's presentations, including its announcement of approximately $700 million in new contract wins. 

 STMicroelectronics declined 1.03 to 33.12. Credit Suisse First Boston lowered its earnings estimates on the European chip maker, citing weakness in the chip sector. 

 Carnival gained 1.85 to 32.75. Credit Suisse First Boston added the stock of the Miami cruise line operator to its Focus List, saying that the cruise industry has addressed the capacity glut that caused stock prices to fall last year, while demand has risen and prices have stabilized at higher levels. 

 Nike sank 9.57 to 39.60. The Beaverton, Ore., athletic footwear and apparel maker late Monday said it expects fiscal third-quarter earnings will miss Wall Street's expectations. 

 Nike blamed the shortfall on weak U.S. footwear sales and an inventory buildup caused by complications in a new supply-chain system. I2 Technologies, which supplied Nike's supply-chain management software, slid 7.94 to 27.56 in Nasdaq trading, even though analysts came to i2's defense, saying it had successfully implemented its products in other large-scale applications. 

 Shares of rival supply-chain software maker Manugistics also weakened, dropping 5.31 to 30.69 on Nasdaq. The company supplied software for Nike's apparel operations, though Nike's inventory problems occurred in its footwear operation. 

 Shares of Reebok, another athletic footwear and apparel manufacturer, also lost ground Tuesday, sinking 79 cents to 26.54. 

 Triton Energy fell 2.91 to 21.50, sinking to a 52-week low. The Dallas oil producer abandoned an exploratory well it said was unproductive. The company said it spent $5.5 million drilling the well, located offshore Equatorial Guinea. 

 Walt Disney lost 65 cents to 30.75 in a session where many blue chips lost ground. The Burbank, Calif., media and entertainment concern agreed to form a joint venture with magazine publisher Wenner Media to publish Wenner's US Weekly magazine. The venture won't have an interest in Wenner's Rolling Stone.

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



1:39 (Dow Jones) Credit Suisse First Boston cut its 4Q cash revenue
and adjusted EBITDA estimates for 360networks (TSIX), a day before the
network builder and operator is scheduled to release its 4Q results.
Credit Suisse analyst Ehud Gelblum cut his cash revenue estimate to $175
million from $213 million and his adjusted EBITDA estimate to $81
million from $131 million. Shares down about 7.19% at $9.28. (BED)



1:31 (Dow Jones) Fed vice chair Ferguson noting that falling
confidence not translating into spending. "A somewhat puzzling feature
of the recent period has been that, despite the sharp weakening in
sentiment, household spending appears thus far to have held up well."
Remarks suggest Fed may not be too impressed by confidence drop and may
need to see more evidence of weakness to cut rates before March 20. (BB)



1:20 (Dow Jones) Fed Governor Ferguson doesn't give any clear signals
in his New York speech. He notes that downside economic risk remains,
but reminds that consumer spending is holding up despite lower
confidence and that oil prices should fall, lowering the inflation
threat. All in all, not a screaming signal of a intra-meeting rate cut,
but not enough to dissuade the market from believing in a intra-meeting
cut. (SV)



1:16 (Dow Jones) Bear Stearns recommends buying a basket of busted
semiconductor converts, since the sector has been sold off with "new
economy" names, but isn't plagued by the same credit problems. Investors
may want to wait until prices reach November's lows, however, Bear
Stearns says. (RTB)



1:05 (Dow Jones) Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards,
might be offering up his own version of the Rudyard Kipling poem "If,"
which begins: "If you can keep your head when all about you ...."
Goldman's version is "When," asking when will investors "look beyond the
current valley of depressing news to the positive peaks that lie ahead,"
and "when will owning stocks be fun again." Goldman concludes the good
times will return sooner rather than later and urges investors to get in
ahead of the upswing. (KJT)



12:53 (Dow Jones) News that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) received
grand-jury subpoenas late last year and is cooperating with the federal
investigation into the marketing of its anticancer drugs and other
products surprised the Street. Despite a few large block trades,
investors and analysts are reserving jugdment until further information
is known. Based on current knowledge, analysts don't anticipate any
meaningful hit. Shares fell 2.6%. (BMM)



12:48 (Dow Jones) Remember when inflation talk included gold? The
Comex's leading April contract, now around $268, is good to go to
$273.30. That depends on whether $266.10 support holds on a daily
closing basis. Tuesday's intraday low is $266.50. (SC)



12:35 (Dow Jones) RadioShack Corp. (RSH) can reach more consumers and
establish itself as the top seller of Direct TV satellite television
services through its alliance with Blockbuster Inc. (BBI), said
Jefferies & Co. analyst Donald Trott. The deal would initially put
RadioShack store-within-a-store in 130 Blockbuster stores, with the
potential for 5,000 stores going forward, Trott said. (DDO)



12:25 (Dow Jones) Shares of California concern Niku (NIKU) - not to be
confused with the equally ailing Nike - were off 35% Monday when the
services revenue management company revealed its Days Sales Outstanding
spiked 42 days sequentially to 132 days and CFO Mark Nelson announced he
was stepping down to spend time with his family. Goldman Sachs and Dain
Rauscher downgraded the shares, despite a slightly higher fiscal 2002
forecast from Niku. (MM)



12:15 (Dow Jones) Broadcom (BRCM), Cisco (CSCO) and JDS Uniphase
(JDSU) are among high profile tech stocks trading "on a plane curve
formed by the intersection of the right circular cone and a plan
parallel to an element of the cone," one market strategist said. The
parabolic formation may end up being a positive, said Mark Minervini,
president of Quantech Research Group, because in times past the pattern
has culminated with a crescendo of selling. "Such an ugly finish should
be welcome," Minervini said. "It ought to shatter the complacent move
overhanging the market and allow the Nasdaq to put in its final low."
(KJT)



12:03 (Dow Jones) National Assn. of Manufacturers Pres. Jasinowski
says "the simple implication to be drawn from today's (durable goods)
report is that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by one-half
a point immediately." (JC)



11:54 (Dow Jones) The California energy crisis is definitely on the
minds of investors, a PaineWebber and Gallup survey discovered. About
44% of those polled see it as part of a larger energy problem that could
affect the rest of the country, and 90% believe California's problems
will affect the rest of the country. PaineWebber's Chief Fixed Income
Strategist Michael Ryan said although other criteria are more important
in influencing one's investment-making decisions, in the current
climate, these sentiments obviously give investors reason to pause
before making an investment choice. (CCC)



11:48 (Dow Jones) Stocks attempting to rebound, but volatile. Hey,
maybe it has something to do with the Fed. Talk seems to be heating up
that central bankers are going to pull the trigger on an ease later
today. Do you think Bush might appreciate that as he goes on the tube
for his first big speech tonight? Then Greenspan can explain to us what
has changed so much from two weeks ago when he speaks tomorrow.
Anyway...The technicians say stocks are oversold, but maybe not ready to
break out completely, while argument for 2H recovery is fading, with or
without Fed help. DJIA up 35 at 10675, Nasdaq drops 30 to 2278, and S&P
500 adds 3 to 1270. (TG)



11:43 (Dow Jones) A nice NYSE debut from CNOOC Ltd. (CEO), the
overseas listing of China National Offshore Oil Co. ADRs are up 6.4% on
their first day of trading, roughly a week after the company raised more
than $1 billion in an IPO led by Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First
Boston, and BOC International. (RJH)



11:28 (Dow Jones) 3Com (COMS) appears "challenged" to meet analysts'
views for its fiscal 3Q ending Wednesday, says JPMorgan H&Q analyst Erik
Suppiger. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus predicts the
network equipment maker will lose 14 cents a share. Suppiger originally
predicted revenue of $740 million, but he notes that markets for several
3Com product lines are weak. 3Com shares trade at roughly one time
projected revenues for calender 2001. That seems low, but Suppiger is
cautious and maintains his market perform rating. (PDL)



11:24 (Dow Jones) If the Fed moves, it will likely do so by early
afternoon today, says a notable chorus of Wall Streeters. The Fed has
the confidence data and it likely has a good indication of Thursday's
NAPM already. Moving Wednesday steps into a political minefield because
of Greenspan's Congressional visit. That leaves today as the best
opportunity to move, and pricing in swaps and mortgages, and Treasury
bills reflect this sentiment. (MSD)



11:21 (Dow Jones) Frontier Airlines (FRNT) down sharply after having
broken a string of quarters of earnings growth with a profit warning.
The regional carrier's net will grow only 5% in March, and one analyst
believes the slowdown will continue for two more quarters. Frontier's
results will look particularly bad if compared with last summer's, the
analyst said, when Frontier picked up traffic from United Airlines
(UAL), which was having labor problems. (ELM)

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



1:20 (Dow Jones) Fed Governor Ferguson doesn't give any clear signals
in his New York speech. He notes that downside economic risk remains,
but reminds that consumer spending is holding up despite lower
confidence and that oil prices should fall, lowering the inflation
threat. All in all, not a screaming signal of a intra-meeting rate cut,
but not enough to dissuade the market from believing in a intra-meeting
cut. (SV)



1:16 (Dow Jones) Bear Stearns recommends buying a basket of busted
semiconductor converts, since the sector has been sold off with "new
economy" names, but isn't plagued by the same credit problems. Investors
may want to wait until prices reach November's lows, however, Bear
Stearns says. (RTB)



1:05 (Dow Jones) Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards,
might be offering up his own version of the Rudyard Kipling poem "If,"
which begins: "If you can keep your head when all about you ...."
Goldman's version is "When," asking when will investors "look beyond the
current valley of depressing news to the positive peaks that lie ahead,"
and "when will owning stocks be fun again." Goldman concludes the good
times will return sooner rather than later and urges investors to get in
ahead of the upswing. (KJT)



12:53 (Dow Jones) News that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) received
grand-jury subpoenas late last year and is cooperating with the federal
investigation into the marketing of its anticancer drugs and other
products surprised the Street. Despite a few large block trades,
investors and analysts are reserving jugdment until further information
is known. Based on current knowledge, analysts don't anticipate any
meaningful hit. Shares fell 2.6%. (BMM)



12:48 (Dow Jones) Remember when inflation talk included gold? The
Comex's leading April contract, now around $268, is good to go to
$273.30. That depends on whether $266.10 support holds on a daily
closing basis. Tuesday's intraday low is $266.50. (SC)



12:35 (Dow Jones) RadioShack Corp. (RSH) can reach more consumers and
establish itself as the top seller of Direct TV satellite television
services through its alliance with Blockbuster Inc. (BBI), said
Jefferies & Co. analyst Donald Trott. The deal would initially put
RadioShack store-within-a-store in 130 Blockbuster stores, with the
potential for 5,000 stores going forward, Trott said. (DDO)



12:25 (Dow Jones) Shares of California concern Niku (NIKU) - not to be
confused with the equally ailing Nike - were off 35% Monday when the
services revenue management company revealed its Days Sales Outstanding
spiked 42 days sequentially to 132 days and CFO Mark Nelson announced he
was stepping down to spend time with his family. Goldman Sachs and Dain
Rauscher downgraded the shares, despite a slightly higher fiscal 2002
forecast from Niku. (MM)



12:15 (Dow Jones) Broadcom (BRCM), Cisco (CSCO) and JDS Uniphase
(JDSU) are among high profile tech stocks trading "on a plane curve
formed by the intersection of the right circular cone and a plan
parallel to an element of the cone," one market strategist said. The
parabolic formation may end up being a positive, said Mark Minervini,
president of Quantech Research Group, because in times past the pattern
has culminated with a crescendo of selling. "Such an ugly finish should
be welcome," Minervini said. "It ought to shatter the complacent move
overhanging the market and allow the Nasdaq to put in its final low."
(KJT)



12:03 (Dow Jones) National Assn. of Manufacturers Pres. Jasinowski
says "the simple implication to be drawn from today's (durable goods)
report is that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by one-half
a point immediately." (JC)



11:54 (Dow Jones) The California energy crisis is definitely on the
minds of investors, a PaineWebber and Gallup survey discovered. About
44% of those polled see it as part of a larger energy problem that could
affect the rest of the country, and 90% believe California's problems
will affect the rest of the country. PaineWebber's Chief Fixed Income
Strategist Michael Ryan said although other criteria are more important
in influencing one's investment-making decisions, in the current
climate, these sentiments obviously give investors reason to pause
before making an investment choice. (CCC)



11:48 (Dow Jones) Stocks attempting to rebound, but volatile. Hey,
maybe it has something to do with the Fed. Talk seems to be heating up
that central bankers are going to pull the trigger on an ease later
today. Do you think Bush might appreciate that as he goes on the tube
for his first big speech tonight? Then Greenspan can explain to us what
has changed so much from two weeks ago when he speaks tomorrow.
Anyway...The technicians say stocks are oversold, but maybe not ready to
break out completely, while argument for 2H recovery is fading, with or
without Fed help. DJIA up 35 at 10675, Nasdaq drops 30 to 2278, and S&P
500 adds 3 to 1270. (TG)



11:43 (Dow Jones) A nice NYSE debut from CNOOC Ltd. (CEO), the
overseas listing of China National Offshore Oil Co. ADRs are up 6.4% on
their first day of trading, roughly a week after the company raised more
than $1 billion in an IPO led by Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First
Boston, and BOC International. (RJH)



11:28 (Dow Jones) 3Com (COMS) appears "challenged" to meet analysts'
views for its fiscal 3Q ending Wednesday, says JPMorgan H&Q analyst Erik
Suppiger. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus predicts the
network equipment maker will lose 14 cents a share. Suppiger originally
predicted revenue of $740 million, but he notes that markets for several
3Com product lines are weak. 3Com shares trade at roughly one time
projected revenues for calender 2001. That seems low, but Suppiger is
cautious and maintains his market perform rating. (PDL)



11:24 (Dow Jones) If the Fed moves, it will likely do so by early
afternoon today, says a notable chorus of Wall Streeters. The Fed has
the confidence data and it likely has a good indication of Thursday's
NAPM already. Moving Wednesday steps into a political minefield because
of Greenspan's Congressional visit. That leaves today as the best
opportunity to move, and pricing in swaps and mortgages, and Treasury
bills reflect this sentiment. (MSD)



11:21 (Dow Jones) Frontier Airlines (FRNT) down sharply after having
broken a string of quarters of earnings growth with a profit warning.
The regional carrier's net will grow only 5% in March, and one analyst
believes the slowdown will continue for two more quarters. Frontier's
results will look particularly bad if compared with last summer's, the
analyst said, when Frontier picked up traffic from United Airlines
(UAL), which was having labor problems. (ELM)

Rauscher downgraded the shares, despite a slightly higher fiscal 2002
forecast from Niku. (MM)



12:15 (Dow Jones) Broadcom (BRCM), Cisco (CSCO) and JDS Uniphase
(JDSU) are among high profile tech stocks trading "on a plane curve
formed by the intersection of the right circular cone and a plan
parallel to an element of the cone," one market strategist said. The
parabolic formation may end up being a positive, said Mark Minervini,
president of Quantech Research Group, because in times past the pattern
has culminated with a crescendo of selling. "Such an ugly finish should
be welcome," Minervini said. "It ought to shatter the complacent move
overhanging the market and allow the Nasdaq to put in its final low."
(KJT)



12:03 (Dow Jones) National Assn. of Manufacturers Pres. Jasinowski
says "the simple implication to be drawn from today's (durable goods)
report is that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by one-half
a point immediately." (JC)



11:54 (Dow Jones) The California energy crisis is definitely on the
minds of investors, a PaineWebber and Gallup survey discovered. About
44% of those polled see it as part of a larger energy problem that could
affect the rest of the country, and 90% believe California's problems
will affect the rest of the country. PaineWebber's Chief Fixed Income
Strategist Michael Ryan said although other criteria are more important
in influencing one's investment-making decisions, in the current
climate, these sentiments obviously give investors reason to pause
before making an investment choice. (CCC)



11:48 (Dow Jones) Stocks attempting to rebound, but volatile. Hey,
maybe it has something to do with the Fed. Talk seems to be heating up
that central bankers are going to pull the trigger on an ease later
today. Do you think Bush might appreciate that as he goes on the tube
for his first big speech tonight? Then Greenspan can explain to us what
has changed so much from two weeks ago when he speaks tomorrow.
Anyway...The technicians say stocks are oversold, but maybe not ready to
break out completely, while argument for 2H recovery is fading, with or
without Fed help. DJIA up 35 at 10675, Nasdaq drops 30 to 2278, and S&P
500 adds 3 to 1270. (TG)



11:43 (Dow Jones) A nice NYSE debut from CNOOC Ltd. (CEO), the
overseas listing of China National Offshore Oil Co. ADRs are up 6.4% on
their first day of trading, roughly a week after the company raised more
than $1 billion in an IPO led by Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First
Boston, and BOC International. (RJH)



11:28 (Dow Jones) 3Com (COMS) appears "challenged" to meet analysts'
views for its fiscal 3Q ending Wednesday, says JPMorgan H&Q analyst Erik
Suppiger. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus predicts the
network equipment maker will lose 14 cents a share. Suppiger originally
predicted revenue of $740 million, but he notes that markets for several
3Com product lines are weak. 3Com shares trade at roughly one time
projected revenues for calender 2001. That seems low, but Suppiger is
cautious and maintains his market perform rating. (PDL)



11:24 (Dow Jones) If the Fed moves, it will likely do so by early
afternoon today, says a notable chorus of Wall Streeters. The Fed has
the confidence data and it likely has a good indication of Thursday's
NAPM already. Moving Wednesday steps into a political minefield because
of Greenspan's Congressional visit. That leaves today as the best
opportunity to move, and pricing in swaps and mortgages, and Treasury
bills reflect this sentiment. (MSD)



11:21 (Dow Jones) Frontier Airlines (FRNT) down sharply after having
broken a string of quarters of earnings growth with a profit warning.
The regional carrier's net will grow only 5% in March, and one analyst
believes the slowdown will continue for two more quarters. Frontier's
results will look particularly bad if compared with last summer's, the
analyst said, when Frontier picked up traffic from United Airlines
(UAL), which was having labor problems. (ELM)



11:17 (Dow Jones) Day One of the CBOE's move to trade QQQ, or Nasdaq
100 Trust, options and already they are dominating early action at the
Chicago exchange. In first trading hour, the QQQ options were the most
active at the CBOE, trading 8,170 contracts of the out-of-the-money
March 55 calls and 4,250 contracts of the April 55 calls, as the Nasdaq
dips. The QQQ options also were active at the Amex, trading more than
3,683 contracts of the March 55 calls and 2,882 contracts of the March
50 calls. (KXT)



11:12 (Dow Jones) It's not a good day to be in Nike's (NKE) shoes.
Investors are running from it and other shoe makers after its late
Monday warning that implementation problems with a supply and demand
planning system will push its fiscal 3Q earnings and revenue below
forecast. But Wells Fargo Van Kasper analyst John Shanley expects Nike's
woes to fill the coffers of Venator Group (Z) and Footstar (FTS). Reebok
(RBK), K-Swiss (KSWS), New Balance and others should also benefit from
Nike's waning market share, he says. (HHH)



10:59 (Dow Jones) S&P says Freddie Mac's (FRE) inherent credit
quality, without assuming an infusion of cash from the Federal
government, means it gets an AA- "risk to the government credit rating."
One analyst responds immediately by saying "that's really bad news."
Shares flat. (RGB)



10:54 (Dow Jones) Harris Corp. (HRS) falls 10% on disappointing
revenue and earnings outlook for fiscal year '01. Cites slowdown in
telecom market. Adams, Harkness & Hill sees investors taking
"wait-and-see stance on the shares, compressing the valuation." (AF)



10:48 (Dow Jones) Business outside the U.S. is no longer a safety net
for DoubleClick (DCLK), say Goldman Sachs analysts. In the 2H of last
year, the online advertising firm's weak domestic business was offset by
overseas growth. But "in recent months, international media sales have
slowed dramatically and we believe that DCLK is faced with overcapacity
in various regions abroad," the analysts wrote. The slowdown is one
reason Goldman cut its 2001 revenue estimate to $529.9 million from
$555.1 million. The call for 5% revenue growth from 2000 is beneath the
company's most recent guidance of 6% to 12%. (PDL)



10:44 (Dow Jones) Harsh weather will chill many February restaurant
sales figures, but Deutsche Banc's John Glass says investors shouldn't
over-react. February is the slowest month for many chains, the analyst
notes. He remains bullish on the category, saying the industry's
relative stability "represents a haven in the current market." (RLG)



10:39 (Dow Jones) Lowe's Cos.' (LOW) expansion plans, which were
announced Monday, will be a positive for Valspar Corp. (VAL), said
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Gil Yang. As the Minneapolis paint-maker's
biggest customer, Lowe's accounts for 7% of Valspar's revenue, Yang
estimates. He expects the store expansion to boost Valspar's annual
revenue by $30 million. (CCC)



10:34 (Dow Jones) With Bear Stearns leading the Fed early-rate-cut
charge, Lehman Brothers is upping its bet the Fed will move early to
60%, from 40% on Monday. They're blaming it on the confidence data.
(MSD)



10:32 (Dow Jones) More caution on business-to-business and enterprise
software companies - this time from Goldman Sachs. The company's tech
group is cutting its software-company revenue estimates for 2001 by 1%
to 10%, citing deteriorating economic conditions. The analysts expect
the lower revenues to be primarily focused in the last three quarters of
the year. The Goldman call, combined with a similar one from Banc of
America Securities, is pressuring software stocks Tuesday. (RS)



10:28 (Dow Jones) Knight Trading Group (NITE) has been pre-allocated
the lead market-maker role for options of the QQQ, or Nasdaq 100 Trust,
at the Pacific Exchange, an exchange spokesman confirmed. (KXT)

overseas growth. But "in recent months, international media sales have
slowed dramatically and we believe that DCLK is faced with overcapacity
in various regions abroad," the analysts wrote. The slowdown is one
reason Goldman cut its 2001 revenue estimate to $529.9 million from

11:28 (Dow Jones) 3Com (COMS) appears "challenged" to meet analysts'
views for its fiscal 3Q ending Wednesday, says JPMorgan H&Q analyst Erik
Suppiger. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus predicts the
network equipment maker will lose 14 cents a share. Suppiger originally
predicted revenue of $740 million, but he notes that markets for several
3Com product lines are weak. 3Com shares trade at roughly one time
projected revenues for calender 2001. That seems low, but Suppiger is
cautious and maintains his market perform rating. (PDL)



11:24 (Dow Jones) If the Fed moves, it will likely do so by early
afternoon today, says a notable chorus of Wall Streeters. The Fed has
the confidence data and it likely has a good indication of Thursday's
NAPM already. Moving Wednesday steps into a political minefield because
of Greenspan's Congressional visit. That leaves today as the best
opportunity to move, and pricing in swaps and mortgages, and Treasury
bills reflect this sentiment. (MSD)



11:21 (Dow Jones) Frontier Airlines (FRNT) down sharply after having
broken a string of quarters of earnings growth with a profit warning.
The regional carrier's net will grow only 5% in March, and one analyst
believes the slowdown will continue for two more quarters. Frontier's
results will look particularly bad if compared with last summer's, the
analyst said, when Frontier picked up traffic from United Airlines
(UAL), which was having labor problems. (ELM)



11:17 (Dow Jones) Day One of the CBOE's move to trade QQQ, or Nasdaq
100 Trust, options and already they are dominating early action at the
Chicago exchange. In first trading hour, the QQQ options were the most
active at the CBOE, trading 8,170 contracts of the out-of-the-money
March 55 calls and 4,250 contracts of the April 55 calls, as the Nasdaq
dips. The QQQ options also were active at the Amex, trading more than
3,683 contracts of the March 55 calls and 2,882 contracts of the March
50 calls. (KXT)



11:12 (Dow Jones) It's not a good day to be in Nike's (NKE) shoes.
Investors are running from it and other shoe makers after its late
Monday warning that implementation problems with a supply and demand
planning system will push its fiscal 3Q earnings and revenue below
forecast. But Wells Fargo Van Kasper analyst John Shanley expects Nike's
woes to fill the coffers of Venator Group (Z) and Footstar (FTS). Reebok
(RBK), K-Swiss (KSWS), New Balance and others should also benefit from
Nike's waning market share, he says. (HHH)

contraction. Merrill Lynch economist Mary Dennis puts odds of Fed rate
cut today at 50/50, citing fall in consumer confidence and weakening
trend in stock market. (BB)



10:22 (Dow Jones) In case people wonder why AOL and Time Warner
merged, Jupiter Media says AOL Time Warner (AOL) properties account for
a third of all time spent on-line in January. Together, the company's
Web properties have a home penetration rate of 72.3%, Jupiter says.
(RJH)



10:17 (Dow Jones) Fall in consumer confidence index to 106.8 hints
strongly at slowing, even fall in, consumer spending, says High
Frequency Economics. "It now seems appropriate to start thinking about a
Fed funds rate as low as 4% by the summer." (JMG)



10:15 (Dow Jones) Analysts at Banc of America are lowering their
revenue estimates on a slew of big software companies. They cite the
economic slowdown and its effect on the Global 1000 companies, which are
big buyers of enterprise and business-to-business software. The analysts
are lowering coverage-wide revenue estimates for 2001-2002 by about 5%
to 10%. Companies covered include Ariba Inc. (ARBA), Commerce One Inc.

10:09 (Dow Jones) 8.4% of confidence survey respondents expect to buy
an auto in the next 6 months, the highest since October. Those expecting
to buy a home rose to 3.8%, highest since August. Suggests that falling
interest rates are boosting rate-sensitive sectors of the economy. (BB)



10:08 (Dow Jones) Stocks rallied a bit right after data, but it looks
like market coming to grips with fact confidence and housing don't
really point to early ease. DJIA off 69 at 10573, Nasdaq drops 43 to
2265. (TG)



10:05 (Dow Jones) The confidence could quell talk of an inter-meeting
rate reduction. Data were weak, but present situation holding up, and
buying plans data signal resilient consumer. Data should give Fed enough
flexibility to wait until March 20 FOMC meeting to act on rates. (BB)



10:03 (Dow Jones) New home sales slump in January, falling 10.9% to a
921,000 annual rate. Still a strong pace but off of the record 1.034
million rate seen in December. Housing may be slowing, but it's not
falling off a cliff. (JN)



10:01 (Dow Jones) Conference Board's Consumer Confidence index fell
again in Feburary to 106.8 from 115.7 in January, its lowest level since
June 1996. The drop again was caused by an eroding expectations index,
which fell to 68.7 in February from 79.3 in January, its lowest level
since October 1993. Present situation also fell, but remains fairly
upbeat at 164.1 versus 170.4 in Feb. The moves were in line with
expectations, and the persistent strength in present conditions might
argue against inter-meeting rate cuts. (SV)

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

Stocks kicked off the week with a rally, as investors anticipate more interest rate cuts from the Fed, possibly as early as this week. The Dow rocketed 200 points; the NASDAQ was a distant second, though, with a gain of 46. The retailers provided the fuel for this latest rally on the belief that more rate cuts will spur consumer spending.

RETAIL RALLY   

Lowe's (LTR)  Home Depot(HD)  Walmart(WMT) up 4.33 up 3.74 up .79 to 58.91 to 43.75 to 51.07   

CHRISTOFOROUS:  Lowe's soared 4 percent. The number two home improvement chain said earnings will beat the street.  Home Depot and  Wal-Mart followed suit.   

Here at the NASDAQ, shares of  Microsoft rallied nearly 5 percent. The company began an appeals court hearing, the software giant's effort to reverse a federal judge's ruling that it was a scofflaw monopolist and should be split in two. Many investors are confident that the court of appeals will overturn that breakup order for  Microsoft.

Shares of  3Com up better than 5 percent. The networking giant will fire 1200 people, that's about 13 percent of its work force, as it tries to regain profitability.   

The stock you'll want to watch in the coming session,  eToys, down 25 percent. It was halted in after-hours trading. EToys will be delisted from the NASDAQ. It is also filing for bankruptcy, and  eToys plans to shut down its etoys.com Web site in early March.

Procter & Gamble (PG)   

down 3.92 to 71.11   

CHRISTOFOROUS: Now  Procter & Gamble didn't participate in the latest rally after the consumer products giant said economic problems in Turkey will hurt its second half earnings.

down 1.00 to 29.15   

CHRISTOFOROUS: And  Texas Instruments says the economic downturn will force sales to drop 20 percent in its fourth quarter.

NEW YORK -- Buyers took back control of Wall Street Monday on a bet that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates before its March 20 meeting.

Blue chips soared and technology issues recorded more modest gains as the market temporarily set aside worries about the economy. The advance gained momentum after former Fed governor Wayne Angell, now a Bear Stearns economist, expressed optimism that such a rate cut would indeed occur.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 200.63 at 10,642.53. The 1.9 percent gain represented the Dow's biggest one-day point increase since Jan. 3, when it rose 299 points.

The Nasdaq composite index advanced 45.99 to 2,308.50, a 2.0 percent increase, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 21.79 at 1,267.65, or 1.8 percent.

``The market has some hope that the Fed might move this week,'' said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates. ``The second thing happening here is that I think the market was really oversold. You tend to get a snapback after that.''

The advances contrasted sharply with last week's string of losses, in which the major indexes tumbled on profit warnings and pessimism about the economy. Analysts said there was renewed talk on Wall Street that the Fed, which has cut interest rates twice this year, would do so again before its next regularly scheduled meeting.

Some market observers now believe the Fed will take that unusual step because of significant declines in the stock market -- the Nasdaq hit a two-year low last week -- and recent economic data showing consumer confidence lagging.

The market was cheered by news reports that Angell now puts the chance of a rate cut this week at 80 percent. On Friday, the market rose when he expressed similar, but not as bullish, sentiments.

``The more the Fed cuts rates, the more it should help the economy,'' said Robert Harrington, head of equity trading at UBS Warburg. ``There's usually a lag of 3 to 6 months before the effect of a rate cut is felt, but it still gives people comfort that the economy will turn around this year. Things have been pretty pessimistic recently.''

Analysts said Wall Street was looking ahead optimistically to consumer confidence numbers due today, and a scheduled appearance by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan before Congress on Wednesday.

The Dow got a boost from Home Depot, up $3.74 at $43.75, and Merck, which rose $2.25 to $79.33. DuPont rose $2.49 to $44.52.

But the blue-chip gains were limited by a profit warning from consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble, which fell $3.92 to $71.11 after lowering its outlook for the second half of fiscal 2001 because of the financial crisis and currency devaluation in Turkey.

Intel was off 44 cents at $29.50, as was PMC-Sierra, down $5.38 at $44.56.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.11 billion shares, down from 1.23 billion Friday.

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX index rose 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent and France's CAC-40 gained 1.7 percent.

 THE Nasdaq Composite Index was up 45.98 at 2,308.49. Among the top tech shares, internet gear giant Cisco Systems was down 1-1/16 at 25-15/16. No. 1 chip maker Intel fell 12/16 to 29-3/16. 

 Software maker Microsoft rose 2-1/2 to 59-1/4 as a court began hearing of the company's appeal of the antitrust ruling against it. 

 The S&P computer software index rose 2.9 per cent, reflecting gains by other sectoral names including Veritas Software, up 3-5/16 at 65-11/16. 

 The latest guidance from Texas Instruments follows a profit warning from Motorola, the world's No. 2 maker of mobile phone handsets, and network computing giant Sun Microsystems, which had helped send the battered Nasdaq lower on Friday, before the market staged a dramatic rebound. 

 But the Nasdaq market's performance was mixed, and strength in the biotechnology sector helped push the composite higher. Genetic analysis companies lead the way with a 10 per cent climb at Human Genome Sciences and an eight per cent rise in shares of Genzyme General.

 WSJ.COM: UK Domain-Name Registrars Scramble For Business 

 By Karen Chan

Dow Jones International News

 WSJ.com 

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- If you've spent the past year watching Internet startups crash and burn, spare a thought for those who put the ".com" into dot-coms. 

 Over the past year, domain-name service companies in the United Kingdom have suffered a double whammy as the demand from the startups they were supplying dried up abruptly, while their own dot-com tag hurt their standing with investors. 

 But as the weaker firms fold, market leaders are pursuing plans to open up a corporate market for brand-name protection on the Internet as a way of keeping afloat. Their plans may be given a boost by the creation of seven new top-level domains this year - including ".info" and ".biz" - the possibility of ".eu" being created, and the growth of the domain-name business in foreign languages, like Chinese. 

 The question is whether they can convince shareholders to believe in their potential once again. 

 "The market has been frightened off by the fall off in demand for domain-name registration services. We've patiently set out our stall, but no one will be our friend until they have confidence in the new services," said Jonathan Robinson, chief executive of NetBenefit PLC. "We've just got to battle it out for the moment." 

 Robinson watched his company's share price plunge 97% to a low of 73.5 pence a share earlier this month, from their high in March last year. NetBenefit's main competitor, Virtual Internet PLC, has fared only slightly better - its share price has fallen 91% from a February 2000 high to its current price of 85 pence a share. 

 Investors turned a cold shoulder on domain-name service companies after the bottom dropped out of the market in the second quarter of last year. In January 2001 monthly registrations of ".co.uk" domain names dropped to 70,000, down 50% from the 140,000 registrations-a-month of a year earlier. 

 The boom, which peaked around March 2000, attracted many to the space. Estimates of the actual number of domain-name service providers vary widely but indicate that in the U.K. indicate there could be as many as 2,000. 

 Overpopulation of the sector led to some very cheap prices. Some registrars even give away names for free in an attempt to secure customers for other services, so it isn't surprising that many smaller companies are now feeling the pinch. Six or seven failures have made it into the press in the last couple of months, with companies like Webnetics.co.uk, and JustNames.co.uk folding, but the true number is likely to be much larger. 

 "This industry has low barriers to entry ... We're now seeing some fallout as a result. I'm aware of three or four (failures) recently, like Namesonthenet and Net90," said Lesley Cowley, operations director at Nominet, the nonprofit registry that administers the dot-uk domain. 

 In some cases, customers have had an unpleasant surprise. Nominet has been contacted by people who found they didn't own domain names they had paid registrars for, according to Cowley. 

 "There have been instances of that. We were hugely unimpressed," said Cowley. Even if a domain has been registered, if the service provider fails and the servers hosting the name are turned off, it won't work. In that instance customers can contact another provider and ask them to transfer the registration. 

 "We're getting about 200 to 300 calls a week on transferring (domain names). It's staggering," said Steve Procter, chief executive of U.K. domain-name reseller Easily. "We now have one person on our help desk dedicated to doing such transfers." Proctor said the calls started in the fourth quarter of last year and haven't stopped. "It's bringing the industry into disrepute. We're here for the long term and so are a few others and these fly-by-nights aren't doing the industry any favors," he said. 

 The confusion may help more established companies, as buyers seek reputable service providers. But leaders like NetBenefit and Virtual Internet aren't concerned with the vagaries of the retail market - they're pursuing the corporate dollar. 

 Tom Turcan, Virtual Internet's chief operating officer and head of its brand-protection division, said firms can pay his company hundreds of thousands of dollars to protect their names on the Web. "Their brands are often multimillion dollar investments so this is extremely important to them," he said. "We've seen no fall off in activity at all," he added. 

 Brand protection involves much more than simply registering the domain names customers request. Turcan said Virtual Internet's first step is to conduct an audit of the names a company holds, then it works with company representatives to advise them on what to buy and where to get it. 

 "It's very easy to get wrong, you can miss countries where infringement is easy, or use the wrong registrars," he said. Virtual Internet purchases new names and pursues infringements, then settles into watching mode, providing monthly reports on the status of names the company is concerned with, and consolidating small bills from foreign registrars into a single bill. 

 With more than 35 million domain names registered worldwide, in more than 200 countries, it's not an easy job. It's about to get harder - which could prove a boon to the domain companies. 

 The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, the U.S. body which manages the domain-name system, has approved seven new top-level domains: ".info," ".biz," ".name," ".pro," ".coop," ".aero" and ".museum." Those are expected to emerge later this year. 

 "I think they will reawaken interest in the industry. When all the news stories first broke, we saw an increase in dot-uk registrations, because it reminded people to get around to it," said Nominet's Cowley. 

 "They're generating a lot of interest from the point of view of brand protection. Many of our clients are concerned that cybersquatters will be able to do it all over again," said Turcan, referring to the practice of registering the domain names of well-known companies in order to ransom them back, or to divert potential customers to a competitor. 

 NetBenefit's Robinson is more cautious. "The new domain names coming online will heighten the need of corporates for proper management of domain names ... but to us it's the icing on the cake. We aren't setting great store by it," said Robinson, who says the company sees new domains as a "speculative" revenue stream. 

 Both Virtual Internet and NetBenefit have stakes in registries set up to administer the new domains. 

 More may be created in the future. In December last year, the European Commission proposed to the European Parliament a dot-eu registry. While some believe such a registry could be formed this year, others are more conservative. "Don't hold your breath for dot-eu. I think it may be some time," said Cowley. "How do you deal with a French company which uses the same trademark for a washing machine as a U.K. company? They have yet to get their heads around that. There are big issues across Europe." 

 Turcan says new registries for domain names in languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, may provide even more of an impetus to the market. But disputes over who should establish those registries, with rivals set up by U.S. company VeriSign Inc.'s Network Solutions unit and the Chinese government, among others, have created confusion for companies wanting to protect their brands in key markets. 

 "Corporates might feel like they've registered their name, when they haven't ... it's terribly confusing, but this is exactly the kind of area where large corporates come to us," said Toucan, who added that there are now three competing Chinese-language registries. 

 After the turbulence seen in the past year, however, it's not clear that even a promising new market will attract support. 

 "Deliverability has become more important than anything else," said Lisa Woodfin, an analyst with U.K. investment bank Granville Baird. "Any promise technology companies make, people don't believe anymore. Even if they don't lie to you, they often over-egg the pudding." While she said there may be some upside to the creation of new domains, she says it is "risky" to count on that revenue. 

 Of the two U.K. leaders, Woodfin favors Virtual Internet because she believes it now derives nearly half its revenue from corporate brand-protection services, and it has a stronger cash position. The company says it has GBP19 million in the bank, enough to see it through to profitability in the year ending November 2002. 

 NetBenefit has some ground to make up with investors after a November profit warning, caused by overexposure to the weakness in the U.K. market. At that time it had just over GBP4 million of cash left. 

 When its share price was strong, the company saw itself as the market consolidator, Robinson said. Now, he won't rule out a role reversal. "We would have an open mind. Whatever makes the best commercial sense," he said. 

 "They'll be finding it tough at the moment ... a lot will depend on how successful they are in reorienting their businesses toward these value-added services," said Louise Barton, an analyst with Beeson Gregory.

(TG)



2:04 (Dow Jones) Stocks pulling back. No word from Fed yet, and
feeling among many was that move, if it was going to happen, would take
place this afternoon. It will be interesting to see how stocks react
through the session the longer we go without an ease. Of course, there's
nothing to say it can't happen tomorrow, or Thursday, or Friday. Of
course, there's nothing to say it will happen at all. Ferguson comments
don't help. DJIA down 24 at 10617 and Nasdaq falls 66 to 2241. (TG)



1:44 (Dow Jones) March Nasdaq volatile as players construe as negative
Fed Vice Chair Ferguson's recently issued prepared remarks, in which he
didn't give any signal on early rate ease and said spending continues
despite flagging consumer confidence, one floor trader said. Cash
markets soft too: DJIA down 8 at 10634, Nasdaq off 54 at 2254. (ZHS/TG)



1:39 (Dow Jones) Credit Suisse First Boston cut its 4Q cash revenue
and adjusted EBITDA estimates for 360networks (TSIX), a day before the
network builder and operator is scheduled to release its 4Q results.
Credit Suisse analyst Ehud Gelblum cut his cash revenue estimate to $175
million from $213 million and his adjusted EBITDA estimate to $81
million from $131 million. Shares down about 7.19% at $9.28. (BED)



1:31 (Dow Jones) Fed vice chair Ferguson noting that falling
confidence not translating into spending. "A somewhat puzzling feature
of the recent period has been that, despite the sharp weakening in
sentiment, household spending appears thus far to have held up well."
Remarks suggest Fed may not be too impressed by confidence drop and may
need to see more evidence of weakness to cut rates before March 20. (BB)



1:20 (Dow Jones) Fed Governor Ferguson doesn't give any clear signals
in his New York speech. He notes that downside economic risk remains,
but reminds that consumer spending is holding up despite lower
confidence and that oil prices should fall, lowering the inflation
threat. All in all, not a screaming signal of a intra-meeting rate cut,
but not enough to dissuade the market from believing in a intra-meeting
cut. (SV)



1:16 (Dow Jones) Bear Stearns recommends buying a basket of busted
semiconductor converts, since the sector has been sold off with "new
economy" names, but isn't plagued by the same credit problems. Investors
may want to wait until prices reach November's lows, however, Bear
Stearns says. (RTB)



1:05 (Dow Jones) Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards,
might be offering up his own version of the Rudyard Kipling poem "If,"
which begins: "If you can keep your head when all about you ...."
Goldman's version is "When," asking when will investors "look beyond the
current valley of depressing news to the positive peaks that lie ahead,"
and "when will owning stocks be fun again." Goldman concludes the good
times will return sooner rather than later and urges investors to get in
ahead of the upswing. (KJT)



12:53 (Dow Jones) News that Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) received
grand-jury subpoenas late last year and is cooperating with the federal
investigation into the marketing of its anticancer drugs and other
products surprised the Street. Despite a few large block trades,
investors and analysts are reserving jugdment until further information
is known. Based on current knowledge, analysts don't anticipate any
meaningful hit. Shares fell 2.6%. (BMM)



12:48 (Dow Jones) Remember when inflation talk included gold? The
Comex's leading April contract, now around $268, is good to go to
$273.30. That depends on whether $266.10 support holds on a daily
closing basis. Tuesday's intraday low is $266.50. (SC)



12:35 (Dow Jones) RadioShack Corp. (RSH) can reach more consumers and
establish itself as the top seller of Direct TV satellite television
services through its alliance with Blockbuster Inc. (BBI), said
Jefferies & Co. analyst Donald Trott. The deal would initially put
RadioShack store-within-a-store in 130 Blockbuster stores, with the
potential for 5,000 stores going forward, Trott said. (DDO)



12:25 (Dow Jones) Shares of California concern Niku (NIKU) - not to be
confused with the equally ailing Nike - were off 35% Monday when the
services revenue management company revealed its Days Sales Outstanding
spiked 42 days sequentially to 132 days and CFO Mark Nelson announced he
was stepping down to spend time with his family. Goldman Sachs and Dain
Rauscher downgraded the shares, despite a slightly higher fiscal 2002
forecast from Niku. (MM)



12:15 (Dow Jones) Broadcom (BRCM), Cisco (CSCO) and JDS Uniphase
(JDSU) are among high profile tech stocks trading "on a plane curve
formed by the intersection of the right circular cone and a plan
parallel to an element of the cone," one market strategist said. The
parabolic formation may end up being a positive, said Mark Minervini,
president of Quantech Research Group, because in times past the pattern
has culminated with a crescendo of selling. "Such an ugly finish should
be welcome," Minervini said. "It ought to shatter the complacent move
overhanging the market and allow the Nasdaq to put in its final low."
(KJT)



12:03 (Dow Jones) National Assn. of Manufacturers Pres. Jasinowski
says "the simple implication to be drawn from today's (durable goods)
report is that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates by one-half
a point immediately." (JC)



11:54 (Dow Jones) The California energy crisis is definitely on the
minds of investors, a PaineWebber and Gallup survey discovered. About
44% of those polled see it as part of a larger energy problem that could
affect the rest of the country, and 90% believe California's problems
will affect the rest of the country. PaineWebber's Chief Fixed Income
Strategist Michael Ryan said although other criteria are more important
in influencing one's investment-making decisions, in the current
climate, these sentiments obviously give investors reason to pause
before making an investment choice. (CCC)



11:48 (Dow Jones) Stocks attempting to rebound, but volatile. Hey,
maybe it has something to do with the Fed. Talk seems to be heating up
that central bankers are going to pull the trigger on an ease later
today. Do you think Bush might appreciate that as he goes on the tube
for his first big speech tonight? Then Greenspan can explain to us what
has changed so much from two weeks ago when he speaks tomorrow.
Anyway...The technicians say stocks are oversold, but maybe not ready to
break out completely, while argument for 2H recovery is fading, with or
without Fed help. DJIA up 35 at 10675, Nasdaq drops 30 to 2278, and S&P
500 adds 3 to 1270. (TG)



11:43 (Dow Jones) A nice NYSE debut from CNOOC Ltd. (CEO), the
overseas listing of China National Offshore Oil Co. ADRs are up 6.4% on
their first day of trading, roughly a week after the company raised more
than $1 billion in an IPO led by Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First
Boston, and BOC International. (RJH)



11:28 (Dow Jones) 3Com (COMS) appears "challenged" to meet analysts'
views for its fiscal 3Q ending Wednesday, says JPMorgan H&Q analyst Erik
Suppiger. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus predicts the
network equipment maker will lose 14 cents a share. Suppiger originally
predicted revenue of $740 million, but he notes that markets for several
3Com product lines are weak. 3Com shares trade at roughly one time
projected revenues for calender 2001. That seems low, but Suppiger is
cautious and maintains his market perform rating. (PDL)



11:24 (Dow Jones) If the Fed moves, it will likely do so by early
afternoon today, says a notable chorus of Wall Streeters. The Fed has
the confidence data and it likely has a good indication of Thursday's
NAPM already. Moving Wednesday steps into a political minefield because
of Greenspan's Congressional visit. That leaves today as the best
opportunity to move, and pricing in swaps and mortgages, and Treasury
bills reflect this sentiment. (MSD)



11:21 (Dow Jones) Frontier Airlines (FRNT) down sharply after having
broken a string of quarters of earnings growth with a profit warning.
The regional carrier's net will grow only 5% in March, and one analyst
believes the slowdown will continue for two more quarters. Frontier's
results will look particularly bad if compared with last summer's, the
analyst said, when Frontier picked up traffic from United Airlines
(UAL), which was having labor problems. (ELM)

 U.S. stocks seen up at open despite latest warnings.

 NEW YORK, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Stocks are seen opening higher on Monday as investors, apparently unfazed by the latest corporate warnings, bet on an interest-rate cut soon from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

 "We have been selling without relent for days on end, so at some point in time the market will come up for air. I think today is that day...," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "The opening should be strong". 

 Texas Instruments Inc., the No. 1 maker of computer chips for mobile phones, on Monday cut its revenue outlook for the first quarter - a month after it had already lowered guidance - saying the U.S. economic slowdown was constraining demand. 

 Another warning came from consumer products maker Procter & Gamble Co. which said its 2001 second-half earnings would be lower than previously forecast due to the impact of the Turkish financial crisis and devaluation of the Turkish lira. 

 PG's shares fell to $72 in pre-market trade, down sharply from a Friday close at $75.03, and TI's fell to $29 from a Friday close at $30.15, and both could pressure sectoral issues. But a host of other stocks, including recently battered technology issues were inching higher in the pre-market. 

 Based on pre-open gains in the Nasdaq 100 index of the tech-laden market's largest stocks, the index is set to open the day with a rise of about 31 points, or 1.50 percent. 

 Less than an hour from the open, March Nasdaq 100 futures were trading 46.50 points up at 2,104 while S&P 500 front month futures were up 8 points at 1,255.50, suggesting a firm open for the tech sector and a positive start for the broad market. 

 March Dow Jones industrial average futures were up 30 points at 10,495, pointing to a higher open for blue-chips. 

 "The futures were higher and stayed higher (after the Texas Instruments news) so at least in the early going we are going to have a bit of a rebound," Hogan said. 

 Among the top tech shares, Internet gear giant Cisco Systems Inc. firmed to $27-3/8 in pre-open trade from a $27 close on Friday. No. 1 chip maker Intel Corp rose to $30-3/8 from a close at $29-151/6. Other early gains included wireless technology company Qualcomm Inc and network computing giant Sun Microsystems. 

 Software maker Microsoft Corp. rose to $57-1/4 from a $56-3/4 Friday close ahead of the start of an appeals court hearing of the company's appeal of the antitrust ruling against it. 

 The new, lower guidance from Texas Instruments follows a profit warning on Friday from Motorola Inc., the world's No. 2 maker of mobile phone handsets, which said it was operating in a "recession of confidence." 

 The Motorola warning, and another one from Sun Micros???ms, had helped send the battered Nasdaq lower in early trade Friday, before the market staged a dramatic late rebound as investors grew optimistic that further Fed rate cuts are around the corner and could come as early as this week. 

 On Friday, the Nasdaq composite index rebounded from a two-year low to finish up 0.78 percent at 2,262.49. 

 A comment by Bear Stearns' chief economist and former Fed governor Wayne Angell that there was a 60 percent chance that the U.S. central bank would cut interest rates by a half a percentage point early next week helped spur the Nasdaq's comeback, traders said. 

 The Fed cut rates by a full percentage point in January in an effort to keep the economy from tumbling into recession. Its next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for March 20, but investors have been hoping a rate cut would come sooner. 

 "The credible guess would be sometime after the payroll numbers (on Thursday)," said Jefferies' Hogan. 

 "Greenspan speaks to Congress on Wednesday, I don't know if he will go in there with a surprise cut already behind us, so that puts it off until Thursday or Friday. Why not wait until he sees the employment numbers at 8:30 on Thursday." 

 Big jumps in key inflation data recently have raised the possibility that the Fed may be less aggressive in making additional cuts. So Wall Street turns its attention to a full economic data calendar this week. 

 The slate carries January personal income and consumption numbers on Thursday, due to show an expected increase of 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, in addition to the February National Association of Purchasing Management's manufacturing survey, which is predicted to firm a bit to 41.5 from 41.2 in January. For the NAPM, a number below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing activity. 

 Starting off the flow of data will be existing home sales figures for January on Monday morning. The figure is expected to come in at 4.98 million, up from December's 4.87 million. 

 In corporate news, Lowe's Cos Inc., said on Monday its fourth-quarter profit fell about 5 percent, as expected, as heavy holiday promotions and flagging lumber prices negatively impacted results. But the world's No. 2 home improvement retailer raised earnings projections for 2001 and said it plans to open between 115 and 120 new stores during the year. 

 Lowe's shares closed at $54.58 on Friday. 

 Qwest Communications International Inc., the No. 4long distance telephone company, said on Monday it is on track to meet its target of 2001 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $8.5 billion to $8.7 billion, and its revenue targets of $21.3 billion to $21.7 billion.

RENAY SAN MIGUEL reporting:   

Here we are about to close the book on February, and investors are still wondering about this winter of discontent. The past week saw some technology heavyweights like  Sun Microsystems finally throw in the towel and surrender to the slowing economy. Yet those economic indicators that the government likes to throw out every week still aren't painting a true recessionary picture. And you've even got some former Federal Reserve officials saying they expect another rate cut soon.   

Let's start with last Friday. The Dow closed down nearly 87 points with financials, drugs, consumer and oil-related issues feeling the heat.

Dow Jones Industrials

NASDAQ   

up to 17.55 2,262.51   

SAN MIGUEL: Software issues suffered, but other tech sectors made a comeback. And here's why they had to come back:  Motorola warned that the economic downturn was responsible for the company not being able to meet 2001 earnings and revenue estimates.  Motorola doesn't just make phones. It makes chips for phones, so that hurt the semiconductor sector as well.

Motorola (MOT)   

down to 1.04 16.25   

SAN MIGUEL:  Sun Microsystems also made for an interesting Friday. The company blamed a slowing economy for an earnings warning. And what's worse, the company said it couldn't give true guidance about its next quarter. Despite all that, bargain hunters took over and the stock finished unchanged.   

More earnings on tap for the week, including  Walt Disney, Revlon, The Gap,  Perot Systems and  Intimate Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, will share the intimate details of its recent sales.   

Also on the agenda for the week, more economic indicators, like consumer confidence, durable goods orders and new home sales, all of that going into Alan Greenspan's computer when it comes time to decide on interest rates.

 Earnings may prove a drag despite Budget, Nasdaq.

 GOOD news number 1: Nasdaq on Friday managed to stem the recent selling tide that took it to a two-year low last week, suggesting that most of its pain may be behind it. Good news number 2: There should be a feel-good boost from Dr Richard Hu's Budget even though it didn't contain any concessions for financial services. 

 But the even better news is that fears of there being no more US rate cuts - something which was highlighted in this column last Monday - are probably unfounded, at least judging by what the bond and futures markets are saying. 

 The bad news? Local corporate earnings may disappoint. Already a handful of firms have started releasing mediocre earnings, notably OCBC on Friday. 

 So while there should be some positive impact on the market from a combination of overseas and local developments, any enthusiasm for local stocks could be reined in by below-par earnings. Indeed, it's this tug-of-war among Nasdaq-Budget-US interest rates-local earnings that will provide the dominant themes this week. 

 On the one hand we have a growing belief that at least for now, Nasdaq may have undergone a selling climax of sorts. After all, profit warning after profit warning sent it diving four consecutive sessions last week and this must eventually stop. People also seem to be asking themselves how much lower can prices go after almost six months of hammering. 

 Still, profits do seem to be a big worry on Wall Street. According to wire reports, Salomon Smith Barney cut its earnings forecast for IBM and triggered a 200-point plunge in the Dow Industrial at one stage before the index recovered to close on Friday with a net loss of 86.94 points at 10,439.87. 

 So sentiment in the US still seems to be quite fragile, especially if the profit warnings or downgrades are for big, well-known companies that perhaps were previously thought to be less vulnerable to the economic slowdown. 

 On the interest rate front, the release of higher-than-expected January US producer and consumer price numbers rekindled inflationary fires last week and called to question the conventional wisdom that interest rates will be cut by a lot more in the first half of this year. 

 However, what's probably happening is that we're seeing a one-off set of numbers, possible blips in a series of numbers that show no signs of inflation. 

 The US Treasury market also thinks so since bonds of all maturities rallied last week as money flowed out of stocks seeking safe havens. The yield on two-year notes, for instance, fell six basis points over last week to 4.53 per cent, the lowest since January 1999. 

 Meanwhile the yield on the 30-year bond fell four basis points to 5.49 per cent, bringing the gap between the two yields to 96 basis points - which according to Bloomberg Business News, is the widest since November 1998 and strongly suggests that the market expects more rate cuts soon. 

 The futures market also seems to share this view - the March federal funds contract saw its yield fall 15 basis points over the week to 5.2 per cent. Since the spot rate is 5.5 per cent the market is pricing in one more rate cut before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 20. 

 In the local market, analysts say the unexpected corporate tax cut announced in Friday's Budget should give a lift to earnings estimates and the across-the-board cuts in income tax rates will lift the mood of the man-in-the-street. Most, however, believe this lift to be quickly overshadowed by other concerns such as the state of the US economy and whether there will be more interest rate cuts. 

 A mildly positive start to the week then, tempered somewhat by unexciting corporate earnings, but with the consolation that Nasdaq may have bottomed. After that, it's anybody's guess.

 Stocks rally on speculation about possible interest rate cut

 NEW YORK (AP) - Buyers took back control of Wall Street Monday on a bet that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates before its March 20 meeting. 

 Blue chips soared and technology issues recorded more modest gains as the market temporarily set aside worries about the economy. The advance gained momentum after former Fed governor Wayne Angell, now a Bear Stearns economist, expressed optimism that such a rate cut would indeed occur. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 200.63 at 10,642.53. The 1.9 percent gain represented the Dow's biggest one-day point increase since Jan. 3, when it rose 299 points. 

 The Nasdaq composite index advanced 45.99 to 2,308.50, a 2.0 percent increase, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was up 21.79 at 1,267.65, or 1.8 percent. 

 "The market has some hope that the Fed might move this week," said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates. "The second thing happening here is that I think the market was really oversold. You tend to get a snapback after that." 

 The advances contrasted sharply with last week's string of losses, in which the major indexes tumbled on profit warnings and pessimism about the economy. Analysts said there was renewed talk on Wall Street that the Fed, which has cut interest rates twice this year, would do so again before its next regularly scheduled meeting. 

 Some market observers now believe the Fed will take that unusual step because of significant declines in the stock market - the Nasdaq hit a two-year low last week - and recent economic data showing consumer confidence lagging. 

 In particular, the market was cheered by news reports that Angell now puts the chance of a rate cut this week at 80 percent. On Friday, the market rose when he expressed similar, but not as bullish, sentiments. 

 "The more the Fed cuts rates, the more it should help the economy," said Robert Harrington, head of equity trading at UBS Warburg. "There's usually a lag of 3 to 6 months before the effect of a rate cut is felt, but it still gives people comfort that the economy will turn around this year. Things have been pretty pessimistic recently." 

 Analysts said Wall Street was looking ahead optimistically to consumer confidence numbers due out Tuesday, and a scheduled appearance by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan before Congress on Wednesday. 

 The Dow got a boost from Home Depot, up $3.74 at $43.75, and Merck, which rose $2.25 to $79.33. DuPont rose $2.49 to $44.52. 

 But the blue chip gains were limited by a profit warning from consumer goods maker Procter & Gamble, which fell $3.92 to $71.11 after lowering its outlook for the second half of fiscal 2001 because of the financial crisis and currency devaluation in Turkey. 

 Technology stocks were mixed. Dow component Microsoft - which asked a federal appeals court Monday to reverse a lower judge's order to break up the company - gained $3.13 to $59.56. 

 But Intel was off 44 cents at $29.50, as was PMC-Sierra, down $5.38 at $44.56. 

 Also Monday, information services provider 3Com said it would cut 1,200 jobs because of soft market conditions. Its stock rose 47 cents to $9.50. 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.32 billion shares, down from 1.45 billion Friday. 

 The Russell 2000 index rose 10.86 to 488.31. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent. Germany's DAX index rose 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.5 percent and France's CAC-40 gained 1.7 percent.

 SMARTMONEY.COM: It's A Good Thing - Or Is It? 

 By Robert Hunter

24 February 2001

Dow Jones News Service
DJ

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- I'm only a casual follower of the New York rumor mill. But since SmartMoney.com moved into the same office building that houses Martha Stewart Omnimedia's (MSO) Internet unit, I've been privy to some choice inside-the-media gossip. 

 You've probably heard about the Connecticut neighbors who all but ran Martha out of town a while back, and the rumor that her own daughter refused to invite her to her wedding. But did you know that Martha has demanded that our building management let her drive her SUV onto a freight elevator and up to her floor, to avoid the scrum in the lobby? (I'm pretty sure that one's true.) Or that prospective employees are warned that Martha, at some point, will make them cry? (Sounds plausible enough.) I've  even heard that Martha once smothered a young child in a basil-infused b&#233;chamel sauce just to watch him die. (This one hasn't been verified, though it would explain her current fling with Anthony Hopkins.) 

 The fact is, people love to hate Martha. But because I  fancy myself a contrarian, I'm (somewhat) compelled to stick up for her. And I'll even throw a little support behind her company's stock, which got slapped across the face on Thursday like a dawdling hotel concierge. 

 On Wednesday, Martha Stewart Omnimedia (hereafter referred to as Martha since, really, what's the difference?) reported strong fourth-quarter results. Not only did earnings rise by 145% from the same period in 1999, but they beat the Street's estimates of 10 cents a share by two cents. By my calculations, that's a 20% difference, or four times Martha's restaurant-tipping percentage. (Allegedly.) 

 The biggest surprise was the publishing unit. The flagship Martha Stewart Living magazine saw a 33% ad page improvement, resulting in a 30% increase in publishing revenue over the fourth quarter of 1999, to $52.6 million.  It also saw a 38% increase in cash flow (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - the preferred metric for evaluating media companies), to $19.4  million. Martha's merchandising cash flow grew healthily,  too, to $5.4 million from $3.9 million, thanks to the launch last October of the Martha Stewart Everyday Kitchen  line at Kmart (KM). Those two units helped make up for the television division, which saw its cash flow fall 9% to $2.9 million, and the Internet group, whose losses increased by 19%, to $8.5 million. 

 So despite the bad news in some units, Martha did manage to pull off a pretty stunning profit surprise. Yet shares sunk 3.3% after the announcement on Wednesday, and another 11% on Thursday morning, before finishing the day down 6%. Why did the souffl&#233; cave in? Martha's financial lackeys warned that even though the publishing division had crushed expectations like an overripe tomato last quarter, the first quarter isn't looking nearly so juicy. Ad pages for the February issue were flat, and are down 15.5% in the March issue. (For the quarter, the company predicted a 10% fall.) The warning prompted several analysts to trim their full-year earnings expectations by around a nickel, and led to a downgrade by Credit Suisse First Boston to Hold from Buy - the chief cause of Thursday's big slide. 

 Such news isn't good for a company that derives nearly  60% of its revenues from publishing. But Thursday's selloff may have been a bit hasty. Martha Stewart is one of those Peter Lynchian buy-what-you-know stocks that retail investors flock to. (The stock is just 32% institutionally held.) What they're really buying is a piece of the Martha Stewart persona, which drives not only  magazine sales but merchandise profits as well. And those  profits are likely to grow strongly this year, since Martha's adding new categories in the spring (organizing knickknacks) and fall (home decorating products like lamps and picture frames). Not many media companies can boast an ancillary revenue stream like that. Moreover, the sale of wares in Kmart at low prices amounts to a pretty savvy countercyclical business strategy that some analysts think  can prop up the sagging publishing division until things turn around. 

 Martha's publishing empire isn't exactly decaying, either. This year, she'll publish 12 issues of Martha Stewart Living rather than 11 (forsaking a double issue in  the summertime, so forget those Hamptons beach houses this year, girls), and will increase the frequency of specialty magazine Martha Stewart Baby to four issues from  two. When the ad climate gets sunnier, she'll be in good position to capitalize. 

 Now, I'm not saying that Martha's stock isn't pricey. At Thursday's close, its price-to-cash-flow ratio of 26.8 was greater than the S&P 500 average of 21.3 - and greater  than that of most of its competitors, save News Corp. (NWS) - and its price-to-sales ratio of 3.6 was still larger than the S&P's 2.8. Moreover, in the short run, Martha's shares will probably suffer a lot of volatility, especially if the publishing climate remains soft. But this is an interesting company with a diversified revenue stream that's built to grow along with its founder's celebrity. 

 Be warned, however: Things could unravel in a hurry if  Martha starts buying products from Guatemalan sweat shops  or tries to clone herself or something. One major PR fiasco can weigh on a personality-driven stock like a botched Yorkshire pudding.

 Euro's recovery should help U.S. corp performance. 

 By Javier David 
830 words
23 February 2001
19:04
Reuters News
LBA
English

 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Big U.S. multinationals winced in 2000 when the euro's steep declines against the dollar hurt earnings, but the European single currency's recent recovery should help ease the pain this year - even as the U.S. economy slows. 

 Market analysts say that as long as the euro holds at or above 90 cents per dollar, any potential damage to 2001 first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings should be contained. 

 The euro's steep drop last year to a low of 82 cents had many large corporations with big stakes in Europe - such as Sara Lee Corp., Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., and McDonald's Corp. - grousing that the currency's weakness was hurting profits. 

 But the euro began a turnaround in November, rising to just below 96 cents in January before easing back to a 90-91 cents range in recent trading sessions. 

 Skip Carpenter, an analyst who tracks food and beverage companies for Credit Suisse First Boston, said that so long as the euro holds above 90 cents, a repeat performance of last year's sapped U.S. profit margins could be avoided. 

 "Based in terms of its current price, the euro will not be a negative impact on profitability for Coca Cola (Enterprises) at these current levels," Carpenter said. "I'm looking at that exchange rate to be somewhat neutral in terms of the earnings impact." 

 Back when the company made its profit warning, the euro was trading near its lows, Carpenter added. 

 While consumer demand overseas was boosting European revenues, converting that money back into dollars from a weakened currency meant that large multinationals "were getting the growth, but not the profits to go along with it," said Sean Callow, currency economist at Ideaglobal.com in New York. 

 Other firms also saw collateral damage from the euro's precipitous drop. For example, McDonald's said euro weakness helped shave a full 7 cents off its 2000 results, which came in at $1.46 per share. 

 The fast-food company has said it expects 2001 earnings to rise somewhere in the neighborhood of 10-13 percent, but that was before adjusting for foreign currency, underscoring the difficulty company treasurers have in gauging the impact of the euro's sudden rise and retracement on earnings. 

 Analysts say the euro's uneven performance - and the failure of many multinationals to accurately predict the currency's eventual recovery in 2000 - was a driving force behind corporate hesitancy to take more aggressive measures to protect earnings from currency volatility through hedging. 

 "When the euro's slide got particularly extended and hit all-time lows, it was just a little too much for the corporations active in Europe," said Callow. 

 90 CENT THRESHOLD KEY 

 The euro's recent turnaround will help U.S. multinationals, which already have been facing slowing U.S. economic growth over the past two quarters. 

 Ann Gurkin, an analyst at Davenport and Company in Richmond, Va., has forecast that while the euro at its current levels would still drag on the profits of some corporations active in Europe during 2001, the damage inflicted should be potentially less severe than in 2000. 

 For example, H.J. Heinz Co. - which derives 26 percent of its sales from Europe - told analysts in December that but for an anemic euro, its earnings per share would have been 17 cents higher in 2000. 

 But according to Gurkin's research, the rising value of the euro against the dollar should limit damage to Heinz's earnings in 2001 to 11 cents, provided the single currency cooperates and remains supported above or near the 90 cents watermark. 

 "While unfavorable currency translation might punish multinational companies, those same companies are rewarded when the trend reverses," said Gurkin. 

 SOME FIRMS HURT BY LACK OF HEDGING 

 Faulty hedging strategies last year may have played a role in last year's euro-related profit losses, a phenomenon which could be occurring now, analysts said. 

 In early 2000, many investment banks prematurely predicted an imminent recovery for the euro, prompting many firms to act too slowly to hedge against currency risk as the euro continued its interminable slide until much later in the year. 

 "I got the sense that corporations were somewhat slow to hedge," said Nic Pifer, portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management in Minneapolis. 

 "Last year economists were saying the euro was going all the way to $1.10 and beyond, and a lot of company treasurers missed the boat somewhat as it went down to the lower levels." 

 But the euro's sharp rise from November to early January has led many of the same Wall Street analysts to predict yet another stab at the key $1.00 barrier by late this year - meaning some corporations could be in danger of getting caught flat-footed once more if they fail to hedge and the currency fails to reach parity.

12:54 (Dow Jones) The selling may be spreading beyond technology
stocks to other groups, but the drops are not as steep, at least so far.
Of a balanced list of 600 tech and nontech stocks tracked by Morgan
Wilshire Securities this month, less than half are off more than 10%.
The biggest decliners: a group of 57 technology stocks that are down
more than 40% so far this month, said chief technical analyst Jay
Lefkowicz. (KJT)



12:43 (Dow Jones) Big name software stocks are crumbling Friday as
investors worry about their financial outlooks and lofty valuations. The
Goldman Sachs software index is off 5.5% on double-digit percentage
drops in Oracle (ORCL), Siebel Systems (SEBL), I2 Technologies (ITWO),
Veritas (VRTS) and PeopleSoft (PSFT). The only big-cap software stock
bucking the trend: Microsoft (MSFT) which is fractionally higher ahead
of its big trial date. (MLP)



12:37 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD is testing its intraday high at $0.9110 as
the Nasdaq and DJIA sink. Revived rumor of Greek Central Bank selling
euros is floating, but EUR seems to be tracking U.S. equities. USD/JPY
at Y116.14. (JEN)



12:35 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps hit limit down, 32 points lower, falling
to 1225.50 at 12:30 p.m. EST. The market flirted with this level for a
while but finally fell to lock limit. A 10-minute trading curbs is in
effect. If the market remains at limit down a 2-minute trading halt will
occur. (DMC)



12:34 (Dow Jones) Nymex crude and products futures move out of
negative territory, staging technical recovery from earlier losses.
Shortcovering cited. Volume light, exaggerating price moves. April crude
up 36 cents at $29.19, facing resistence at $29.59; March heating oil up
0.98c at 74.60c; resistance pegged at 75.10c. March gasoline up 1.61c at
84.10c. (BWH)



12:30 (Dow Jones) Trading in Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) options were
cautiously bullish Friday morning and the stock was up, even as other
tech names lost ground. With the stock ahead 56 cents at $55.75, the
at-the-money March 55 calls traded actively, with some investors buying
these. Also, more than 5,000 contracts of the in-the-money April 60 puts
traded, with investors selling these. Trading floor speculation that the
software giant might settle its antitrust suit helps, although skeptical
market observers say the persistent rumor has made the rounds before.
(KXT)



12:25 (Dow Jones) Dollar slipping against euro and yen as DJIA and
Nasdaq slide again. The euro is at $0.9120 and the dollar buys Y116.10.
(JRH)



12:23 (Dow Jones) Computer screens showing tech stocks bled red Friday
morning, but a few bullish trades showed up here and there. At least one
investor opened a new position in 3Com Corp.'s (COMS) July 7.50 puts,
selling a large number of these out-of-the-money puts. This is a
cautiously bullish trade - likely not expecting the network systems
provider to fall below $7.50 by mid-July so the puts will expire
unexercised. 3Com stock most recently was up 22 cents to $9.06. The July
7.50 puts were at 75 cents on Pacific Exchange volume of 20,000
contracts, compared with open interest of 843. (KXT)



12:18 (Dow Jones) Stock activity getting nastier, with major indexes
at lows for session. IBM leading DJIA lower, off 7%. Few places to
escape. Tsys rallying. DJIA off 192 at 10334, Nasdaq down 75 to 2169,
and S&P falls 29 to 1224. (TG)



12:09 (Dow Jones) Motorola's (MOT) warning is also weighing on
semiconductor stocks, sparking fears that handset sales might not see as
immediate a recovery as some expected. Adding to that fear is word that
Texas Instruments (TXN) is cutting back production in five factories.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell as much as 5% in intraday,
with both chip stocks and chip equipment stocks down. (KWH)



12:02 (Dow Jones) The number of bankruptcy petitions filed in calendar
year 2000 fell 5% from filings in calendar year 1999, according to data
released by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. (JC)



11:53 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps are down, near session lows. Traders say
to keep an eye on the session low of 1233. "It's right near yesterday's
low of 1230. If we can hold it, we'll probably bounce in the afternoon.
If not, expect further selling," floor trader says. Ultimately, though,
he sees March S&Ps going to the 1170 area. (DMC)



11:39 (Dow Jones) It's Martha Stewart vs. the world, as the celebrity
domesticator tries to take her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO), global. Stewart is already in Brazil, Japan and Canada, and
has her eye on other regions. The results, if they work out, could be as
sweet as her recipe for Luscious Chocolate Cake with Whipped Ganache,
but the expansion challenge will be a heady one, according to
consultants. (BS)



11:30 (Dow Jones) A triple whammy for the wireless sector. Motorola's
(MOT) profit warning, Qualcomm's (QCOM) delays in rolling out 3G
wireless services in Europe, and Deutsche Banc downgrades sent the
sector into a tailspin. Qualcomm, down 20%, led the decline. Other big
losers were Motorola, down 5%, Ericsson (ERICY), down 4%, and Nokia
(NOK), down 7%. (ELM)



11:26 (Dow Jones) Is decimalization a drag on the Dow? That's how some
traders feel, saying the change from fractions to decimals on the New
York Stock Exchange is making stocks less appealing. The switch, meant
to narrow spreads, may be doing just the opposite in some cases, said
Charles Johnson, head of equity trading at Blaylock & Partners. "You see
a stock at 31 and the next quote is much wider, say 31.20. A lot of
people can't quite understand what's going on and aren't doing any
buying while they try to figure it out." (KJT)



11:17 (Dow Jones) Following WSJ report that Northrop (NOC) sued
Lockheed (LMT) for an alleged contract breach, some sober thoughts on
the defense sector: The consensus view on the sector is too simplistic
and "investors could be negatively surprised" when a more complex
picture emerges on defense spending, warned Merrill Lynch analyst Byron
Callan. Amid the Bush administration's spending review, the analyst
hinted programs such as military aircraft modernization and ballistic
missile defense are at risk. "Expect political food fights over changes"
in spending, he wrote. Shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTNA)
are all down more than 1%. (SON)



11:13 (Dow Jones) S&P says that since the beginning of the year only
10 cents of investment grade corporate bonds have been upgraded for
every $1 in debt downgraded. This is a big change from 2000 when markets
saw 70 cents of debt upgraded for every $1 in debt downgraded. (CSE)



11:02 (Dow Jones) Another disappointment in techland. Shares of once
high-flying business-to-business outfit VerticalNet (VERT) are off 15%
after the company's 4Q failed to please Wall Street. The cash loss was
$28.5M, or 32 cents a share. Although the First Call/Thomson Financial
consensus for 19c a share had not been updated to include VerticalNet's
divestiture of its NECX unit, analysts said the company's loss was still
wider than they expected. Revenue of $40.7M also disappointed. Stock
recently at $3.00. Last March it was above $148. (RS)



10:54 (Dow Jones) Merrill decides to "pro-actively" reduce estimates
on JDS (JDSU). Cites Nortel (NT) news and other indications of
weaker-than-expected end-market for optical systems in next few
quarters. March quarter rev view goes to $950M from $1B and EPS to 16c
from 17c. FY01 rev falls to $3.75B from $3.9B, EPS to 70c from 72c.
Keeps near-term accumulate, long-term buy and sees significant growth
returning when sector recovers, which Merrill expects in 2002. (TG)



10:47 (Dow Jones) The dollar is off its earlier lows although the DJIA
and Nasdaq are in solidly negative territory. The euro's quick rally to
over $0.9100 was seen as a technical bounce and this has run out of
steam. The euro is now lower at $0.9075 and USD/JPY is at Y116.28. (JRH)



10:44 (Dow Jones) Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Glenn Schorr
lowered earnings estimates on three large online brokerage firms, citing
"the continued weak retail trading environment." Trading slowed sharply
in February after an "okay" start in January, and Schorr doesn't hold
out much hope for a rebound in March. Schorr lowered his 1Q EPS view on
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) to 13c from 15c and his 2001 view to 59c from
62c. 1Q estimate on E*Trade Group (ET) goes to 3c from 4c, and 2001
estimate to 24c from 28c. Schorr left his estimate on Ameritrade Holding
(AMTD) 2Q unchanged at a 5-cent loss, but lowered his target for
Ameritrade's fiscal 2001 per-share loss to 10 cents from 9 cents. All
three stocks are down slightly. (GFC)



10:34 (Dow Jones) Another Wall Street push for publishers of
educational materials. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Peter Appert
sees the new Bush education program - two elements of which are testing
and increased funding - as a boon for companies like Harcourt (H),
McGraw Hill Cos. (MHP), and Houghton Mifflin (HTN); providers of
remediation and teacher training services like Sylvan Learning (SLVN),
Scholastic (SCHL) and Lightspan (LSPN); and, possibly, private school
operators like Edison Schools Inc. (EDSN) and Nobel Learning (NLCI).
(BS)



10:30 (Dow Jones) March Nasdaq falls to its 65-point limit down level
of 1986.50 at 10:23 a.m. ET. A 10-minute trading curb is in effect. If
the market remains at limit down, a 2-minute trading halt will occur.
March Nasdaq's move to limit down is accompanied by new session lows in
March S&Ps and DJIA. (DMC)



10:22 (Dow Jones) The currency crisis in Turkey will have minimal
impact on global financial services giant Citigroup (C) - and possibly a
positive one, said analyst Catherine Murray of J.P. Morgan Securities.
She said Turkey probably represents less than 1% of its core income and
it's not primarily lending-based. "Citi is an experienced player in the
emerging markets, including in Turkey, and is adept at risk management
in volatile markets," she added, noting that she continues to believe
Citi, rated buy, is a defensive play in the current market environment.
(TAS)



10:11 (Dow Jones) Although the Naz Composite on Thursday recorded a
new low for the year-old bear market, technical momentum readings ticked
up by the end of the day. Moreover, the bear market low of 2185.91 was
virtually important weekly support at 2182.10. This means technical
bounce. If the index, now around 2211, can close above 2300, it means
upside correction. (SC)

12:34 (Dow Jones) Nymex crude and products futures move out of
negative territory, staging technical recovery from earlier losses.
Shortcovering cited. Volume light, exaggerating price moves. April crude
up 36 cents at $29.19, facing resistence at $29.59; March heating oil up
0.98c at 74.60c; resistance pegged at 75.10c. March gasoline up 1.61c at
84.10c. (BWH)



12:30 (Dow Jones) Trading in Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) options were
cautiously bullish Friday morning and the stock was up, even as other
tech names lost ground. With the stock ahead 56 cents at $55.75, the
at-the-money March 55 calls traded actively, with some investors buying
these. Also, more than 5,000 contracts of the in-the-money April 60 puts
traded, with investors selling these. Trading floor speculation that the
software giant might settle its antitrust suit helps, although skeptical
market observers say the persistent rumor has made the rounds before.
(KXT)



12:25 (Dow Jones) Dollar slipping against euro and yen as DJIA and
Nasdaq slide again. The euro is at $0.9120 and the dollar buys Y116.10.
(JRH)



12:23 (Dow Jones) Computer screens showing tech stocks bled red Friday
morning, but a few bullish trades showed up here and there. At least one
investor opened a new position in 3Com Corp.'s (COMS) July 7.50 puts,
selling a large number of these out-of-the-money puts. This is a
cautiously bullish trade - likely not expecting the network systems
provider to fall below $7.50 by mid-July so the puts will expire
unexercised. 3Com stock most recently was up 22 cents to $9.06. The July
7.50 puts were at 75 cents on Pacific Exchange volume of 20,000
contracts, compared with open interest of 843. (KXT)



12:18 (Dow Jones) Stock activity getting nastier, with major indexes
at lows for session. IBM leading DJIA lower, off 7%. Few places to
escape. Tsys rallying. DJIA off 192 at 10334, Nasdaq down 75 to 2169,
and S&P falls 29 to 1224. (TG)



12:09 (Dow Jones) Motorola's (MOT) warning is also weighing on
semiconductor stocks, sparking fears that handset sales might not see as
immediate a recovery as some expected. Adding to that fear is word that
Texas Instruments (TXN) is cutting back production in five factories.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell as much as 5% in intraday,
with both chip stocks and chip equipment stocks down. (KWH)



12:02 (Dow Jones) The number of bankruptcy petitions filed in calendar
year 2000 fell 5% from filings in calendar year 1999, according to data
released by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. (JC)



11:53 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps are down, near session lows. Traders say
to keep an eye on the session low of 1233. "It's right near yesterday's
low of 1230. If we can hold it, we'll probably bounce in the afternoon.
If not, expect further selling," floor trader says. Ultimately, though,
he sees March S&Ps going to the 1170 area. (DMC)



11:39 (Dow Jones) It's Martha Stewart vs. the world, as the celebrity
domesticator tries to take her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO), global. Stewart is already in Brazil, Japan and Canada, and
has her eye on other regions. The results, if they work out, could be as
sweet as her recipe for Luscious Chocolate Cake with Whipped Ganache,
but the expansion challenge will be a heady one, according to
consultants. (BS)



11:30 (Dow Jones) A triple whammy for the wireless sector. Motorola's
(MOT) profit warning, Qualcomm's (QCOM) delays in rolling out 3G
wireless services in Europe, and Deutsche Banc downgrades sent the
sector into a tailspin. Qualcomm, down 20%, led the decline. Other big
losers were Motorola, down 5%, Ericsson (ERICY), down 4%, and Nokia
(NOK), down 7%. (ELM)



11:26 (Dow Jones) Is decimalization a drag on the Dow? That's how some
traders feel, saying the change from fractions to decimals on the New
York Stock Exchange is making stocks less appealing. The switch, meant
to narrow spreads, may be doing just the opposite in some cases, said
Charles Johnson, head of equity trading at Blaylock & Partners. "You see
a stock at 31 and the next quote is much wider, say 31.20. A lot of
people can't quite understand what's going on and aren't doing any
buying while they try to figure it out." (KJT)



11:17 (Dow Jones) Following WSJ report that Northrop (NOC) sued
Lockheed (LMT) for an alleged contract breach, some sober thoughts on
the defense sector: The consensus view on the sector is too simplistic
and "investors could be negatively surprised" when a more complex
picture emerges on defense spending, warned Merrill Lynch analyst Byron
Callan. Amid the Bush administration's spending review, the analyst
hinted programs such as military aircraft modernization and ballistic
missile defense are at risk. "Expect political food fights over changes"
in spending, he wrote. Shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTNA)
are all down more than 1%. (SON)



11:13 (Dow Jones) S&P says that since the beginning of the year only
10 cents of investment grade corporate bonds have been upgraded for
every $1 in debt downgraded. This is a big change from 2000 when markets
saw 70 cents of debt upgraded for every $1 in debt downgraded. (CSE)



11:02 (Dow Jones) Another disappointment in techland. Shares of once
high-flying business-to-business outfit VerticalNet (VERT) are off 15%
after the company's 4Q failed to please Wall Street. The cash loss was
$28.5M, or 32 cents a share. Although the First Call/Thomson Financial
consensus for 19c a share had not been updated to include VerticalNet's
divestiture of its NECX unit, analysts said the company's loss was still
wider than they expected. Revenue of $40.7M also disappointed. Stock
recently at $3.00. Last March it was above $148. (RS)



10:54 (Dow Jones) Merrill decides to "pro-actively" reduce estimates
on JDS (JDSU). Cites Nortel (NT) news and other indications of
weaker-than-expected end-market for optical systems in next few
quarters. March quarter rev view goes to $950M from $1B and EPS to 16c
from 17c. FY01 rev falls to $3.75B from $3.9B, EPS to 70c from 72c.
Keeps near-term accumulate, long-term buy and sees significant growth
returning when sector recovers, which Merrill expects in 2002. (TG)



10:47 (Dow Jones) The dollar is off its earlier lows although the DJIA
and Nasdaq are in solidly negative territory. The euro's quick rally to
over $0.9100 was seen as a technical bounce and this has run out of
steam. The euro is now lower at $0.9075 and USD/JPY is at Y116.28. (JRH)



10:44 (Dow Jones) Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Glenn Schorr
lowered earnings estimates on three large online brokerage firms, citing
"the continued weak retail trading environment." Trading slowed sharply
in February after an "okay" start in January, and Schorr doesn't hold
out much hope for a rebound in March. Schorr lowered his 1Q EPS view on
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) to 13c from 15c and his 2001 view to 59c from
62c. 1Q estimate on E*Trade Group (ET) goes to 3c from 4c, and 2001
estimate to 24c from 28c. Schorr left his estimate on Ameritrade Holding
(AMTD) 2Q unchanged at a 5-cent loss, but lowered his target for
Ameritrade's fiscal 2001 per-share loss to 10 cents from 9 cents. All
three stocks are down slightly. (GFC)



10:34 (Dow Jones) Another Wall Street push for publishers of
educational materials. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Peter Appert
sees the new Bush education program - two elements of which are testing
and increased funding - as a boon for companies like Harcourt (H),
McGraw Hill Cos. (MHP), and Houghton Mifflin (HTN); providers of
remediation and teacher training services like Sylvan Learning (SLVN),
Scholastic (SCHL) and Lightspan (LSPN); and, possibly, private school
operators like Edison Schools Inc. (EDSN) and Nobel Learning (NLCI).

after the company's 4Q failed to please Wall Street. The cash loss was
$28.5M, or 32 cents a share. Although the First Call/Thomson Financial
consensus for 19c a share had not been updated to include VerticalNet's
divestiture of its NECX unit, analysts said the company's loss was still
wider than they expected. Revenue of $40.7M also disappointed. Stock
recently at $3.00. Last March it was above $148. (RS)



10:54 (Dow Jones) Merrill decides to "pro-actively" reduce estimates
on JDS (JDSU). Cites Nortel (NT) news and other indications of
weaker-than-expected end-market for optical systems in next few
quarters. March quarter rev view goes to $950M from $1B and EPS to 16c
from 17c. FY01 rev falls to $3.75B from $3.9B, EPS to 70c from 72c.
Keeps near-term accumulate, long-term buy and sees significant growth

10:44 (Dow Jones) Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Glenn Schorr
lowered earnings estimates on three large online brokerage firms, citing
"the continued weak retail trading environment." Trading slowed sharply
in February after an "okay" start in January, and Schorr doesn't hold
out much hope for a rebound in March. Schorr lowered his 1Q EPS view on
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) to 13c from 15c and his 2001 view to 59c from
62c. 1Q estimate on E*Trade Group (ET) goes to 3c from 4c, and 2001
estimate to 24c from 28c. Schorr left his estimate on Ameritrade Holding
(AMTD) 2Q unchanged at a 5-cent loss, but lowered his target for
Ameritrade's fiscal 2001 per-share loss to 10 cents from 9 cents. All
three stocks are down slightly. (GFC)



10:34 (Dow Jones) Another Wall Street push for publishers of
educational materials. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Peter Appert
sees the new Bush education program - two elements of which are testing

McGraw Hill Cos. (MHP), and Houghton Mifflin (HTN); providers of
remediation and teacher training services like Sylvan Learning (SLVN),

the market remains at limit down, a 2-minute trading halt will occur.
March Nasdaq's move to limit down is accompanied by new session lows in

She said Turkey probably represents less than 1% of its core income and
it's not primarily lending-based. "Citi is an experienced player in the
emerging markets, including in Turkey, and is adept at risk management
in volatile markets," she added, noting that she continues to believe
Citi, rated buy, is a defensive play in the current market environment.

virtually important weekly support at 2182.10. This means technical
bounce. If the index, now around 2211, can close above 2300, it means

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT



12:02 (Dow Jones) The number of bankruptcy petitions filed in calendar
year 2000 fell 5% from filings in calendar year 1999, according to data
released by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. (JC)



11:53 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps are down, near session lows. Traders say
to keep an eye on the session low of 1233. "It's right near yesterday's
low of 1230. If we can hold it, we'll probably bounce in the afternoon.
If not, expect further selling," floor trader says. Ultimately, though,
he sees March S&Ps going to the 1170 area. (DMC)



11:39 (Dow Jones) It's Martha Stewart vs. the world, as the celebrity
domesticator tries to take her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO), global. Stewart is already in Brazil, Japan and Canada, and
has her eye on other regions. The results, if they work out, could be as
sweet as her recipe for Luscious Chocolate Cake with Whipped Ganache,
but the expansion challenge will be a heady one, according to
consultants. (BS)



11:30 (Dow Jones) A triple whammy for the wireless sector. Motorola's
(MOT) profit warning, Qualcomm's (QCOM) delays in rolling out 3G
wireless services in Europe, and Deutsche Banc downgrades sent the
sector into a tailspin. Qualcomm, down 20%, led the decline. Other big
losers were Motorola, down 5%, Ericsson (ERICY), down 4%, and Nokia
(NOK), down 7%. (ELM)



11:26 (Dow Jones) Is decimalization a drag on the Dow? That's how some
traders feel, saying the change from fractions to decimals on the New
York Stock Exchange is making stocks less appealing. The switch, meant
to narrow spreads, may be doing just the opposite in some cases, said
Charles Johnson, head of equity trading at Blaylock & Partners. "You see
a stock at 31 and the next quote is much wider, say 31.20. A lot of
people can't quite understand what's going on and aren't doing any
buying while they try to figure it out." (KJT)



11:17 (Dow Jones) Following WSJ report that Northrop (NOC) sued
Lockheed (LMT) for an alleged contract breach, some sober thoughts on
the defense sector: The consensus view on the sector is too simplistic
and "investors could be negatively surprised" when a more complex
picture emerges on defense spending, warned Merrill Lynch analyst Byron
Callan. Amid the Bush administration's spending review, the analyst
hinted programs such as military aircraft modernization and ballistic
missile defense are at risk. "Expect political food fights over changes"
in spending, he wrote. Shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTNA)
are all down more than 1%. (SON)



11:13 (Dow Jones) S&P says that since the beginning of the year only
10 cents of investment grade corporate bonds have been upgraded for
every $1 in debt downgraded. This is a big change from 2000 when markets
saw 70 cents of debt upgraded for every $1 in debt downgraded. (CSE)

11:30 (Dow Jones) A triple whammy for the wireless sector. Motorola's
(MOT) profit warning, Qualcomm's (QCOM) delays in rolling out 3G
wireless services in Europe, and Deutsche Banc downgrades sent the
sector into a tailspin. Qualcomm, down 20%, led the decline. Other big
losers were Motorola, down 5%, Ericsson (ERICY), down 4%, and Nokia
(NOK), down 7%. (ELM)



11:26 (Dow Jones) Is decimalization a drag on the Dow? That's how some
traders feel, saying the change from fractions to decimals on the New

Charles Johnson, head of equity trading at Blaylock & Partners. "You see

picture emerges on defense spending, warned Merrill Lynch analyst Byron
Callan. Amid the Bush administration's spending review, the analyst

11:02 (Dow Jones) Another disappointment in techland. Shares of once
high-flying business-to-business outfit VerticalNet (VERT) are off 15%
after the company's 4Q failed to please Wall Street. The cash loss was
$28.5M, or 32 cents a share. Although the First Call/Thomson Financial
consensus for 19c a share had not been updated to include VerticalNet's
divestiture of its NECX unit, analysts said the company's loss was still
wider than they expected. Revenue of $40.7M also disappointed. Stock
recently at $3.00. Last March it was above $148. (RS)

10:44 (Dow Jones) Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Glenn Schorr
lowered earnings estimates on three large online brokerage firms, citing
"the continued weak retail trading environment." Trading slowed sharply
in February after an "okay" start in January, and Schorr doesn't hold
out much hope for a rebound in March. Schorr lowered his 1Q EPS view on
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCH) to 13c from 15c and his 2001 view to 59c from
62c. 1Q estimate on E*Trade Group (ET) goes to 3c from 4c, and 2001
estimate to 24c from 28c. Schorr left his estimate on Ameritrade Holding
(AMTD) 2Q unchanged at a 5-cent loss, but lowered his target for
Ameritrade's fiscal 2001 per-share loss to 10 cents from 9 cents. All
three stocks are down slightly. (GFC)

10:22 (Dow Jones) The currency crisis in Turkey will have minimal
impact on global financial services giant Citigroup (C) - and possibly a

She said Turkey probably represents less than 1% of its core income and
it's not primarily lending-based. "Citi is an experienced player in the
emerging markets, including in Turkey, and is adept at risk management
in volatile markets," she added, noting that she continues to believe
Citi, rated buy, is a defensive play in the current market environment.

virtually important weekly support at 2182.10. This means technical
bounce. If the index, now around 2211, can close above 2300, it means
upside correction. (SC)

 Motorola sees first-quarter shortfall, perhaps loss.

 NEW YORK, Feb 23 (MEDIAFAX) - Wireless communications gear maker Motorola Inc. said on Friday a dramatic drop in its business could lead to its first quarterly operating loss in more than 15 years as it becomes the latest technology bellwether to signal the severity of the U.S. economy's slowdown, informs Reuters. 

 Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola, the world's No. 2 wireless handset maker behind Finland's Nokia Corp., had already warned last month that its first-quarter results would suffer from a slowdown in its personal communications and semiconductor businesses. 

 At that time, it projected first-quarter sales of $8.8 billion would be flat with a year earlier, while profits would drop to 12 cents per share from 20 cents. 

 Now, however, it said it won't meet that lowered guidance, and if the slowdown persists, it expects to report an operating loss for the quarter. 

 The last time Motorola recorded an operating loss was the third quarter of 1985, a company spokesman said. It posted a net loss in second quarter 1998, but that included a $2 billion charge. 

 After the latest warning, Motorola shares were down 89 cents, or 5.2 percent, at $16.40 in New York Stock Exchange trade on Friday morning. In premarket trading, however, the stock had slid as far as $15.75 - its lowest price since October 1998. 

 The stock - down more than 73 percent from its all-time high of $61.54 last March - has underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX> by more than 85 percent in the past year. 

 Motorola has been facing intensifying competition in its handset business from Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson, the No. 3 player worldwide. 

 But Motorola executives insisted in a conference call following its profit warning that the shortfall resulted from the sharp economic slowdown in the United States and inventory corrections taking place broadly in technology markets worldwide - not lost market share. 

 "We believe that this weakness is the result of current industry-wide conditions and not a loss in market share," President and Chief Operating Officer Robert Growney told analysts. 

 The company said it will continue to actively adjust its cost structure in response to this environment and take additional cost reduction steps in the future. Growney said Motorola will hold capital spending this year to less than the $2.5 billion it had previously projected. Last year its capital outlays totaled $4 billion. 

 Motorola's warning follows a spate of profit and sales warnings from major technology companies in recent days. 

 On Thursday, network computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. and data storage powerhouse EMC Corp. cut sales and profit targets, citing the slowdown in capital spending by large corporations. 

 And last week, telecommunications equipment maker Nortel Networks Corp., the world's biggest supplier of fiber-optic telecom gear, said it will post a first-quarter loss and lowered its revenue growth expectations for the year.

12:35 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps hit limit down, 32 points lower, falling
to 1225.50 at 12:30 p.m. EST. The market flirted with this level for a
while but finally fell to lock limit. A 10-minute trading curbs is in
effect. If the market remains at limit down a 2-minute trading halt will
occur. (DMC)



12:34 (Dow Jones) Nymex crude and products futures move out of
negative territory, staging technical recovery from earlier losses.
Shortcovering cited. Volume light, exaggerating price moves. April crude
up 36 cents at $29.19, facing resistence at $29.59; March heating oil up
0.98c at 74.60c; resistance pegged at 75.10c. March gasoline up 1.61c at
84.10c. (BWH)



12:30 (Dow Jones) Trading in Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) options were
cautiously bullish Friday morning and the stock was up, even as other
tech names lost ground. With the stock ahead 56 cents at $55.75, the
at-the-money March 55 calls traded actively, with some investors buying
these. Also, more than 5,000 contracts of the in-the-money April 60 puts
traded, with investors selling these. Trading floor speculation that the
software giant might settle its antitrust suit helps, although skeptical
market observers say the persistent rumor has made the rounds before.

12:25 (Dow Jones) Dollar slipping against euro and yen as DJIA and
Nasdaq slide again. The euro is at $0.9120 and the dollar buys Y116.10.
(JRH)



12:23 (Dow Jones) Computer screens showing tech stocks bled red Friday
morning, but a few bullish trades showed up here and there. At least one
investor opened a new position in 3Com Corp.'s (COMS) July 7.50 puts,
selling a large number of these out-of-the-money puts. This is a
cautiously bullish trade - likely not expecting the network systems
provider to fall below $7.50 by mid-July so the puts will expire
unexercised. 3Com stock most recently was up 22 cents to $9.06. The July
7.50 puts were at 75 cents on Pacific Exchange volume of 20,000
contracts, compared with open interest of 843. (KXT)



12:18 (Dow Jones) Stock activity getting nastier, with major indexes
at lows for session. IBM leading DJIA lower, off 7%. Few places to
escape. Tsys rallying. DJIA off 192 at 10334, Nasdaq down 75 to 2169,
and S&P falls 29 to 1224. (TG)



12:09 (Dow Jones) Motorola's (MOT) warning is also weighing on
semiconductor stocks, sparking fears that handset sales might not see as
immediate a recovery as some expected. Adding to that fear is word that
Texas Instruments (TXN) is cutting back production in five factories.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell as much as 5% in intraday,
with both chip stocks and chip equipment stocks down. (KWH)



12:02 (Dow Jones) The number of bankruptcy petitions filed in calendar
year 2000 fell 5% from filings in calendar year 1999, according to data
released by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. (JC)



11:53 (Dow Jones) March S&Ps are down, near session lows. Traders say
to keep an eye on the session low of 1233. "It's right near yesterday's
low of 1230. If we can hold it, we'll probably bounce in the afternoon.
If not, expect further selling," floor trader says. Ultimately, though,
he sees March S&Ps going to the 1170 area. (DMC)



11:39 (Dow Jones) It's Martha Stewart vs. the world, as the celebrity
domesticator tries to take her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO), global. Stewart is already in Brazil, Japan and Canada, and
has her eye on other regions. The results, if they work out, could be as
sweet as her recipe for Luscious Chocolate Cake with Whipped Ganache,
but the expansion challenge will be a heady one, according to
consultants. (BS)

 Why `healthy' Europe is still a suitable case for treatment.

 DOCTOR Romano Prodi and Europe's leaders meet in Stockholm next month, hoping to find a cure for the economic ills plaguing the world's biggest trading bloc as it bids to outstrip the spluttering but still vigorous US. 

 On the surface the EU looks a picture of health. The euro is on the up. The econo 

 my has weathered the turbulence of stock markets and protests over fuel prices. Unemployment is down, with two and a half million new jobs created. The EU is even set 

 to grow faster than the US over the next couple of years. 

 But, as the European Commission admits in its report previewing the Stockholm gathering, beneath the surface the prognosis is less reassuring ñ and a lot of bitter medicine must be swallowed. 

 ìOur relative economic strength must be used to speed up ñ rather than slow down ñ difficult r 

 eforms,î the Commission declares. 

 With a lavish social security system and labour laws to match, unemployment is still a weakspot. ìWhile new jobs have been created, 14 million people are currently out of work,î the Commission adds. 

 This is despite the fact that industry is keen to recruit in many areas such as telecoms and IT. The problem is finding properly-trained candidates. This month's informal meeting of employment and telecoms ministers focused on chronic labour shortages and skills gaps in many mem 

 ber states, which are often made worse by limits on worker mobility. 

 Efforts will be made in Stockholm to cut the jobless queues, tool up workers for the needs of the 21st century and boost the free movement of labour, but leaders will also highlight the need for reforms. 

 For example, the EU executive will need to win support for streamlined methods of regulation in areas where industry is moving faster than the legislative process. 

 The Commission also wants to wrap up negotiations on the latest round of m 

 easures to open postal markets by June, but the end result is likely to disappoint nearly all the relevant players. 

 Private sector firms are waiting eagerly for a chance to compete in the old monopoly strangleholds, while many state-run post offices are transforming themselves 

 into pan-European logistics giants hungry for foreign business. 

 The financial services sector is still hampered by barriers to cross-border trade, despite ongoing Commission efforts. 

 The EU's energy markets are also in need of a good 

 stoking, and Commissioner Loyola de Palacio is pushing a series of measures to liberalise them fully by 2005. 

 Further down the Stockholm agenda, a raft of other issues cry out for attention. Europe, it will be argued, still fails to reward research, innovation and invention. The evidence shows that businesses invest less than their US counterparts in new technologies and in research. 

 A key problem remains the lack of a one-stop-shop EU patent system. 

 A single market for services is also needed, with too ma 

 ny barriers to trade protecting national fiefdoms and discouraging competition. Sectoral state aid continues to plague many member states, at best rewarding inefficiency and increasingly tempting multinationals to relocate to friendlier shores. 

 The fledgling e-commerce market is riddled with often conflicting regulations that continue to baffle international lawyers ñ not to mention the small businesses that are supposed to drive growth. 

 Finally, Europe's airspace suffers from overcrowding and lack of coord 

 ination. The situation for passengers is set to worsen, with industry counting the cost in lost productivity as executives spend more time in the departure lounge than the boardroom. 

 If the EU succeeds in pushing through the reforms being prescribed ahead of its Stockholm physical examination, its economic outlook could be significantly healthier by the end of the year.

 NEC issues  profit warning

 NEC has became the latest major technology group to issue a profitwarning, as last year's optimism fades in the face of a slowing US economy, weak Japanese consumer spending and competition from Asian rivals. 

 NEC, the world's third-biggest chipmaker and Japan's largest supplier of personal computers, said consolidated operating profit for the year to March 31 would be GBP 1.12 billion or 24 per cent below its previous estimate in October, on sales of GBP 31bn down from GBP 32.35bn. 

 "We're not optimistic about the first quarter of the next business year," NEC executive vice president Shigeo Matsumoto said. 

 The warning was of little surprise to the market, which has been braced for bad news from Japan's big electronics makers since signs began emerging of a US slowdown late last year.

Election Fall-out Hits Telstra

A 5 per cent fall by the US tech index, Nasdaq, focused local investor attention on offshore markets yesterday, although the political uncertainty sweeping the domestic market contributed to yet another subdued performance by Telstra.

Friday's profit warning by Nasdaq-listed Nortel saw the Canadian telecom company drop 33 per cent and dragged the US market down 5 per cent. Telstra, hit by the double-whammy of a weaker sector offshore as well as the political fall-out from the Queensland election, fell 13c to $6.47.

Mr Marcus Padley, head of private client at Barton Capital Securities, said the stock's continued weakness might have been exaggerated by low trading volumes but also by its future status on the sharemarket.

``A combination of [Opposition Leader] Kim Beazley threatening to control Telstra from the Government frontbenches and the global selloff of telcos since the dismal float of Orange in the UK has hit the stock,'' Mr Padley said. ``If there is one thing international investors hate it is politicians interfering in investments and uncertainty.''

The sharemarket also was pushed lower by News Corp and the banking sector as predictions of poor earnings beset the blue chips. CBA fell 61c to $29 as the stock moved ex-dividend 61c and NAB 35c to $28.80.

The All Ordinaries index fell 27.1 to 3240 and the S&P/ASX200 31.2 to 3288.9. Trading levels were low with 44,000 trades passing through the market worth less than $1 billion. Dealers said the activity had been curtailed by the lack of a US market last night, shut for President's Day.

CSL, which reports interim results today, fell $3.32 to $31.33.

Lend Lease enjoyed a late spike pushing the stock off a 12-month low of $14.49 touched earlier in the session. The stock finished up 8c at $14.99. Analysts said the late bounce might have been technical, a number of buy orders triggered as the stock dropped below $14.50. Its chief executive, Mr David Higgins, begins an institutional investor roadshow this week.

Brambles surged 86c to $48.87 as investors await Thursday's interim results.

Transurban fell 32c to $4.26 after revealing the group's Melbourne CityLink tunnel was leaking and had to be closed.

 TORONTO, Feb 19 (AFP) - Nortel Networks President and CEO John Roth, facing harsh criticism for a surprise profit warning last week, defended his record here Monday, pointing to the firm's nearly quadrupled earnings under his leadership. 

 Nortel last Thursday announced it would slash profit expectations by 20 percent and reduce its workforce by 10,000 employees in 2001 -- 6,000 more than estimates given in late January. 

 Stock markets in Frankfurt, London, New York, Paris, Toronto and Tokyo tumbled in response to the Nortel cuts. 

 On the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, Nortel -- which makes up nearly 21 percent of the benchmark TSE 300 -- dropped one-third of its value to 31 dollars (20.15 US) per share, establishing a new 52- week low. The TSE 300 plummeted 574.04 points, or 6.4 percent, to 8,393.23 the day after the news broke. 

 Blaming the cutbacks on the sharp downturn in the US economy, Roth said nonetheless Nortel was well-positioned to weather the storm. 

 "We'll come out of this downturn as a stronger company than we went into it," Roth told a packed business luncheon here. 

 The firm said last week it anticipates year-on-year growth in revenues and in earnings per share in 2001 will be 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. 

 Analysts question Roth's ability to lead the firm, citing his swift about-face from a rosy 2001 forecast given in late January, and some stockholders demanded he resign. 

 Roth said under his leadership, investors have seen "15 straight quarters where we've met or beat (our) guidance." 

 "I must say that what I set out to do four years ago, I've largely achieved ... Nortel is the world leader in telecom infrastructure," Roth said, boasting since he took Nortel's helm in 1997, annual revenues of 15.7 billion dollars US nearly doubled to 30.3 billion dollars US last year. 

 The company's rate of return also climbed, from 4.3 percent to 7.6 percent in the same period. 

 "Unfortunately, this will be the first quarter where I will not meet (our original) guidance," he said, but made no apologies for the sell-off around the globe that followed Nortel's news. 

 "We do not really control what the stock markets do," he said. "The job of CEO is really to guide a company so that it outperforms the market segment that it serves." 

 Roth said Nortel's board has asked him to "stick around until about this time next year," and said he intends to direct the company's focus to fiber-optics networks within cities. 

 Asked by an audience member about the three class-action lawsuits filed in the US following the precipitous drop in the firm's financial estimates, Roth said it was not "unexpected." 

 "Any time there's any meaningful movement in stock  -- either up or down -- you can expect class-action suits," he said. A Nortel spokeswoman said they had yet to receive the complaints and therefore refused comment. 

 Shortly after ending his 20-minute speech, he darted off, refusing to take any questions from reporters. 

 Mike Steadman, CEO of Toronto-based Global Installers Network, a Nortel supplier, said Roth's speech was on target, adding questions about his credibility were off base. 

 "I think he's done a good job, (and) I don't think he would mislead anyone," Steadman said. 

 Lawrence Surtees, an analyst at IT research firm IDC Canada, disagreed, saying Roth's omission of which US customers were dropping orders for Nortel equipment was odd. 

 "Who are they? ... Where's the news releases from Qwest, from MCI, from AT and T, from Sprint that they are canning multiyear contracts?" he asked. 

 "I think they (Nortel) need to come clear with that," Surtees added, noting if just 75 of Nortel's clients account for 85 percent of its business, it would behoove the company to have a better handle on the slowdown in US orders. 

 Nortel closed up 1.69 dollars Monday on the TSE to 32.69 (21.25 USD). The US markets were closed for a federal holiday.

 THE stock market finished lower yesterday after a $4 billion rout of blue-chip stocks. 

 Few sectors were spared in the sell-off as the all ordinaries index fell 22.9 points to 3240. 

 The Sydney Futures Exchange pointed to more downside ahead, with its spot index losing 25 points to 3296. 

 In New York on Friday, a profit warning from Nortel Networks and reports of military action in the Middle East prompted a sell off. 

 Hartley Poynton institutional adviser Paul Lucas said the local market fell in line with Wall Street in early trading before treading water for most of the day. 

 In yesterday's trade, banks took a beating, led by CBA, down 61c to $29 after going ex-dividend, and NAB, 35c to $28.80. 

 News Corp dipped 46c to $18.89 while its preferred scrip lost 20c to $16.90 but rival John Fairfax Holdings reversed recent trends to climb 10c to $3.82, despite some analysts' downgrades after last week's weaker interim profit. 

 BHP held firm at $19.65, after positive reports from its iron ore division, which said rising world demand should see a "robust" price agreement in the present negotiations with Japanese steel mills. 

 And, Foster's Brewing gained 3c to $4.63 on reports it planned to sell some of its pubs and bottle shops because of weaker returns.

 Taiwan stocks down 1.8 percent

 TAIPEI, Feb 19 (AFP) - Taiwan share prices closed 1.8 percent lower Monday following the Nasdaq's fall over the weekend, dealers said. 

 The Taiwan Stock Exchange weighted price index fell 108.37 points to 5,937.30, on turnover 96.52 billion Taiwan dollars (2.99 billion US). 

 "The market was mainly depressed by the Nasdaq's losses over the weekend on profit warning from Canada's telecom giant Nortel Networks," said James Su, manager of Power World Securities. 

 He said US market weakness raised concerns on the prospects of Taiwan's technology industry, which triggered strong selling of electronics issues. 

 The Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.00 percent to 2,425.28 on Friday after Nortel issued a profit and revenue warning worse than the market had expected. 

 Su said some of the selling pressure came from profit-taking as the index approached the heavy-resistance level of 6,000 points. 

 In the near term, Taiwan shares may regain momentum if the US market bounces back, he added. 

 Decliners outpaced risers 334 to 207, with 46 issues unchanged. 

 The technology counter posted the biggest losses. 

 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company shed 2.00 dollars to 96.00, Systex lost 4.50 to 69.00 and Acer Inc. eased 1.10 to 22.40.

RENAY SAN MIGUEL reporting:   

It's the Presidents Day holiday weekend, and investors want to preserve, protect and defend their portfolios by selling tech stocks. And confusion still reigns over the economy. The latest economic indicators point to rising inflation and sagging consumer confidence. But housing starts are up.   

The Dow ended Friday down 91 points. Techs, biotechs, drugs, chemicals and airlines were down. Gold and utilities--two safe havens for investors--were up.

Dow Jones Industrials

NASDAQ

Tech Loser   

Hewlett-Packard (HWP)

 Nortel  profit warning  sends investors fleeing Series: THE CANADA REPORT

 Investors bailed out of Canadian fiber-optics giant Nortel Networks, rocking the stock market, after the company issued a profit and revenue warning. 

 Nortel expects to cut as many as 10,000 jobs this year because of the sudden downturn in the U.S. economy. About 6,000 of those jobs have been eliminated, mostly through attrition and early retirements, from a work force of 85,000 people. 

 The surprise announcement resulted in shares in Canada's biggest high-tech company plunging by $15 to $31 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

 Chief executive John Roth said Nortel, the world's biggest supplier of optical equipment used to build the phone and data networks of the Internet, would lose money in the first quarter and revenues would be squeezed by U.S. economic conditions. 

 After making big profits in recent years, Nortel forecasts revenue and profit growth from operations at 15 percent and 10 percent respectively this year - about half of earlier forecasts. 

 First-quarter revenues are predicted at $6.3-billion (U.S.) - nearly $2-billion below earlier estimates - and the company will post a loss per share from operations of 4 cents U.S. 

 Extradition hurdle upheld 

 The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that almost no one facing the death penalty should be extradited from Canada. 

 In a 9-0 ruling, the judges upheld the guarantees of fundamental justice and the right to life, liberty and security under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

 Some observers said the judgment suggests an end to any chance of reinstating the death penalty, which was abolished in Canada in 1976. 

 The ruling centers on Vancouver men Atif Rafay and Glen Sebastian Burns, who are wanted in the slayings of Rafay's father, mother and sister in their Bellevue, Wash., home in 1994. 

 Justice Minister Anne McLellan said she will seek assurances from Washington state prosecutors before extradition is allowed that the pair won't be executed if convicted. 

 In brief 

 Bernard Landry, Quebec's premier-in-waiting, has said the province should again have an official premier's residence. Lucien Bouchard, the retiring premier whom Landry likely will replace within weeks, never used the residence and it was sold. "I think it's quite normal (to have an official residence); Quebec is a national capital," Landry said in 1998. 

 Author Mordecai Richler, Supreme Court Judge Antonio Lamer and sex educator Sue Johanson are among 98 people appointed to the Order of Canada. The Order was established in 1967 to recognize outstanding achievement and service in various fields of endeavor. 

 Facts and figures 

 Stock exchanges and the Canadian dollar took a beating last week. 

 The Nortel selloff pulled the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Index down 574 points Friday to 8,393 points while the Canadian Venture Exchange index closed at 3,221 points. 

 The Canadian dollar dropped to 64.97 cents U.S. on expectations of lower interest rates while the U.S dollar returned $1.5391 in Canadian funds before bank exchange fees. 

 The key Bank of Canada rate is unchanged at 5.75 percent while the prime lending rate is 7.25 percent.

 Baghdad `strike' sends share prices tumbling.

 The US-UK air strike on Baghdad last night, combined with a shock profit warning from Nortel Networks the Canadian world-leader in fibre-optics, sent stocks plummeting in one of the bleakest days on Wall Street this year. 

 News of the air strike came in early afternoon, when the market was already being pummelled by the bad news from Nortel, which showed that the state of the communications industry in the United States was worse than anticipated. Combined with the highest inflation figures for a decade and a major setback for the big pharmaceuticals company Schering-Plough, the bad technology news unleashed the bears, wiping out recent gains on the Dow and Nasdaq. 

 The Nasdaq Composite finished 4.99 per cent down at 2,425.62 and the Dow at 10,801.31, down 0.83 per cent. The technology-driven Nasdaq recorded widespread losses in the networking and fibre-optic sectors. Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, JDS Uniphase, Lucent Technologies, Microsoft, General Electric and AT&T were among hard-hit stocks. Nortel, the world's biggest seller of fibre-optics, said that it would cut 10,000 jobs, an increase of 4,000 on its earlier predictions, because of a faster and more severe economic downturn in the US and a reluctance by US consumers to spend on new equipment. 

 The Toronto-based company has a major investment in Ireland, North and South, with 2,500 employees in Belfast, 730 in Galway, 50 in Dublin and 45 at Shannon. A Nortel spokesman told The Irish Times that "specific locations for job cuts have not yet been determined". Nortel's value quickly tumbled 33 per cent on the announcement by the company on Thursday evening that for the first quarter it expects a loss from operations of four cents a share compared to the current estimate of a profit of 16 cents a share. The company now expects earnings to grow 10 percent in 2001, a third of the pace it forecast when it reported earnings in January. "We are now seeing a faster and more severe economic downturn in the United States which we now expect will result in a slower overall market growth of approximately 10 per cent in 2001," said Mr John Roth, Nortel president and CEO. "We are seeing longer-than-expected delays in spending by our US customers as they continue to assess the impact of the economic and market conditions on their businesses." 

 Nortel's prospects for sales of wireless equipment also dimmed as installation schedules for some European networks were pushed back, Chief Operating Officer Mr Clarence Chandran said. Nortel now expects the network operators to install the equipment in the first half of 2002 instead of the fourth quarter of this year. Schering-Plough also saw its stock value plummet after it was ruled out of compliance with the rules of the US Food and Drugs Administration. As a result it had to suspend several production lines. The New Jerseybased drug-maker has 500 employees at Brinny, Co Cork, 280 at Avondale Co Wicklow and 100 in Bray Co Wicklow. 

 The sharp rise in inflation was revealed in the producer price index, which surged 1.1 per cent in January, surpassing expectations for a 0.3 per cent increase. The chief reason was a surge of 11.3 per cent rise in domestic natural gas prices. However, housing starts rose strongly in January to their highest level in nine months, the government said yesterday in a report that suggested lower mortgage rates were breathing life into the housing market.

Telecom Weighs on Markets Nortel's Gloomy Forecast and Job Cuts Sour Investors

The pendulum of public opinion swung into the dour position Friday as Nortel Networks' profit warning and plan to lay off 10,000 workers added to fears that the U.S. economy could be headed for recession. 

Nortel, which said Thursday that it would post a first-quarter loss because of declining sales in the United States, closed $9.75 lower at $20 in New York 

Because Nortel, based in Brampton, Ontario, is a leading supplier of communications gear, its warning weighed on its suppliers and on the market in general. The Nasdaq composite index, home to many technology stocks, fell nearly 5 percent. 

So far, 2001 has been a moody year on Wall Street: Stock prices rise one day on hopes that cuts in interest and tax rates will enliven the economy and raise corporate profits, then fall the next on concerns that such governmental remedies are needed because conditions are so bad. The U.S. industrial economy already is contracting. The weakness is discouraging manufacturing companies from making investments, which is putting pressure on suppliers of equipment such as Nortel. 

Illustrating the weakness in manufacturing, the government said Friday that industrial production fell 0.3 percent in January, the fourth straight monthly decline. Much of that decline reflected reduced utility output, but factory production was down again, by 0.1 percent, after a 1.1 percent drop in December. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index for the first part of February fell to 87.8, its lowest level since 1993. (Page 11) 

The Nortel statement that it was seeing "a faster and more severe downturn in the United States" than was previously thought echoed news on Feb. 7 from Cisco Systems, whose routers carry much of the Internet's digital traffic. Cisco said sales in the three months that ended Jan. 27 were below its forecasts. 

Nortel responded to the worsening outlook by announcing plans to lay off 10,000 employees, the same number its competitor, Lucent Technologies, said last month it would cut. 

Other companies also have taken the corporate ax to their employment rolls, with 142,208 job cuts announced in January, the highest monthly total ever recorded by Challenger, Gray &Christmas Inc. The Chicago-based outplacement company said there were 133,713 reductions announced in December. 

"It seems to me that as this slowdown rolls out, the first place that it landed was manufacturing and in retail," said John Challenger, chief executive of the company. "It is now moving into the new economy." 

Announced layoffs in telecommunications, electronic commerce and the computer industry totaled 44,851 in January, a rise from 24,007 in December and 11,482 in November, he said. 

Wall Street analysts are growing increasingly pessimistic about the prospects for earnings this year. Charles Hill, research director for First Call Corp., said estimates for earnings at technology companies had turned negative, with a decline of 18 percent now expected in the first quarter after previous predictions of a 3 percent gain, a decline of 15 percent expected in the second quarter instead of a 2 percent gain, and a decline of 3 percent in the third quarter instead of an 11 percent gain. 

"Every day that goes by, the chances for a recovery in the third quarter seem to be evaporating," he said. 

But at J.P. Morgan Chase, Bruce Kasman, the chief economist, said it remained unclear whether there would be a recession. J.P. Morgan, he said, was predicting the economy would stagnate in the first quarter but then accelerate to a 1.5 percent rate of growth in the second, although it was growing cautious about the latter forecast. He said that even though there was a high level of announced layoffs, the actual number of job losses often differed from announced plans. 

Indeed, employment in the three months through January rose by 113,000, despite the increase in layoff announcements. Still, that represented a rise at roughly half the rate of the previous year. Many of the job gains were in construction and agriculture, although technology actually showed an overall rise. 

Mr. Kasman said the economy could also show growth for a time even if corporate profits fell. He acknowledged that the outlook was weakening but said the Federal Reserve Board had already reduced short-term interest rates by a percentage point this year and was poised to give further aid to the economy. 

The Treasury bond market seemed to take the view that lower interest rates were likely. The yield on the 10-year bond fell to 5.11 percent from 5.19 percent Thursday. When investors are worried about the stock market, Treasury issues are often viewed as a safer alternative. 

The Dow Jones industrial average was finished 91.20 points lower, or 0.8 percent, at 10,799.82, and the Nasdaq composite was down 127.28 at 2,425.638. The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index lost 25.14, or 1.9 percent, to 1,301.47. 

Investors certainly seemed worried about telecommunications stocks, which were among the last of the sectors to fall from their heights of last year. With its fall Friday, Nortel's stock was trading at roughly 27 times its earnings of the past 12 months, down from a high of 146 times last March. 

On Friday, telecommunications-equipment leaders including JDS Uniphase, Cisco Systems, Corning, Lucent, Juniper Networks and even Ciena, which lifted the market Thursday with a positive outlook for the coming months, were lower.

Nortel stock loses $50b in value; Feared freefall will lower consumer confidence, sharpen market nerves

"The problem is what happens to the consumer now when they see what's happened to their own stock portfolio," said Andrew Pyle of Scotiabank.  

"The average Canadian may now say, 'That's it, I'm throwing in the towel on my own spending over the next few months,"' the markets expert said.  

But if spending stalls now, in a fragile economy, "we are all in for a bit of a rough ride," said Ted Carmichael, chief economist for J.P. Morgan.  

"What happened with Nortel is trimming significantly from the value of portfolios, from people's net worth," Carmichael said. "There are signs now it may begin to affect both the household wealth of Canadians and consumer confidence."  

The Toronto Stock Exchange 300, Canada's dominant index, dropped more than 600 points on opening yesterday as sell orders on Nortel rolled in.  

Overloaded TSE trading systems could not cope, a persistent problem for the country's major exchange.  

TSE officials said high Nortel volume caused the latest glitch.  

Orders were re-routed to the New York Stock Exchange as Nortel trading was halted off and on during the day.  

Nortel also trades in New York.  

The TSE 300 closed down 574 points to 8,393.23 -- a range it has not seen since January 2000. The index has lost 26.4 per cent since September.  

In the midst of a weakening tech sector, Nortel has been considered solid, and analysts continue to believe it should do well in the longer term.  

But it has gone straight down from a high of $125 last summer, aggravated by a massive selloff in October.  

Yesterday, Nortel closed well under a previous 52-week low of $42.46, dragging other major companies down, too.  

JDS Uniphase, Celestica and C-Mac Industries, which sell to Nortel, were down about 20 per cent in Toronto.  

On the New York Stock Exchange, Dell Computers and Hewlett-Packard joined Nortel in warning of deteriorating business.  

That market was also afflicted by a jump in U.S. inflation and by air strikes against Iraqi radar bases.  

Nortel dropped 33 per cent to $19.90 US in New York.  

The trigger for the Nortel selloff was chief executive John Roth's surprise announcement Thursday that profits and revenues would be only half as large as expected for the world's No. 1 supplier of fiber optics.  

Roth said Nortel must cut a total of 10,000 jobs and cannot rely on strong orders from the world's telecommunications companies anymore.  

"This has caused a lot of nervousness because there are so many people who own shares in Nortel," said Fred Ketchen, director of trading at Scotia McLeod in Toronto.  

"Many are seeing the value of their holdings disappear before their eyes."  

No one is talking yet about an outright recession. But economic difficulties may be worsening as the auto sector deteriorates, affecting the steel industry.  

High tech is sagging as well.  

"A drop like this in a firm like Nortel makes everybody even more nervous," said Kate Warne, Canadian market strategist for brokerage Edward Jones.  

"It's on top of months of announcements from other firms that the world doesn't look as bright as it used to."  

Roth's announcement that 2001 growth would be only 15 per cent caught the investment community off guard.  

It was only a few weeks ago that Nortel was predicting 30 per cent growth.  

"While there have been numerous profit warnings from across the tech and telecom sector in the past six months, this one was particularly shocking in timing and severity," the brokerage house BMO Nesbitt Burns wrote in a daily market report.  

"Nortel Network's latest profit warning flung a Scud missile into a languishing TSE."  

Lower spending by firms that buy equipment from Nortel was the cause of the problem, Roth has said.  

Turmoil in the markets, combined with pessimism in the U.S. over economic prospects, affected the Canadian dollar as well.  

It lost 0.41 cents to reach 64.97 cents US, the first time the currency has closed under 65 cents since December.  

"I'd say it's skittishness surrounding the stock market. And the outlook for Nortel in particular that has produced the selloff in the Canadian dollar," said Rob Palombi, senior fixed income analyst at Standard and Poor's in Toronto.  

Finance Minister Paul Martin, in Italy for a meeting of the G-7 finance ministers, said there was no serious reason for concern.  

Canada remains in a better position to weather economic turbulence than the United States, Martin said.  

But economists like Carmichael of J.P. Morgan said there was no reason to be too smug.  

"When it became apparent the U.S. economy was slowing down, a lot of Canadian economists maintained we would not slow down as much," Carmichael said.  

"But really, the data we've been seeing lately will confirm Canada is quite exposed.  

"These developments with Nortel suggest the Canadian economy is slowing down rapidly, too."  

Nortel, always a major force in the Canadian markets, has seen its value on the TSE 300 index eroded dramatically in the last six months.  

A Nortel bloodbath in October pushed the TSE 300 down 840 points, its biggest point loss in history.  

That dive ripped $75 billion from the company's market capitalization.

 Companies: Dell to Eliminate About 1,700 Jobs In Central Texas

 NEW YORK -- Dell Computer Inc. said it is eliminating about 1,700 jobs in its Central Texas operations, or about 4% of its total work force, reducing its head count for the first time in its 16-year history. 

 Most of the cuts are in administrative, marketing and product-support functions, and reductions are being made at all organizational levels, the Round Rock, Texas, computer maker said. 

 The cuts come on top of a series of moves intended to counter an industry slowdown. Dell already has frozen most hiring, barred travel unrelated to sales calls, and cut some marketing programs. 

 Dell said many of the reductions involve positions made redundant by the recent reorganization of several Dell business units. Others are the result of Dell's lowered expectations for industry and company growth, the company said. 

 Last month, while warning that his company wouldn't meet Wall Street analysts' earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, Dell Chief Executive Michael S. Dell said the company would cut costs to improve profit margins. Dell was slated to report quarterly results Thursday after the market closed. 

 Dell said that as of the end of its fourth quarter, it employed 22,000 people in Central Texas and 40,200 world-wide.

 Telecommunications giant Nortel Networks issued a profit and revenue warning after markets closed yesterday, saying it would cut a total of 10,000 jobs this year - 6,000 more than previously announced. 

 It cited the economic downturn in the US economy which it said was proving to be sharper than expected. "While we previously noted that economic uncertainties and capital constraints were impacting our outlook, we are now seeing a faster and more severe economic downturn in the United States, which we now expect will result in a slower overall market growth of approximately 10 per cent in 2001," said Nortel Networks president and chief executive officer Mr John Roth.

 Techs up before  warning  Rosy  profit  news from Ciena offset by Nortel guidance after market close

 U.S.-based networking-equipment firm Ciena Corp. jump-started an impressive technology rally yesterday in both New York and Toronto by reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profit and topping it off with an upbeat forecast -- but that was before Nortel Networks Corp. shocked the Street by lowering its growth outlook for 2001. 

 Just after trading closed, the key telecom player warned it foresees "a faster and more severe economic downturn in the United States." Nortel said it expects to cut about 10,000 jobs this year as part of its realignment. Nortel's new guidance caused sentiment to shift quickly. The company's stock plunged to less than $23 (U.S.) in U.S. after-hours trading from its $29.75 close on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Fibre-optics giant JDS Uniphase Corp. slumped to $42 from its close of $45.12 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while Cisco Systems Inc. dropped to $28.37 from its Nasdaq close of $30.81. 

 The Nortel warning came as a cruel disappointment for tech bulls who had been heartened by Ciena's cheerful news. 

 Ciena's profit of 18 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31 exceeded analysts' expectation of 15 cents, and far outshone the company's year-earlier performance of 3 cents. With that rosy news at a time other companies are warning of slowing growth and slumping profits, Ciena stock jumped as high as $94 on the Nasdaq, before closing at $89, up 16 per cent. 

 Encouraged by Ciena's positive results, market bulls returned to the recently battered technology sector.Tech bigwigs such as JDS, Cisco, Intel Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Oracle Corp. rose, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index up 61.51 points to 2,552.91. 

 "Money had been waiting on the sidelines for an impetus to go back into techs," said George Rodriguez, senior vice-president of Guzman & Co. in Jersey City, N.J. "Techs are part of investors' diet, but they had forced themselves not to have any for the past six months or so." 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index ended up 55.79 points to 8,967.27. Nortel, which accounts for nearly 20 per cent of the index, rose $1.14 (Canadian) to $46.15. 

 Celestica Inc., Ballard Power Systems Inc., Research In Motion Ltd., Descartes Systems Group Inc. and Mitel Corp. joined Nortel on the advancers list, helping push the TSE 300's industrial products subindex up nearly 2.5 per cent. 

 A mix of enthusiasm and bargain-hunting pushed the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been on the downswing for the past couple of days, up 95.61 points to 10,891.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 10.69 points to 1,326.61. 

 The Canadian Venture Exchange's CDNX index closed up 7.09 points at 3,221.08.

 Feb 16, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - TOP STORIES: 

 Nasdaq tumbles on Nortel profit warning

 New York-Feb. 16-The Nasdaq was sitting at its session lows in morning trade. Traders say analysts were "blindsided" by Nortel's (CA;NT) profit warning Thursday and are worried that other networking companies will revise down their already lowered estimates. As for the stronger-than-expected PPI, one trader said inflation is not the main concern of the Fed right now and that if the profit warnings continue, it may force the Fed to act "sooner rather than later." The Nasdaq composite average was down 116 points, or 4.56%, at 2436 and the Dow Jones industrial average was down 63 points at 10,827. ( Story .1300 ) 

 US dollar boosted briefly by producer prices 

 New York-Feb. 16-The dollar initially strengthened across the board on news of a much 1tronger-than-expected gain in U.S. January producer prices, before quickly returning those gains. The euro is stuck in the low 91.00-cents area. The currency remained firm even though the U.S. Treasury said it is sticking to its strong dollar policy. An earlier newspaper report quoted Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill as saying the United States has no such policy. ( Story .901 ) 

 US Treasuries lower following producer price news 

 New York-Feb. 16-Treasuries moved lower as stronger-than-expected producer price index and housing starts data added to doubts that the Fed would cut rates by half a percentage point at its March policy meeting. Weaker-than-expected industrial production and falling stock prices limited the losses. The 30-year bond was down 12/32 at 98, and the 10-year note was down 7/32 at 98 12/32. The 2-year note was up 2/32 at 99 27/32. ( Story .312 ) 

 Europe stock markets drop as telecom rebound short-lived 

 London-Feb. 16-An early rebound in the European telecoms sector proved short-lived after Moody's downgraded France Telecom. A new wave of concerns about fiscal health of telecommunications stocks also encouraged selling. Losses in telecommunications shares pulled the FSTE Eurotop-100 index down 2.1% to 3372.61 points. ( Story .1165 ) 

 German Bunds follow Treasuries lower 

 London-Feb. 16-German government bonds, or Bunds, have fallen back along with slumping Treasuries after the release of strong producer price data in the United States. The March Bund future has dropped 15 ticks to 108.62. ( Story .337 ) 

 OF INTEREST: 

 Japan stocks end down 1.1% 

 Tokyo-Feb. 16-The NikkYi closed lower as network issues faced a sell-off due to a profit warning from Nortel Networks Corp. (CA;NT), while concerns over weak Nasdaq futures on Globex pressured select technology issues. Trading was light as investors adopted a wait-and-see stance ahead of the Group of Seven meeting on Saturday. The Nikkei ended down 152 points, or 1.1%, at 13,175. ( Story .1105 ) 

 Japan bonds end nearly flat 

 Tokyo-Feb. 16-March 10-year yen bond futures closed a tick down in choppy trade while market players adjusted their positions ahead of the Group of Seven meeting this weekend. Cash bonds also remained quiet. March futures closed at 137.63 yen, down 0.01, while the yield on the benchmark No. 228 Feb 10-year cash bond stood unchanged at 1.400%.

 Nortel issues  profit warning , cuts more jobs, citing severe US downturn

 TORONTO, Feb 15 (AFP) - Nortel Networks issued a profit and revenue warning on Thursday after markets closed, saying it would cut a total of 10,000 jobs -- 6,000 more than previously announced -- due to a faster, more severe economic downturn in the US economy. 

 "While we previously noted that economic uncertainties and capital constraints were impacting our outlook, we are now seeing a faster and more severe economic downturn in the United States which we now expect will result in a slower overall market growth of approximately 10 percent in 2001," said Nortel Networks president and CEO John Roth. 

 The firm anticipates growth in revenues and earnings per share in 2001 over 2000 of 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. 

 For the first quarter of 2001, Nortel expect revenues of 6.3 billion dollars US and a loss per share from operations of four cents US on a diluted basis. 

 After announcing cuts of some 4,000 jobs in early January, the telecommunications giant now estimates a reduction of 10,000 jobs in 2001, compared to its total workforce at the end of last year. 

 "Approximately 6,000 employees have been addressed to date," a company statement said, adding that the effect will be minimized by normal attrition, including retirement.

INVESTORS ABANDON DOW FOR NASDAQ TECHS

Tech stocks gave investors a Valentine's Day gift yesterday, gaining ground in a rally that market watchers hope signals an end to the continued losses of the past few months. 

Still, blue chips dropped on continuing earnings fears and uncertainty over the future trend of interest rates. 

The Nasdaq gained 63.68 to 2,491.40 yesterday as investors found the bargains, particularly in the semiconductor sector, too attractive to resist. 

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 107.91 to 10,795.41, while the broader S&P 500 slid 2.88 to 1,315.92. 

"It was a very important day for technology," said Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "I think this is part of a major bottoming effort, [but] it's not over. My guess is it's going to take time." 

Money manager Michael Holland said the Dow's poor performance yesterday, despite Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's assurances earlier this week that the country is not in a recession, shows that the Fed has lost credibility among investors. 

"They're not really sure that everything is just fine," Holland said. "On a day like today people are voting that Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve may not be closing in on reality here." 

Holland added: "The market believes the Fed erred" by keeping the money supply too tight and by raising rates too much. 

But Canelo said bad economic news could be good news for stocks. 

"I'm very bullish," he said. "Once the Fed starts cutting interest rates is the best time to be in the stock market, bar none." 

3M led the Dow lower, falling $3.17 to $110.97, joined by Johnson &Johnson which fell $1.25 to $95.65, and Procter &Gamble which slipped 86 cents to $73.69. 

McGraw-Hill, publisher of Business Week magazine, fell $4.40 to $58.15, after warning of a sharply lower-than-expected quarterly profit. 

On the Nasdaq, chip-equipment maker Applied Materials led the high-flying semi-conductors upward, gaining $5.56, or 13.5%, to $46.81 and Intel climbed $1.69 to $34.13.

 BANK HAWKS ON WRONG ROUTE.

 double desbank. Never mind that underlying February tion has tumbled to 1.8pc, that Greenspan is still warning of stall in the American economy after a 1pc cut in interest rates, or that barely a day goes by without a quoted company issuing a profit warning. The Old Lady of although needle Street is refusing to lose her concentration. Sure, as arch-hawk the Bank's deputy governor Mervyn King has noted, the risks to growth and inflation at present are on the downside. In other words it is more likely that British output will tank and prices fall even further below target in the coming months. in get this and the fact that the Bank acknowledges that the MPC is divided on this point. 

 THE Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) plainly is determined to wrestle the mantle of the soundest central bank in the West from the pre-euro German 

 King apparently believes there is no point in fiddling around with interest rate changes now. The 

 cut by a quarter-point to 

 5.75pc was no more than a preemptive move in case the slowdown has a bigger impact on Britain than expected. But he remains fixed on the medium-term horizon and the belief that inflation may drift down in 2001, it will pick back up towards 2.5pc on the two-year horizon. 

 It is his view that business and consumer confidence remain at record levels and that, as output continues to grow at around trend rates, supply bottlenecks resulting higher wages and prices will occur. 

 At present there is no definitive evidence that the British economy is enjoying American-style productivity gains, and the drop in prices which has occurred is largely the result of fluctuations in energy prices and cannot be banked permanently. 

 Certainly, he is supported by the latest unemployment numbers which show that Labour is now within sight of achieving the rare of inflation below 2pc and the jobless rate under a million. 

 That will be at the core of Gordon Brown's electoral strategy. But the weakening global economy (outside Europe), which is already causing major shakeouts in the car and steel industry and is bruising the hi-tech economies of California and the Pacific Rim, will be an important countervailing factor. Thread-With real interest rates (interest rates adjusted for inflation) in Britain higher than any of the other richest nations, there does seem to be a case for gradual interest rate cutting. 

 Better to reduce interest rates now, at a time when the odds are more on the Governor Sir Eddie George having to write to the Chancellor explaining why inflation is undershooting, than waiting for confidence to fall off a cliff as could easily happen after the election, as in the US. King denies that 

 there is a disinflationary bias at the MPC. But the Bank's recent history and its forecast for the next 12 months suggest otherwise. 

 SO now we know what an Abbey National defence document would look like if it is required to fend off the bear hug from Sir Brian Pitman and Peter Ellwood (see inter-view page 80). 

 The real strength of Abbey, and this a testimony to Ian Harley's stewardship, has been its skill in switching from mortgage bank to diversified financial institution. As a result it is a more nimble institution than Lloyds TSB and able to put on profits growth of 11pc - which is higher than Lloyds managed last year. 

 The critical numbers are that diversification from mortgages now produces 53pc of earnings and that the cost-income ratio stands at 40.2pc. 

 The relative efficiency will make it that much harder for Lloyds to squeeze costs without even heavier job losses and branch closures than outlined. 

 Moreover, Abbey has been able to kick into touch misinformation on its record in current account banking, where it is putting on 5,000 customers a week or 250,000 a year, despite being outside the inner circle of clearing banks which dominate the money transmission systems. infla-All this should be reasonable news for Abbey shareholders. If Lloyds TSB should be cleared as a buyer by the OFT, then Abbey should be able to force the price higher than the 1325p a share (a 36pc premium) currently on the table. 

 The second option of a non-premium merger with Bank of Scotland may mean a less favourable exit for Abbey's army of small shareholders, but the potential for future growth if BoS chief Peter Burt and Harley can blend their different management styles. 

 The third possible outcome, that of Abbey independence, clearly can work as the Abbey results show. 

 But that would be bitterly disappointing for shareholders looking for the exit profit they have been dreaming of since flotation.

 LONDON -- European technology stocks were early Wednesday afternoon, pressuring the broader markets as investors sold their holdings amid profit warnings and downgrades.   

 Bookham Technology slid after it said slower demand for one of its major products will lead to weaker growth in the first half. The British optical components manufacturer, which issued a profit warning in January, said its pretax losses in 2000 widened to GBP 29 million ($42.1 million), from a GBP 15.9 million loss a year earlier. Bookham shares were down 9.6%.   

 The Dow Jones Stoxx Index was down 4.39 points to 349.74. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in countries that joined the common currency, dropped 6.23 points to 377.77.   

 The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index was down 66.5 points to 4354.6, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 was down 76.7 ponts to 4553.7. The technology subindex led decliners, falling 5%, while the telecommunications subindex dropped 3.9%.   

 The technology subindex has fallen more than 18% since the beginning of the year.   

 European chip manufacturers tumbled after Credit Suisse First Boston cut its rating for industry leader Intel and said a recovery in the group this year is "unlikely." Confidence in technology shares was shaken further after JDS Uniphase, the world's largest fiber-optics components manufacturer, warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations.   

 Chip manufacturer Infineon was down 7.5% in Frankfurt, while STMicroelectronics was down 5.4% in Paris. Chip designer ARM Holdings was off 6.8% in London. Chip equipment maker ASM Lithography dropped 8.8% in Amsterdam.   

 Other blue-chip technology issues fell, reflecting the overall gloom that hung over the industry. Networking company Alcatel dropped 6.6% in Paris. Philips Electronics fell 3.2% in Amsterdam. Mobile phone manufacturer Ericsson slid 5.2%.   

 Stocks also retreated following comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the economic weakness experienced in the fourth quarter didn't continue into January. Some interpreted his comments to mean that the Fed won't cut interest rates soon.   

 Michael O'Sullivan, European strategist at Commerzbank in London, said disappointment about Mr. Greenspan's comments hurt interest-rate sensitive technology stocks. With no interest-rate cut in sight, the focus has returned to the performance of companies and industries.

 N.Y. Stocks End Mixed, But This Time, Tech Prevails

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. equities finished mixed in another of Wall Street's maddening bipolar sessions, with technology issues progressing at the expense of the broad list. 

 Shares of Juniper Networks finished $10.50 better at $89.38 a share in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, as the stock, which has ignored analysts' entreaties recently, responded favorably to some accolades from an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 

 Oracle advanced 2.44 to 25 on Nasdaq, as part of a recovery in the recently beleaguered software sector. BEA Systems also finished higher, gaining 5.75 to 53, while Veritas Software improved 6.75 to 76.38, both on Nasdaq. 

 The gains came after investors reacted optimistically to fundamental developments in other areas of high technology. Applied Materials, for example, reported quarterly results after the close of trading Tuesday that topped the targets the company had helped analysts establish. Shares rose 5.56 to 46.81 in Nasdaq trading Wednesday. 

 Still, there was a measure of counterintuitiveness to the gains, since all Applied Materials did was top profit goals the company had earlier drawn down, and then it warned that capital spending on chip-making equipment was waning. 

 So, too, Sycamore Networks finished 3.75 higher at 26.31 on Nasdaq, even though analysts weren't all that enthused about the fiber optic products maker's quarterly results, which came out late Tuesday. Thomas Weisel Partners, for example, cut its rating on the stock to buy from strong buy, saying it would come back to the stock with an eye toward restoring the strong buy rating when the company's financial visibility improved. 

 Despite the fundamental stumbling blocks, technology stocks overall rallied, carrying the Nasdaq Composite Index 63.69 points higher, a gain of 2.62%, to 2491.41. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which traded above the 11,000-point mark intraday as recently as Tuesday, trailed lower,  ending 107.91 points weaker, a loss of 0.99%, at 10795.41. 

 "This market is moving back and forth like a pendulum," Brian Belski, chief fundamental strategist at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said Wednesday. "We hit the value stocks the last couple days, and now we've swung back into the growth camp." 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,385 issues advancing, 1,711 declining and 200 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,110,251,390 shares, compared with 1,061,901,200 Tuesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 652.03, down 5.69. The average price per share fell 34 cents. 

 Proof that momentum, rather than fundamentals, drove the direction of trading Wednesday could be found in the stocks that moved lower for the session. They included capital equipment stocks, such as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, which fell 3.17 to 110.97, and Honeywell, which lost 1.03 to 47.67, as well as consumer-products issues, such as H.J. Heinz, which sank 2.07 to 43.02, and Gillette, which lost 65 cents to 32.20. Both groups came into Wednesday's session with strong gains in recent trading. 

 Some of the losses in consumer products reflected spillover from a profit warning out of ConAgra. The Omaha,  Neb., food maker warned that its profits will fall short of projections for the remaining two quarters of its fiscal year. The stock sagged 4.85 to 20.01. 

 Shares of Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream also lost ground, falling 4.94 to 30.06, while Hershey Foods retreated 1.40 to 63.52, and Smithfield Foods stumbled 1.25 to 28.85. 

 Shares of Campbell Soup eased 71 cents to 30.02. The food maker posted fiscal second-quarter results that proved a little stronger than analysts anticipated. However, the company said it continued to spend heavily on  marketing to support its soup sales. 

 Clear Channel Communications advanced 1 to 59.02, after the San Antonio radio station owner reported fourth-quarter results after the close of trading Tuesday,  and reduced its outlook for growth in 2001. Nevertheless,  analysts responded favorably; Lehman Brothers, in a research note, said the company is well positioned to exceed its conservative operating projections. 

 Brocade Communications managed to post a gain of 81 cents to reach 54.25 on Nasdaq. The San Jose, Calif., maker of networking switches, which fell 15% Tuesday, came  back despite some cautious comments from analysts about its outlook. 

 JDS Uniphase shares lost ground intraday, falling to a  52-week low of 36.75, but rebounded to close 2.75 higher at 41.25 on Nasdaq. The move came a day after the fiber-optic equipment maker, whose operations now include the former SDL, warned that its results after the merger this week would come in short of analysts' forecasts. 

 AT&T Wireless lost 1.32 to 21.69. The wireless service  provider's parent, AT&T, said that it will retain about $3 billion worth of the wireless operation's shares after it spins the unit off, catching by surprise investors who had expected the company to distribute all its holdings. 

 AT&T shares lost 72 cents to 21.76. 

 KLA-Tencor jumped 6 to 43.13 on Nasdaq, after J.P. Morgan raised its rating on some chip stocks, including KLA. 

 Varian Semiconductor, another name in the group J.P. Morgan helped, added 2.25 to 29.50 on Nasdaq. 

 Shares of programmable chip makers finished better, with Altera adding 2.31 to 30, while Xilinx improved 3.50 to 51.25, both on Nasdaq. 

 Ciena advanced 7.63 to 76.81 on Nasdaq, after UBS Warburg made some optimistic comments about the telecommunications equipment maker's quarterly results, which are due out Thursday. 

 ONI Systems gained 6.88 to 47.75 on Nasdaq. Both Lehman Brothers and Thomas Weisel Partners issued some upbeat comments about the San Jose, Calif., fiber-optic equipment maker. 

 CNF gained 1.46 to 36.50. Salomon Smith Barney boosted  its rating on the Palo Alto, Calif., freight-hauling concern. 

 WellPoint Health Networks increased 4.58 to 104.90. The Thousand Oaks, Calif., health-care provider reported fourth-quarter results Tuesday that topped what analysts had been expecting. Bear Stearns boosted its earnings forecast for 2001. 

 Allegiance Telecom fell 2.81 to 21.94 on Nasdaq. The Dallas telecom service provider reported fourth-quarter results that disappointed versus analysts' forecasts. CIBC  World Markets said it remains cautious on the sector for the next quarter or two, based on what it saw in the results. 

 Lockheed Martin fell 1.09 to 35.82. The Bethesda, Md.,  aerospace and defense systems maker said it plans to wring $2.8 billion of costs out of its operations by the end of 2003.

DEFUSING TIME BOMBS FORUMS HELP TEACHERS SPOT TROUBLE

Edith Dunn has just ushered her first-graders out the door at Valley Academy Charter School.  

Now she has settled inside the school's small cafeteria with three dozen other employees for a 90-minute workshop on preventing school violence.  

"I never even thought it was a necessary part of teaching," said Dunn, who has worked at the school near 15th Avenue and Union Hills Drive in Phoenix for six years.  

For Dunn and other school employees, knowing how to prevent violence is quickly becoming a part of their jobs.  

A non-profit Valley agency has stepped in to help.  

Touchstone Communities Inc., a mental health agency, has developed a program designed to help school staff members identify violent traits in students and keep that violence from escalating.  

The School Violence Prevention Program started after the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, which left 12 students and one teacher dead and touched off numerous copycat threats at Valley schools.  

Repeated calls from local schools for crisis counselors prompted Touchstone Communities to offer the free workshop.  

"What we found out was there was a real need to talk a little bit more about prevention," said therapist Kris Kirchner, who conducts many of the workshops. "We are a very reactive society, and it's very easy to get into a pattern of reacting to situations."  

School employees -- everyone from the principal to the custodian -- learn the character traits that could lead to violence. These include withdrawal, skipping school, bullying and uncontrollable outbursts of anger. Suicide threats, lack of parent involvement and violent drawings or writings also can be signs of potential violence.  

"When schools become aware of characteristics, they can identify the students and get them the help they need," said Steve Ginsberg, chief operating officer for Touchstone Communities.  

Kirchner warns teachers that one trait by itself doesn't mean the student is going to come into the classroom with a gun. Rather, it's a combination of traits that could lead to a child taking out aggression on fellow students.  

Teachers are in a position to recognize this, Kirchner said, because "kids spend more time in the classroom than they do at home."  

As Kirchner ticked off the violent traits to watch for, several teachers in the audience nodded their heads in agreement. They can identify with the boy who pulls the thumbtack off the bulletin board and pokes another student. They recognize the playground fight that spills over into the classroom.  

Teachers need to be concerned about violence, even at the kindergarten level, teacher Pat Trotter said. She deals with some kindergartners who are angry and don't know how to express it properly.  

Even though Trotter has taught school for 21 years, she walked out of the School Violence Prevention Program workshop with new information.  

"I have the encouragement to not give up on a child that is demonstrating some of these behaviors," she said. "To look a little deeper. Since it's not an academic problem per se, we might not have our flag raised. This is a more whole look at the child."  

Since Touchstone began offering the School Violence Prevention Program, 15 schools have signed up for the free workshop. For information, call (623) 930-8705, Ext. 117.

 An imminent US downturn is making investors wary of UK prospects 

 While the nation obsesses over Peter Mandelsons indiscretions and Keith Vazs social circle in the run-up to the election, economists are keeping an eye on the UK economy, which is showing signs of slowing. 

 The biggest worry is that an imminent downturn in the US may adversely affect the British economy and pull it into recession. US GDP grew by an annualised 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2000, down from 5 per cent in the first half of the year. 

 US manufacturing is already in recession and, in January, consumer confidence sank to its lowest level for over four years, according to the Conference Board. 

 The UK economy is also slowing. Output grew by 0.5 per cent in the final quarter of 2000, down from 0.75 per cent in the third and 1 per cent in the second. Although personal consumption remains strong, households budgets are already stretched. At the same time, world trade is cooling off. The US economic slowdown is already taking effect with 14 per cent of profit warning companies citing poor US sales as affecting their profits. 

 But the outlook is not all negative. Important European markets continue to grow, leaving the UK well-placed to weather a US slowdown. The Ernst & Young Item Club UK Economic Prospects report for winter 2001 claims the downside risk resembles those of 1998 although it does warn that recent developments in the US have increased risks. 

 The Goldman Sachs Global Economics Weekly report for 17 January 2001 states that the UK is well protected from a US recession. A drop in exports to the US of 6 per cent would reduce euro-land GDP by 0.1 per cent. 

 The indicators are so ambiguous there seems no consensus on what the year ahead holds for the UK economy. Stewart Robertson, an UK economist at Lombard Street Research, an economic consultancy, was bullish about 2001 and dismissed the pessimism as media hype: "The panic is overstated. I dont even think the US is going into recession despite Greenspans incompetence." 

 He said although manufacturing had done badly and consumer confidence was low because of media speculation, other US indicators were more positive. "The mortgage market is doing well and, with the recent cut in interest rates, it can only get better." 

 Even if the US goes into recession, Mr Robertson did not see the UK being affected. "The US economy is less important to the UK than Europe." In fact, he sees a good outlook for the UK. "Even the weakest sectors like manufacturing are doing well. The consumer and housing markets are also on the up." He thought any cuts in interest rates the Monetary Policy Committee did make this month would be reversed in the second half of the year. 

 Nigel Morgan, an economics strategist at Old Mutual, was less optimistic about UK prospects. He believes the UK is slowing down like the US. "Were not slowing as fast, but then again our growth rate was not as high." He said the economies of Japan and Europe were also slowing. "If everybody around us is slowing, it seems logical that we are. 

 "We are practically in a recession now as the figures for growth in the last quarter were near zero." But he did expect the gradual easing of monetary and fiscal policy would bring a prosperous second half of the year. "The Bank of England should cut interest rates and Gordon Brown should make some tax cuts before the next election. These measures should ease the UK economy off the rocks." 

 Donui Agbokou, an UK analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the investment bank had cut its prediction of UK growth to 2.4 per cent from 2.7 per cent because of the US economic slowdown, but was not alarmed by 2001 forecasts. "The US slowdown will only affect the UK economy a little. The UK economy has strength of its own. Domestic demand is still strong and public spending will also come into the picture soon. This will compensate for any trouble in the US." 

 But she did see a similar pace of change to Mr Morgan. "The first half of this year will probably be quite slow but, with the right monetary and fiscal policies, things should improve in the third and fourth quarters." The only variance from this might come because of the unexpectedly severe slowdown in the fourth quarter of last year. "There might be a bounce back in the first quarter of this year but it would be artificial." 

 Sharda Dean, an UK economist at Schroder Investment Management, took a similar view: "Were predicting UK growth to be about 2.4 per cent this year." She said this was the result of the US economic downturn as 3 to 4 per cent of the UKs GDP depended on exports to the US. 

 But the UK would not be as badly hit as the US. "The UK has not been growing at the same speed as the US." Furthermore, she was optimistic the UK consumer sector would remain buoyant and inflation would stay low. "The Bank of England will cut interest rates by 100 percentage points over the next year," she said. 

 All this leaves the investor back where he started. Pundits range from the pessimistic to the optimistic. It seems, as always in economics, a question of wait and see.

Schlumberger Ltd., the New York energy-services company that has begun branching out into technology, is negotiating to buy Sema, a European information-technology company, in a deal valued around 3.5 billion pounds, or a little more than $5 billion, people involved in the talks said Sunday. Last month, Sema hired Rothschild and Credit Suisse First Boston to explore its options after a profit warning related to its $4.7 billion acquisition of LHS, a U.S. telecommunications software company. Sema's board met on Friday to consider a Schlumberger offer, these people said, adding that a decision could be reached in the next few weeks.

The Australian dollar is back on struggle street and the sharemarket looks set for five days of arduous trading as investors flip a coin on the outlook for global growth.

The opening act for equity markets this week was played out on Friday night with the US Nasdaq stock index falling more than 3.5 per cent.

The local market looks set to respond and the share price futures index on the S&P/ASX200 is likely to open below 3300 for the first time in more than a month.

The chief economist at ComSec, Mr Craig James, said investors in local equities were likely to retreat to the relative safety of the sidelines until clarity develops about economic prospects.

"Decisive rate cuts have have reduced the odds of a V-shaped recovery in the US, but it is far from a foregone conclusion. While US sharemarkets gravitate between optimism and pessimism, earnings results from a number of high-profile Australian companies will set direction for the All Ordinaries in the coming week," he said.

Of those high-profile companies, Foster's Brewing is the first to kick off today, followed by the interim profit results for Western Mining on Tuesday.

Foster's interim result is expected to be down 1.5 per cent to $239.8 million.

The Foster's result will arrive in the aftermath of last week's action by Lion Nathan to cement its control of a New Zealand wine company, Montana Group, out-bidding the $NZ4.40 per share bid by British drinks giant Allied Domecq plc.

An equities strategist at Macquarie Bank, Mr Tim Rocks, said the bid for Montana Wines by Lion and Domecq had "led to a positive rerating of all the wine stocks in the market."

Meanwhile, the retail sector remains the focus of attention with the entry of the Aldi chain. Mr Rocks said: "We are reasonably confident that Woolworths is well positioned for [the Aldi entry] and may be able to hold its position in the retail sector. However, we are less confident about Coles Myer, which doesn't have clear-cut plan to cope with the situation."

Coles stock will open at $6.24 today, having fallen 5.4 per cent last week after a profit warning.

Other reports expected this week are the annual results for Cochlear due today, and interim results for Boral and Publishing and Broadcasting due on Thursday.

In currency and debt markets, the mood will be set by today's Quarterly Policy Statement by the Reserve Bank, which, according to the general manager of economics at Westpac, Mr Bill Evans, "will provide much more evidence on the Bank's current assessment of the state of the economy".

The chief economist at HSBC, Dr John Edwards, said while it would be difficult for the RBA to say anything different to last week's statement accompanying the rate cut, "the risk is that it will talk the economy up, offering some support to the currency and weighing on the debt market".

The $A is vulnerable to a fresh bout of short selling after falling below US53.5¢ towards the end of last week. Any potential recovery in the local currency was capped by comments by US Federal Reserve officials on Friday night hinted that expected rate cuts in the US might not be as severe as previously thought.

Long-dated bonds rallied on the news, with the local benchmark 10-year yield falling to 5.30 per cent from 5.35 per cent.

Published Correction date: 02/18/2001 - Clarification: Some sharks die if they stop swimming; others don't. Some species, such as the nurse shark, have special muscles to pump water through their gills, so they can rest on the ocean floor. But most of more than 300 species of sharks lack such mechanisms, so they must move to breathe. This story profiling an Internet company referred to a motto that said sharks die if they stop swimming. 

Since the market for technology stocks burst last March, hundreds of Internet companies have burned out of existence, costing thousands of jobs, destroying billions in stock-market wealth and challenging the gains promised by the New Economy. Now the question looms: Will dot-coms create lasting value? As the 6-year-old Cobalt Group set its budget for 2001, The Seattle Times went inside to see how an Internet company struggles to get ahead while those around it fail.

MONDAY, DEC. 4, 2000

Kevin Root pulls up to a conference table ringed by executives and launches his budget pitch. The faces looking back are serious. The strain of setting a spending plan for the coming year shows in the puffy skin around their eyes.

Most of Cobalt's rivals in the automotive Internet business went bust or laid off workers last year, and the executives know their future rides largely on budget choices. With the aim of reaching profitability this year and with just $16.6 million in the bank--about what Amazon.com spends every three days--Cobalt is careful about money.

How careful? Root's group, which trains auto dealers to use the Web as a sales tool, wants two new positions. That's not much for a growing company with 600 employees, particularly in a division with lucrative prospects.

But the executives reject Root's request. The jobs carry salaries of $45,000 and $90,000, plus bonuses and stock options. Even though Root's group is profitable and likely would make money on the investment, the execs decide the cash would be better used elsewhere.

"The goal is to be cash-flow positive by the end of 2001 and to do it with the money we have," says David Snyder, chief financial officer. "There are a lot of meritorious ideas that ... get traded off."

So it goes at Internet companies these days. Around the country, technology start-ups have been hammered by the business equivalent of a perfect storm: the combined force of faulty business plans, collapsing stock prices and a slowing economy. They have learned that on the Internet, as in the real world, the fundamental principles still apply. To survive, they must provide something of value that people want to buy, sell it for more than it costs to produce, and make their capital last until they break even.

These realities are changing the early aura that surrounded Internet companies. Employees now shudder at being called dot-com workers. Older workers are joining up, bringing experience that can help build a sustainable business. And grand concepts like being the online source for something, or everything, are giving way to a single-minded focus on money.

A report last week suggesting that Amazon.com might run out of cash this year, despite having more than $1 billion in the bank and laying off 1,300 workers to cut costs, shows just how important money has become.

But for Internet insiders, the long hours remain the same. It is late afternoon in the same Cobalt meeting room and, as popcorn and drinks arrive, the executives press on to other business: How to drive employees toward sales targets higher than what the company is telling Wall Street. Whether there's a "hole" in sales projections. Whether the products are as good as they need to be.

"The competition is coming up," says Mike Martinez, vice president of marketing. "We need to put money into new software to stay ahead."

John Holt, the chief executive, agrees. "We're raising prices," he says. "The products have to be better."

Holt is a rarity, a founding Internet CEO who still has his job. Many of the 20-year-olds who started dot-coms in recent years have ceded control to better managers or gone bust.

At 44, Holt has held his position for nearly six years and has no illusions about the board's readiness to replace him.

But he seems to have the right stuff. A former actor and fisherman, he has the presence of a leader, a manner that puts people at ease and some strong Old Economy values. Holt believes a person should be of use, and that's his goal at Cobalt. The business pays rents and mortgages for hundreds of people and holds a "sacred trust"--venture capital--that helped it get started. It may be exciting that Cobalt is an Internet company. But it's almost irrelevant. Holt wants to run a company that's built to last.

In his office--a corner of a renovated brick warehouse on First Avenue South near Safeco Field--an inflatable plastic shark hangs from a thick beam overhead. It's a reminder that Cobalt has to keep moving, Holt says. Sharks drown if they stop swimming.

TUESDAY, DEC. 5

NEW YORK - DoubleClick, the nation's leading online advertiser, said it is cutting staff, signaling the consequences of the slowdown in online ads may be worse than previously anticipated.

Cobalt has survived by going where the money is. Unlike rivals who sought to put car dealers out of business, Holt sought them as a source of revenue.

Back in 1995, he began persuading automakers and the nation's 22,000 auto dealers they should work together to control their brands on the Web. Today, Cobalt counts 8,500 dealers and 15 automakers among its clients, and has claimed a growing piece of nearly $13 billion they spend on marketing each year. Dealers pay a set-up fee to create their Web sites and a monthly amount thereafter to keep them running.

Cobalt's future depends not just on signing more customers, but on persuading dealers, who aren't known for being tech-savvy, to spend more each month for increasingly sophisticated Web sites.

At heart, Cobalt is a software company that, like Microsoft or Aldus, grows by selling new versions of its products. Cobalt is spending heavily to develop wholesale exchanges for parts and used cars. And it is overhauling its computer platform to give its software more scope for growth, make international expansion easier and attract programmers interested in working with cutting-edge computer languages.

Cobalt recently raised prices 5 percent, an increase capped by the National Automobile Dealers Association, which endorses its products. But many Cobalt sales people think the prices are too low, considering most dealers spend $20,000 a month on advertising. Cobalt's "essentials" package, which costs $350 up front and $359 a month, gives dealers a basic site, the ability to post inventories of new and used cars, e-mail forms and locator maps so people can find the dealership. The top package, at $1,500 up front and $1,499 a month, adds software to search for parts at other dealerships, sell a car online and e-mail reminders when customers need an oil change.

"The job now is to up-sell and cross-sell across the breadth of services they have," says Allyson Smith, an analyst at broker SG Cowen in San Francisco.

The slowing economy could threaten Cobalt if dealers cut ad spending. But dealers might also decide that in a tough environment they need to reach as many customers as possible. And 62 percent of new-car shoppers are expected to do research on the Internet before going to a showroom in 2001, up from 54 percent in 2000.

WEDNESDAY, DEC. 6

NEW YORK - Apple Computer said that it expects revenue will fall short of its target by $600 million and that it will post its first quarterly loss after 12 consecutive profitable quarters. The personal-computer maker blamed a "swift industrywide decline in PC sales," among other factors .

It's 2 p.m. and Kevin Root's team assembles in a conference room. Like a police chief sending his force on assignment, Root briefs them on the budget. The group gets no new staff unless it beats its revenue target of $1 million. Root wants them to aim higher, for $1.77 million. "If we shatter our numbers, we're all heroes," Root says. "We need to blow that number away."

Root drew up his budget using a technique he learned at Microsoft. Each team member estimates how much income they can generate; the combined total becomes the target. The system ensures everyone has a stake in the outcome. If one person fails, the team suffers.

"It's all driven by what's in it for me," Root tells his crew. "If you really kick ass, you get over 100 percent of your bonus pool. Likewise, we do not pay bonuses for below-average performance. In that case, you're just doing your job, and base pay covers that."

Finally, Root asks each team member to set personal goals. During quarterly reviews, 55 percent of their score hinges on whether budget targets are met.

"At the end of the day, all that matters is did we make it or not. That's what we care about," Root says. "That's what the Street cares about, that's what the board cares about. Excuses don't matter."

Growth has been one of the few constants at Cobalt, but now even that may be changing. Cobalt doubled in size last year, adding 300 people. But in 2001, only 70 new employees will be added. Ironically, this slowing may be a relief, bringing a degree of normalcy after nearly six years of breakneck expansion.

In other ways, change keeps coming. Cobalt has two people, Wendy Miles and Chris Bayless, who handle what it terms "process redesign." One of their biggest projects came last year when car dealers grew frustrated with customer service. Cobalt's service was built around five departments, and work was falling through the cracks because it relied on "sneakernet"--people walking orders from place to place.

In response to complaints, Holt and his team spent hours outlining a fix: Blow up the departments and build a new team. Last summer, they launched an amalgam of 120 people organized around car brands.

Cobalt twice reengineered its professional-services group, which builds custom Web sites. Initially, Web designers worked in a pool and were tapped for specific projects for big clients. The approach adjusted easily to changes in work flow, but knowledge about the clients was getting lost.

So a year ago, Cobalt organized the designers into teams for groups of automakers, such as Toyota-Lexus and Honda-Acura. But that system risked having expensive talent sit idle. So Cobalt changed the structure again, keeping part of each team but putting designers back into a pool to restore flexibility.

The work still isn't over. The budget process estimated each of the 69 people in creative services cost $27,000 a year more in salary than they generated in revenue.

That adds up to $1.9 million in lost income, 20 percent of the department's annual sales. As CFO Snyder put it in the budget meeting, "we're getting creamed in this piece of business."

The department is now looking for software that will track hours and projects.

THURSDAY, DEC. 7

NEW YORK - Motorola says it will cut 2,870 jobs, about 2.2 percent of the communication company's work force, and outsource the manufacturing of $1 billion of wireless-communications equipment.

Rajan Krishnamurty recently changed his hair color. To gray. Cobalt's 44-year-old chief technology officer, who spent 20 years at IBM, wanted everyone to know he'd stopped dyeing his hair. So with mock seriousness, he slipped three shots of the new do into a PowerPoint presentation at a company meeting. The audience roared.

Cobalt, like most Internet companies, still draws twentysomething programmers with brightly colored locks. But Cobalt has grown up and diversified. All of the executives are in their 40s, except for the sales chief, Terry Smail, who is 57, and Martinez, head of marketing, who at 35 is the only one without any gray.

It's a shift employees have noticed. When someone remarked recently that Cobalt was getting "the look of an old company, I said `Oh, my God,' because it has other connotations," such as bureaucracy and old thinking," says Julia Pizzi, vice president of human resources.

"But instead of all 20-year-olds running around, there's almost a sense of relief that there's someone sitting over there with experience. That's comforting."

The average age is 32. Only 42 percent of employees are technologically trained. A third are liberal-arts majors. And many bring experience from previous careers.

Mike Johnson spent 20 years as a construction worker. At 48, his sandy hair is flecked with gray, and his skin is tawny from outdoor work. Two years ago, tired of the unsteady pace of building houses, he pored over newspaper classifieds looking for a new career. Cobalt's ads jumped at him, he says, but "like everyone else, I was scared away by all the qualifications."

Tinkering with a home computer helped him land a job in a call center handling tech questions for frustrated Earthlink subscribers. He mustered the nerve to call Cobalt and was hired for a technical-support job.

His lack of formal training wasn't a problem. "Dot-coms are a lot more open-minded than old-style companies," he says.

Johnson also thinks his pay and career prospects are better than in the Old Economy. He's earning more than some people he knows with degrees, and he has stock options that could add to that total someday.

His son, Jason, joined Cobalt this week, something that sparks pride in the elder Johnson. "If I was 18 and had a chance to come into a company like this... " Johnson says.

One way Cobalt hopes to improve its products is by overhauling its computer architecture. The project, code named Phoenix, will cost $12 million over several years, a sum that makes it Cobalt's most ambitious undertaking to date.

Employees know about Phoenix, and an interim step, known as Falcon. But as the projects have advanced, the distinctions have grown fuzzy. Today, a meeting is called to define the projects so they can be explained to the company.

Seven people, including three vice presidents and an outside consultant, gather in a small meeting room to brainstorm analogies for Falcon. A Swatch watch (changeable, cost-effective, durable, cool). Lego building blocks (fun, easy, advanced, colorful). A factory.

No one likes the smokestack image, but it's true that Falcon will enable Cobalt to manufacture Web sites. So factory sticks.

It took an hour of banter--and lots of scribbling on a white board with multicolored markers--to come up with the simple image.

FRIDAY, DEC. 8

SEATTLE-- In a second round of layoffs, Network Commerce says it is cutting 85 jobs and closing a direct-marketing operation in San Francisco. The online-services provider has eliminated 167 jobs, or a fourth of its work force, in two months. An additional 59 workers at local dot-coms Net Nanny, iCopyright and Imandi.com lost their jobs this week.

It's 7:30 a.m., and the executive team is assembled in a conference room. Holt looks tired. His wristwatch is off and rests on the conference table beside the third mobile phone he's had in six months. (The others wore out.) The group discusses the National Automotive Dealers Association conference, coming up in February in Las Vegas. The event is the biggest in the automotive industry, drawing 35,000 people.

Among the many items Cobalt is preparing for the convention is a compact disc with car-related tunes to hand out. Cobalt has ordered 20,000 copies, at a cost of $120,000. Yet even on this item, its only giveaway for the year, it will be careful about costs. Only dealers will receive the freebie, not vendors or suppliers. Cobalt also is using the same booth it had last year, which was designed so the panels could be updated.

The budget has been finished in four weeks--on time--and Holt makes a point of thanking Kathy Ryan, 26, who has been crunching the numbers. Now the focus shifts forward. Cobalt will try to generate as much revenue as possible early in the year so monthly subscription revenue will build up by year's end. It also plans to push some major expenses, including part of Falcon, into the second half.

TUESDAY, DEC. 19

SEATTLE-- Microsoft's president sent an e-mail asking employees to cut spending "very significantly" in response to slowing growth and rising competition, a message that pushed its shares down 7 percent .

Cobalt's board assembles at 8 a.m. to approve the budget. Among them is Joe Landy, managing director of investment bank Warburg Pincus, which has put up most of the capital Cobalt will spend this year. No cell-phone calls interrupt the six-hour meeting. Holt and Snyder say recession, slowing car sales or problems at big automakers could blow Cobalt off course. But barring that, the company can break even on a cash-flow basis. The board's big question surprises Holt: Have you cut too much? "Should you take more money from us?" Landy asks. Holt and the others insist they don't need it.

TUESDAY, JAN. 9

SEATTLE-- Three analysts cut their investment ratings on Amazon.com's stock after the Internet retailer's fourth-quarter sales and profit missed Wall Street expectations. Separately, Loudeye Technologies laid off 50 people, or 18 percent of its staff, warning sales were falling significantly.

It's just after 9 a.m., and Cobalt's auditorium is teeming as hundreds of employees arrive for the monthly company meeting. Holt, in jeans and a turtleneck, hops onstage to reveal the good news: Cobalt will break even this year. "When companies do that they are permanent," he says. "We're about 10 months away. It's close enough that we can almost taste it."

But the focus on money doesn't stop there. Cobalt always ends these monthly gatherings with hero awards, and today Brent Rannow, a 28-year-old technician, is among the winners. While moving 175 phone lines in December to accommodate Cobalt's growth, he saved $9,000 by canceling lines that weren't being used.

"Congratulations," says Holt, as he hands Rannow his prize. "That's 108 grand a year!"

 Companies: Dell Computer Is Set to Impose Deep Expense Cuts --- Move Amid PC Market Slump Could Include First Layoffs

 Dell Computer Corp., after slashing prices amid a sagging personal-computer market, is gearing up for deep expense cuts that could include the first layoffs in the company's 16-year history. 

 The Round Rock, Texas, computer company recently told managers to prepare for 8% to 10% expense cuts, according to people familiar with the directive. The cuts would be on top of a series of moves intended to counter an industry slowdown. Dell already has frozen most hiring, barred travel unrelated to sales calls and cut some marketing programs. 

 A spokesman for Dell said he wasn't aware of any broad reductions. 

 Last month, while warning Dell wouldn't meet Wall Street expectations for its fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, Dell Chief Executive Michael S. Dell said it would cut costs to improve profit margins. Mr. Dell then said, "Our businesses will make (expense) adjustments as they see necessary to be sure we remain competitive." 

 Some employees believe the company could be preparing to eliminate as many as 4,000 positions through a combination of outright job cuts and an annual performance review, beginning as early as next week. Every year, Dell's 36,000 full-time employees are ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 and each February, the company typically dismisses or places on a probation any employee ranked in the bottom fifth. 

 Amid the softest PC market in recent history, Dell has launched a price war in an attempt to pressure weaker rivals and grab market share. PC shipments last year rose just 9.2% as home-PC sales slumped late in the year, according to market researcher International Data Corp. 

 Dell, which records about $32 billion (34.37 billion euros) in annual revenue, is expected to report fourth quarter results Feb. 15. In January, Dell projected profit of 18 cents to 19 cents a diluted share, well below Wall Street expectations, on revenue of $8.6 billion, up about 26% from the previous year. 

 It also warned that the price cutting would pare gross margins, or profits after manufacturing costs, by three percentage points from the previous year. 

 Analysts believe that fears of a recession are prompting U.S. companies to cut computer budgets, putting new pressure on PC sales this year. 

 David Bailey, an analyst at brokers Gerard Klauer Mattison, said new cuts at Dell would indicate that PC demand continues to sag. Most PC makers have indicated they don't see demand perking up until the second half of the year at the earliest. 

 "I think this is not going to be viewed as trimming the fat, but as preparing for slower growth," Mr. Bailey said. 

 The company late last year advised managers to scrutinize all costs, even asking them to return unneeded company-issued pagers. Dell also closed an online procurement business called Dell Marketplace. The business was launched last September and designed to allow Dell customers to buy and sell using Dell's electronic commerce capabilities.

 CHICAGO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Saks Holdings Inc. fell more than 12 percent on Friday and analysts cut earnings estimates for the retailer after the company warned of lower fourth-quarter profits. 

 Shares of Birmingham, Ala.-based Saks were off $1.67 at $11.93 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Before the Thursday earnings warning, the stock had been marching steadily higher and was not far from its 52-week high of $15.06. 

 On Thursday Saks, which operates regional department stores such as Carson Pirie Scott and Younkers as well as the luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue, said its fourth-quarter sales rose 4 percent to $2.12 billion but forecast that profits would fall short of the 98 cents a share it earned in the same quarter a year earlier. 

 The retailer also said it was ditching plans to spin off its Saks Fifth Avenue business, citing poor performance in the luxury market. 

 Goldman Sachs retail analyst George Strachan cut his 2001 earnings estimate for Saks to 93 cents a share from $1.05, and JP Morgan retail analyst Shari Schwartzman Eberts wrote in a research note said the the outlook for the company was "challenging." 

 "We reiterate our 'market performer' rating and would be taking profits," Eberts wrote in a research note.

 At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Dell was down 44 cents at $26.06, but is much higher than the 52-week low of $16.25 set Dec. 21. 

 Some employees believe the computer maker could be preparing to eliminate as many as 4,000 positions through a combination of outright job cuts and an annual performance review, beginning as early as next week.

This from a company that had been used to annual revenue gains of 50% a year up until fiscal 1999. 

 Dell also warned that the price cutting would pare gross profit margins, or profits after manufacturing costs, by three percentage points from a year ago.

 Yesterday, Spherion Corp., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., staffing concern that supplies Dell with factory workers, said in a conference call that a large Austin customer, which analysts believe is Dell, has reduced its staffing needs by more than 1,200 employees a week. A Spherion spokeswoman declined to comment.

An early rally evaporated on Wall Street as investors turned sour on retail and tech stocks. Now here at the NASDAQ, we had Cisco Systems adding to Wednesday's 13 percent plunge. It fell another 3.4 percent.  Microsoft gave up nearly 4 percent. This is after the well-known Internet analyst Henry Blodget said he doesn't think the software giant is a good buy right now. Blodget initiated coverage of  Microsoft with a downgrade from buy to accumulate. WorldCom was able to inch up nearly 1 percent, even though profit tumbled 44 percent in the fourth quarter, hurt by poor performance at its long-distance business.   

And it was markdown mayhem at many of the nation's retailers last month. Most retail chains had to resort to cutting prices on winter goods left over from the slow holiday sales season. The Gap and Ann Taylor each warned that all that discounting will take a bite out of profits.

 Cisco aftermath leaves traders looking for clues.

 STOCKS were off in early afternoon trade, as Wall Street searched for a cue, a day after the growth slowdown warning of computer networking company Cisco Systems hammered the tech sector. 

 A C Moore, chief investment strategist at Dunvegan Associates said: "The market has discounted a lot of bad news, but at the same time there's no real catalyst for stocks to do better. So they are toying with support." 

 The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was down 36.19, or 0.33 per cent, at 10,910.53. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index was off 1.68, or 0.13 per cent, at 1,339.21. Both traded sideways earlier. 

 The Dow was weighed down by software giant Microsoft with a 1-1/2 loss at 63-3/16. Leading brokerage Merrill Lynch cut its investment rating, citing concerns about the maturing personal computer market. 

 The blue chip index was also dragged down by retail stocks like Wal-Mart Stores, which lost 2.16 to 52.50, and home improvement retailer Home Depot, off 1.53 at 44.25. 

 Most US retailers posted January same-store sales - or sales at stores open at least one year - in line with or just above expectations, but many warned they expect margins to be squeezed because of deep mark downs to which they resorted, to clear space for spring merchandise. 

 "The same-store sales report data is showing wholesalers were discounting at this point, so there is price-cutting which is affecting Wal-Mart and others, and that is one of the negative chills affecting the market," Moore added. 

 Wal-Mart fell although it met the top end of analysts' expectations, posting a six per cent rise in same-store sales. 

 Women's apparel retailer AnnTaylor Stores, whose same-store sales fell 14.3 per cent in January, said fourth-quarter profit should come in well below estimates, and its shares fell 1.20 to 26.50. Another warning came from No1 US apparel retailing chain Gap, off 2.86 a share to 26.70. It said same-store sales fell 12 per cent against an expected drop of four per cent to seven per cent. 

 Adding to some of the negative sentiment was the jump in oil prices, which fanned fears that higher energy costs will nip at Corporate America's bottom-line. Record January consumption figures and new violence in the Middle East have put oil on a firm trend. 

 Two economic reports generally gave yet more evidence of economic cooldown. The government said weekly jobless claims rose to 361,000 in the week ended 3 February, exceeding an expected 348,000. 

 The government also said wholesale inventories were unchanged in December, well below expectations for a 0.3 per cent gain, after November's 0.4 per cent gain. 

 Tobacco and food company Philip Morris, up 86 cents to 46.86, offered some support to the Dow as investors sought safer-sound names in the uncertain economy. 

 Among bright spots, Electronic Data Systems jumped 5.43 to 62.33 after the computer services provider posted a 15 per cent gain in earnings per share. 

 Toy maker Hasbro posted a fourth-quarter loss, its year-ago profit erased by charges for letting go nearly nine per cent of its workers and a 25 per cent sales drop. 

 Fewer children lined up for toys linked to Pokemon cartoons and Star Wars movies. 

 Hasbro, whose brands also include Play-Doh, Scrabble and the robotic puppy Poo-Chi, reported a loss of $58.4 million, or 34 cents per diluted share, before unusual charges. 

 A year earlier, the company posted earnings of $155.4 million, or 79 cents, excluding one-time charges. 

 The red ink was not quite as bad as Wall Street had expected. Analysts, on average, had tabbed Hasbro to lose 37 cents a share in the fourth quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.

 Dell Poised to Slash Costs, May Trim Staff Amid PC-Market Slowdown

 Dell Computer Corp., after slashing prices amid slowing growth in the personal-computer market, is gearing up for deep expense cuts that could include the first layoffs in its 16-year history, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The Round Rock, Texas, computer company recently told managers to prepare for expense cuts of 8% to 10%, according to people familiar with the directive. The cuts would be on top of a series of moves intended to counter an industry slowdown. Dell already has frozen most hiring, barred travel unrelated to sales calls, and cut some marketing programs. 

 A spokesman for Dell (DELL) said he wasn't aware of any broad reductions. 

 Last month, while warning that his company wouldn't meet Wall Street analysts' earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 2, Dell Chief Executive Michael S. Dell said the company would cut costs to improve profit margins. Mr. Dell said, "Our businesses will make [expense] adjustments as they see necessary to be sure we remain competitive." 

 At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Dell was down 44 cents at $26.06, but is much higher than the 52-week low of $16.25 set Dec. 21. 

 Some employees believe the computer maker could be preparing to eliminate as many as 4,000 positions through a combination of outright job cuts and an annual performance review, beginning as early as next week. Every year, Dell's 36,000 full-time employees are ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 and each February, the company typically dismisses or places on probation any employee ranked in the bottom fifth. 

 Amid the softest PC market in recent history, Dell has launched a price war in an attempt to pressure weaker rivals and grab market share. PC shipments last year rose just 9.2%, as home-computer sales slumped late in the year, according to market researcher International Data Corp.

 TECH stocks reacted sharply on Wednesday following the profit warning by internet equipment major Cisco. 

 Cisco was not able to beat estimates for the first time in its history, falling short marginally. The results came in after market hours on the Nasdaq on Tuesday causing a fresh bout of selling in local IT stocks. 

 The company grew by 48 per cent, but revised its revenue estimates lower with a 30 per cent growth for the third and 18 per cent growth for the fourth quarter. 

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange, Infosys Technologies was down at Rs 6,490 (Rs 6,686), followed by Satyam Computers at Rs 382 (Rs 406), SSI at Rs 1,350 (Rs 1,480) and Silverline Technologies at Rs 244 (Rs 263). 

 Fagged out 

 THE government's move to ban advertising and sponsorship of sports and cultural events by tobacco companies saw companies like ITC coming under heavy selling pressure. The stock closed 10 per cent lower at Rs 789. Alliance fund was tipped to be a big seller in the counter. 

 Tobacco companies are known to spend close to Rs 250 crore on advertising in mass media. The decision is also expected to have a negative impact on advertising agencies like Lintas, HTA and other media. 

 However, this move may turn out to be beneficial for a large companies like ITC with established brands as it will now be difficult for rival companies to launch competing strong brands. 

 Besides ITC, shares of other cigarette maker Godfrey Philips came under selling pressure. The Godfrey Philips share was locked at its 8 per cent lower limit of Rs 496.85. 

 RPL: Public demand 

 RELIANCE Petroleum attracted a huge demand on the bourses in an otherwise easy market on Wednesday. The combined volumes on the BSE and NSE stood around three crore shares compared with one crore shares on the previous day. 

 RPL has been in the news for a while due to plan to offer a stake to a strategic partner. The renewed interest at the counter has been attributed to a possibility of offering stake at a substantially higher price as compared to the current market price, dealers said. 

 The rumours are making the market rounds that the company may offer 12 per cent stake to a strategic partner at a price of Rs 90 a share.

 A LEADING North Devon financial consultant has raised his profile after he produced a scathing leaflet warning of the potential dangers of With Profit Bonds. 

 Philip Milton, chairman of Barnstaple-based Philip J. Milton and Co, produced the whistle-blowing critique on With Profit Bonds which has gained the attention of several national newspapers and Sky Television. The Guardian newspaper dubbed Mr Milton "the independent financial adviser who broke ranks" after he launched the booklet, With Profit Bonds - Have you been Myth-Sold? Mr Milton, whose practice is based at Joy Street, claimed With Profit Bonds could become the next big mis-selling scandal in the industry because the product was made to appear safe and to have tax benefits. 

 He said: "We come across clients all the time who have been sold With Profit Bonds and have been persuaded with all the same lies. I do not think advisers who sell them know all the issues." Mr Milton said the company believed investors were entitled to have "the full facts" explained to them including the "exorbitant costs and commissions and inefficient taxation regime covering these opaque schemes".

 Former Xerox Officials in Mexico Assert Headquarters Ignored Fiscal Warnings

 Former Xerox Corp. officials in Mexico say executives at the copier titan's U.S. headquarters ignored early warning signs about accounting problems in that country and instead intensified pressure to meet profit goals. 

 The assertions support allegations from James F. Bingham, an assistant treasurer at Xerox, who says in a lawsuit that he was fired last year for reporting accounting irregularities. Among other things, Mr. Bingham said Xerox management had adopted a "win at any cost" financial strategy that overcame sound accounting and used bookkeping tricks to make up for business weakness. As reported, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating accounting practices at Xerox. 

 A Xerox spokesman said the company "will not trade off our ethical standards for results anytime. Anyone who does so," he added, "does so at their own peril." 

 Xerox, Stamford, Conn., has attributed accounting problems in Mexico to rogue executives who circumvented company procedures and concealed bad debt levels. Xerox took almost $120 million in charges last year because of bad debts related to the accounting situation. 

 But former Xerox Mexico executives claim that they warned U.S. officials of rising levels of bad debt three years before Xerox said the problem would result in a special charge. 

 Sandeep Thakore, the former Mexico finance director who was forced to resign last year, warned his superior at the regional division, Don Weber, of $16 million to $18 million in unpaid bills in mid-1997, according to Mr. Thakore's lawyer, Larry Rolnick. Early the following year, the lawyer says, Mr. Thakore's request for a $6 million to $8 million reserve to offset some of the problem debts was rejected by Mr. Weber. 

 Mr. Weber, a  vice president in Xerox's developing markets operation, declined to comment, as did a Xerox spokesman. The SEC, which declines to comment, has interviewed Mr. Thakore, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

 In January 2000, Antonio Robles, the former Xerox Mexico general manager, says he alerted Michael Festa,  vice president of finance for developing markets, to what Mr. Robles described as a $40 million to $50 million problem with unpaid bills from customer accounts in Mexico. 

 But instead of corrective actions, Mr. Robles says, the response from headquarters was "crazy." He says his unit's pretax profit goal for 2000 was set by Stamford headquarters at $154 million, a 20% increase from the $128 million attained in 1999, despite the mounting bill troubles. A Jan. 27, 2000, memo from Gordon Nicol, a vice president in the developing markets group in Stamford, includes the $154 million target. 

 Mr. Festa declined to comment. Xerox Controller Greg Tayler says the company won't discuss profit levels or goals for individual units, but said those figures sounded too high. Mr. Nicol didn't return phone calls. A Xerox spokesman said, "I'm not aware of any successful sales organization that doesn't press itself to achieve progressively better results." 

 Mr. Robles says he was asked to resign last spring for his part in the Mexico scandal. He denies any wrongdoing, and says managers were acting in good faith, contending they continued to work with delinquent customers in the expectation that they would eventually be able to pay. 

 Xerox says Mr. Bingham's allegations were presented to directors and auditors and found to be "without merit." On Tuesday, after The Wall Street Journal reported Mr. Bingham's concerns, a Xerox spokesman dismissed them as "allegations of a disgruntled employee who was fired for insubordination." Mr. Bingham, who raised his objections to Xerox's accounting before he left the company last summer, says he brought up his concerns because he wanted problems corrected. 

 At 4 p.m., Xerox shares were down 53 cents to $7.39 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Investment
Gloomy outlook for US earnings

Economists may be divided over the extent of the United States' slowdown, but there is no doubt that corporate America has already entered a profit recession.

With the 2000 earnings season all but completed, the chief executives of the nation's largest companies have left investors with a decidedly gloomy outlook for the year ahead.

Industry analysts expect average profit growth from the Standard and Poor's 500 group this year of 5.9 per cent, roughly one-third last year's figure. But the final number could well be lower, with some market players predicting flat profits across the entire US economy for the first time since the 1991 recession.

That hinges on whether tax cuts and lower interest rates revive demand in the northern summer.

Wall Street economists generally think they will, but analysts working on the ground are more pessimistic.

Third-quarter earnings forecasts have been scaled back over the past month as executives lowered expectations at end-of-year analyst briefings, warning they do not expect to emerge from the economic slowdown as quickly as previously forecast. The biggest surprises have come from the technology sector, with companies at the forefront of communications and computing foreshadowing profit and revenue shortfalls, including Dell, JDS Uniphase, Corning and Microsoft. Sector-wide earnings growth is expected to be zero this quarter.

"The danger about tech [profit projections] is why they fell as fast and as far as they did," said Mr Chuck Hill, the head of research for the First Call earnings estimates service. "It raises the question as to whether it is more than the economy. Is it that the markets for these products are saturated? We just don't know."

It also raises a difficult issue for sharemarket investors. Will falling interest rates follow tradition and trigger a sharemarket rally, or will stagnant profits and dividends drive investors into the bond market?

Wall Street appears undecided. After celebrating January's change in monetary policy with a mini-Nasdaq boom, the market has paused. The technology benchmark has fallen 3 per cent over the past week and the broad-based S&P500 is flat.

Ms Sheila Hartnett-Devlin, the chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Company, a manager of $US47billion ($85billion) in assets, believes America's large corporations will have difficulty increasing profits until late in the year. "We're cutting back on equities because the outlook for profits is pretty poor this year, but we think the outlook for fixed income is quite good," she said.

"We're expecting flat or very low profit growth [for the S&P500]. The profit upturn in the third quarter is probably not going to be as strong as the Street hopes."

A key indicator of how badly the slowdown is affecting technology earnings will come this week from Cisco Systems. The world's largest manufacturer of routers and switches is expected to announce a 60 per cent earnings-per-share increase on Wednesday morning, Australian time.

But most focus will be on the outlook given by the chief executive, Mr John Chambers. If a company in the heart of the internet economy like Cisco produces a downward forecast, shares across the Nasdaq are likely to suffer too.

A sharp reduction in spending by business and individuals is the main force behind the problem, but many businesses were forced to cut prices after building up too much stock.

High interest rates also made it difficult for smaller companies to raise money, particularly those internet and telco start-ups buying from the large technology manufacturers.

But the problems have not been contained to the new economy. Last quarter, some of the big profit disappointments came from paper, mining and transport companies.

Profits across the economy rose 4.2 per cent, while GDP increased 1.4 per cent. Earnings in the first quarter, which will start being released in late April, are forecast at negative 0.8 per cent, according to First Call. Second-quarter earnings are seen flat, rising to 7 per cent in the third quarter and taking off in the fourth at 17 per cent.

SUGAR producer Tate & Lyle today issued its fourth profit warning in a year, blaming dissolving US margins and big rises in energy prices since November.  

It said energy costs for the year to March would be Pounds 10 million more than the Pounds 30 million it predicted in November. Margins had fallen further than expected at two US sugar businesses, Western and Domino, which it is trying to offload.  

The group claimed that US authorities had artificially propped up the price of raw sugar for growers while refined prices plummeted.  

American rival Imperial Sugar is currently in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection procedure.  

Analyst David Lang of Henderson Crosthwaite said: "It's nothing the management has done. It's a political problem which needs politicians to sort out. That won't happen for some time."  

Even in the group's core businesses there was precious little good news.  

Staley, its US corn syrup producer, has managed to lift selling prices but any extra profit will be partly wiped out by higher corn costs and energy prices.  

An unfavourable product mix at European starch business Amylum will eliminate any gains from price increases.  

Only traditional cane refining businesses in Britain, Portugal and Canada continued to perform well.

 Europe Stock Focus: Iona May Buck Volatile High-Tech Mkt

 DUBLIN -(Dow Jones)- Although shares in Irish software-maker Iona Technologies PLC (IONA) have suffered on the back of volatility in New Economy stocks and initial teething difficulties with its sales force, its fortunes may soon be about to change, analysts say. 

 Some market watchers see Iona's stock doubling to more than $100 in the next year. The company's new products have been a hit with the market, analysts say. It beat analysts' bullish expectations for fourth quarter earnings and some analysts see revenue growth of up to 40% in the next two years. 

 Iona, which sells software that allows computers to talk with each other, beat earnings forecasts when it said on Jan. 17 that fourth-quarter revenues rose 44% to $47.9 million and net income rose 52.4% to $5.7 million. 

 Earnings were boosted by its new web-enabling business, iPortal, which has gained traction in the market with several large deals with customers. Half of Iona's sales were generated through sales of iPortal in the last six months of 2000. 

 Barry Dixon, analyst with Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, expects Iona to post a 35% to 40% increase in revenues over the next two years. 

 "Iona is a profitable company and it should also get operational leverage as revenues increase," Dixon said. He has a 12-month price target of $100. 

 Early Monday, shares were unchanged at EUR57.50 in Dublin, where shares gained 30% last year. In New York, they closed up almost 2% at $55 3/16 on Friday. 

 "Iona had a profit warning in the first quarter of 1999," Dixon adds, "and the market hasn't gotten over that. It's still punishing Iona (in relation to its peers), which isn't justified." 

 The analyst says iPortal is as good if not better than competitor BEA Systems PLC's (BEAS) Weblogic. "We're very impressed with its plan going forward," he added. 

 Iona's Chief Executive Barry Morris expects iPortal to grow "north of 50%" or faster than Iona's historical business, which have expanded between 20% and 30%, despite the fact that "there is more careful, prioritizing of spending in the U.S." 

 "Iona is still at an unjustified discount to its direct competitors, such as BEA Systems," said Gerry Hennigan, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin, who has 12-month price target of $103. 

 Hennigan says, unlike its peers, Iona has built up its technology organically and, as a result, has an attractive P/E. "It doesn't have a lot of goodwill or amortization," he said. 

 The company's CEO said he's a believer in building and owning intellectual property. "It's less expensive. Companies buying or licensing technology are finding difficulties in their ability to innovate rapidly enough," Iona's Morris said. 

 Discount Due To Sales Woes 

 Enrique Curran, analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin, agrees that Iona is cheaper than its peers, which he says, "relates to the group's initial problems in developing an enterprise sales capability." 

 Morris acknowledges that in early 1999 there were "execution issues of our sales force. We certainly missed our own expectations in that quarter but have since built a substantial, formidable sales force." 

 Recent quarterly results confirm that Iona has overcome its early hurdles, said Merrion Stockbroker's Curran. "Iona is one of our favorite stocks," he says.

 The company's CEO said he's a believer in building and owning intellectual property. "It's less expensive. Companies buying or licensing technology are finding difficulties in their ability to innovate rapidly enough," Iona's Morris said. 

 Discount Due To Sales Woes 

 Enrique Curran, analyst at Merrion Stockbrokers in Dublin, agrees that Iona is cheaper than its peers, which he says, "relates to the group's initial problems in developing an enterprise sales capability." 

 Morris acknowledges that in early 1999 there were "execution issues of our sales force. We certainly missed our own expectations in that quarter but have since built a substantial, formidable sales force." 

 Recent quarterly results confirm that Iona has overcome its early hurdles, said Merrion Stockbroker's Curran. "Iona is one of our favorite stocks," he says.

 In Light of Melrose Park, Illinois, Shootings, Companies Can Take Steps To Limit Workplace Violence, According to a Chicago Expert

 CHICAGO, Feb. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- The shootings at a Melrose Park Navistar plant again raise employee safety concerns for companies and their staffs.  As a result, companies in Chicago should review their policies on limiting violence in the workplace. 

 Since homicide is the second-leading cause of workplace death in the United States, employers should take precautionary measures to limit the potential for violence on the job.  Indeed, the recent history of work-related homicides represents only part of the violence-related challenges facing American companies.  In 1998, for example, there were more than 8,000 serious on-the-job assaults. 

 "The bad news is that workplace violence is becoming more widespread across a broader range of companies and not-for-profit organizations," according to Kathryn Hartrick, a partner in the Chicago law firm of Stickler & Nelson, who advises employers on employment issues, including violence. "However, there is some good news for employers.  There are usually warning signs that precede an outbreak of violence in the workplace.  As a result, employers can take preventive steps to minimize the chances of assaults and deadly attacks." 


There are three key ingredients that most often contribute to lethal
work-related violence:
  *  An employee who has a heightened potential for violence.  Potentially
     violent employees may have a substance abuse problem, experience mental
     illness, or harbor a longstanding perception of being treated unfairly
     by an employer.
  *  A workplace environment that can be a catalyst for an unstable or angry
     employee.  High-pressured, fast-paced, low-paying workplaces can be
     high-risk environments for employees pre-disposed to violence.
  *  A triggering event experienced by a company employee, either on the job
     or at home.  This could include the termination or layoff of an
     employee or a personal setback such as a divorce or the break-up of a
     relationship.  (First reports indicate that this is the case for the
     assailant in the Navistar plant shootings.)



Other factors, including the lack of social support and the accessibility of
guns, can also play a role in workplace violence.



Although there are no foolproof steps to prevent workplace violence,
companies can establish and implement comprehensive workplace violence
policies.  Key elements in a strong prevention program, according to Hartrick,
include:
  *  Assessment of high-risk employees and workplace stress factors.
  *  Creation of a crisis intervention action plan.
  *  Incorporation of violence prevention measures, policies, and protocols
     as part of an employee relations program.
  *  Development of a management level committee to monitor ongoing risks of
     violence.
  *  Anticipating volatile behavior when high-risk employees are
     disciplined, demoted or lose their jobs (as appears to be the case in
     the Melrose Park shooting).



It is important that companies set up clear lines of communication, all
along the reporting chain, regarding the monitoring of aberrant employee
behavior, including verbal or physical threats.  Employers should implement a
zero-tolerance policy toward any kind of violence, with clearly communicated
disciplinary measures commensurate to the threats.



"Companies should use every tool possible to create a safe working
environment," says Hartrick.  "Many employers are uncomfortable confronting
mental health and personality issues, which are frequently the basis for
aberrant behavior.  But in order to maximize on-the-job safety, management
needs to be tuned into the behaviors that are high-risk.



"In addition, companies need to create proactive policies that also address
disgruntled customers who pose security risks.  A while back, we saw a day
trader murder several people in Atlanta, allegedly because of his anger at
losing thousands of dollars in the stock market.  Creating a system in which
management can be promptly alerted when a customer becomes abusive or
threatening is essential.  Having a clear policy of how to handle such an
individual is equally important."

Chicago.  Hartrick practices labor and employment law on behalf of management.
She has extensive experience in counseling clients on workplace violence
issues and prevention.  Stickler & Nelson represents more than 350 hospitals,
healthcare systems, corporations and not-for-profit organizations around the
country.

 THIS WEEK three of our five tipsters have responded to Friday's fall on the tech-heavy Nasdaq board in the US, and headed for the resources end of the market. 

 In retrospect this was a good decision because over the weekend the US CRB Index which measures commodity prices ended just short of its highest level ever as investors bet Dr Greenspan's 1 per cent rate cut in January will inevitably lead to a blowout in inflation as Dr Greenspan pumps up money supply. 

 Reynolds Stockbroking's Tony LeBrun likes Magnetic Minerals. 

 He says the company has outlined a high grade mineral sands resource at Dongara in WA. 

 Mr LeBrun believes Magnetic is cheap when compared with the potential wealth of Dongara. 

 D J Carmichael's Kevin Nichol has his heart set on Platinum Australia. Mr Nichol says the drilling at its Panton Project in the Kimberleys in West Australia is progressing better than expected and he believes the company will outline a resource of 800,000 ounces of platinum group metals this month. 

 He is confident the shares could go to 80c in the short term. 

 Hudson Securities' chartist Joe Spadaro, now famous for his spot-on tip with VoiceNet which he acurately predicted would double in price in a few day - it actually tripled in price - likes Emperor Gold. 

 Emperor, he says, has no debt and is highly geared to the gold price and he has a target of $1.00 on the stock. 

 In safer waters, Gavin Duffy from ComSec likes Simsmetal after its stellar half year result. 

 Mr Duffy believes Sims at some stage will be rerated and the market will see it as a new age environmental stock not as a scrap metal dealer. 

 BNP Securities' John Barry Wilson likes Lend Lease because it is a blue chip which slumped after a shock profit warning. 

 He says you have to buy a stock like Lend Lease on the dips.

 THE FED CUTS RATES Stocks: Mixed Day but Good Month Nasdaq falls as Dow edges up for the day, but the so-called January Barometer suggests an up year on Wall Street.

 The stock market ended mixed Wednesday despite the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate cut, but Wall Street's bulls were more impressed with the month than the day: Most major stock indexes posted gains for January, and historically that has foretold an up year for the market. 

 The blue chip Standard & Poor's 500 index edged down 7.72 points, or 0.6%, to 1,367.11 Wednesday, but for the month the S&P jumped 3.5%. 

 The Nasdaq composite index lost 65.62 points, or 2.3%, to 2,772.73 for the day, surrendering an early rally after the Fed announced its widely expected half-point rate cut. But Nasdaq rebounded 12.2% for the month, after diving 39% last year. 

 The so-called January Barometer holds that investors can usually tell whether stocks are headed for a good year or a bad year based on January's trend. The barometer has been accurate 46 of the last 51 years, according to market historian Yale Hirsch, author of the Stock Trader's Almanac. 

 "A lot of investment and corporate decisions are made on a calendar basis, and depending on the economic conditions out there, that's what drives the market one way or the other" early in the year, Hirsch said. 

 "A good January shows that there is still demand for equities," said Greg Nie, an analyst at First Union Securities Corp. who studies patterns in stock prices and volume to predict market moves. 

 What's more, in odd-numbered years when new U.S. Congresses convene, such as this one, the S&P index's January direction has been a perfect indicator of the market's performance for the year, Hirsch said. 

 That reflects how new Congresses want to put their stamp on the economy, he said--as the current Congress is expected to do with an income tax cut, as proposed by President Bush. 

 A year ago, the S&P index fell 5.1% in January--and indeed foretold a down year. The index lost 10.1% for the full year. 

 Hirsch's batting average for the barometer gives it credit in four years when the market ended virtually flat, though not in line with the January trend--such as in 1994. 

 All in all, the barometer's success reflects in part that "there's so much reinvestment that typically comes into the market at the beginning of the year, that if the market doesn't respond, it's a measure of a lack of investor confidence," said Steve Shobin, president of Americap Advisors. 

 Still, analysts also note that the stock market's trend this January represented a bet by investors that the economy will stay out of recession, helped by the Fed's interest-rate easing campaign. 

 But an economic revival--and with it, rebounding corporate earnings--aren't certain, of course. 

 Many analysts, however, continued to wax bullish in the wake of the latest Fed move. 

 "The cavalry has arrived. With its rate cut and clear signs of more to come, the Fed has shifted the market's focus from the raft of earnings disappointments to the promise of a re-accelerating economy in the second half," said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates. 

 "The good news is that the market got what it wanted, but the better news is that the Fed is acting aggressively to keep the economic expansion going, which in turn should help maintain the slowly developing recovery we've seen in stocks," said Stuart Freeman, strategist at A.G. Edwards. 

 Overall Wednesday, losers outnumbered winners 7 to 6 on Nasdaq, but rising stocks led losers 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The Dow industrials inched up 6.16 points to 10,887.36, surrendering a bigger gain early in the session, before the Fed announced its move. 

 Stocks swung wildly after the Fed announcement, slumping initially, quickly rebounding, then falling again. 

 Many analysts expected the post-announcement selling because the market had already factored the half-point rate cut into stock prices. "This was the most telegraphed rate cut in history," said Gary Kaltbaum, a technical analyst at JW Genesis. 

 Investors showed the most caution in the tech sector, which has suffered the bulk of corporate earnings disappointments in recent weeks. Soft profits and reduced outlooks again hurt long-battered stocks in tech, analysts say. 

 Applied Materials lost $2.13 to finish at $50.31. The maker of semiconductor equipment said after the market closed Tuesday that sales for its fiscal first quarter would fall below estimates as customers cut back purchases. 

 Amazon.com, which warned late Tuesday of a future slowdown and said it was cutting 1,300 jobs, fell $1.63 to $17.31. 

 Other tech losers Wednesday included Adobe Systems, down $9.06 to $43.69 after a profit warning; Dell Computer, down $2 to $26.13; Emulex, down $9.50 to $93; and Brocade Communications, down $8.19 to $90.31. 

 The Dow got a big boost from the retailing sector, which tends to rise when interest rates are lowered and consumers spend more. Wal-Mart advanced $3.03 to $56.80 and Pacific Sunwear rose $1.44 to $35. 

 Many energy stocks also gained, led by Exxon Mobil, up $2.17 to $84.15, and Unocal, up 71 cents to $34.52. 

 In the bond market, Treasury yields fell across the board. The 1-year T-bill yield slid to 4.59% from 4.66% Tuesday. The 5-year T-note fell to 4.78% from 4.90%. 

 The yield on the 30-year T-bond dropped to 5.50% from 5.60%. The bond got an additional push after Bill Gross, bond fund guru at Pacific Investment Management Co., told CNBC that "the best portion of the Treasury curve is actually the long-term Treasuries. The best value in the market is now the long Treasury bond at about 5.5%."

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) 

 A Hot Start 

 January's stock market trend has usually set the tone for the rest of the year, and that fact is fueling more optimism among Wall Street's bulls: Most market indexes scored sharp gains last month, led by the Nasdaq telecom and Nasdaq composite indexes. The stock market has been powered higher in large part by the Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates again on Wednesday. 

 A Promising January 2001 

 Nasdaq telecom: +19.9% 

 Nasdaq composite: +12.2 

 S&P 500: +3.5 

 S&P mid-cap: +2.2 

 NYSE composite: +1.0 

 Dow industrials: +0.9 

 The January Barometer, 1980-2000 

 Since 1950, the Standard & Poor's 500 index's trend in January has accurately foretold the market trend for the year 46 of 51 times: An up January usually meant an up year, and a down January usually meant a down year.

 Aetna Inc.'s warning last week of unexpectedly high medical costs struck fear into analysts' and investors' hearts about overall managed care industry second quarter earnings, especially since the caveat followed unusually robust utilization among some for-profit hospital companies. But the first round of second-quarter results from managed care plans shows healthy earnings and controlled health care expenses. 

 * WellPoint Health Networks, Inc. reported a medical loss ratio of 80.8%, a slight drop from last quarter's 81.0%. The seemingly small difference translates to $4.3 million in earnings, notes Credit Suisse First Boston. But Cerulean Companies, Inc., parent of the Georgia Blues, which is set to merge with WellPoint by the close of 2000, reported a much higher medical loss ratio of 87.8%. 

 * Oxford Health Plans, Inc.'s medical loss ratio was 80.9% -- unusually low because of favorable prior period reserve estimates. Without that $15 million boost, the MLR would have been 82.4%, down from 85.8% for the same period last year. Oxford's medical cost trend rose 4.2% in the quarter, but premium increases far outpaced it, up 8.5%, noted Rob Mains of Advest, Inc. 

 * And RightCHOICE Managed Care, Inc. posted an MLR of 81.9%, up from 80.5% last quarter but down from 82.6% in the year-ago quarter. 

 Still, analysts remain concerned about accelerating costs, and insurers acknowledge higher medical cost inflation. Continued increases in pharmacy expenditures were cited by Oxford, for example, as well as higher inpatient hospital rates. Oxford officials said both higher utilization and higher unit costs were contributing to the inflation. But to date, strong pricing and a strong economy appear to be enough for most firms to post strong profits. 

 Earnings Beat Wall Street Consensus 

 WellPoint posted second-quarter net income of $83.7 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to $71.1 million, $1.03, in the same period last year. WellPoint performed well ahead of Wall Street's consensus estimate of $1.21 per share. 

 The Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based insurer also reported 10% enrollment gains in the California market, adding 492,000 new members. Total membership is 7.6 million, compared with 7.0 million at the end of 1999's second quarter. 

 Oxford announced second-quarter net income of $37.0 million, or $0.41 per share, vs. a loss of $13.0 million, -$0.16, in the year-ago period. It also beat Wall Street's consensus estimate of $0.27. 

 Oxford's administrative loss ratio fell significantly, to 12.1% this quarter from 15% in the same period last year. Oxford's earnings targets for next year hinge on lowering the administrative ratio to the 10% range. 

 Oxford's membership was 1.49 million, a slight drop from 1.52 million in the first quarter. Management said it expected enrollment, which has been dropping continuously as the firm leaves unprofitable markets and restructures products, to start growing again once it rolls out its new plan offerings. 

 Call Oxford at (203) 459-7674, or WellPoint at (805) 5457-6792.

The fuel prices were still there in the second quarter, but the impact was much less serious - primarily because more people flew in the U.S. air travel marketplace that quarter than in any previous quarter in commercial aviation history. 

 The 10 major carriers reported a total net profits just shy of $2 billion. Some of that net result, such as the $460 million contributed by Delta Air Lines [DAL], was due to extraordinary items such as Delta's $228 million gain from the exchange of priceline.com warrants into preferred shares. However, Delta also recorded an $86 million charge for costs associated with an early retirement medical option program. Continental Airlines [CAL] also charged about $4 million for early debt repayment. 

 Some airlines' first-half earnings, such as those for Alaska Airlines [ALK] and Southwest Airlines [LUV], were affected somewhat negatively from the change in the way U.S. airlines account for the sale of frequent flyer mileage to individuals and companies. The sale of mileage has become a significant moneymaker for most airlines and is often used as corporate incentive to reward employees for good performance. 

 In addition, operating and net income for US Airways [U] dropped sharply due to the lagging effect of threatened labor actions against the East Coast carrier in the first quarter. And then there's Trans World Airlines [TWA], which was lucky enough to report a slight $15 million operating profit and reduced its net loss to just under $5 million. However, despite high fuel costs, it's very likely that TWA, based on its 2Q performance, could report its first quarterly net profit in two years. 

 Could this be a $100 Billion Year? 

 It is interesting to note that the 10 majors reported gross revenues of just under $50 billion for the first six months of the year, which points to a likely $100 billion-plus tally for the entire first year of the new century. Because most airlines that reported healthy earnings in the second quarter indicated continued strong advance bookings for the third quarter, it is probable that they will report strong growth in year-over-year results, particularly if moderation in fuel prices continues. 

 Amazingly, U.S. airlines could have dramatically broken earnings records for any quarter had fuel prices not continued to be so high. Sam Buttrick, analyst for PaineWebber, said in his wrap-up report, "As expected, the June quarter marked a turning point for industry profits. After almost two years of shallow decline (starting with the global financial crisis of 3Q 98), industry operating profits turned up in Q2 - rising about 13 percent ... about 3 percent ahead of our pre-release forecast. The story of the quarter was a simple one - exceptional revenue growth and exceptional (we hope) oil prices." 

 Buttrick noted that airlines raise prices on a systemwide basis at least three times in the first six months of 2000, "and consumers responded by flying more - a happy, if anomalous, outcome." System passenger revenue, he claimed, grew by more than 10 percent for the first time in at least 10 years, and occurred in step with strong growth in revenue per available seat mile (RASM). 

 Fortunately for Northwest Airlines [NWAC] and United Airlines [UAL], RASM on Pacific Rim flights grew by the most - 15 percent year over year - indicating a continuation in the strong recovery being experienced by most Asian countries. Following Asia was Latin America, and transatlantic RASM even rose by 8 percent. Buttrick said he expects RASM "moderation" in the second half of 2000 in domestic and Pacific segments. 

 What Happened to Delta? 

 As AFN noted in the July 24 issue, Delta was one of the surprising exceptions among the top half dozen airlines in its 2Q 2000 performance. Delta's system RASM grew by only 3 percent, although Pacific RASM grew strongly - 23 percent - compared to second quarter 1999, but the remainder of Delta's sectors grew more slowly than industry average. 

 Buttrick said that Delta's domestic RASM under-performed "on poor April results and comparatively lackluster yields." Fortunately, its cost per available seat mile (CASM) growth was low because it so effectively held the line on fuel cost increases. But only Delta and US Airways [U] experienced drops in yields for the quarter, and US Airways' decrease was primarily due to more low-fare competition and trouble with unions in the first quarter. "We'll need to look into this more," Buttrick concluded. 

 Buttrick said that Delta's two now-owned regional carriers Atlantic Southeast and Comair contributed a total of $80 million, about $30 million more than in 1Q 2000. 

 Despite all that, PaineWebber is still maintaining its forecast of a calendar-year $7.40 earnings per share total for Delta, "and our C01 estimate remains $7.85," Buttrick said. Target share price is $72-$73 on 9-9.5 times $7.85. 

 Buttrick Warns of 'Cost Acceleration' 

 If fuel costs are removed from the unit cost equation, PaineWebber noted that costs climbed fairly sharply - 4 percent - the first time it approached that level since the first quarter of 1999. Buttrick said that cost figure "marks core cost acceleration from recent levels and reflects higher labor costs, poor completion factors, and excessive flight delays." In fact, United was not the only airline to plan schedule 3Q schedule reductions in the second half. America West Airlines [AWA] reported July 27 that it will reduce its schedules and take four additional aircraft out of service for use as spares in order to fix its ongoing reliability problems. 

 PaineWebber ended its 2Q summary on a somewhat humorous note. "In sum," Buttrick said, "if you had told us six months ago that the U.S. airline industry would show double-digit earnings growth with $30 (per barrel) oil in a (purportedly) slowing economy, we would have assumed the bars had opened early that day." 

 Airlines might expect an even higher level of net profitability in 3Q and 4Q 2000 if fuel prices continue to moderate, and if the expected benefit from a unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to pump even more oil per day occurs. 


"We continue to expect 2H profit growth in the 20-25 percent range
with
20 percent growth in 3Q and 40 percent growth in the seasonally less
profitable
4Q," Buttrick concluded. "Notwithstanding what some interpreted broadly
as an
earnings warning from UA, on balance we have raised our Q3 outlook by 2%
- from
18 percent to 20 percent operating profit growth. That's the kind of
warning we
can live with."

 Toronto's market-moving tech stocks pummeled Bay Street yesterday for a second session in a row, pulling Canada's benchmark index well into the red. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock index finished down 353.25 points to 10,342.98, a loss of more than 3 per cent. Year to date, the little exchange that could is still up almost 23 per cent, much higher than its cousins to the south. 

 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 74.96 points to 10,511.17, led by declines from the interest rate sensitive financial services companies. The Dow's big retailers -- Home Depot Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. -- also took a hit as the U.S. government released stronger-than-expected economic data. 

 The U.S. Commerce Department reported a sharp 5.2-per-cent increase in its gross domestic product, well above the 3.8 per cent that analysts had expected. The growth was driven by government spending and inventory building. Consumer spending slowed to 3.7 per cent, compared with a 7.6-per-cent increase in the first quarter. 

 Dow components Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., Microsoft Corp., Coca-Cola Co. and McDonald's Corp. were some of the only gainers on the high-profile index. 

 Following hot on the heels of Thursday's decline, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index sank 179.23 points to 3,663. 

 American Power Conversion Corp. was one of the Nasdaq's biggest sliders, losing 44.5 per cent after issuing a profit warning and having its rating slashed by a Wall Street brokerage. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 29.73 points to 1,419.89. 

 The small caps on the Canadian Venture Exchange pulled the CDNX down 15.85 points to 3,303.35. 

 One day after breaking off merger talks with Corning Inc., Nortel Networks Corp. was the driving force for most of the TSE's decline. The exchange's most heavily weighted stock plummeted $8.30 to $107.45 following news it was buying Alteon WebSystems Inc. of San Jose, Calif., for $7.8-billion (U.S.) in stock. 

 Another high-tech heavyweight, JDS Uniphase Corp., made waves. Profit-takers forced the fibre-optic maker to fall $17.40 to $172 (Canadian), only two days after touching an intraday high of $204.50. 

 BCE Inc., Research In Motion Ltd., Sierra Wireless Inc., Certicom Corp., Celestica Inc., Descartes Systems Group Inc. and Corel Corp. all plunged.

Cumulus Media to sell 55 stations

ATLANTA - Cumulus Media Inc., the country's third-largest broadcasting company, will transfer 55 stations in 10 markets to Texas-based Clear Channel Communications.

Cumulus, which has been troubled with massive debt and 11 shareholder lawsuits over its finances, also said it will buy five stations Clear Channel is selling in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Shreveport, La.; and Melbourne, Fla. The Cedar Rapids stations include KRNA-FM and KDAT-FM.

In return, Clear Channel will acquire 25 stations from Cumulus for $91 million, the company announced Tuesday. The Justice Department approved that acquisition last week, Cumulus said Tuesday.

Cumulus owns five radio stations in Dubuque - AM station WDBQ and FM stations KXGE, KIKR, KLYV and WJOD.

Ford announces plans to improve SUV fuel economy

DETROIT - Ford Motor Co., which is credited with popularizing gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, will announce Thursday that it plans to improve the fuel economy of its fleet of SUVs by 25 percent over five years, according to reports.

Ford chief executive officer Jacques Nasser was scheduled to speak at the National Press Club in Washington on Thursday. A Ford spokesman declined to comment on the speech.

The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, citing unnamed sources, said Wednesday that Ford would improve fuel economy mostly by improving technology on the SUVs it already sells - using lighter-weight materials and making engines and transmissions more efficient.

AOL, Time Warner pledge broadband access

WASHINGTON - Merger partners America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc. pledged Thursday that a deal to allow broadband access to Internet service providers will be hammered out shortly.

"We are open, ready, willing and able" to make deals giving ISPs access to Time Warner's broadband network, Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin told the first day of a Federal Communications Commission hearing on the proposed AOL-Time Warner deal.

Nokia's shares dive on profit warning

HELSINKI - Nokia Corp, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, warned Thursday its profit in the third quarter of 2000 would be lower than in the second quarter of the year due to seasonal factors and the launch of new handset models.

The markets' reaction to the warning was swift as it pulled Nokia's shares down by over 15 percent, despite the release of strong second-quarter growth numbers at the same time.

On the Helsinki Stock Exchange Nokia fell almost 20 percent within half an hour before recovering some ground.

WorldCom profits jump

NEW YORK - WorldCom Inc., the long-distance telephone company which recently abandoned plans to merge with rival Sprint Corp., said Thursday that second-quarter earnings rose 53 percent and that it might create separate companies or tracking stocks for its voice-telephone operations.

Profits, excluding one-time items, rose to $1.33 billion, or 46 cents per share, compared with $865 million, or 31 cents, a year ago, meeting Wall Street expectations.

The Clinton, Miss.-based company said legal and investment-banking fees stemming from the termination of the merger resulted in a charge of $55 million in the latest quarter. As a result, the company posted net income $1.29 billion, or 44 cents per share.

Revenues rose to $10.19 billion, from $9.07 billion a year ago.

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  I`m Rhonda Schaffler on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange tracking this continuing sell-off on Wall Street today as investors fret about earnings warnings and a potential interest rate hike, something that was raised at the latest round of economic data, the GDP report earlier today. Dow Industrials off its worst levels of the session, but there`s no recovery in the broader market. Decliners over advancers by two to one margin. Among the groups of stocks getting hit hard today: Financial stocks and retail issues. 

 Let`s take a look at the Dow movers, because here we have a couple of financial stocks selling off, down more than 2 for both American Express (URL: http://www.americanexpress.com/) and J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) .  Wal*Mart`s (URL: http://www.wal-mart.com/) down 1 7/8.  Today UBS Warburg (URL: http://www.ubs.com/) started coverage of a number of retailing stocks. The analysts at UBS starting Wal*Mart with a whole rating and saying that there are some concerns in the short term about the retail sales environment. 

 Another big story here has been the drop of stock of Norstrom (INAUDIBLE) on a profit warning.  General Electric (URL: http://www.ge.com/) is down 1 13/16. Some news from GE is saying the head of NBC, Bob Wright, is vice chairman of the board.  Wright remains president. Jack Welch stepping down next spring after running GE for 20 years. And Johnson & Johnson (URL: http://www.jnj.com/) (URL: http://www.jnj.com/) is up about 1 1/2. There is some buying in the drug sector today. Also there is some buying in oil stocks and food stocks and some of the chip stocks here bouncing back after the slide yesterday. Let`s go back now to the studio and Kitty. 

 KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET COVERAGE:  All right.  Thanks very much, Rhonda Schaffler at the New York Stock Exchange.

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

It was a tale of two markets as investors dumped tech stocks for the old economy blue chips. Shares of  Coca-Cola and  Exxon Mobil lent support to the Dow as investors bought shares of companies with steady profit growth.

CHRISTOFOROUS: But the NASDAQ came under pressure, sliding 3.5 percent after a string of tech companies gave gloomy profit predictions. The darling of the mobile phone industry,  Nokia, sparked the tech sell-off, down more than 25 percent after warning about the third quarter.  Nokia says people are holding off on buying cell phones until the new models are released later this year. Now some analysts said market reaction was pretty harsh; they believe things will pick up for  Nokia in the fourth quarter.   

Meantime, Worldcom gave back more than $5 after warning of slowing growth in the second half of the year.   

And  Amazon.com found no comfort, down another 13 percent, after sales at the online retailer disappointed. Also, about half a dozen analysts downgraded the stock. But some say don't give up on Amazon just yet.   

Mr. TIM ALBRIGHT (Salomon Smith Barney): They have got 22 1/2 million customers right now. The next largest retailer--and I don't count  eBay as a retailer--has about two million customers. That sort of differential is akin to AOL with all other ISPs, and--and Amazon's in a good spot to leverage that vast customer base.   

CHRISTOFOROUS: Amazon's stock is down 60 percent so far this year.   

But  Starbucks could see its shares perk up after earnings met estimates and sales soared 31 percent. The specialty coffee retailer hopes to open 1,100 new  Starbucks stores next year.

 NEW YORK - The euro fell sharply against the U.S. dollar and yen yesterday after the single currency's failure to hold above the key Y103 level triggered a selloff. 

 Stronger than expected U.S. durable goods orders added to downward pressure on the euro and helped the dollar recover from earlier weakness due to yen cross-buying. 

 The yen's recovery against the euro began after the expiry of an option at Y103, a key resistance level that the single currency was unable to stay above on Wednesday. The euro fell over a yen and a cent from its highs in Asian trading, and yen cross-buying also pulled the dollar below Y109. 

 However, the dollar got a boost in early New York trading from the strong U.S. data, prolonging the euro's decline and posting a small recovery against the yen to trade back above Y109. 

 A still strong U.S. economy combined with controlled wage pressures was the "best of both worlds," and gives investors reason to focus on the dollar again, said Timothy Duy, senior currency analyst at research firm G7 Group in Washington. 

 However, other analysts attributed the strength in the dollar to technical positioning. 

 Late yesterday, the dollar was at Y109.27, up from an intraday low of Y108.74 in London trading, but little changed from Y109.20 late on Wednesday in New York. 

 The euro was buying US93.24 cents, close to its intraday low of US93.23 cents, but down sharply from US94.13 cents the day before. It had also fallen to Y101.88, compared with Wednesday's Y102.81. 

 Sterling recovered against the dollar to trade at US$1.5134, near late Wednesday's US$1.5141, after hitting a low of US$1.5109 during the New York session. 

 The dollar also fell back a bit against the Swiss franc, but held on to most of its gains. It was at 1.6629 francs, just under its intraday high of 1.6630, but sharply higher than 1.6490 Wednesday. 

 In other trading, the Swedish krona was sent reeling due to stock market losses. The krona's almost 2% drop against the U.S. dollar was part of the domino effect stemming from Finnish mobile phone company Nokia's surprise profit warning, which sent its shares 20% lower at one point. The losses spread to Swedish rival Ericsson. 

 The Canadian dollar slipped to US67.95 cents from US68.26 cents on Wednesday. The U.S. dollar closed at $1.4717 from $1.4650.

 JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: I said Christine Romans was at the New York Stock Exchange. I misspoke. The delightful Susan Lisovicz is handling the big board for us. How are you? Happy Friday. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Happy Friday to you. You also know he as the feisty redhead, I think you called me. 

 CAFFERTY: That is in your business card? 

 LISOVICZ: It is. Christine Romans is off today and I am happy to fill in. And we have a lot to tell you about. You mentioned Nordstrom (URL: http://www.nordstrom.com/) . So certainly  we`ll be watching the retail sector with Nordstrom`s warning. But EDS (URL: http://www.eds.com/) which is number two in computer services to IBM matched Wall Street`s expectations at 53 cents but you know what analyst are watching especially these days with the moderating economy is revenue. EDS sparked a sell-off last month when it said, forget it, the revenue number will be lower than expected and well you can see what happened to the stock. It is actually trading $2 off its 52-week low. It was down about 1/3 of a point yesterday at 40 and change. And those revenue numbers which the street had expected to come in 3-4 percent or even lower than that. So watch EDS today. They have a fairly new CEO and chairman in Dick Brown. He came in last year to re-ignite growth. He says the second half of the year will improve and we`ll see if analysts or investor more importantly buy it. AES (URL: http://www.aesc.com/) now is  a different type of company. It`s an old economy company. In fact it is the largest US power producer in the country. It also came in line with expectations at 25 cents. It has had a different type of year. Partly because of the deregulation that has been going on in the industry. It`s got interest in about 125 plants not only in the US but also in Europe and in Asia. It`s  trading near its 52-week high. So a better year certainly for AES, up 72 percent over the last year. Coming in about almost a dollar higher yesterday at 52 3/4. So very good picture for AES. Its profit jumped 56 percent because of its investment and again in the deregulation power industry it`s really help today. And those are a couple of company we`ll be watching today. A whole smorgasbord and GDP and whatever else happens down here at the New York Stock Exchange. Back to you, Jack.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The dollar posted a solid advance against the euro Thursday, getting a boost from euro selling for yen and a strong rise in U.S. durable-goods orders. The U.S. currency ended little changed against the Japanese currency after rebounding from earlier weakness following the durables report. 

 Late Thursday, the euro traded at 93.24 U.S. cents, down from 94.13 U.S. cents late Wednesday. The dollar was quoted at 109.27 yen, little changed from 109.20 yen late Wednesday, but well above its intraday low of 108.74 yen. The pound fetched $1.5134, little changed from $1.5141 late Wednesday. 

 For the second straight day, the dollar was influenced by euro-yen trading. Much of the dollar's gains against the euro could be attributed to the single euro-zone currency's decline against the yen. Late in the New York session, the euro bought 101.88 yen, down sharply from 102.81 yen late Wednesday. 

 Meanwhile, U.S. durable-goods orders surged 10% in June, the largest advance since July 1991 and well above expectations for an unchanged reading. However, excluding the heavily weighted transportation sector, orders for items expected to last more than three years rose 0.8% last month, the Commerce Department said. 

 While the durable-goods report initially caused some concern that the U.S. economy continues to expand at a torrid pace, the report is considered a volatile economic indicator, and another key report suggested U.S. labor-cost pressures seem to be easing. The employment-cost index for the second quarter rose 1.0%, in line with expectations, following the first quarter's stronger 1.4% climb. 

 A still-strong U.S. economy combined with controlled wage pressures was the "best of both worlds," and gives investors reason to focus on the dollar again, said Timothy Duy, senior currency analyst at research firm G7 Group in Washington. 

 "The data support the continuing growth differential story" between the U.S. and euro zone, Mr. Duy said. 

 Other analysts attributed the strength in the dollar and yen against most other major currencies to technical factors. 

 "I definitely think it's more technical than economic fundamentals," said Jeffrey Yu, vice president of foreign exchange at Sanwa Bank in New York. "But I think the forex market feels that the durable goods and ECI still point to a continuation of U.S. economic growth. And some players think the durable-goods number itself gives impetus to the Fed for the remote possibility of a rate hike." 

 The ECI is a favored indicator of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who made clear in House testimony this week that economic data between now and the central bank's next policy meeting in August could be decisive. 

 Mr. Duy of the G7 Group expects the dollar's uptrend to continue if U.S. second-quarter growth data due out Friday are higher than or on target with expectations. Economists forecast a slowdown to 3.9% growth in second-quarter gross domestic product following the first quarter's 5.5% rate. 

 However, despite uncertainty about Japan's economic recovery and a falling Nikkei stock average, Mr. Duy sees the dollar meeting heavy resistance at 110 yen. Japanese employment, consumer prices, and industrial-production data are due out Friday. 

 Finally, the Swedish krona was sent reeling in a thin summer market because of sharp stock market losses. The krona's almost 2% drop against the dollar was part of the domino effect stemming from Finnish mobile-phone company Nokia Corp.'s surprise profit warning. The losses trickled over into neighboring Swedish rival Ericsson -- a heavyweight on Stockholm's blue-chip OMX index, which closed down 3.1%.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) set a single-day trading record Wednesday, as money managers grabbed 200 million shares of the company before its inclusion in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 

 The fiber optic equipment maker broke the January record set by New York Stock Exchange-listed Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU), which saw 179 million shares trade hands after a profit warning. 

 At 4 p.m. Wednesday, about 120 million shares of JDS Uniphase had changed hands. That would have been less than previous Nasdaq record-holder Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which saw 171 million shares trade hands Dec. 9, 1997, said a Nasdaq spokesman. 

 But in after-hours trading, composite volume reached 200,430,700 shares. 

 Volume surged going into the close and in after-hours trading, as index-fund managers who waited until the last moment hustled to buy the stock. Much of the selling probably came from hedge funds, brokers and other "gamers" taking advantage of the surge in share demand due to the S&P 500 entry. 

 JDS Uniphase, which beat Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations Wednesday afternoon, is the world's largest independent supplier of fiber optic components. 

 The stock closed regular-session trading up 4.4%, or 5 3/4, at 135 15/16.

It was an ugly day on Wall Street as investors were pounded by a fresh batch of profit warnings. Xerox tanked more than $3 after sounding a profit warning for the third time in a year.

LSI Logic (LSI) down 8/18 to 32 3/8   

CHRISTOFOROUS:  LSI Logic lost more than 8 after earnings that the chipmaker missed some analysts' estimates. And here at the NASDAQ,  Rambus was the victim du jour, down 9 1/2 on the day. That's after  Intel said it will no longer exclusively use  Rambus technology for its Pentium IV chip.   

And after the bell,  Amazon.com showed us its bottom line. The online retailer posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 33 cents a share, but its sales numbers didn't live up to expectations. It has certainly been a tough week for Amazon. On Tuesday, its president and chief operating officer quit, and hours before its earnings were released, an analyst said the stock was too expensive. Adding insult to injury, Amazon suffered a 40-minute system outage Wednesday morning. In regular trading, Amazon down more than $1. In after-hours trading, the stock fell more than $3.   

But  JDS Uniphase rallied 5 3/4 in very active trading ahead of its profit report. The fiber-optics giant beat the Street by 2 cents a share. JDS was also added to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which forces money managers to buy the stock.   

And a big Web merger made headlines after the bell.  InfoSpace announced it will buy the Web site operator Go2Net for $2.6 billion in stock. At the NASDAQ MarketSite, I'm Alexis Christoforous, CBS MarketWatch.

It was a day for those holistic, anti-nausea wristbands on Wall Street today with NASDAQ shares under attack. Well, the Dow went up 69 points, 2/3rds percent; the NASDAQ Composite fell 145 points, or 3 2/3rds percent. MARKETPLACE's Michelle Brier reports.   

MICHELLE BRIER reporting:   

Unlike previous trading sessions where investors seemed to languish for little or no apparent reason, today there was real economic data to digest and disappoint. Orders to US factories for durable goods shot up by 10 percent, the largest increase in nine years. And while the employment cost index showed a modest 1 percent increase in benefits and pay for workers in the last quarter, it also recorded the biggest 12-month rise in almost a decade. Not a pretty pair of reports if you're hoping for clear signs of an economic slowdown, says Alan Levinson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price.   

Mr. ALAN LEVINSON (T. Rowe Price): All of this, it seems to me, raises the probability that the Fed is going to want to nudge up rates again in August.   

BRIER: Still, other economists argue the jury's still out. Also troubling investors today was wireless phonemaker  Nokia's warning of future profit problems, says Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities.   

Mr. BRYAN PISKOROWSKI (Prudential Securities): Well, clearly profit warnings have been the bulls' Achilles heel this week. And with further action coming out of  Nokia today, we've got downside.   

BRIER: Even though  Nokia is actually listed on the New York Stock Exchange, similar tech stocks took big hits on the NASDAQ. In New York, I'm Michelle Brier for MARKETPLACE.   

BRANCACCIO: And that's the top of our news for Thursday. More on that 3 2/3rds percent drop for the NASDAQ Composite when we do the numbers.

 Xerox Profits Down by Half As Sales Fell in 2nd Quarter

 STAMFORD, Conn., July 26 -- The Xerox Corporation said today that its second-quarter profit fell by half on lower sales and that efforts to turn around operations would take longer than expected. Per share earnings declined 17.5 percent. 

 Profit from operations fell to $222 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with net income of $448 million, or 62 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales fell 3.6 percent, to $4.69 billion. 

 Xerox took a charge of $78 million, or 11 cents a share, in the most recent quarter for bad debt expenses at its Mexican operations, a problem that the company had said in June might cost 5 to 6 cents a share. Combined with a gain of $1 million for research and development and reorganization, net income was $145 million, or 19 cents a share. 

 The results matched expectations of analysts, who had lowered their estimates after a warning, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Xerox had been expected to earn 42 cents a share before the warning. 

 ''This is much worse than I thought and much worse than anyone thought,'' said David Giroux, an analyst at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore. ''Management had limited credibility before and they have no credibility today.'' 

 Xerox is trying to recover from a failed reorganization that prompted the ouster of its chief executive in May. The company said last month that sales of its DocuPrint and DocuTech machines were being hurt by increased competition. It was the third profit warning in four quarters for Xerox, which has lost more than half its market value, or about $20.4 billion, over the last year. 

 Investors should make a ''significant downward adjustment to current second-half expectations,'' Paul Allaire, the chairman of Xerox, said in a statement. The company expects to begin showing signs of improvement in the fourth quarter, he said. 

 Shares of Xerox fell $3.1875, to $15. 

 Increasing competition is cutting into sales of Xerox products as the company tries to recover from last year's botched realignment of the sales force along product lines rather than geography. 

 Xerox expects profit of less than 24 cents a share in the third quarter, Mr. Allaire said during a conference call. The company, based in Stamford, was expected to earn 38 cents a share in the quarter, according to  First Call. 

 The company did point out some signs of improvement, saying sales-force turnover declined in the United States and Europe, and back-office problems were corrected. 

 Compared with the first quarter, sales of color copying and printing machines increased 59 percent, including a 50 percent increase in color printer sales from the recent acquisition of Tektronix Inc.

 U.S. Stocks Stumble 1.7% on Earnings --- LSI Logic's Profit Report Sparks a Sell-Off in Tech Sector

 NEW YORK -- An uneven earnings performance cost technology stocks more ground, and left market averages lower again Wednesday.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7% or 183.49 points to 10516.48, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1%, or 41.65 points, to 3987.92.   

 In individual trading, LSI Logic slumped sharply after Wall Street pilloried the Milpitas, California-based semiconductor supplier's second-quarter profit statement. Released late Tuesday, the report showed the company matched Wall Street's profit target for the quarter, but posted revenue that fell short of forecasts, prompting a host of analysts to turn critical of the stock.   

 LSI shares, which closed Tuesday in 4 p.m. primary trading at 48 13/16, slid to 40 1/2 in after-hours composite trading that day, then declined further Wednesday, ending at 32 3/4.   

 Shares of Rambus declined 9 7/16 to 75 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after Intel indicated it planned to use other memory technology in its coming Pentium 4 processor, rather than rely on Rambus as the sole technology provider. That put more pressure on the vulnerable semiconductor sector.   

 Internet stocks also struggled, with Amazon.com down 1 9/16 to 36 1/16 on Nasdaq, near its 52-week low of 32 15/32 set June 23, after Lehman Brothers lowered its rating on the stock to a neutral from a buy ahead of the release of the online retailer's second-quarter profit, which were to have been released after the close of trading Wednesday. The firm said the company is exposed to near-term execution risks.   

 Meanwhile, Xerox scattered more bad news around the computer-hardware sector after the printer maker issued another earnings warning. Shares of hardware names such as Hewlett-Packard, which fell 5 3/8 to 110, and International Business Machines, which lost 1oe to 109oe on the New York Stock Exchange, posted sharp losses, though Compaq Computer managed to ride its own upbeat profit news, and upbeat comments from PaineWebber, to a gain on the day, up 1 3/4 at 29 3/16.   

 In fact, there was enough good news floating around the technology sector that it kept the Nasdaq Composite Index's loss relatively tame.   

 The index got some measure of support from the rush to trade JDS Uniphase ahead of the optical components maker's entry in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which was slated to take place after the close of trading Wednesday. The stock rose 4 51/64 at 134 63/64 on Nasdaq in heavy trading.

 Non- Profit  Homeowners Group Issues National  Warning : 'Switching Game' Abuses Deny Consumers Benefits of Energy Deregulation Savings

    Ex-Monopolies Blocking Customers Who Seek Savings at Competitors;
     Review of Atlanta and D.C. Markets Show Best and Worst Practices



WASHINGTON, July 26 /PRNewswire/ -- The nonprofit United Homeowners
Association (UHA) warned consumers across the U.S. today that cost savings
under energy deregulation may be denied to them by former utility monopolies
that are exploiting their still-powerful status by playing "switching games"
designed to frustrate homeowners seeking to use lower-cost competitors,
including online energy companies.


 UHA's consumer warning is based on an analysis of natural gas deregulation at work in two major U.S. markets:  Atlanta and Washington, D.C.  In the greater Washington, D.C. area, UHA found evidence that as many as three out of four Washington Gas and Light (WGL) customers seeking to switch to alternative energy companies are hit with unreasonable delays, many of which eventually result in long-stymied consumers giving up out of frustration.  By contrast, UHA determined that fewer than one in 10 customers of Atlanta Gas and Light (AGL) in Georgia face such switching delays when they opt for a competitor. 

 UHA President Jordan Clark said:  "Natural gas is the same product everywhere it is sold in the U.S. and yet consumers face wildly different approaches to deregulation.  Washington, D.C., is a textbook example of how to make a complete mockery of energy deregulation.  We are aware of many dozens of consumers who have been frustrated at every turn in their efforts to get the former monopoly utility here out of their pocketbooks.  The games that are used make it often very difficult or impossible for consumers to switch to lower-cost energy suppliers.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is Atlanta, where consumers almost never have problems switching and, as a result, actually get a chance to save under energy deregulation." 

 The UHA warning is national in scope because a majority of states are in the early stages of the energy deregulation process, with often different approaches for encouraging price competition in electricity and natural gas. For example, natural gas deregulation is now underway in 32 states with four totally deregulated (including Georgia), seven in the first phases of the process, another 12 states (including those in the greater Washington D.C., area) with deregulation pilot programs, and 10 states actively considering deregulation. 


Jordan added: "The message here is something that needs to be understood by
lawmakers and homeowners across the nation.  So-called 'pilot programs' that
leave ex-monopoly utilities in charge of the day-to-day side of implementing
deregulation are a train wreck waiting to happen.   You can't leave the fox
guarding the chicken coop and expect anything but the predictable result.
The notion that consumers need a 'go-ahead slow' approach to energy
deregulation is patently offensive and ignores the evidence that full-scale
energy deregulation is working quite well in Atlanta.  The only parties that
benefit by a slow crawl to energy deregulation are the ex- monopolies that get
a last-ditch opportunity to wring every last penny they can out of unwary
consumers."
  EXTREMES IN ENERGY
  DEREGULATION:  D.C. AND ATLANTA



In highlighting a national problem in deregulated energy markets, the United
Homeowners Association highlighted two markets - Washington, D.C., and
Atlanta, Georgia, that are polar opposites in the approach taken to energy
deregulation.   Georgia consumers are benefiting from an approach to
deregulation that gave all 1.4 million customers in the state the right to
switch from Atlanta Gas & Light (AGL) to 19 competitors over a one-year
period.



By contrast, consumers in the Washington, D.C. and the adjoining Maryland
and Virginia suburbs are forced to go through the ex-monopoly, Washington Gas
& Light, to make switches from a short list of WGL-approved energy providers.
Among its many anti-consumer provisions are the pilot program's requirement
forbidding customers new to the D.C. area from using any other supplier than
WGL during their first month of residency.   Customers also are required to
switch back to WGL if they move from a second to a third energy supplier.
Further, the Washington, D.C. "experiment" forbids Virginia and Maryland
customers to make switches over the Internet.



In contrasting the pilot program approach in Washington, D.C. to wide-open
energy deregulation in Atlanta, UHA noted the following problems:
  *  Long delays in switching. UHA is aware of many dozens of complaints
     in the greater Washington, D.C., area of unreasonably long delays faced
     by WGL customers seeking to switch to lower-cost alternative energy
     companies.  Switching delays of three months were common of the
     complaints made in Washington.  This compares starkly to the Atlanta
     energy deregulation experience where most switches are handled within
     hours and cases of delays involving days or weeks are virtually unheard
     of.
  *  Excessive switching failures. UHA found evidence that WGL fails to
     process as many as three out of four switches submitted to it by
     competitors. In many cases, the reasons cited for the rejections (e.g.,
     missing middle initials on customer forms) appear to be so trivial as
     to be part of a deliberate effort to block the maximum number of
     customer switches. By contrast, the switching failure rate for
     consumers in Atlanta is well under one in 10 cases, according to UHA's
     analysis.  Significantly, failed switches in Atlanta are straightened
     out in a matter of days rather than the typical three-month hold-up
     encountered in the Washington, D.C. area.
  *  Technological barriers to competition.  Perhaps the clearest
     indication that the WGL "pilot program" is set-up in a way to block
     customer switches is the process involved.  WGL accepts switches from
     alternative energy companies on only one day every month.  It uses what
     is essentially a non-computerized process that requires each case to be
     handled in a time-consuming way.  Any deviation from WGL records for a
     customer results in a rejection of the switch application, which may
     then not be considered until the one-day switching period in the
     following month.  To further complicate matters, WGL does not permit
     access to customer records so that switching applications may be
     double-checked prior to submission. By contrast, the Atlanta switching
     process is open all month long, uses state-of-the-art technology,
     shares customer record information in order to minimize the likelihood
     of switch rejection, and permits instantaneous resubmission of any
     failed switches.
  *  Billing problems.  UHA is aware of a number of cases in which former
     WGL customers, after being switched, complain about continuing to be
     billed for full service by Washington Gas & Light.  Not only have these
     complaints been resolved in a manner that is excessively time
     consuming, but this appears to have the effect of making it virtually
     impossible for online energy companies to compete, since they are
     starved for cash due to the delayed payments.  No such problems have
     been reported in Atlanta, where AGL must meet with a panel of
     competitors on a regular basis and respond to complaints and
     suggestions for improvements in the deregulation system there. No such
     mechanism exists under the Washington, D.C. "pilot program" to ensure
     that small competitors to the WGL are not crushed by their entrenched
     ex-monopoly competitor.
  *  Unresponsive bureaucracy.  With no incentive to lose customers, an ex-
     monopoly left in charge of its deregulation may be somewhat less than
     enthusiastic about assisting customers in switching to competitors.
     Participants in the WGL program have long complained that the company
     is unwilling to assist customers that seek to switch to lower-cost
     energy companies. And there appears to be little pro-consumer watchdog
     oversight of WGL. (When UHA contacted the Public Service Commission for
     information about the D.C. area pilot program, it was directed to
     Washington Gas & Light,) By contrast, the Atlanta deregulation program
     is actively overseen by consumer protection authorities, who have been
     active in policing the few problems with energy deregulation that have
     cropped up in Georgia.
  IMPACT OF ABUSES ON CONSUMERS



To illustrate how "switching games" are used by ex-monopoly utilities to
discourage consumers from switching, UHA offered two representative consumer

 JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: For the numbers and a list of 

 stocks to watch, let`s check  in with Christine Romans at  the New York Stock Exchange. Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Jack. Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) met lowered Wall Street forecast of 30 cents a share in the most recent quarter. But it warned about its third quarter. You might remember that last month it issued its third profit warning in something like 4 quarters that is what made Wall Street lower their expectations for the company. The company reporting that will be taken an 11 cents charge on some bad  debt issues in its Mexican unit. Let`s take a look at the stock and you can see that investor and analyst and the street clearly this is not a huge surprise judging from the way the stock has behaved. It looks like investor have had a great deal of pessimism about Xerox shares for some time now. Static lowered chart since late last year. What investors and analyst are trying to decide now is just what exactly the timing of some sort of repositioning or recovery will be. Now DaimlerChrysler (URL: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com) shares. DCX is the ADRs, the ticker symbol here at the New York Stock Exchange. But those shares overseas are trading down about 2 percent. I`ll tell you why the company came out with its profit report and while its Q2 net was up 18 percent, the company as expected warned about its 2000 profits saying it will be less than it was in 1999. Investor are selling off that stock. If you can look at DaimlerChrysler shares, it`s sort of a Xerox kind of story. It`s been trending lower for some time now about a year it`s been a dramatic downturn in the stock. You can see it`s trading right now near a 52-week lows. And LSI Logic (URL: http://www.lsilogic.com/) , want to tell you about that one. It`s a chipmaker. LSI is the ticker symbol. It  came in in line with expectations of 29 cents a share. But analyst are digging into the revenue numbers, Jack, and some of them don`t like what they see. Revenue $644 million. That is falling short of what some analyst had been expecting. There was some volatility in the stock in the after hours. It fell something like six points. The report was released after the closing bell. Stock fell 6. Recovered a little bit, but it is still leaning lower trading around 40 or slightly below 40 in the pre-market. So we`ll be watching to see if that stock is still weak this morning or if investors think that maybe it got overdone in after hours trading which also happens sometimes. So we`ll watch to see how investor react to that one as well. Back to you.

 - CONOCO INC. 

 HOUSTON -- Conoco Inc. said Monday that second-quarter earnings quadrupled and beat expectations thanks to sharply higher oil prices as well as a recovery in profit margins for gasoline and other fuels. The integrated oil company said net income before special items rose to $460  million, or 73 cents a diluted share, from $114  million, or 18  cents a share, in the same period last year. Analysts on average had forecast that Conoco would earn 70 cents a share, said First Call/ Thomson Financial, which tracks estimates. Conoco said revenues climbed to a new quarterly high of $9.5  billion, up $3.2 billion, or 50  percent, over a year ago, thanks in part to red-hot prices for crude oil and natural gas.  For the quarter, crude-oil prices averaged about $28.75 compared  with $17.70 a barrel a year ago. 

 - GOODYEAR TIRE 

 NEW YORK -- Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the world's largest tire maker, said Monday  its second-quarter operating profit rose nearly 9 percent, exceeding Wall Street's lowered forecasts, helped by cost- containment efforts and increased efficiency. The Akron, Ohio-based company said that excluding one-time items, it earned $64.9  million, or 41  cents per share, up from $59.7  million, or 37  cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts' consensus forecast was 38  cents per share, revised down from 58  cents after the company issued a profitwarning in June. Including charges, Goodyear's second-quarter net income fell more than 9  percent, to $59.7  million, or 38 cents per diluted share, from $65.7  million, or 41  cents per diluted share. Net sales were $3.47  billion, up nearly 14  percent from $3.05 billion a year earlier. 

 - ENRON CORP. 

 HOUSTON -- Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, said Monday that its second-quarter earnings rose 30  percent and beat Wall Street estimates as Internet- based trading boosted its core wholesale-energy business. Net income rose to $289  million, or 34 cents per share, from $222  million, or 27  cents per share, in the second quarter of 1999. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 32  cents a share. Second-quarter revenue rose 75  percent to $16.9  billion from $9.7 billion. In addition to its core energy business, Enron has branched out into broadband telecommunications. It also recently acquired the London- based metals trading house MG Plc. 

 - KNIGHT RIDDER 

 SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Knight Ridder Inc., the No.  2 U.S. newspaper- publishing group,  reported higher second-quarter earnings Monday, beating Wall Street estimates.  Advertising revenues  continued to fuel growth as the company expands onto the Internet. Excluding special one-time items, earnings rose to $1.02 per share from 83 cents in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 95 cents per share. The publisher said earnings including one-time items rose to $96.3  million, or $1.08   cents per share, from $86.6  million, or 88  cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue grew about 5  percent, to $852.5  million from $809.7  million. Ross Jones, Knight Ridder's chief financial officer, said advertising revenues were strong. Knight Ridder publishes 32 daily newspapers in 28 U.S. markets with a daily readership of 8.7  million and 12.9 million on Sundays. 

 - MERCK & CO. 

 NEW YORK -- Merck & Co., the world's No.  2 drug company,  posted a 16 percent rise in second-quarter earnings Monday, beating Wall Street forecasts on robust sales from newer drugs, and said results for the full year should also beat expectations. In view of strong company sales for the first half of the year, Merck notched up its earnings expectations for the whole year. The company said it "would be reasonable to expect full-year 2000 results to be above the current range" of Wall Street forecasts. The Whitehouse Station, N.J.- based company posted quarterly earnings of $1.72  billion, or 73 cents per share, compared with $1.48  billion, or 61  cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected 69  cents a share. Quarterly per-share results were also bolstered by a share-buyback program. Total sales rose 18  percent to $9.5 billion, led by the company's arthritis painkiller Vioxx, which was launched last year and competes with the Pharmacia Corp. drug Celebrex. 

 - SAFECO CORP. 

 NEW YORK -- Safeco Corp., the eighth-largest U.S. home insurer, reported second-quarter profit fell 77  percent Monday, largely due to storm losses in the Midwest and rising claims in other lines of coverage. The Seattle-based company, which also sells life insurance and asset-management services, said operating profit, excluding one- time items, fell to $12.1  million, or 10 cents per share, from $53.2 million, or 40  cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. The results missed analysts' lowered average forecast of 12  cents-per- share profit.

 AT&T Earnings Beat Forecasts

 NEW YORK (AP) - Quarterly profits at AT&T Corp. and its new wireless group beat Wall Street forecasts, but the nation's biggest long-distance and cable TV company didn't convince some analysts that recent problems have been overcome. 

 AT&T said net profits totaled $1.75 billion or 53 cents a share in the second quarter, up nearly 10 percent from $1.59 billion or 49 cents a share in the same period in 1999. 

 Operating profits, which exclude certain one-time factors and AT&T's stakes in Cablevision and ExciteAtHome, came to $1.88 billion or 57 cents a share, topping the consensus forecast of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Second-quarter revenue totaled $16.87 billion, if adjusted to include a full quarter from the MediaOne, the cable TV company that AT&T acquired in mid-June. That figure represents a 4.5 percent increase from the combined second-quarter revenues generated last year by the same operations. 

 AT&T Wireless Group posted an unexpected profit of $22 million or 6 cents a share in an abbreviated second quarter that began April 27, when the company was created through an initial public offering of a separate stock representing AT&T's mobile phone business and a new initiative to deliver calls and Web access to homes using "fixed wireless" antennas. Analysts had expected the wireless group, which is still fully owned by AT&T, to show a loss of 1 cent per share, according to First Call. 

 Wireless revenues grew 31.9 percent to $2.48 billion compared with a year-ago tally of $1.88 billion. The average monthly revenue per subscriber was $71.50, up from the $66.40 reported for the second quarter of 1999. 

 But aside from the wireless group's stellar showing, Tuesday's update wasn't quite so encouraging as some analysts had hoped, especially in terms of the business services unit's recovery from some first-quarter stumbles and the company's decision to wait before making forecasts for next year. 

 In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AT&T rose just 62.50 cents to $33.938, while AT&T Wireless rose $1.437 or 5 percent to $28.50. 

 Second-quarter revenues from business services, a key market AT&T hopes will fill the void left by falling prices in consumer long distance, grew just 4 percent to $7.1 billion. And during a conference call with analysts, executives acknowledged that the unit's full-year growth would come in at the lower end of the 6 percent to 8 percent range the company predicted three months ago. 

 "They still have not cleared the stench from the first quarter," said Jim Linnehan, telecommunications analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners. 

 Linnehan remained positive on AT&T's overall prospects. "It looks like they're setting themselves up for a nice 2001." But he and other analysts found it unsettling that AT&T still wasn't ready to provide any forecasts. 

 AT&T's chief financial officer, Charles Noski, insisted that the only way to win back Wall Street's confidence after the company's profitwarning three months ago was to carefully reassess every aspect of the business before making new predictions. 

 "Until we complete that process and I feel comfortable that we've got our arms around what 2001 and 2002 look like, we're not going to go out and give 20001 guidance," Noski said. "That's the way I do business, (chief executive) Mike Armstrong agrees with that, and I think that's a better idea than going out with premature outlooks that may be wrong." 

 Meanwhile, AT&T's second-quarter report also provided an early peak at the customer response to the new PocketNet online service for mobile phones launched in May and the company's limited trials with residential fixed wireless service. 

 At the end of the second quarter, there were more than 80,000 PocketNet users among AT&T's 11.7 million mobile phone subscribers, a figure that has increased to more than 100,000 in July. AT&T declined to quantify how many of those customers were using the basic version of PocketNet, which is free, except to say that more than expected had signed up for premium services. 

 The fixed wireless service, introduced in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in March, now has about 2,800 customers using 6,000 phone lines and about 70 percent of whom also signed up for high-speed Internet service. The average monthly bill has been about $85 per month.

 WRAP: Land's End Down 25% After 2nd Quarter  Profit Warning

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Lands' End Inc. (LE), which last month lowered
sales projections, saw its shares lose ground Monday after the company
said earnings for its fiscal second quarter and year will be even worse
than it had previously forecast.


 The catalog and Internet retailer now says it expects earnings for the quarter ending July 28 to be around 7 cents a share and sales to be flat with the year-earlier period. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned 14 cents a share on sales of $254.6 million. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to earn 17 cents a share. Prior to last month's warning, analysts' estimates had been for second-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share. 

 For the year, Lands' End indicated it expects to post earnings of around $1.82 a share. Analysts had been looking for earnings of $1.90 a share. 

 In recent years, Lands' End has been saddled with excess inventory resulting from unappealing offerings and has struggled with problems at its children's apparel and home-fashions catalogs. In children's apparel, Lands' End has been facing stiffer competition from retailers such as Gap Inc. (GPS) and Target Corp.'s (TGT) discount stores. 

 In May, the company reported first-quarter results that were far worse than Wall Street expected. In June, Lands' End lowered sales projections for its fiscal first half and year, citing weakness at its specialty-catalog businesses. While results for the second quarter weren't expected to be as strong as previously projected, Lands" End in June stressed that earnings for the second quarter would rise from the year-earlier quarter. 

 The company said it now expects sales for the full year to increase by 6%, rather than previous projections of "somewhat above 6%." But improved gross profit margins should help Lands' End meet its previous pretax profit goal of about 7% of sales. 

 The NYSE-listed shares recently traded at 30, down 10 1/8 or 25.2% on volume of 1.1 million compared with average daily volume of 280,000

 thanks to gains by high-tech heavyweights 

 Bay Street bucked Wall Street's trend yesterday, propelling Canada's benchmark index to end the week above the high-profile Dow Jones industrial average. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-stock index closed up 101.28 points to 10,842.08, thanks to steep gains from some of Canada's high-tech market heavyweights. Year to date, the Little Index That Could has chugged up 32 per cent. The Standard & Poor's TSE 60-stock index closed at 665.47, up 8.54 points. 

 In Vancouver,Canada's junior high techs pushed the Canadian Venture Exchange's CDNX index up 5.13 points to 3,383.20. 

 In New York, strong profit warnings from some big high-tech firms pummelled the major indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index fell 90.11 points to 4,093.76 after wireless phone maker Ericsson Inc. and computer printer firm Lexmark International Inc. warned that third-quarter profit could fall below analysts' estimates. 

 The Dow Jones lost 110.31 points to 10,733.56 on the back of the big computer hardware companies. Dow bigwig Hewlett-Packard Co. fell more than 5 per cent to $123.44 (U.S.) after Agilent Technologies Inc., a spinoff of HP, issued a profit warning. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 15.38 points to 1,480.19. 

 Of the TSE's 14 subindexes, seven kept their heads above water. The industrial products sector -- home to many of the TSE's high-tech companies -- was up 2 per cent after falling into negative territory during the first part of trading. 

 The precious minerals grouping was the biggest loser, declining almost 2 per cent, as Bay Street's large gold producers took a tumble. 

 In what has become a norm on the TSE lately, a handful of stocks did most of the work on the 300 index. Market heavyweight Nortel Networks Corp. gained $3.75 (Canadian) to $118.95. The Brampton, Ont.-based bellwether touched a 52-week high of $119.65. 

 Fibre-optic maker JDS Uniphase Corp. continued to ride the wave of investor popularity following Thursday's mammoth move forward. JDS surged another $9.65 to $197.95. Standard & Poor's Corp. recently announced that JDS was being added to its high-profile S&P 500-stock index. 

 Fellow heavyweight Canadian Pacific Ltd. gained 55 cents to $38.80 after its subsidiary, Canadian Pacific Railway Co., announced it had inked two agreements with Canadian National Railway Co. to share tracks in Canada and the United States. 

 Global electronic information provider Thomson Corp., the parent company of The Globe and Mail, announced that it had completed the sale of its final batch of U.S. newspapers to Gannett Co. Inc. for $1.125-billion (U.S.). Thomson touched a 52-week high of $60.25 (Canadian) between bells, then retreated slightly to close up almost 3 per cent at $59.90. 

 On the earnings watch, Rogers Communications Inc.'s class B shares fell 30 cents to $41.90 despite its improved second-quarter earnings report.

 Nasdaq, Small-Cap Stocks Continue To Trade Lower

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Near the midpoint of Friday's session, Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks continue to trade lower, kept down by profit taking and concerns about the outlook for profit growth in the months ahead. 

 The Nasdaq Composite was recently off 47.22 at 4137.34. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks is down 7.76 at 526.99, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 83.71 at 10,760.16. 

 Technology stocks have been faring poorly throughout the day. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index, which has been dropping recently, is down 4%. Among large players in the chip industry, Intel Corp. is off 2% and Applied Materials Inc. is down 3.7%. The Nasdaq Computer Index is off 1.4%, while the Dow Jones Internet Commerce Index is down 1.5%. 

 Profit-taking is likely playing a role in Friday's decline, as investors are coming off a Thursday session that saw stock prices advance amid favorable comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. And the monthly expiration of options contracts takes place Friday and is probably affecting the stock market as well. 

 But Bill Meehan, market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, says the decline is also being driven by investors' concerns about earnings growth in future quarters. These fears have been apparently stoked by Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson's warning that problems with its mobile handset unit will hold back profit growth. Recently, Ericsson's American depositary receipts were off 10.2%. 


On the Nasdaq, declining issues lead advancers, 2,343 to 1,218, with
1,489 unchanged. Nasdaq National Market volume is 869.3 million shares,
with total volume of 889 million shares.

OLICK: Testimony by Alan Greenspan fueled Thursday's surging stock prices on Wall Street. CBS MarketWatch analyst Alexis Christoforous has that.   

ALEXIS CHRISTOFOROUS reporting:   

Fed chief Alan Greenspan said the magic words, `the economy is slowing.' In his semiannual speech before Congress, Greenspan made some cautious but upbeat comments. He said the economy is beginning to balance itself, and that may reduce the risk of accelerating inflation. Investors took that to mean the Fed may hold off on raising interest rates at its August meeting.   

But it wasn't all about Greenspan. IBM gets some of the credit. It soared 8 1/4 on the heels of its better-than-expected earnings. In fact, IBM's rally accounted for nearly half the Dow's gain.

IBM (IBM) up 8 1/4 to 117

down 10 3/8 to 54 1/8   

CHRISTOFOROUS: Here at the NASDAQ, though, we have to talk about  JDS Uniphase, rallying nearly 20 percent on word that it will be added to the S&P 500 Index. And the rally could live on, courtesy of some after-the-bell news. That's when America Online said earnings beat the Street by 2 cents a share, as it added nearly a million new subscribers in its fourth quarter. And  Sun Microsystems unleashed earnings that were 6 cents ahead of estimates. But  Agilent Technologies could feel Wall Street's wrath. After the bell, the  Hewlett-Packard spinoff warned that earnings will miss the mark. At the NASDAQ Marketsite, I'm Alexis Christoforous, CBS MarketWatch.

 Nasdaq Drops 2.9% As Microsoft Results Weigh on Market

 WSJ.com 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.9% Wednesday, weighed down by disappointment with Microsoft's earnings and other results amid caution about coming reports. The software bellwether also restrained blue chips despite upbeat results from some other companies. 

 The technology-rich Nasdaq composite closed down 121.54 points to 4055.63, adding to Tuesday's 97.50-point drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 43.84 points, or 0.4%, to 10696.08 after falling 64 points the previous session. 

 Other major indexes also ended lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.78 to 1481.96, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 1.26 to 656.95, and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks lost 8.42, or 1.6%, to 527.86. 

 Microsoft (MSFT), the most active stock on the Nasdaq market, dropped 5 3/8, or 7%, to 73 1/8 by 4 p.m. EDT after the software giant reported after the close Tuesday that its quarterly earnings beat Wall Street's estimates. But revenue was flat, and analysts with SG Cowen and Prudential Securities lowered their ratings on the company. 

 Microsoft's decline overshadowed gains by other blue chips, including Coca-Cola, Citigroup and Boeing, that issued encouraging earnings results Wednesday. Analysts said investors also extended Tuesday's bout of profit-taking that emerged following a week of gains as second-quarter earnings season picked up speed. 

 Edward Collins, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America, said the reaction to the earnings news from Microsoft and some other big-cap technology stocks weighed on the broader market as investors dissected earnings reports. "There were actually a few disappointments, even though the numbers at first glance looked good," Mr. Collins said. 

 Uncertainty about coming earnings and the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy also restrained the market ahead of much-anticipated remarks from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan scheduled for Thursday. Mr. Greenspan speaks to the Senate Banking Committee on monetary policy, a semiannual precedent started with the now-lapsed Humphrey-Hawkins bill. Investors will be looking to Mr. Greenspan's remarks for possible hints about whether the Fed will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in August. The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999 to curb inflationary pressures and restrain the U.S. economy, and left rates unchanged at its last meeting. 

 On Wednesday, Internet, computer, semiconductor and biotech shares declined, with airline, health-care and retail shares also weak. Treasury prices edged lower on caution ahead of Mr. Greenspan's remarks. The dollar rose against the euro but showed little movement against the yen. 

 In addition to the Microsoft report, the market received better-than expected earnings results from technology heavyweight and Dow component Intel, as well as Apple Computer, following the close of trading Tuesday. But the reaction on Wall Street was negative. 

 Shares of Intel (INTC) fell 4 7/8 to 138 1/8, giving back early gains and weighing on the broader market. The chip maker reported late Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings jumped 79%. Apple Computer's (AAPL) shares fell 4 9/16 to 52 11/16 after the company beat profit expectations but showed weaker-than-expected revenue. 

 Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said the downturn in the face of earnings that are beating expectations suggests the market already has priced in good reports, and investors are taking profits following the official announcements. 

 "You're having a lot of good earnings and a lot of negative reactions," Mr. Hyman said. "That means the market has probably run up too much on the Nasdaq or the growth stocks." 

 Although many companies are meeting or beating Wall Street's earnings estimates, some of those falling short of so-called whisper numbers also are seeing declines after releasing results, Mr. Hyman noted. Whisper numbers are unofficial earnings estimates that circulate on the Internet and on trading desks. 

 Earnings news continued to flow from other Dow components following encouraging results over the past week, with Citigroup (C) rising 1 3/16 to 67 7/8 after beating Wall Street's estimates. Elsewhere in the banking sector, Chase Manhattan (CMB) also beat estimates, but Bank One (ONE) fell short of expectations. 

 Among other blue-chip companies, Coca-Cola (KO) rose 2 5/16 to 60 1/2 after beating expectations and Boeing (BA) rose 3/4 to 45 7/8 after topping estimates, but United Technologies (UTX) fell 1 1/2 to 57 1/2 after exceeding forecasts. Shares of International Business Machines (IBM) rose 13/16 to 104 1/8 ahead of its earnings report. After the closing bell, IBM reported a 19% decline in second-quarter net income amid sluggish hardware sales, although per-share results topped estimates by six cents. 

 Airline shares came under pressure, despite posting results Tuesday and Wednesday that were mostly above expectations, after United Airlines' parent UAL Corp. issued a profit warning. The S&P Airlines Index dropped 3.8%, as shares of UAL (UAL) fell 5 15/16, or 10%, to 53 5/16 and the overall transportation sector declined. 

 Veritas Software (VRTS), a developer of software used to manage data storage, dropped 15 5/16, or 12%, to 112 1/4 after reporting its core results were better than analysts had anticipated. And Commerce One (CMRC), a developer of electronic-commerce software, fell 11 1/4, or 17%, to 55 5/16 after its core loss wasn't as bad as analysts had expected. But computer storage maker EMC (EMC) rose 4 7/16 to 83 after reporting a better-than-expected 50% increase in second-quarter net income. 

 Outside the U.S., European markets closed mixed as Wanadoo, France Telecom's Internet arm, gained 10% in its debut in Paris. Across the Asian-Pacific region, markets also closed mixed Wednesday. 

 In major U.S. market action: 

 Stocks fell. On the Big Board, where 906 million shares traded, 1,117 stocks advanced and 1,670 declined. On the Nasdaq market, 1.43 billion shares changed hands. 

 Treasurys fell. The 10-year Treasury note was down nearly 1/8 point, or $1.25 for a $1,000 bond, bringing the yield up to 6.15%. The 30-year bond fell 1/8 point to yield 5.91%. 

 The dollar rose modestly against the euro. It traded at 92.38 cents to the euro and 108.26 yen to the dollar, compared with 92.65 cents to the euro and 108.27 yen to the dollar late Tuesday in New York.

SENATE OKS $248 BILLION MARRIAGE TAX RELIEF BILL GOP-BACKED MEASURE FACES VETO BY CLINTON

The Senate voted Tuesday to reduce taxes for married couples as Republicans emboldened by new estimates of soaring budget surpluses set their sights on keeping their tax cut bandwagon rolling through the election year. 

Defying an almost certain White House veto, the Senate voted 61 to 38 in favor of a GOP-drafted measure to eliminate a quirk in the tax code under which millions of married couples pay more in taxes than they would if they were single and filing separate returns. The bill, which would also extend relief to many other married couples, would reduce federal revenues by $248 billion over the next decade. 

"Families today have many, many financial challenges," said Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth Jr., R-Del. "Getting married should not be one of them. It's only fair it's only fair to let families keep more of what they earn." Eight Democrats, including Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, broke with the party to back the bill, underscoring the Republicans success this year in mustering some Democratic support for tax bills something they were unable to do last year when President Clinton vetoed their major GOP tax bill for the year. In the shifting politics of taxes, Republicans are now gambling that voters, swept up in a booming economy, are becoming inured to long-standing Democratic arguments that GOP tax cuts primarily help the rich. 

Last week, Congress completed work on legislation to phase out the federal estate tax, and GOP lawmakers are preparing more bills raising contribution limits on individual retirement accounts, cutting Social Security taxes for upper-income people, and possibly repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax, a measure originally enacted to prevent wealthy Americans from avoiding paying any taxes. 

In the wake of new Congressional Budget Office estimates of the surplus, GOP leaders said they may further sweeten the marriage tax bill when House and Senate members meet to reconcile competing versions of the bill. 

Lawmakers said, for instance, that they may speed up the implementation of the legislation, which, as approved by the Senate, would: increase the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly to twice the basic standard deduction for an unmarried individual, expand the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets for married couples, and adjust the Earned Income Credit to help lower income families. 

The Congressional Budget Office reported Tuesday that putting aside the Social Security program, the budget surplus will be nearly $2.2 trillion over the coming decade, or $1.3 trillion higher than the budget office's January estimates. 

"This extra surplus is . . . a windfall profit to the federal government based on the work, the efforts, the risk-taking of the American workers," said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. "As a result, the government, like a company, should give a bonus to those who made this possible." Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., added that "we ought to do all we can" to allow Americans to keep more of their money "since there's a tremendous non-Social Security surplus pouring into the federal Treasury." But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., urged Republicans to use prudence in spending the projected surplus, warning that it could shrink or disappear almost as quickly as it snowballed during the past two years. 

Daschle said the soaring surplus projections are the "fiscal equivalent of the dot.com stock market and every bit as volatile," adding that "to base an entire tax strategy on that volatility I think is a huge mistake." Democrats also raised fairness issues: A new Treasury Department analysis of seven GOP tax measures that have passed the House Ways and Means Committee this year said that together, 76 percent of the cuts would go to the 23 million wealthiest families. The remaining 91 million families would get just over 23 percent. 

Clinton has proposed more targeted marriage penalty relief, but Tuesday he renewed his offer to accept a bigger tax cut of roughly $250 billion over 10 years if the Republicans would accept a Medicare prescription drug benefit for the elderly of an equal value along the lines of the Democratic plan. 

"By itself, I would veto this bill," Clinton said in a statement issued Tuesday from Camp David, where he was brokering the Mideast peace talks. He described the Republican plan as "fiscally irresponsible, poorly targeted, and regressive." 

With surpluses looming, Democrats have joined with Republicans in calling for major tax relief this year, but the two sides have not been able to agree on the size or shape of legislation in a highly charged political atmosphere. The House took the lead early this year in passing marriage penalty relief legislation a 10-year, $182 billion measure. 

But the effort stalled in the Senate when the Republicans could not overcome Democratic delaying tactics. 

Last week, the Republicans took a different tack by granting the marriage penalty tax legislation special immunity from filibusters. The House passed its version of the bill for the second time, and Tuesday the Senate finally pushed through its version. Once they work out their differences, GOP leaders intend to send a final version to Clinton before the start of the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia on July 31. By doing so, they hope to draw stark differences between the two parties over taxes. 

House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters Tuesday that Congress would delay sending Clinton the legislation phasing out the estate tax until September, to deny Clinton the chance to lump it together with the marriage penalty legislation and portray the cuts as too costly. 

"They're anxious to get everything together so they can throw their right labels on it and see if they can spin their way out of signing it," Armey said.

 Baby Bells win court victory on network leasing SBC Communications and other regional Bell companies won a partial victory yesterday when a federal appeals court struck down rules that govern how much rivals can pay to lease pieces of local phone giants' networks. 

 The Federal Communications Commission failed to comply with the Telecommunications Act of 1996 when it adopted a formula based on the cost of building an efficient network in the future, a panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found. SBC had argued the fees should be based on the actual cost it paid to build the network, but AT&T Corp. and others said that would reward the practices of an inefficient monopoly. 

 The rates for leasing network pieces - copper wires, switches, billing systems - have been the subject of legal tussles for years. Competitors of the Baby Bells say there will be no local phone competition until they can turn a profit using leased facilities while they build out their own networks. 

 While the 8th Circuit held that fees could be based on future costs, it said the FCC erred by relying on a model based on hypothetical factors. The rules will now be remanded to the agency for revision. 

 New Jersey regulators, whose own formula for network leasing was struck down earlier this year, plan to revisit the issue in October hearings. 

 Energy costs mar otherwise good inflation report Soaring gasoline prices and a record jump in the cost of natural gas were largely responsible for a sharp increase in consumer inflation last month. Most other prices were tame. 

 ''People are paying a lot more at the gasoline pump, and inflation is a lot higher as a result, but outside the energy sector, inflation is low," said Mark Zandi, economist with RFA Dismal Sciences. 

 The split picture left economists divided about whether the Federal Reserve will push interest rates higher next month to keep inflation in check. 

 After a tiny rise in May, the Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched inflation gauge, shot up a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent in June, the largest increase since March, the Labor Department reported yesterday. 

 The jolt came from an expected leap in energy prices, which hit their highest point in 14 months with a 5.6 percent bounce. 

 Outside the volatile energy and food categories, inflation's "core" rate rose just 0.2 percent for a third consecutive month, suggesting that most other prices remain under control. The core performance matched many analysts' expectations. 

 Aetna's stock tumbles after profit warning Aetna warned yesterday that second-quarter earnings may be well below Wall Street expectations due to rising medical costs at its health maintenance organizations. 

 The company's stock tumbled more than 10 percent after sliding 6 percent Monday amid reports that Aetna was nearing a deal to sell its financial services and international businesses to ING Group of the Netherlands. 

 In yesterday's warning, Aetna predicted that second-quarter profits will total just 85 cents to 95 cents per share. 

 Industry analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had estimated Aetna would earn about $1.20 per share for the quarter. 

 Aetna's shares fell $6.94 to $59.69. Compiled from reports by

 Dow Ends Down 44; Nasdaq Falls 124 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stock prices tumbled today as disappointed investors vented their wrath on a slew of technology companies whose second-quarter financial results fell short of expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 43.84 at 10,696.08, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 123.77 at 4,053.40. The primary catalyst for the selloff was disappointing quarterly results from two technology bellwethers - Microsoft and Apple. Microsoft fell $5.375 to $73.125 after the software giant reported that second quarter sales were stagnant. Earnings were up for the quarter, but the increase was attributed to investment income rather than profits from sales. Investors punished Apple after the computer maker beat Wall Street's earnings expectations by a mere penny. Apple reported second quarter profits of 45 cents a share. Wall Street had predicted 44 cents. Apple's stock was off $4.562 at $52.688. 

 United Technologies Earnings Rise 

 HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Second-quarter operating income at United Technologies Corp. jumped 22 percent, boosted by strong revenue growth at its air conditioning and elevator units. For the three months ended June 30, UTC earned $509 million, or $1.00 per share - a bit more than the 98 cents expected by analysts. In the year-ago period, the Hartford-based company earned $1.08 billion, though $650 million came from the sale of discontinued operations. Excluding that and other one-time items, UTC earned $417 million a year ago. 

 Intel Delays Shipments of New Chip 

 SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) - Intel Corp., the world's biggest computer chip maker, has postponed the debut of its first 64-bit processor for at least three months. It wants more time to test the chip to detect any possible bugs before the product hits the market. Intel won't begin selling the chip, dubbed Itanium, until the fourth quarter, company officials said today. The Itanium is designed for use in sophisticated computer servers rather than PCs. Such servers power the Internet and run large corporate databases. 

 Banks Report Mixed Earnings 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Citigroup's second-quarter earnings rose nearly 23 percent, beating Wall Street forecasts, while Chase Manhattan and the southeast regional bank Wachovia posted smaller profits but still topped expectations. The robust profit report released today by Citigroup showed strong growth in consumer and investment banking for the nation's largest financial services company. Chase suffered from a drop in the value of investments because of the stock market slump and weakness in its consumer banking division. Wachovia's results were hurt by loan losses and non-performing assets. Meanwhile, troubled Bank One Corp. in Chicago reported a huge second-quarter loss on taking an after-tax charge of $1.91 billion to write down assets in its First USA card unit and other non-performing loans. 

 Coca-Cola Beats Expectations 

 ATLANTA (AP) - Second-quarter earnings at Coca-Cola Co. dropped 2 percent as its restructuring efforts continue to affect the bottom line. However, it beat analysts' expectations with strong growth overseas helping out. Coke said it earned $926 million for the three months ended June 30, or 37 cents per share. In the same period last year, Coke earned $942 million, or 38 cents per share. xcluding one-time items, Coke earned 44 cents a share, beating the forecast of 41 cents per share by analysts. 

 GM, Ford Raise Incentives on Models 

 DETROIT (AP) - General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have raised incentives on several car and truck models, a move aimed at keeping customers coming to showrooms while U.S. auto sales appear to be slowing. GM this week followed similar moves Ford made last week. The Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler AG raised its incentives at the beginning of June. GM's new program raises rebates to $2,000 on several models, including all its minivans. 

 Airlines Beat Street's Expectations 

 NEW YORK (AP) - AMR Corp, UAL Corp and Trans World Airlines Inc. all beat analysts expectations, but an earnings warning by UAL, the parent of United Airlines, sent most airline stocks down sharply today. Meanwhile, US Airways missed expectations due to higher fuel costs and the threat of a strike. UAL Corp, the parent of United Airlines said second-quarter earnings were $336 million, down from $637 million, though last year's results include a one-time $428 million gain from the company's sale of its stake in Gallileo International. However, UAL also warned that third-quarter revenue growth would slow. AMR, the parent of American Airlines said record numbers of passengers pushed its second-quarter operating profit higher, to net income of $321 million, or $1.96 per share, up from $268 million, or $1.76 per share in the year-ago period. At Trans World Airlines Inc. losses were narrowed by $2 million as the carrier beat expectations. Trans Wold reported an operating income of $15.3 million and a net loss of $4.23 million, or eight cents a share. A year ago, oy lost $6.2 million, or 18 cents per share. US. Airways earned $80 million, or $1.17 per share, well below the the $1.38 per share estimate of analysts. 

 Qwest Revenues Increase 47 Percent 

 DENVER (AP) - Qwest Communications International and U S West both topped Wall Street profit forecasts for the past three months, the final quarter before an $85 billion merger that transformed the companies into a telephone and Internet powerhouse. Qwest said today it has operating profits of $39.7 million, or 5 cents a share, for the second quarter. Those results exclude one-time merger-related costs that reduced Qwest's net profit to $7.2 million, or 1 cent per share. U S West, the local phone company for most of the Rocky Mountains and Northwest regions, posted a net loss of $121 million, down 24 cents a share, mostly as a result of $178 million in costs related to the merger. Excluding one-time factors, the former Baby Bell earned $447 million, or 87 cents a share, beating analyst forecasts of 84 cents a share. 

 McGraw-Hill Reports Earnings Jump

 Treasury Buying Back More Debt 

 WASHINGTON (AP) - The Treasury Department will buy back $1.5 billion of the national debt tomorrow - the latest in a series of debt reductions. That means Treasury will ask investors who hold certain older, higher-yielding 30-year Treasury bonds to consider selling them back to the government. Specifically, Treasury said today that it wants to buy back 8 outstanding issues of 30-year bonds that will mature between February 2021 and August 2023.

 Bay Street's benchmark index hit another record high, passing the symbolic milestone of closing higher than the Dow Jones industrial average for the first time in five years. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index was up 65.72 points to 10,844.52, after going as as high as 10,873.48 in morning trading. It had surpassed the Dow during Friday's session, but slipped behind at the close. 

 On the Canadian Venture Exchange in Vancouver,the CDNX was down 3.4 points to 3,387.7. 

 In New York,the Dow slipped 8.48 points to 10,804.27, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.51 points to 1,510.49. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, the technology-heavy composite index gained 28.49 points to 4,274.67. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, paper-products company Fort James Corp. was a notable mover. Its shares closed up $8.44 (U.S.) or 34 per cent to $33 after rival Georgia-Pacific Corp. said it would acquire the company in a takeover bid worth $7.8-billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of about $3.5-billion in debt. 

 On Nasdaq, Cisco Systems Inc.'s shares were the most active, closing up about 2 per cent to $69.63. 

 Shares of wireless-technology firm Qualcomm Inc. finished up $6.75, almost 11 per cent, to $69.81 after the company announced that Japanese and European authorities have upheld patents on several of its technologies. 

 But another software profit-warning casualty appeared in the form of Mercator Software Inc., whose shares plunged almost 60 per cent -- $36.44 to $26.19. On Friday, it announced that its second-quarter earnings would be half what analysts were expecting. 

 Of the TSE's 14 subsectors, only five were in positive territory, with industrial products the biggest gainer, rising 1.43 per cent. 

 Tech names did well, with JDS Uniphase Canada Ltd. up $7.05 (Canadian) to $174.55, and Cognos Inc. up $3.50 or more than 5 per cent to $65.50. 

 Shares in Canadian Satellite Communications Inc., known as Cancom, finished up $1.30 or 4.78 per cent at $28.50 in the wake of a bid by Shaw Communications Inc. to take over the firm. Cancom operates direct-to-home satellite TV provider Star Choice, and Shaw already owns 62 per cent of Cancom. 

 Shaw's shares were down $1.60, more than 4 per cent, to $33.90. 

 Shares in Alcan Aluminium Ltd. closed down 30 cents at $47.85, after the company announced that its earnings had met analysts' expectations -- doubling in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year. 

 QLT Inc., which had been down more than 10 per cent during the day, closed off $2.60 or almost 3 per cent at $85.70. The shares' dive comes after two U.S. analysts cut their ratings for the company on concerns over coming competition for one of its products, a light-activated drug that treats a disease that causes blindness in the elderly. 

 Nortel Networks Corp., which accounts for more than one-third of the value of the TSE 300, climbed $2 to $117.90.

 Dow Ends Down 64; Nasdaq Drops 98 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks slumped today as investors locked in some gains from the technology rebound despite some strong profit reports by major companies and a mostly unsurprising inflation report. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 64.35 to close at 10,739.92 after falling as much as 101 points during the session. The Nasdaq fell 97.73 to 4,176.94. 

 Consumer Prices Jump 0.6 Percent 

 WASHINGTON (AP) - Consumer prices jumped 0.6 percent in June, with gasoline and natural gas prices causing much of the rise. Aside from those items and the volatile food category, most prices increased only modestly, the Labor Department said today. The 0.6 percent rise followed a 0.1 percent rise in May. 

 Aetna Issues Profit Warning

 HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Aetna warned today second-quarter earnings may be well below Wall Street expectations because of rising medical costs at its health maintenance organizations. It predicted that second-quarter profits will total just 85 cents to 95 cents per share. Industry analysts had expected Aetna earnings of about $1.20 per share for the quarter. 

 ExciteAtHome in Joint Venture 

 REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) - At Home Corp., owner of the popular Excite Web portal and the ExciteAtHome cable modem network, says it is hooking up with Dutch communications giant UnitedGlobalCom to deliver high-speed Internet access outside North America. The joint venture, called Excite Chello, will operate in 15 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America - markets where the new company will own exclusive cable modem rights to 30 million homes. Excite Chello will begin with 300,000 customers who currently subscribe to the two companies' services. Redwood City-based At Home already offers high-speed Internet access to homes in Australia, the Netherlands and Japan. 

 GM Earns $1.75 Billion in 2Q 

 DETROIT (AP) - Second-quarter earnings at General Motors Corp. rose 1 percent, with a variety of higher costs in its automotive business offsetting growing revenues. GM said today earnings were hurt by investments for new vehicles and services in the United States and Europe, and by losses at Isuzu, of which GM owns 49 percent. Nevertheless, GM earned $1.75 billion, or $2.93 a share, compared to $1.73 billion, or $2.66 a share, from continuing operations in the year-ago period. Including discontinued operations, GM earned $1.92 billion last year. This year's results exceeded Wall Street estimates. Shares of GM were at $60.813, up $0.438. 

 Wells Fargo's 2Q Profit Up 12 Pct. 

 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Wells Fargo & Co.'s second-quarter profits rose 12 percent as the bank's push to sell more products to its customers continued to pay off. The San Francisco-based financial services company said today it earned $1.04 billion, or 63 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, up from $931 million, or 55 cents per share, in the year-ago period. The results matched the analysts' expectations. Wells Fargo's second-quarter revenue of $4.56 billion was up 11 percent from the year-ago period of $4.13 billion, realizing a goal of double-digit growth set by a new management team in 1998 after the bank was purchased by Norwest Corp. Shares of Wells Fargo were at $42.063, down $1.312 

 Time Warner Reports Stronger Results 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Time Warner Inc., the world's largest media company, reported stronger operating results across its various businesses today. Net profits were held down by several charges, however, including expenses related to its acquisition by America Online Inc. Time Warner reported net earnings of $75 million for the second quarter ending June 30, or 5 cents a share. That compared to $593 million or 43 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 8 percent to $7.08 billion. Shares of Time Warner were at $87.375, down $1.813. 

 Honeywell Earnings Rise 14 Percent 

 MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Second-quarter net income at Honeywell International Inc. rose 14 percent, meeting analysts' reduced expectations. For the three months ended June 30, Honeywell earned $617 million, or 76 cents a share, versus $540 million, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items in both quarters, Honeywell earned 75 cents per share, meeting the reduced expectations of analysts. Honeywell said last month it expected to earn 73 cents to 77 cents a share for the quarter because of unexpected parts shortages in its aerospace unit, higher raw material prices and higher interest rates. Analysts had been expecting the Morris Township-based manufacturer to earn 78 cents per share. 

 Philip Morris Earnings Up 7 Percent 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Philip Morris Cos.' profit rose 7 percent in the second quarter, reflecting gains in cigarette sales domestically and abroad as well as growth in its Kraft Foods division. The company said today that earnings totaled $2.17 billion, or 95 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30. The results matched the 95 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Revenues for the April-June period were $20.84 billion, up 5.2 percent. 

 Wal-Mart Ordered To Pay in Bias Case 

 NEW YORK (AP) - A judge in New Brunswick, N.J., has ordered Wal-Mart to pay more than $2 million to a former cashier who said he was harassed and fired after a boss learned he was undergoing a male-to-female sex change. Ricky Bourdouvales, 27, sued the retailing giant in May, alleging it violated New Jersey's anti-discrimination laws by firing him in January. The default judgment was issued yesterday after the company failed to respond to the lawsuit. 

 European Stocks Move Lower 

 LONDON (AP) - European stocks were lower today as U.S. and European data renewed concern about rising inflation. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index fell 3.58 points, or 0.8 percent, to 441.36. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies was down 3.03 points, or 0.8 percent, at 391.47. Euro-zone inflation in June was up to 2.4 percent on the year from 1.9 percent in May, pushed higher by strong oil prices and the weak euro. In the United States, the consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in June, a touch more than the 0.5 percent forecast, boosted by a surge in energy prices. In domestic markets, London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 1.1 percent, to 6,450.5. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 0.3 percent to 7406.91 on a day when trading was disrupted by technical problems throughout the afternoon.

 HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Aetna warned Tuesday that its second-quarter earnings were likely to be well below analyst predictions, blaming an increase in medical costs for its health maintenance organizations. 

 Aetna's share prices fell sharply Tuesday - closing at $59.688, down $6.93, or 10.4 percent. 

 Aetna's share prices also fell sharply Monday - closing at $66.625, down $4.50, or a little more than 6 percent - amid reports that a deal was getting close to sell its financial services and international businesses to the Dutch company ING Group. 

 In its announcement Tuesday, Aetna predicted quarterly earnings of 85 cents to 95 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by First Call on Monday had estimate earnings in the area of $1.20 per share. The company is scheduled to report its earnings Aug. 4. 

 The second-quarter commercial HMO cost trend was up between 10 percent and 12 percent over last year's levels, Aetna said. Most of the increase was due to more people seeking services, including emergency room and outpatient care, the company said. 

 Costs are also up in its Prudential HMO and Medicare HMO businesses, Aetna said. 

 "While our current-period information is not complete, we wanted to alert our shareholders to this rise in medical costs," said Aetna's chairman and chief executive officer, William H. Donaldson. 

 "We are highly focused on actions we are taking to address the underlying causes of these higher costs and to offset their impact on our customers and on earnings going forward," he said. 

 Aside from administrative cost-cutting, Aetna is looking at beefing up its "on-site" consultations on medical practices and planning to demand premium increases in health plans that renew in the fourth quarter. 

 The company also said it might retool its plans to use "tiered co-pays," which it said have an effect on demand for medical service. 

 The Wall Street Journal and The Hartford Courant reported last week that ING was again the leading candidate to buy the Aetna businesses, despite the earlier collapse of exclusive talks. 

 Aetna's board was reported to be considering the deal over the weekend. The Courant, citing analysts, said a delay in announcing any agreement may be due to the complexity of the deal, which Aetna wants to structure so that it minimizes the tax consequences. 

 "It wouldn't be shocking if that can hold up a deal for three days," said Ken Abramowitz of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 

 Aetna and ING have refused to comment on the reports.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Optimistic earnings expectations for technology companies helped lift the Nasdaq Composite Index Monday, but blue chips slipped amid caution ahead of economic news. 

 Treasurys were lower. The 10-year Treasury note was down 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face value, bringing the yield up to 6.15%. The 30-year bond fell 18/32 to yield 5.91%. The dollar rose. 

 The Nasdaq Composite rose 28.49 to 4274.67 after gaining 71 points Friday, capping a 5.5% surge for the week. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 8.48 to 10804.27 after rising 24 points in the previous session. 

 Shares of some blue-chip companies that were expected to report earnings Tuesday weighed on the Dow industrials, with General Motors, Intel and Microsoft closing lower, although Honeywell International advanced. Philip Morris, which also is scheduled to report Tuesday, fell a point to 23 1/2 in the wake of Friday's record punitive-damages verdict against the tobacco industry in Florida. 

 Among earnings news Monday, fiber-optics company Corning rose 12 1/4 to 279 1/4 after beating Wall Street's estimates and raising its full-year guidance. 

 Shares of forest-products giant Georgia Pacific fell 2 1/4 to 26 3/8 after it confirmed that it plans to acquire tissue-paper company Fort James for about $7.8 billion in cash and stock, plus debt. Fort James rose 8 7/16, or 34%, to 33. 

 Qualcomm jumped 6 3/4, or 11%, to 69 13/16 after Japan and Europe upheld three of the company's patents.

 The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has advised member nations to be ready to implement a 500,000-barrel-a-day production increase by the end of July, the official OPEC news service said Monday. 

 The statement from Opecna is the clearest signal yet from the cartel that it will raise crude production despite reservations of some members. The news helped to pressure the price of crude and petroleum products in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

 Alcan Aluminum, the Canadian aluminum producer that is preparing to merge with Switzerland's Alusuisse Group, said second-quarter net income more than doubled on a 12% increase in revenue. 

 Meanwhile, in Zurich, Alusuisse shareholders approved a plan allowing the merger with Alcan to proceed. Alcan said it expects the deal to be completed in the fourth quarter.

 Rohm & Haas issued its second profit warning in three months, serving notice that it expects second-quarter earnings to come in well below analysts' already lowered estimates. 

 The maker of specialty chemicals and plastics cited escalating costs for raw materials and energy in a tough pricing environment, as well as weaker sales of some of its products.

 Xerox COO Says Brazil Unit Key To Company's Recovery

 RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Xerox Corp. (XRX) is counting on its Brazilian subsidiary to help the company regain morale and restore market confidence after a recent wave of heavy losses and personnel reshuffling, a top company official said Wednesday. 

 "Brazil is considered the jewel of the crown," said Anne Mulcahy, Xerox's new Chief Operating Officer at a press conference here. 

 "We continue to look at Brazil not only as a source of great results, but also as a source of creativity and innovation for our company," she added. 

 Brazil ranks as Xerox's fifth largest operation outside the U.S. and has developed into a major manufacturing and exporting center for the company, with five factories and one software development plant. Xerox do Brasil exports 30% of its production to Latin America, the United States, Europe and Canada. 

 Mulcahy said the Brazilian unit has regained momentum after the financial crisis that hammered the country's economy last year, noting that earnings prospects are encouraging. 

 Xerox do Brasil reported revenues of 2 billion reals ($1=BRR1.805) last year, a figure company officials expect should be matched this year. 


Brazil Investments In 2000 Seen At Around $150 Million



Last week, Xerox do Brasil announced investments of $5 million in an
Application Service Provider, known as ASP, to offer mid- and
large-sized companies web-based solutions such as web hosting services,
electronic billing, and e-commerce.



"We have great expectations for this project, and might even make
further investments before the end of the year," said Guilherme
Bittencourt, Xerox do Brasil's CEO, without providing more details.



Apart from investments in the ASP project, Xerox do Brasil said it
will invest $150 million this year to revamp its five factories and
software development center.



The photocopier giant has been struggling for more than a year to
recover from heavy losses due to slumping sales and a consolidation of
its customer administration centers, which strained customers relations
and scared investors away.



The company reported a $243 million first-quarter loss, and said it
expects earnings to fall short of Wall Street's expectations again this
quarter. Results will be announced on July 27.



By mid-June, when Xerox issued a profit warning about second quarter
earnings, the company's stocks had tumbled more than 60% in the 12
previous months.



Xerox Chief Executive Officer Paul A. Allair said after a shareholders
meeting in May that Xerox's financial performance in 1999 was
"unacceptable."



Mulcahy explained there were external factors that contributed to the
"challenges" faced by the company, but the internal restructuring
process was the main villain.



But said she was confident the company had put the right strategy in
place, and that soon stockholders would have better news.



"Our focus now is on our customers, our employers and our
stockholders, so we will restore this company's great value and growth,"
Mulcahy said.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Strong earnings from aluminum giant Alcoa, the first blue-chip stock to post second-quarter results, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average slightly higher Monday. But profit taking held down technology shares. 

 Treasurys declined, with the 10-year note's yield rising to 6.04% from 6.00% late Friday. The dollar was lower against the yen and the euro. 

 The Dow industrials rose 10.60 to 10646.58 after surging 154 points Friday. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 42.90, or 1.1%, to 3980.30 after gaining 62 points in the previous session. 

 Big Board advancing stocks led decliners by 9 to 7 on volume of 815.1 million shares. 

 Dow industrials component Alcoa added 2 1/16 to 29 11/16 after the aluminum maker posted a nearly 60% increase in second-quarter net income, topping Wall Street expectations. Other blue chips that posted solid gains included General Motors, General Electric and Home Depot. 

 Investors also focused on a big merger in the fiber-optics field. JDS Uniphase slumped 15 1/16, or 13%, to 101 1/8 atop the Nasdaq most actives after it agreed to buy SDL for about $40 billion in stock. SDL rose 25 3/8 to 320 11/16. 

 Technology stocks finished mostly lower. Microsoft fell 2 9/16 to 79 9/16, while fellow Dow-30 stocks Intel, Hewlett-Packard and IBM also fell. 

 But the brokerage sector climbed on hopes that a summer stock-market rally is in store, which would lead to more brokerage-transaction fees. Lehman Brothers rose five points to 102 1/8.

 Honeywell International, which last month shocked Wall Street by issuing a second-quarter profit warning, Monday said earnings for the year will fall short of analysts' expectations and announced plans to eliminate 6,000 additional jobs. 

 The company said it will implement "aggressive cost-cutting initiatives" to offset weaker-than-expected revenue and higher raw-materials prices. Honeywell plans to reconfigure some of its businesses, including merging its polymers and specialty-chemicals businesses into one unit. Honeywell makes aircraft-guidance systems, electronic materials, industrial controls and a host of other things.

 Smokers in a landmark court fight under way in Miami asked for up to $196 billion in punitive damages from the tobacco industry Monday to punish it for ruining the lives of millions of sick and addicted customers. 

 According to the Associated Press, smokers' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt called $154 billion "an appropriate, just number" but suggested jurors consider a range of $123 billion to $196 billion. Witnesses for smokers testified the defendants could afford $150 billion to $157 billion. 

 --- 

 New York Times Co. reported a sharp increase in second-quarter profit because of strong national newspaper advertising. Net income rose 22% to $101.7 million, or 59 cents a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were looking for earnings of 56 cents a share. Revenue increased 14% to $885.6 million. 

 Meanwhile, Gannett, publisher of USA Today, reported a solid increase in second-quarter earnings, after factoring out a one-time gain from a year earlier, as demand for newspaper advertising climbed. Results met Wall Street expectations.

 Among other broad-market measures, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 3.28, but the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 1.93 and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks added 2.61. 

 Treasurys declined, with the 10-year note's yield -- which moves inversely to the price -- rising to 6.04% from 6.00% late Friday. The dollar was lower against the yen and the euro. 

 Trading was tentative as investors await more earnings results later this week to see if the slowing U.S. economy took a bite out of corporate profits, one analyst said. "We're just looking at a little bit of temperance that has arisen as a result of the fact that the flow of corporate earnings needs to be studied carefully," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. 

 Joseph DeMarco, a managing director at HSBC Asset Management Americas, said the market appears to be dealing on a stock-by-stock basis as investors await a broader set of earnings results for direction. "The market will probably mark time until we get a little deeper into the earnings reporting period," said Mr. DeMarco, adding that a market rally could gain strength if investors see more companies meeting or beating estimates. 

 Dow industrials component Alcoa (AA) added 2 1/16 to 29 11/16 after the aluminum maker posted a nearly 60% increase in second-quarter net income, topping Wall Street expectations. Other blue chips that posted solid gains included General Motors (GM), General Electric (GE) and Home Depot (HD), which rose 2 3/16 to 57 11/16 following news it plans to double the number of its home-improvement stores by 2003. 

 Investors also focused on a big merger in the fiber-optics field. JDS Uniphase (JDSU) slumped 15 1/16, or 13%, to 101 1/8 atop the Nasdaq most actives after it agreed to buy SDL for about $40 billion in stock. SDL (SDLI) rose 25 3/8 to 320 11/16. 

 Technology stocks finished mostly lower. Microsoft (MSFT) fell 2 9/16 to 79 9/16, while fellow Dow-30 stocks Intel (INTC), Hewlett-Packard (HWP) and International Business Machines (IBM) also fell. TenFold (TENF) sank 6 13/16, or 40%, to 10 1/4 after the software company issued a profit warning. But semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose 2 1/4 to 84 1/4. 

 The Internet sector also lost ground. DoubleClick (DCLK) fell 4 1/4 to 31 11/16 while Yahoo (YHOO), America Online (AOL) and eBay (EBAY) all posted solid losses. 

 But the brokerage sector climbed on hopes that a summer stock-market rally is in store, which would lead to more brokerage-transaction fees. Lehman Brothers (LEH) rose five points to 102 1/8, while Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (MWD), Paine Webber (PWJ) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also rose.

 A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- "Never say never" is, if you ask me, an indisputable bit of folk wisdom, but a lot of folks paid it no mind Friday when, in the aftermath of the U.S. jobs report for June, they said that the FOMC would never raise rates when it next meets on Aug. 22, which is almost a month and a half from now. 

 Maybe some of these folks succumbed to the siren song of an appearance in the print or electronic media. I mean, you've got a better shot of making it if you take a stand. "I don't know," or "It's too soon to tell," are both responses that stand a far better chance of winding up on the cutting room floor than "Alan Greenspan would have to be nuts if he raised rates now." 

 In the U.S. this week, all economic indicators that matter have been backloaded into Friday: PPI, retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization - all for June. 

 Arguably, the most important of the three in  attempting to determine the Fed's next interest-rate move is the report on producer prices last month. Will this be the report that finally detects the recent surge in petroleum prices? Some, but by no means all, forecasters believe so. The top of the predictive range for the overall PPI is up 0.8%. 

 The only other PPI observation I have - and call me retro, just don't call me seldom - has to do with the May report. In May, said the Bureau of Labor Statistics, overall producer prices were unchanged, but the "core" PPI - ex-food and ex-energy - rose by 0.2%. Does that mean, my friends, that at a time of apparent runaway petro prices, their extraction from the May data actually had a calmative effect on the core PPI? Or did prices paid to food producers tumble, and we all missed it? The 0.2% advance is not merely counterintuitive, it's counterintuitive's Daddy.

adding both of them and dividing by two.

 WRAP: Honeywell To Cut 6,000 Jobs In Wake of Pft Warning

 WSJ.com Roundup 

 MORRISTOWN, N.J. -(Dow Jones)- Honeywell International Inc. (HON) set plans to cut 6,000 jobs, moving to cut costs just weeks after announcing that its second-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations. 

 The cuts, which are equal to 5% of its work force, come amid disappointments at the company's performance-materials operations and are in addition to the 11,000 positions Honeywell has said it would cut since it completed its merger with AlliedSignal Inc. late last year. 

 The job cuts will be accomplished through attrition, retirements and layoffs, the company said. The company also will impose a hiring freeze. 

 "We are implementing a series of aggressive cost-cutting initiatives across the company to address the shortfalls in our business performance," said Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, in a prepared statement. "With these actions, we expect earnings-per-share growth in 2001 to range from 10% to 15%." 

 Monday's announcement comes nearly a month after the Morristown, N.J., maker of home and industrial controls, aerospace systems and specialty chemicals surprised investors by issuing a profit warning. Honeywell said it had been hurt by an increase in oil prices and a general slowdown in business conditions. In addition, the company said it would lower its earnings-per-share expectations for the second quarter to 73 cents to 77 cents, below the 78 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 At the time of that announcement, Bonsignore declined to give specific reasons why the company cut its expectations. 

 The company hasn't yet reported its second-quarter earnings.

 JACK CAFFERTY, CNNfn ANCHOR, BEFORE HOURS: Earnings season effectively begins today. Go to Christine Romans at  the New York Stock Exchange. Welcome back. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there. 

 CAFFERTY: You will be busy this week. 

 ROMANS: I know. The beginning of this week is going to be really jam-packed with earnings report. Brace yourself. The second quarter reporting season is here. It really gets underway next weak starting I think the 17t that is when we`re really in full force. We`ll get a healthy dose of what to expect this week  4 Dow component on the agenda, and among them ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) expected to earn. It`s the second quarter for ALCOA. The forecast is 45 cents a share that compares with 32 cents a year ago. Remember this stock is trading right down near a 52-week low and lost some ground on a nice rally on Friday. So watch Alcoa. Looks like the street was a little concerned about what that profit report might say. Also newspaper companies report this week among them Gannett Company (URL: http://www.gannett.com/) . It`s forecasted $1 a share. "New York Times" (NYT), 56 cents a share versus 48 cents a share is what they`re looking there. So  here we go. Gets underway. Now we have the profitwarning season behind us, and profit season upon us again. Also Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) ,  keep an eye on this. Remember it warned back on June 19 and analyst lowered their expectations. Now the company says its second quarter will beat the street`s lowered expectations but going out for full year 2000 and 2001 earning it is revising downward slightly some of its forecasts. So a longer term revised downward but saying this second quarter will beat the street`s lowered expectations. And Heinz (URL: http://www.heinz.com/) , watch the food sector. We`ve a lot of movement in here with talk and actuality of proposed mergers and such. US trade regulators apparently planning to block Heinz`s proposed $185 million acquisition of Milnot Holdings (ph). That is the owner of its rival Beech-Nut Products. HNZ is Heinz ticker. And another one to tell you about Forest Oil, (SST). That one to buy Force Energy, for $436 million in stocks. Force Energy trades over at the Nasdaq. Those are some stock just to watch today as we get this new week  underway. All of the economic data is at the end of the week. It is earnings. Back to you.

Quakes Need to Shake Lethargy, Injuries

A GLANCE at the MLS calendar shows two months remain in the regular season; but for the Earthquakes, it's getting uncomfortably close to the end.

On the surface, it looks as if the Quakes still are in the running for a playoff spot -- the three division winners and the next five teams with the best records qualify for postseason play, and San Jose lags five points behind Miami and Columbus for that final spot. The Quakes' play of late -- four ties and a loss in their past five matches -- has them running in place rather than gaining ground.

As coach Lothar Osiander said the other day: "We're falling far behind. It's getting critical."

San Jose (4-8-8, 20 points) has 12 matches remaining, seven at Spartan Stadium where the Quakes are undefeated in 2000 (4-0-5) and have a 15-game unbeaten streak dating to last season. But if the team's past three home matches are any indication -- all ties that should have been victories -- that on-going league record is in danger of coming to an abrupt halt.

Speaking of halt, the Quakes have limped through a disastrous road schedule this season, going 0-8-3 away from Spartan, and beginning with tonight's game against the Colorado Rapids (9-9-2, 29 points) in Denver, it looks like more of the same for San Jose. The four teams the Quakes play in their five remaining road games (Colorado twice, Los Angeles, Dallas and D.C. Uni ted) are a combined 21-12-8 on their home fields this season.

Part of the Quakes' problems stems from their anemic attack, which has a league-worst 24 goals scored, 19 at Spartan. Although forward Abdul Thompson Conteh has a team-high seven goals, he often has been more of a hindrance than a help on offense, mucking up promising scoring chances by overrunning the ball, being dispossessed of the ball or sending crosses way off the mark.

Another reason for the Quakes' sputtering offense has been the non- play of forward Ronald Cerritos, the club's all-time leading scorer (44), who, because of national-team duty with El Salvador or injury, has played in only nine games this season. He's missed the past eight games with a right quadriceps strain, but though he's due to come off the injured-reserved list next Friday, Osiander said he doesn't expect Cerritos, who has four goals this season, back in the lineup until "the end of the month."

And midfielder Khodadad Azizi, another player expected to key the Quakes' offense, has been plagued with injuries. He's on injured reserve with a right hamstring strain and has suited up for only 11 matches. When he has been in the lineup, he hasn't been too effective, scoring only one goal and contributing three assists. Not very good production from a supposed "playmaker."

When asked after Tuesday's dreadful scoreless draw with Kansas City whether there was anyone, anywhere in the Quakes' system to give the attack some zest, some effectiveness, Osiander just shook his head. "I can't make any changes," he said sadly, "because I don't have anybody."

The next two months could last forever.

FOOTNOTES: Tab Ramos, the U.S. National team's brilliant but oft-injured midfielder (fractured skull, two major knee operations, pulled hamstring are just some of his medical woes since 1994), has been added to the Americans' roster for their opening World Cup qualifiers against Guatemala (July 16) and Costa Rica (July 23). "It's been difficult," said Ramos, who last appeared for the national team in the best-forgotten '98 World Cup. "I got to the point where I thought I might never play -- period."

Two major coaching changes occurred this week in the wake of Euro 2000: Giovanni Trapattoni has replaced Dino Zoff, who unexpect- edly resigned after his Italian team lost to France in the championship match, and Louis van Gaal took over as manager of the Dutch team, replacing Frank Rijkaard who resigned after the team's humbling semifinal loss to Italy in Amsterdam (Holland, playing before a home crowd, had a man-advantage for most of the game and missed two penalty kicks).

US shadow falls on tech stocks - Stock Market.

A PROFIT warning from Computer Associates, the US software house, and a sharp overnight retreat in the Nasdaq cast a long shadow over blue-chip technology issues, which failed to participate in the sustained recovery in leading shares.

CA's controversially timed statement - released after-hours on Monday ahead of the Independence Day holiday - together with a similar warning on Wednesday from BMC Software, a smaller US rival, served to rattle confidence in related computer services stocks. Informix, the US database specialist, and Citrix, an application provider, have also recently issued warnings on quarterly earnings.

In London, that selling fed through into Logica, down 130p to #15.50, which recorded the sharpest retreat in the FTSE 100, as well as Misys, down 21p to 547p, CMG, off 29p to 951p, and Sema Group, 13p weaker at 908p.

ARM Holdings emerged unscathed, despite bearish noises on the semiconductor market on Wednesday from Salomon Smith Barney, and its shares finished 34p stronger at 709p. The final tally in the FTSE 100 was almost solely attributable to a switchback performance from Vodafone AirTouch, which, after touching 292p at one point, closed 15p better at 312p. Brokers continued to warm to its second-quarter subscriber numbers, with Deutsche Bank repeating its strong buy recommendation and 465p target.

The FTSE 100 settled 37.1 points better at 6,419.6, against a 23.1 point loss in the FTSE techMARK 100 to 3,405.1.

Trade was still thin, meaning that brokers' recommendations had a disproportionately large effect. Among miners, Rio Tinto added 45p to #10.73 after JP Morgan raised its price target to #13.20. BAE Systems gained 14p to 425p after an upbeat assessment from Credit Suisse First Boston, which advises its clients to buy up to 480p.

Heading the other way, EMI Group retreated 28p to 642p as talk of a bid to scupper its recently approved Time Warner merger faded.

Similarly, investors took profits at Cable & Wireless, off 56p to #11.90, after Wednesday's run on talk of a strike from Deutsche Telekom.

Among retailers, Marks & Spencer traded down to 234p on a muted reaction to its new autumn-winter range, but recovered ahead of the close to settle just 1p lower at 240p.

GILT-EDGED: UK government bonds held steady ahead of the MPC's interest rate decision, but followed international markets lower in the afternoon, when German bunds emerged as the worst performer. The futures market dictated trade in medium-dated issues, with the September gilt contract closing off 54p at #113.60. Treasury 5 per cent 2004 lost 14p to #97.45, while Treasury 8 per cent 2021 shed 54p to #143.80.

NEW YORK: Stocks ended mixed in a volatile session. Most technology shares bounced back from a sell-off in the previous session, although earnings worries hurt blue chips. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 2.13 points down at 10,481.47.

 UPDATE 2-U.S. retail sales for June modestly higher.

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales for June came in modestly higher on Thursday - on par with analysts' expectations - as shopping enthusiasm was dampened by higher interest rates and soaring gas prices.  

 A slowing economy partnered with higher gasoline prices deterred shoppers from driving to America's shopping malls, analysts said. Industry watchers became cautious on retailers after sales began slowing in the first two weeks of June.  

 The weak finish could mean lackluster profits for the second quarter, analysts said. And July, which is typically seen as a clearance month for summer goods, could also see lighter sales.  

 "The continued impact of higher interest rates is certainly having an impact on demand, as well as higher gas prices, which everybody knows about," said Wayne Hood, retail analyst at Prudential Securities. "I think exactly what the Federal Reserve wanted is beginning to happen."  

 Sales for the month were also diminished by most retailers moving their Independence Day sales to the first week of July rather than the final week of June. As a result, July sales may be moderately higher, although the lack of momentum in June is likely to carry over.  

 "July will be a kind of a throw-out month because it's a clear-out month," Hood said. "So the next real gauge of measuring true underlying demand will be in August."  

 The Standard & Poor's Retail Index was up 10.73 points at midday, or about 1.25 percent, to 869.79. Since mid-April, the index has slipped more than 20 percent from its lifetime high of 1,052.00.  

 The Lehman Brothers same-store sales growth index rose 3.0 percent in June versus a 6.8 percent rise in the year-ago period and a 4.9 percent gain in sales in May.  

 "Sales growth will cool to mid-to low-single digits from the mid-to high-single digits we've seen for a while now," said Steve Paspal, retail analyst with John Hancock Funds.  

 "After pursuing a torrid pace for years, consumers finally are taking a breather," Paspal said. "But with employment levels, disposable income and consumer confidence still strong, we're talking slowdown, not recession."  

 High-end department store Nordstrom Inc. posted a softer-than-expected sales increase of 9.1 percent. Analysts had expected an increase of about 14 to 16 percent for June.  

 The news pushed Nordstrom shares down 1-5/8 to 22-1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.  

 "Nordstrom was a little lighter than expected, and everybody else so far is kind of where we thought they would be," Prudential's Hood said.  

 Merrill Lynch's department store composite rose 3.0 percent, in line with expectations, boosted by Neiman Marcus Group's sales, which rose 17.3 percent. Shares of Neiman rose 2-1/8 to 29-13/16 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday.  

 "By and large, June was another disappointing month," said Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown's Dan Wewer, who follows value retailers such as Dollar Tree Stores Inc. , which posted a better-than-expected same-store sales gain of 14.3 percent.  

 Shares of Dollar Tree were up 6-11/16, or more than 17 percent, to 46 at midday on the Nasdaq stock market.  

 "Greenspan is achieving what the Fed set out as a goal - tapping the brakes on the economy - and that's certainly showing up in the consumer sector," he said.  

 Wewer said even value retailers, which might otherwise stand up well in a slowing economy, were running, at best, in line with expectations, but mainly below original estimates.  

 Among speciality retailers, AnnTaylor Stores Corp. saw a 4.1 percent rise in same-store sales, which pushed the company's share price up 1-15/16 to 33-5/8 at midday.  

 Shares of Gap Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. were also up at midday despite a modest profit warning from Gap and declining sales for Abercrombie.  

 The San Francisco-based Gap said same-store sales fell 2 percent and warned the company's second-quarter profit will fall short of Wall Street expectations. Still, Gap shares managed to climb 2-7/16, or more than 8 percent, to 32-7/16.  

 Abercrombie shares were up almost 20 percent at midday after the company said sales dropped 4 percent, much better than the 8 to 10 percent drop analysts had been expecting. Shares were up 2-1/4 to 13-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 MDSI Mobile Data stock pounded on  profit warning .

 RICHMOND, British Columbia July 6 (Reuters) - Startled investors shaved nearly 42 percent from shares in MDSI Mobile Data Solutions Inc. on Thursday after the company, which develops wireless workforce management system software, warned of a second-quarter sales shortfall. 

 Shares in the Richmond, British Columbia, firm, the latest in a string of software firms to pre-announce disappointing results, sank by C$15.00 to C$21.00 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in early trade. On Nasdaq, the issue shed 10-5/16 to 14. 

 MDSI, which said major telephone companies had delayed purchase decisions, expects revenues of $13.2 million to $13.8 million for the period ended June 30 and a loss of $400,000 to $700,000, or 4 cents to 7 cents a share before one-time charges related to its acquisition of Connectria, an application service provider and provider of online service management solutions for service companies. 

 The company said the shortfall stemmed from the timing of deals, but does not indicate lost business. 

 For fiscal 2000, MDSI expects about 25 percent growth over 1999 revenues excluding third-party hardware revenues. The company will report second-quarter results on July 25. 

 MDSI warned in February it would miss fourth-quarter profit targets as customers delayed orders due to Y2K concerns. 

 The market pounding repeats a pattern set on Wednesday when Entrust Technologies Inc. , which lost $2.2 billion in market value, Computer Associates International Inc. and BMC Software Inc. all warned of disappointing financial results. 

 "With certain large contracts this quarter, the delays could not be overcome. We still expect these contracts to happen and we still expect to win each of them," said chief executive Ken Miller in a statement. "As we had originally expected to recognise the revenue from these deals over multiple quarters in 2000, we are adjusting expectations for the balance of the year to take a more conservative view." 

 MDSI also said on Thursday it has signed a $8.5 million contract with Cable & Wireless Optus, Australia's second largest telco, for its wireless workforce management software. The contract covers software licenses, installation, and support and maintenance.

 Canada's benchmark index rose yesterday as Nortel Networks Corp. and Research In Motion Ltd. both gained for a third day, leading technology stocks higher on optimism about earnings growth. 

 Talisman Energy Inc. and other oil companies fell after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said it would consider a plan to increase crude oil output. 

 And investors remained reluctant to place bets before tomorrow's Canadian and U.S. job figures, which are expected to provide clues about whether inflation is under control. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 composite index rose 22.05 points to 10,323.75, a second consecutive record high. However, declines beat advances 633 to 463. 

 Trading volume was 132.5 million shares worth $3.3 billion, compared with a three-month daily average of 178.6 million shares. 

 The blue-chip S&P/TSE 60 benchmark also ended in positive territory, up 3.10 points at 628.61. 

 The Canadian Venture Exchange lost 30.19 points to 3,442.18. 

 "We're getting confidence coming back into the technology area," said Ian Nakamoto, of SVC O'Donnell Mutual Funds Inc. "(Analysts) are saying second-quarter earnings should be up 25 per cent compared with last year, which is very strong." 

 Toronto outperformed New York indices as stocks tumbled after a batch of earnings warnings from computer software makers sent investors scrambling to ditch tech shares. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average shed 75.84 points at 10,483.60, hammered by losses in International Business Machines Corp. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 23.09 points at 1,446.23. 

 Weakness in semiconductor stocks led the way lower for the technology-laced Nasdaq composite index, dropping 128.81 points to 3,863.12. 

 In Toronto, Nortel rose to a second straight record close, gaining $1.45 to $106 even as its Entrust Technologies Inc. issued a profitwarning. 

 Research In Motion gained $2.05 to $73.30 after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its revenue estimates. The investment bank said RIM was the company most likely to succeed as mobile phone and hand-held computer technologies converge. 

 Oil stocks dropped for a second day, pulled lower by a plunge of almost 7 per cent in crude oil prices. The TSE's oil and gas index dropped 257.1, or 3.5 per cent, to 7,110.68, making it the TSE's worst-performing sub-index. 

 Saudi Arabia said Monday that it was prepared to raise output by 500,000 barrels a day to cut prices after an 18-month rally. 

 Alberta Energy Co. fell $1.95 to $56.05, Talisman Energy Inc. dropped $1.90 to $45.90 and Petro-Canada slipped $90 cents to $26.70. 

 "OPEC's trying not to kill the economy," Nakamoto said. "Crude prices now are seen as more likely to go down or to stabilize. They're not likely to go up."

 TONY GUIDA, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET COVERAGE:   Let`s find out what`s going on at the New York Stock Exchange as the sell off seems to get a little bit heavier now. Rhonda Schaffler following the action for us from the floor 

 of the New York Stock Exchange. Hi, Rhonda. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:   Hi there Tony.  Well, you saw from some of those stocks that you showed, it`s pretty much a tech rout here. 

 Computer Associates (URL: http://www.cai.com) , the headline story, most actively traded stock.  Here`s a stock down 43 percent on a profitwarning, plus you`ve got this separate thing going on with chip stocks. Another group of stocks we`re seeing some pretty hefty selling is within the oil sector. Let`s take a look at some big board movers because we`ve got two on there that illustrate this day in this market. BP Amoco (URL: http://www.bpamoco.com/) is one oil stock in retreat. It`s down more than 4.  Merrill Lynch kind of trading on the stock to neutral from accumulate and as we`ve been reporting throughout the trading day, light sweet crude is off pretty dramatically in New York.  It`s down $1.75 a barrel right now on word of an increased output in production from Saudi Arabia. 

 Texas Instruments (URL: http://www.ti.com/) is down more than 4. Texas Instruments was one of four specific chip stocks downgraded by Salomon Smith Barney which cut its price target on TI to $80 a share from $93, cut its rating to outperform from buy.  It says however it expects second quarter earnings to come in line with expectations but the entire theme from the Salomon Smith Barney report out today is going forward. Some of these chip stocks could have seen growth peaked and that there`s a bit of a downturn in TI`s case.  Cellular handset exposure was something that Salomon Smith Barney pointed out. 

 A couple of Dow stocks still moving higher though, even as we`re at session lows and that includes Boeing (URL: http://www.boeing.com/) , off more than $1. Boeing not commenting on a report that Boeing is near an agreement to sell 30 of its 777`s to International Lease Finance Corporation. That report in today`s "Wall Street Journal." 

 And AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) is up $1. This stock is one that`s been trading near its 52-week lows for quite some time.  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter saying that investors should take a wait and see approach on the company`s share and Morgan saying it would like to see things like some improvement in business services and also its cable execution. Beyond those stocks, some of the cyclicals are actually doing OK. General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) for instance, getting a strong buy from Warburg today.  3M (URL: http://www.mmm.com/) is another big winner.  The Dow Transports taking off.  That index was off up 67 points, so it`s really a story here of very broad tech weakness as well as some losses in those oil stocks thrown in too. Tony.

 TALK FROM THE TRENCHES - HOW MUCH CAN RATES FALL PRE-JOBS DATA? 

 By Joe Plocek & Rob Ramos

 NEW YORK (MktNews) - Just as traders are set to fade the market, there's another piece of "good news" and Treasuries trade firm again, market sources say. Still, the specter of a strong U.S. June employment report on Friday overhangs and the market should remain rangebound until then. 

 Right now, lower oil prices and weaker stock markets are being widely attributed for the strength in fixed-income markets. 

 Treasury long bonds broke through the one-month high of 105-22/32 (5.845%) set on June 20. Technicians say the next resistance is at 106-07+/32, the 2-1/2 month high set on June 2 following May's softer-than-expected employment report. 

 And despite the stellar performance of short-dated paper, sources say two-year notes may witness another round of buying from some players forced out of outstanding flatteners. Strategists add that traders are likely to use narrowing of spreads to enter steepeners. 

 But others worry about two-year notes trading better than a 6.25% yield vs. the 6.5% federal funds target. How much sense does the trade make in front of the June employment report Friday, a source asks? Still, the two-year is being pulled higher by aggressive short covering of eurodollar and Fed fund contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade. And as long as stocks continue display weakness, short-dated paper is likely to sustain a bid, sources say. 

 The lower NASDAQ is being blamed on Salomon Smith Barney's downgrade of the semiconductor sector and general warnings about lower earnings. Computer Associates issued a profit warning very late Monday while the market was sleeping and currently trades $21 lower at $30 a share. 

 Eurodollar futures traders report very active dealer-led buying of both the March and September contracts, which one floor analyst suggested was massive short-covering ahead of Friday's payroll report. 

 Looking at prices of Fed fund futures, the September contract is pricing in approximately a 44% chance of a 25bps rate hike at the Aug 22 FOMC. That's down from the 50/50 priced in on Monday. One trader said the uptick in Fed fund futures prices is "spillover" from Monday's NAPM as "the world wants to believe the economy is heading for a soft landing." 

 After the BTM retailer survey came in at -0.4% for the July 1 week, Sep T-bonds pushed higher, nearly testing nearby trendline resistance. What if that weakness is a head-fake caused by a bad comparison to last year's July 4? 

 But there may be more good news in store for bonds that will come from the presidential announcement of a Mideast summit slated to take place next week. 

 Sources speculate the Mideast announcements will be on diplomacy for Israel rather than oil, but the news is still good for financial markets. After all, the Saudis pumping 500,000 more barrels per day may affect prices and cause quota cheating. 

 August NYMEX crude oil futures opened sharply lower Wednesday and traded off $2.25 a barrel to $30.25 before mildly recovering to $30.50 a barrel. 

 Looking ahead, there are two more developments that could affect trading, sources say. At noon EDT, the Fed announces possible changes to open market operations. Sources say the announcement should be "evolutionary" rather than a shock and look for the Desk to buy more off-the-run issues ahead. 

 At 2:30 p.m. EDT, the 10-year TIPS announcement could be for as little as $4 billion, versus $6 billion last time. Economists note the US Treasury indicated there would be more cuts in TIPS auction size in the future. 

 Both announcements point up one important fact: diminishing amounts of U.S. Treasury debt ultimately are the underlying reason that the market trades so well. Until the U.S. budget outlook takes a turn for the worse, this reduction in supply is likely to underpin the market.

 CHICAGO (MktNews) - U.S. Treasuries prices held firm midmorning Wednesday, bolstered by a number of factors, most recently a steep decline in high-tech stocks and NYMEX crude oil futures. 

 Treasuries largely shrugged off the release of May U.S. leading economic indicators, which was reported in line with market expectations at down 0.1%. In addition, April LEI was revised to unchanged from down 0.1%. 

 Instead, traders focused on losses in stocks, particularly in the high-tech sector, and lower oil prices. Pressure in the technology sectors was attributed in part to spill-over from Computer Associates, which issued a profit warning late Monday and was trading over $21 lower early in Wednesday's session. 

 Meanwhile, Aug NYMEX crude oil futures opened sharply lower and were off $2.15 a barrel early after reports that Saudi Arabia is ready to announce an oil production increase of 500,000 barrels per day. 

 Technical buying in Treasury futures also contributed to the day's uptrend. Traders said activity in picked up dramatically as the Sep T-bond took out a one-month high of 98 4/32, and small buy-stops were hit. 

 The next upside barrier for the Sep T-bond contract is pegged at 98 8/32, a 2 1/2-month high set after the May U.S. employment report release. 

 Basically, bonds are setting up for a test of the June 2 highs, said John Canavan, a market economist at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. In the cash long-bond, that level is 106.05, he said. 

 Earlier Wednesday, pit sources said one New York dealer and a Japanese-based firm each purchased 2,000 Sep T-bond contracts on the day. In addition, a commercial firm was a buyer of 1,000 lots, sources said, while another dealer was a scale-up seller of 2,000 Sep T-bonds. 

 A Japanese life insurance company was a reported buyer of cash off-the-run long bonds overnight, sources said. 

 Sources also pointed out recent U.S. economic data releases are reinforcing a picture of slower U.S. economic growth. The U.S. Redbook retailer report declined 0.2% for the week ended July 1. Auto sales also looked a little weaker in June. With most June North American auto sales in, analysts said the selling rate looks like 14.1 million units versus 14.3 million in May. 

 At 11:03 a.m. EDT Wednesday, the 30-year bond was trading at a yield of 5.857%, compared with 5.870% at 1:00 p.m. EDT Monday, while the 10-year note was at a yield of 5.936% vs. 5.989% late Monday. - Suzanne Cosgrove; (312) 697-9675; email: cosgrove@marketnews.com.

 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Stocks slid at the opening on Wednesday as a downgrade of the semiconductor industry and another batch of profit warnings from technology companies led investors to bail out of the sector. 

 The profit warning that rattled Wall Street the most came from business software maker Computer Associates International Inc., which said its quarterly earnings would fall short of estimates. Its stock dove 22 to 29. 

 "Disappointments continue to be devastating," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president and market strategist, Fahnestock and Co. "The Computer Associates warnings sent a tremor through markets." 

 Investment bank Salomon Smith Barney lowered its investment rating on the semiconductor sector, sending the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index .SOXX) down 5.06 percent. 

 The impact was felt on the tech-packed Nasdaq composite index .IXIC), which fell 52 points, or 1.30 percent, to 3,940 with Intel Corp., the world's largest computer chip maker a big drag. 

 Intel fell 2-5/8 to 134-1/4 after Salomon said it saw a trend of slowly reversing industry fundamentals. 

 Among some of the other big losers, security software developer Entrust Technologies Inc. plunged 36-5/8 to 40-1/2 after saying its second-quarter earnings per share would fall short of expectations because of delays in closing sales. 

 Also warning, business software maker BMC Software Inc. said its profit would fall well shy of Wall Street expectations because of weakness in its mainframe business toward the end of the period. BMC lost 11-3/4 at 23-3/4. 

 The earnings warnings unnerved the market in the week leading up to start of the second quarter earnings reporting season. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) was off 12 points, or 0.11 percent, at 10,548 with much of the drag coming from oil giant Exxon Mobil. Exxon Mobil was off 2-8/16 to 77-1/16. 

 Oil companies were down as oil prices fell following Saudi Arabia's vow to release more oil to cool scorching prices. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) eased 6 points or 0.41 percent to 1,463. 

 "I think the weakness in oil shares is expected to drag down the broader market," said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood.

IMCO had previously forecast earnings in a range of $0.25 to $0.28 per share. CEO Don Ingram says he expects the company's profits to pick up in the second half of the year because of job cuts and better sources for raw materials. He says the company should earn between $0.53 and $0.58 per share in the second half of the year.

AT&T MAY SELL LONG-DISTANCE BUSINESS

AT&T Corp. is reportedly considering selling or creating a tracking stock for its consumer long-distance business.

The news did not seem to help the company's sagging stock price, which reached a new 52week low Friday.

Business Week's online edition Thursday quoted unnamed sources as saying chief executive C. Michael Armstrong was considering a sale or tracking stock, but that no decision was imminent.

The Wall Street Journal said Friday that the company was considering tracking stocks not only for the long distance business, but for the cable unit and other divisions.

AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said the company would not comment on what he termed ``speculative reports.''

Tracking stocks are intended to follow the financial performance of a division, but do not represent an ownership stake.

AT&T created a tracking stock for its wireless division in April. Wireless technology has attracted a lot of investor attention the last few years, and the stock opened strongly, but it has since dropped along with the parent company's stock.

On Friday, shares of AT&T Wireless closed up $1.25 to $27, below their initial offering price of $29.50. AT&T shares fell as low as $31.25-- a new 52-week low, before finishing the day down 25 cents at $31.875.

Analyst Steve Kamman at CIBC Worlds Markets said AT&T's problem is that the sprawling company presents a complex picture to investors.

``When I buy AT&T stock, I'm not exactly sure what I'm buying. There are so many moving parts to this company. It's unclear where management's focus is,'' Kamman said.

AT&T's best remedy would be to break the company into two or three parts: a consumer business, a business-services division and a wholesale network business, he said.

``Why issue a tracking stock? It's a little like being half pregnant.''

AT&T shares traded as high as $61 in November last year. The stock dropped more than 25 percent in May, after the company issued a profit-warning partly because of competition in consumer long-distance.

Job cuts in that unit are already a major part of Armstrong's plan to cut $2 billion in costs during 2000. The company has notified 6,200 workers that their positions are being eliminated, mostly in long-distance.

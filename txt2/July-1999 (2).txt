 Following a series of costly stumbles, First Union announced a shakeup in its top management ranks Thursday that ends the 24-year career of President John Georgius, 54. 

 Ken Thompson, 48, the bank's low-key head of its fast-growing investment banking division, will take Georgius' job when he retires Dec. 31. 

 Thompson's appointment introduces a clear successor to Chairman and Chief Executive Ed Crutchfield, 58, said people close to the bank. First Union announced the changes after a board meeting called Thursday to discuss management issues. 

 Despite the moves, a persistent question remained Thursday: Are they enough to sate investors and turn around the nation's sixth-largest bank? 

 Bank analyst Charlie Peabody of Mitchell Securities, who has followed First Union since the 1980s, says there are large shareholders quietly agitating for Crutchfield's removal. 

 "There is still dissatisfaction within the institutional community and they are making known their preferences through the analyst community," he said Thursday. 

 Peabody, a Crutchfield supporter, said he expects the First Union chief executive will turn the company around next year. Still, 1999 will be a "transition year," perhaps even with a profit warning late in the year, he said. 

 The board met for two hours at the bank's Charlotte headquarters, with many N.C. directors in attendance and other members of the 27-person board participating by telephone. Thompson received a standing ovation when he was ushered into the 41st-floor boardroom, according to a person close to the bank. 

 Thompson goes on the board immediately, and Georgius will step off when he retires. 

 The shakeup comes amid one of the rockiest years in First Union's history. The bank stunned Wall Street in January and May with warnings that profits will fall far short of expectations. Its shares are down 21 percent this year. Many analysts have panned its sweeping branch makeover, dubbed "Future Bank," as a failure. 

 Georgius was the architect of "Future Bank," a strategy that sought to strip branches of many service functions and redirect them to a giant call center, freeing employees to sell mutual funds and other products. It sought to nudge consumers toward automated-teller machines, telephones and other technology and away from tellers. But many customers balked, saying they don't drive to their branch to use the phone or stand in long teller lines. 

 On Wall Street Thursday, a number of analysts labeled Georgius as the fall guy. "I don't think he was the sole issue here," said analyst Peter Kuper at Keefe Bruyette & Woods. "To assign it all to Georgius is unnecessarily unfair." 

 Bank officials say they plan to show Wall Street numbers next week that indicate sales are way up. "Future Bank is clicking," spokeswoman Virginia Mackin said Thursday. 

 Despite missteps with Future Bank and CoreStates Financial, the Philadelphia bank First Union swallowed last year, Georgius has an illustrious track record. 

 The bank's longtime attorney, Rodgin Cohen, once said that First Union would not exist today without Georgius' expertise in carrying out all the mergers Crutchfield negotiated. Known as a tough and sometimes terse manager, he is also credited with persuading Crutchfield that First Union had to move into the mutual fund business, and he also oversaw the bank's successful overhaul of its commercial banking business. 

 Georgius has been visible in the Charlotte community on issues ranging from education to transit. He is co-chairing the Discovery Place Committee for Aquarium Organization, which is backing construction of a major aquarium in Charlotte. 

 And he has played a prominent role in education improvement and programs like Smart Start. 

 Georgius was not available for comment Thursday. But a person close to the bank suggested there may be some private reasons that motivated his decision. He is recently remarried to the former Nancy Blake. She has been seriously ill. 

 "John has contributed tirelessly to the growth and success of first Unoin over the past 24 years," Crutchfield said in a statement issued by the bank. "But he has expressed a desire to retire and pursue other interests at this point in his life. We respect his decision, deeply appreciate his contributions and wish him every success in the future." 

 A statement by Georgius said: "I'm proud of First Union's growth and accomplishments and I'm confident in the direction the company is going." 

 Thompson, a Rocky Mount native, has long been seen as a rising star at the bank, which he joined in 1976. A commercial lender by background, he was named head of the capital markets group, which offers Wall Street-style services to the bank's corporate clients, in 1996. The position was seen as a critical stepping stone if he were to head the bank one day. 

 The bank announced the moves after the stock market closed. On a down day for most stocks, First Union shares rose $1.12{ to $48. 

 "I still want to see performance," said Thomas Goggins, John Hancock Funds senior vice president and manager of Financial Industries Fund, a major First Union shareholder. "At the end of the day, the stock price has been disappointing to say the least this year, so all I care about is getting the stock moving again."

 Analytica htt p://www.oxan.com United States: Economic Slowdown? In recent weeks, economic data have produced conflicting signals about the strength of domestic demand within the US economy. A majority within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes that growth will decelerate and that only a small tightening of monetary policy will be necessary in the short term. However, the Federal Reserve has consistently underestimated domestic demand, and there are signs that the economy is still buoyant. Moreover, with improving economic prospects in Europe and Asia, the external forces encouraging lower US interest rates are likely to be reversed. The combination of these factors could put pressure on the Fed to tighten further. On June 30, the FOMC surprised financial markets by adopting a neutral policy stance, after voting to increase the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5%. 

  A majority within the committee believed that the economy was showing early signs of overheating (especially with respect to consumer spending), necessitating a moderate monetary tightening. However, rather than diminishing expectations about the economy, the decision to move to a neutral bias-along with the moderate rate rise-prompted a stock market rally, increasing the 'wealth effects' which have fueled household consumption during the current expansion. Economic data released since the FOMC meeting have validated the committee's restrained actions. Wholesale prices fell slightly in June, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was flat for the second month in succession. This was the first time this has occurred since 1986. Furthermore, the May CPI increase of 0.7% which has been cited as a key reason for June's monetary tightening, now seems an aberration. The Federal Reserve is projecting inflation to rise at only 2.25-2.50% over the four quarters of this year. This is set against the background of 3.50-3.75% real GDP growth over the same period. In his July 22 testimony to Congress, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted that "there are mechanisms in place that should help to slow the growth of spending to a pace more consistent with that of potential output growth". Consumption growth is expected to slow on the back of more moderate equity price rises in the next 12-18 months (and perhaps even a stock market correction), which should curb the wealth effects underpinning consumer spending. Moreover, as businesses and households adjust to the higher cost of borrowing, they should begin to trim their capital spending plans. There are already signs that the economy may be beginning to slow. Consumption decelerated in June, when retail sales rose by only 0.1%. Furthermore, housing starts fell to their lowest level in over a year. This suggests that the interest rate rise may have already dampened demand in the housing market. Nonetheless, the FOMC has consistently underestimated the strength of domestic demand. It would therefore be unwise to assume that the economy has entered a phase of slower growth. Consumers still have little reason to feel inhibited. Economic data supporting this assessment include June's consumption data, which-when stripped of automobile sales-rose by 0.4%. It has also been suggested that labor and building material shortages, rather than falling demand, were responsible for the housing slowdown in June. Moreover, the Federal Reserve has admitted that large, unexploited profit opportunities may mean that any cyclical retrenchment in business spending could be muted. The FOMC's decision to move to a neutral monetary stance in the face of the economy's continued buoyancy rests on two factors. Firstly, the Fed seems to think that US productivity growth will continue to increase. Secondly, the committee believes that it has the ability to pre-empt any forces of imbalance if they threaten economic stability. With respect to productivity, the Federal Reserve appears to believe that there has been a historic shift in the economy's supply-side potential. Non-farm business productivity grew at an average rate of just over 1% per year in the 1980s, but in recent years has accelerated to more than 2%; over the past year it has averaged 2.5%. This increased productivity growth has helped to rein in and keep inflation low, despite the sustained expansion in demand and employment. It has also allowed real wages to rise without increasing unit labor costs and reducing profits. The Fed appears to believe that this trend could continue, based on the expectations of analysts and company executives. The driving forces behind the productivity gains include business restructuring using the synergies of new technologies with enhanced productive efficiencies, the enhanced flexibility of productive facilities and the elimination of bottlenecks. Large swaths of inventory safety stocks, redundant capital equipment and under-utilized workers have also been removed. In addition, the reduction of barriers to cross-border trade has intensified the pressures of global competition. While the Federal Reserve can do little directly to increase productivity growth, it is charged with providing a favorable macro environment. As such, there are three major concerns which could require pre-emptive action. The first is a possible bubble in equity prices. The Federal Reserve remains worried that equity prices could be driven to unsupportable levels; indeed, some analysts argue that the stock market has already reached this point and that a correction is overdue. However, the FOMC knows that it cannot effectively directly target stock or other asset prices and admits that identifying a bubble in the process of inflating is a formidable challenge. Its approach to date has therefore been to follow the financial markets while warning of the dangers. Surging capital gains have prompted concern about the large shortfall in private savings, which could eventually prove inflationary. If this should happen, there would be some advance warning in the labor market and wages (where pressures build up slowly). Without early, decisive action by the FOMC, imbalances would arise that would eventually force a more disruptive adjustment to interest rates later. The gap between private saving and domestic investment has thus far been funded by capital inflows attracted by the marked increase in rates of return on US investments. It is thus linked to the supply-side 'miracle'. However, if US productivity were to slow and foreign economies were to enjoy a sustained revival, capital inflows from abroad may be difficult to sustain at current interest rates and at the current dollar rate. The widening trade deficit (which hit a record 21.34 billion dollars in May) makes the United States even more heavily dependent on these inflows. While a fully blown financing crisis is highly unlikely, a shift in the impact of foreign influences on domestic US monetary policy-making may be in prospect. In the past couple of years, with European growth sluggish and the emerging economies depressed, the international background favored US domestic monetary easing. Now that the business environment is improving in Europe and Asia, the external factors encouraging lower domestic interest rates have been removed. Somewhat brighter international prospects will have two effects: US exports will be buoyed, helping to close the current account deficit in the longer run. This will please the US administration, especially Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers, who has urged the EU, in particular, to adopt economic policies which encourage domestic demand-led growth. Long-term bond rates and the dollar will fall. German 10-year bond yields have already risen, narrowing the differential with US yields to just over 1 percentage point. This suggests that world bond prices will be much tighter over the short to medium term. As euro-area growth improves, the euro will also rise in value against the dollar. These developments are not yet so marked as to affect US monetary stance in the short run, but they could gradually put pressure on the Federal Reserve to tighten. Even if the FOMC leaves interest rates unchanged at its August 24 meeting, there are still risks that it will need to raise them later. ( The Korea Economic Weekly 1999/07/29 ).

SHARE prices are falling sharply on both sides of the Atlantic.  

Investors have been caught in a pincer movement with the profit warning from Glaxo Wellcome taking an early toll, while worries about another US rate rise compounded the problem.  

The FT-SE 100 index opened sharply lower and saw its losses extended by an opening fall of more than 180 points for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the wake of worse-than-expected labour costs data.  

The index fell 128.7 to 6168.5. So much for this week's rally.  

City investors were quick to pass round the painkillers as they digested the shock news of Glaxo Wellcome's profits warning. More than Pounds 6 billion was wiped from the group's stock market value as the price plunged 182p to 1570p on turnover of more than 26 million shares. The Americans have also continued selling the stock.  

The market fears the drugs giant has gone ex-growth. Some of the big securities houses have been left with egg on their faces. Only last week, blue-blooded stockbroker Cazenove was telling clients to switch out of SmithKline Beecham, down 39p at 735p, and into Glaxo. Oops!  

The Glaxo share price has dropped from a peak of 2258p this year as US investors continue to switch back into cyclical stocks. But some of the big securities houses have been happy to chase the stock ahead of the results, enthused by prospects for new products such as flu treatment Relenza, which has just received US approval.  

Already City speculators are claiming that Sir Richard Sykes, the Glaxo Well-come boss, may be tempted to turn his attention back to rival SmithKline in order to generate fresh earnings growth.  

The two sides were in merger talks last year but some large egos got in the way.  

That did not go down well in the Square Mile, where a merger had strong support.  

Investors appeared to be ringing all the wrong numbers among the mobile phones operators. Cable & Wireless dropped 21p to 763p on reports it was close to accepting a Pounds 7 billion offer for One2One, which it owns jointly with the US group MediaOne, from Deutsche Telecom. Such an offer would fall short of the Pounds 11 billion being bandied about earlier this year and would cast doubt on the valuations being put on the other mobile phones companies by the City.  

Orange took it to heart, falling 31p to 967 1/2p.  

Storehouse lost an early lead to finish 1p cheaper at 122p. City speculators are dreaming of a possible merger with rival Debenhams, 1 1/2 p easier at 364p. Troubled Storehouse has spent Pounds 260 million during the past couple of years but has failed to achieve the returns enjoyed by Debenhams. A bullish trading  

statement from chairman Lord Harris of Peckham lifted Carpetright 5p to 447p.  

The AIM-listed Future Integrated Telephony traded 6p higher to a year's high of 78 1/2p. Financier Bob Morton has acquired a 15% stake in the company, which sells and installs telephone systems, and is looking for a quick turnaround.  

Newcomer Freeserve continued to build up a head of steam, rising 15p at 226p as more than 12 million shares changed hands.  

lPrices and indices in this section are supplied from various sources and calculated at different times and may not always match those listed in the tables. Ofex prices relate to the previous close.  

WALL STREET tumbled today as poor economic data brought the prospect of another US interest rate rise. The Dow Jones Average was off 186.80 at 10,785.27.

 Street Upbeat As Pacificare Meets Lowered Earnings Views

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The nation's largest operator of Medicare health maintenance organizations saw its second-quarter profits rise 41% as it increased premiums for commercial plans. 

 Pacificare Health Systems Inc.'s (PHSY) second-quarter profits rose to $1.49 a share on revenue of $2.45 billion compared with last year's profits of $1.06 a share on revenue of $2.39 billion. 

 Analysts covering the company appeared upbeat about the figures, as did investors who helped the stock rise about 10% in early morning trading. 

 "The quarter is as good as can be expected given the tough environment they are in," said Peter Costa, an analyst at ABN AMRO Inc., referring to the havoc that dwindling Medicare reimbursements have been playing on the managed-care industry. 

 Analysts said the numbers fell in line with revised estimates Pacificare released last month when it warned the Street that estimates were too high. The company lowered its estimates to between $1.45 a share and $1.50 a share. 

 At the time, the company's caution left some wondering whether Pacificare was simply being cautious in preventing market overexuberance or issuing a profit warning. As a result, the stock price - which hit a high of over $100 a share in early May - fell over the course of several days. 

 Pacificare's profit warning came as a surprise to many since the company had been touting its growth prospects in recent weeks. 

 "Look at what the company reported last year," said Bank of America Securities LLC analyst Todd Richter. "Here is a company that reported earnings that were up 40% year-over-year. I think the concerns people had was that the company was talking very optimistically and people's estimates got up." 

 Shares of Pacificare recently traded at 67 15/16, up 5 7/8, or 9.5%, on Nasdaq volume of 631,700. Average daily volume is 486,250 shares. 

 But analysts covering the company warned that given Pacificare's huge position in Medicare - the company derives 60% of its business from Medicare - serious questions remain to be answered about federal regulatory issues and capitation. 

 "It is not an easy company to get your hands around," Richter said. "What earnings are at a moment in time are only part of what people should look at." 


     Shifting The Risk To The Doctors



Pacificare has largely escaped the negative effects of dwindling
Medicare reimbursements, a problem that has ravaged the medical services
and managed-care industries. But its solution has been to shift
financial risk to the doctors by paying set fees per patients, a process
known as capitation.



Pacificare's success is noteworthy given the fact that such a large
potion of its business is derived from Medicare. But the company could
become vulnerable if doctors are successful in demanding higher rates
from the company, analysts said.



The medical care ration - the portion of each premium dollars that
goes to pay medical costs - for Pacificare's commercial health plans
fell slightly to 81.4% from 83.7% as the company raised premiums and
sold a money-losing plan in Utah. The ratio for its plans serving
Medicare, however, rose to 87.5% from 86.1%.



Pacificare said it has studied the Medicare reimbursement issue to
define methods for maintaining adequate profit margins. As a result,
nearly all Medicare members will see some combination of member-paid
premium increases, increased co-payments or reductions in benefits.



But with costs far outpacing increases in Medicare reimbursements,
analysts said questions still loom as to how long Pacificare can remain
profitable.



"They are doing an amazing job considering they are 60% in Medicare,"
said Joseph France, analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.



"Still, you can charge these extra premiums and reduce benefits, but
it eventually becomes hard to maintain profitability if repayments
continue to be inadequate," he added.

 PARIS (Dow Jones)--Shares in French computer maker Bull SA came under selling pressure early Friday, falling 7.9% after Thursday's profitwarning. 

 At 0830 GMT, Bull shares were at EUR7.45, down EUR0.64. 

 "Investors can only be distressed by the company's long track record of profit warnings," said a Paris-based trader. 

 Traders said Bull's plan to increase its capital before the end of 1999 was also weighing on the stock. 

 On Thursday, Bull said that it was lowering its forecasts of full-year earnings growth because of uncertainty in the information-technology market. 

 The warning came after the company posted a EUR13.0 million loss in the first half of 1999.

 CyberCash Invests In Commission Junction to Boost InstaBuy.

 CyberCash Inc has bought a minority equity stake in a start-up e- commerce affiliate program company to boost take-up of its InstaBuy one-click shopping wallet technology. It has invested $7m for an undisclosed minority stake in Santa Barbara, California-based Commission Junction, which currently has around 90 merchants and 85,000 affiliates that it links together. As well as the stake, the deal means that as of September, any of those affiliates will be able to take advantage of InstaBuy, which enables users to carry over credit card information from one merchant to another without typing it all in, either through direct integration of InstaBuy or automatic form-filling. 

 Take up of InstaBuy has been relatively slow, as the company admitted in a second quarter profit warning earlier this week. Only has about six companies have fully integrated the InstaBuy cartridge so far, but CyberCash says it has already profiled the top 100 e-commerce web sites that will enable InstaBuy to populate forms automatically on those sites. It hopes to have about 200 more done by next month and it will integrate InstaBuy with its CashRegister product later this year, which will bring those 14,000 merchants into the system automatically. 

 Commission Junction not only links merchants with affiliates, it also keeps track of the referrals. For CyberCash, it means more places to use its wallet, while enabling the merchants and their affiliates to keep their customers' eyeballs. It says that payment models like this will not fly if users are driven away from the merchant's site to complete the transaction. The version of InstaBuy that ships this week will be the first with automatic form-filling capabilities.

PHOENIX AREA LACKS HIGH-TECH PLANNING

The message is unmistakable: Phoenix has some work to do if it wants to play in the big leagues of high technology in the 21st century.  

The warning came in the form of a study released last week by the Milken Institute, a non-profit economic think tank studying the dynamics of world economic growth.  

The major problem isn't that Phoenix ranked 12th or lower in many of the measures applied to its high-tech performance. As much as many of us would have like to believe otherwise, Greater Phoenix has struggled to live up to it hopes of earning a title such as ''Silicon Desert'' or ''Digital Desert.'' All too often it has found itself under the long shadows of ''Silicon Valley'' or Boston or Austin or Boulder or Atlanta. The major problem is that not enough is being done to prepare for the changes that are coming the world of technology.  

''Because of the growing role of high-tech industries in the national economy, metros that do not achieve some level of attainment in these critical industries will likely experience substandard economic growth in future,'' the Milken study says.  

''High-tech industries are determining which metropolitan areas are succeeding or failing. Without growth in high-tech sectors, metros will be left behind.''  

I believe we have bit of overstatement there, because there still will be other industries making significant contributions to the so-called New Economy. However, high tech will be the driver in most metro areas, at least.  

For the purpose of its study, the Milken Institute ''applied a methodology that includes industries that spend an above-average amount of revenue on research and development and that employ an above industry-average number of technology-using occupations such as scientists, engineers, mathematicians and programmers.''  

Despite the attractiveness of high-technology industries, there is a danger in putting too much emphasis on a single sector of the economy. Anyone who was around the Valley in the late 1980s remembers how a real estate collapse cut the legs out of the economy.  

The study recognizes the economic risk and warns that ''if a synchronus shock were to spread across a number of related technology industries, an economywide recession could occur.''  

Interestingly, Phoenix does not appear on the list of 50 metros most sensitive to high-tech recessions, because high-tech output does not represent a major portion of the total output in the metropolitan area. The metro Phoenix economy has become much more diversified than it was 10 year ago.  

Jackie Vieh, director of the Arizona Department of Commerce, pointed out to me last week that a number of things have already been done to bolster the state's readiness for the change to a technology-driven economy. They include: lower corporate income tax; research and development tax credits; personal property tax reduction; funding for job training; workforce development; changes in technology tranfers regulations.  

But there still seems to be little sense of urgency, not much focus and not much in the way of high-profile leadership from either the public or private sector. Other states are well ahead in this aspect.  

The Milken Institute has some suggestions on economic-development policy.  

For one, providing a readily available labor pool is probably the best investment that state or local governments can make.  

Also, enhancing and reinforcing high-tech research capability both in basic and applied research (commercializing ideas and technology) can be a fruitful and effective public policy, especially during the growth state of high-tech industries.  

And, research centers and institutions are undisputedly the most important factor in incubating high-tech industries.

 Caterpillar Sees Profit Growth Slowing in '99

 CHICAGO, July 16 -- After months of hinting at a turnaround, Caterpillar Inc., the maker of construction and earth-moving equipment, warned investors yesterday that profit growth would continue to slide this year. 

 The warning came after Caterpillar said that its second-quarter profits had fallen 36.5 percent from a year earlier because of slumping demand for heavy machines and equipment. It was the fourth consecutive quarterly profit decline for Caterpillar. 

 Shares of Caterpillar fell 18.75 cents, to $58.9375, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The company said it revised its outlook because sales of more profitable machines and equipment, like mining trucks, had dipped while sales of less profitable equipment, like truck engines, had gained -- upsetting the more favorable profit mix that had been the basis for an earlier projection. 

 Second-quarter sales were $5.1 billion, Caterpillar said, down from $5.6 billion in the second quarter of last year, and profits in the latest quarter were $283 million, down from $446 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were 78 cents, slightly below Wall Street expectations and down from $1.20. 

 Wall Street analysts said they were disappointed by the results and by the company's warning, but several analysts said investors were already looking ahead to early next year. 

 ''Caterpillar, at this point, is a 2000 story,'' said David Bleustein, an analyst at Paine Webber. ''We expect the benefits of the global recovery to more than offset any slowdown there might be here in the United States.'' 

 That turnaround, however, was expected to come earlier this year. In March, Caterpillar executives sounded an upbeat note at a convention in Las Vegas, Nev., saying that signs of a recovery in Asia, corporate belt-tightening and a push to diversify its business could put the company on sound footing in 1999. 

 But today, the company pushed that optimism further out, saying that it did not expect a big jump in profits until the fourth quarter of this year. 

 ''We're trying to fix this,'' said F. Lynn McPheeters, chief financial officer at Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill. ''We thought the mix of business would turn a little earlier.'' 

 Although Caterpillar says its warning grew out of a slowdown in the sale of more profitable mining and oil exploration equipment, the company pegged its yearlong profit slump to a recession in parts of Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and weakness in the mining and oil exploration industry. 

 Despite those problems, Caterpillar executives say the company has made great strides in diversifying its mix of businesses, noting gains in everything from solar turbines to truck engines and financial services. 

 Revenue in 1998 was a record $21 billion, and this year the company expects revenue to be slightly below that figure. Profits, though, could be down 20 percent to 25 percent because of fierce competition and the unexpected slump in some of the company's most profitable products, the company said. Although profits dipped last year to $1.5 billion, it was the third consecutive year the company recorded a profit of more than $1 billion. Even with a sharp slowdown, the company could still earn $1 billion this year. 

 ''We'll have profits that are down but reasonable, considering the recession we've had in many of our businesses,'' Mr. McPheeters said today in a telephone interview. 

 He also said that the company had already seen a slight upturn in Asia, the only region where sales gained from a year earlier, and that Caterpillar had not yet benefited from a Federal highway bill that recently went into effect. 

 The company said it would continue to benefit from cost reduction put into place a year ago, and there are expectations for a solid fourth quarter, with some analysts estimating a profit jump of 40 percent or more from a year ago, when Caterpillar suffered a steep decline. 

 Wall Street analysts, though less optimistic in March than the company was at that time, now say they believe the company's fortunes will turn in 2000. While several analysts dropped their third-quarter and year-end estimates, according to the First Call Corporation, which surveys analysts, no analyst altered a prediction for next year. 

 ''This is being seen as a one-quarter problem,'' said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call. ''This is a pretty mild analyst reaction.''

 U.S. Markets: Stocks Mixed On Caterpillar News

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Stocks traded mixed Friday, as a surprisingly poor earnings report from Caterpillar weighed on the blue chips, while technology stocks were able to squeeze out modest gains. Bonds rose, and the dollar weakened. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 19 points to 11167 in late morning trading after rallying 38.31 points Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched down 0.80 to 1408.80 Friday, and New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 1.50 to 659.30. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index added 16.60 to 2856. 

 Friday is an options-expiration day, which often makes market indexes more volatile. The Dow industrials were led down early by Caterpillar, which fell 1 1/16 to 58 7/16, after the heavy-equipment manufacturer reported second-quarter earnings of 78 cents per share, two cents below analysts' consensus estimates. The company said net income fell 36% in the quarter and warned that per-share earnings could fall 25% below 1998's levels. 

 "Not good," said Michael Lyons, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The market was going to spotty anyway due to profit-taking, but the Caterpillar news adds to that.' 

 The blow was cushioned by an accommodating bond market. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, which was over 6% as recently as July 7, continued to fall below 5.9%, as unrest in Iran, fears of an economic crisis in Argentina, and a dispute between Taiwan and China triggered heavy buying of U.S. government securities. 

 But a growing number of analyst are wondering just how durable the stock market's recent will be, considering how few stocks are performng especially well. 


According Don Hays, chief investment strategist at Wheat First Union,
only 134 stocks that trade on the Big Board and 192 on the Nasdaq Stock
Market have set new highs lately. 'That's very unimpressive," Hays said.
"It demonstrates just how poor the breadth of this rally is, and doesn't
bode well for a sustained rise."
   Technology stocks were led by Microso ft, up 3 1/2 to 97 7/8 after
people familiar with the situation said the company is moving closer
to create a stock to track its Microsoft Network properties, which
include the Hotmail e-mail service and the Expedia travel site.
Alcoa, a Dow component, rose 1 1/2 to 62 1/4, helping support the
industrial average, after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgraded its shares
to "strong buy" from "neutral.'
   Iridium World Communications fell 1/32 to 7 7/32 after the company
it will miss a $90 million interest p ayment on bonds, and at least
one of its investors, Lockheed Martin, said it doesn't plan to
contribute additional funds to the satellite-phone venture. The news
came a day after Motorola, Iridium's largest investor, said the
project may have to be shut down in bankruptcy-law proceedings because
of huge losses unless its investors can agree on a restructuring plan.
   Gillette rose 1 3/8 to 46 1/8 after reporting a 19% slide in
earnings for the second quarter, suffering from sluggish overseas
economie s and underperformance in a few of its nonrazor businesses.
The consumer-goods company late Thursday reported net income of 26
cents a diluted share, compared with 33 cents a share a year earlier.
The results were in line with Wall Street expectations, which had been
reduced following the company's warning last month of sluggish profit.
   In major market action Friday: Stocks were mixed. On the Big Board,
where 243 million shares traded, 1,483 stocks declined and 1,059
advanced.



Bonds rose. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was up 1/4 of a
point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 in bond face value. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of the price, stood at 5.89%.



The dollar weakened. It traded at 120.97 yen and $1.0219 per euro,
compared to 120.99 yen and $1.0195 per euro late Thursday in New York.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Stocks were mixed early Friday, with a weak
earnings report from Caterpillar pressuring blue chips. Technology
stocks moved modestly higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 9 points to 11177 in the
first half hour of trading, after adding 38.31 points Thursday.



The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index Friday rose 1.20 to 1410.80
Friday, and New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased 0.30 to
660.40. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 18.70 to 2858.


 Decliners led advancers on the Big Board, 1,361 to 978, as volume reached 166 million shares. Trading was expected to be volatile because Friday is an options-expiration day. 

 Caterpillar fell 1 5/8 to 57 7/8 after reporting second-quarter earnings fell 36% to 78 cents per share, two cents below analysts' consensus estimates. The heavy-equipment manufacturer, a Dow component, also said yearly per-share earnings could fall 25% below 1998's levels. 

 However, the industrials got some support from Alcoa, which added 1 5/8 to 62 3/8. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter upgraded shares of the Pittsburgh aluminum company to "strong buy" from "neutral." Microsoft gained 3 1/16 to 97 7/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, pushing technology shares higher. The Redmond, Wash., software giant is nearing creation of a tracking stock for its Microsoft Network properties, which include Hotmail e-mail service and the Expedia travel site, sources close to the matter said. 


Meanwhile, QLogic jumped 9 1/2 to 149 3/8 on Nasdaq after fiscal
first-quarter profit jumped 140% from a year ago, flying past analysts"
estimates. The Costa Mesa, Calif., computer technology company late
Thursday reported net income of 60 cents a diluted share, compared with
26 cents in the previous first quarter. Analysts had predicted earnings
of 49 cents.
   Elsewhere, Air Products & Chemicals sank 5 1/16 to 64 1/4 after
warning its third-quarter earnings will be around 48 cents a share,
below analysts" estimates, and its yearly results would drop by 5% to
7% from 1998. The Allentown, Pa., gas supplier also agreed to
purchased the Australian and New Zealand operations of BOC Group, the
U.K. gases company said. The purchase is part of an $11.2 billion
breakup bid for BOC Group by Air Products and Air Liquide of France.
   Veritas Software gained 7 3/16 to 60 1/2 on Nasdaq. Goldman Sachs
initiated coverage of the Mountain View, Calif., data-storage company
with a "market outperform" rating.



Kinder Morgan Energy rose 2 1/2 to 40. The Houston oil concern said
second-quarter net income rose to 61 cents from 50 cents a year ago,
handily beating Wall Street estimates of 56 cents. The company also
projected an increase in its Pacific operations.



Gillette added 1 5/16 to 46 1/16 after reporting a 19% slide in
earnings for the second quarter, in line with expectations. The Boston
consumer-goods company, which is suffering from sluggish overseas
economies and underperformance in a few of its nonrazor businesses, said
late Thursday net income totaled 26 cents a diluted share, compared with
33 cents a share a year earlier.

     COPENHAGEN, July 15 (Reuters) - Danish blue-chip shares 

 closed almost one percent higher on Thursday in a market 

 following the positive trend in Europe and dealers seeing the 

 moderate upward trend continuing undramatically up to the 

 weekend. 

     The KFX top-20 index put on 0.96 percent to close at 218.94 

 in KFX turnover of 859 million crowns($118.3 million), with the 

 KFX July future finishing one point ahead at 216.50. 

     "The blue chip index is headed towards the 220 level, 

 fuelled by Europe and early Dow gains, but Friday will not see 

 major advances," one dealer said. 

     Heading the day`s league of loss leaders was upmarket audio 

 and television maker B&O which tumbled 40 crowns or 8.4 percent 

 to 433 crowns on a profit warning. 

     Road construction, chemicals and packaging firm Superfos, 

 which rose 40 percent on Wednesday on news of a possible pending 

 takeover bid from Britain`s CVC Capital Partners, slipped four 

 crowns or 2.8 percent back to 139 crowns. 

     Main market constituents Tele Danmark and bio-tech firm Novo 

 Nordisk both edged up one crown, with the former ending at 400 

 crowns and the latter at 765 crowns. 

     Otherwise Moeller shipping and oil noted solid rises, while 

 banks were buoyant with Den Danske pushing five up to 845 crowns 

 and rival Unibank rising 13 to 523 crowns.

ANALYSTS FRET AS STARBUCKS DIVERSIFIES

The way Karen Sack sees it, the growth and expansion pressures on Starbucks are typical of the demands Wall Street often puts on public companies.

``They've got to find ways to grow,'' says Sack, an analyst for S&P Equity Group in New York City. ``They can't sit still. It's just too competitive. It's all a question of what their growth strategy is.''

Uncertainty about that basic question caused Starbucks' stock price to sink more than 40 percent earlier this month after the company stunned investors with news of an expected $19 million revenue shortfall for 1999 and lower profit projections. The shares closed up 50 cents at $25.62-1/2 Tuesday.

That news stung all the more because the company raised prices in May by an average of 10 cents a cup.

Starbucks cited overly optimistic retail revenue projections and $4 million in start-up costs for its developing Internet business.

Sack and other analysts, however, point to the missed projections and downward profit adjustment as warning signs that Starbucks might be heading in the wrong direction.

Many analysts say the larger question is whether Starbucks is risking too much by trying to extend its brand name to products and services beyond its core business of specialty coffee.

``I think it puts a cloud over the company, to some degree,'' Sack said. ``Wall Street doesn't like uncertainty. Analysts start worrying that they're going too far afield. There's a lot of suspicion.''

Some analysts, pointing to other retailers whose electronic commerce efforts have turned into financial black holes, say such uneasiness is not surprising or unwarranted.

But Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz insists the company's retail stores remain a top priority. He quickly adds, however, the Internet offers significant potential for the company to expand globally and extend its brand beyond coffee.

``We have a significant opportunity to create a breakthrough Internet strategy in a multibillion-dollar, underserved category,'' Schultz said during a conference call with analysts and investors last month. ``We're not just throwing up a Web site. We're not being cavalier about it. We're trying to build a long-term business here.''

Schultz declined to be interviewed for this story. But during the June 30 conference call, he said the company's research has identified housewares, specialty foods and home furnishings as areas that together represent a $100 billion-a-year market that Starbucks could begin to tap.

The decision to pursue an Internet strategy is based on research suggesting 70 percent of the 10 million customers who visit Starbucks' retail stores each week are affluent, computer-savvy consumers who would be attracted to a Starbucks' Web site. Once there, Starbucks is confident large numbers of customers trust the Starbucks brand enough to purchase products besides coffee.

Scott Waltmann, an assistant vice president at Merrill Lynch in New York, said Schultz's ideas should not be underestimated or discounted just because some stray from the core business.

``I do believe that most are looking at this in a simplistic fashion,'' Waltmann said. ``If you're a retailer and you're not exploring e-commerce, you're behind the eight ball. (Schultz) definitely has a vision that he wants to translate, communicate to his customers. I think he's legitimately on to something here.''

To prepare for its Internet push, Starbucks is forming a new subsidiary called Starbucks X, which will oversee the company's online endeavors, as well as other ventures such as its publishing partnership with Time Inc., its alliance with Internet chat provider Talk City, and its venture with Oxygen Media.

But Laurie Breidenbach, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle, said while Starbucks' reputation and brand name remain largely unshaken in the Pacific Northwest, Wall Street sees the situation much differently.

``Their core business is very strong (and) I think the idea of leveraging a brand is a good idea,'' Breidenbach said, but ``that's a lot for one company to digest. It's hard for any company.

Is Ladbroke set to book into Hilton? MARKET REPORT

IT could be time for investors to check in for some five-star action at Hilton Group. After a prolonged courtship, Hilton Hotels Corporation of the US is believed to be about to strike a deal that amounts to a reverse takeover of the former Ladbroke hotel and betting shop empire.  

Put together by Steve Bollenbach, Hilton Corporation's dynamic president and chief executive officer, the deal could involve Ladbroke's gaming operations being spun off under group chief executive Peter George.  

Hilton edged up only 1 /2 p to 245 3 /4 p before rumours circulated that an announcement is pending. HHC and Ladbroke have been in talks for years to bring all Hilton hotels worldwide back under one roof. Ladbroke owns the Hilton name outside the US.  

Hilton has become increasingly focused on its hotels and casinos since its Pounds 1.2bn acquisition of Stakis in March. This was reflected in its decision to kick the old Ladbroke name into touch.  

Meanwhile, mid-market hotel chain Regal hardened 1 /4 p to 18 3 /4 p on heavy turnover of Pounds 42.8m. It accompanied vague rumours that Bonham Industries was adding to its 9.7pc stake prior to launching a full-scale bid.  

Regal crashed from 27p earlier this month when it warned that profits for this year would be 'substantially' below market expectations because of difficult trading and restructuring costs.  

One analyst slashed his forecast from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 22m to a loss of Pounds 9.4m, including exceptionals.  

Gerry Robinson's leisure and media group Granada looked sick as a parrot at 617p, down 26p, after confirming the Pounds 22m purchase of a 9.9pc stake in Liverpool Football Club. Funds raised will help to strengthen the team.  

News of the deal excited other quoted football clubs who could now attract the attention of other major media groups. Ofex-traded Arsenal rose Pounds 100 more in thin trading to Pounds 2,700 on hopes that Carlton Communications will buy a strategic shareholding.  

Carlton, which informally bid Pounds 4,000 a share for the Gunners in November 1998, eased 5 1 /2 p to 556 1 /2 p.  

Still awaiting confirmation of the sale by chairman and chief executive Martin Edwards of a 10pc stake in the club, Manchester United jumped 6 1 /2 p more to 230p. Leeds Sporting, owners of Leeds United FC, edged up 1 1 /4 p to 18 1 /4 p after Jupiter Asset Management increased its stake to 10.1pc.  

Premier-ship newcomers Sunderland gained 9 1 /2 p to 456p, while Tottenham Hotspur advanced 4p to 69 1 /2 p and AIM-listed Chelsea Village 4 1 /2 p to 73 1 /2 p.  

Elsewhere, an overnight sell programme which left broker Warburg Dillon Read stuffed with stock upset the applecart. Market-makers marked stocks lower and Wall Street opened 115 lower on rumours that Argentina may be about to default on its overseas loans. The Footsie fell away to finish 99.9 points down at 6445.6.  

Government data showing inflation stayed below its 2.5pc target in June raised hopes that there could be one more 1 /4 pc interest rate cut before the end of the year. UK underlying inflation was unchanged on the month in June and up 2.2pc on the year. The pound firmed 1 /8 cent to $1.5577.  

Sluggish German retail sales and a slump in exports saw the beleaguered euro slip to an all-time low of $1.0108 before bear closing prompted a rally which left a close of $1.0168.  

Confident that institutions will fill their boots with Freeserve when shares of the Internet provider are floated at between 120p and 150p on July 26, buyers pushed Dixons 45p higher to 1325p.  

Nervous selling ahead of tomorrow's agm left Marks & Spencer 14p down at 379 3 /4 p. Chief executive Peter Salsbury's statement is expected to be bearish, to say the least. It could include a profits warning because like-for-like sales of clothes have been showing double-digit falls.  

Marks will today announce an Pounds 11m facelift for 100 UK stores, giving them a simpler layout and more striking window displays.  

* WILL Cussins Property become the latest housebuilder to fall to a management buyout? It jumped 13p to a new peak for the year of 105 1 /2 p, valuing it at Pounds 18m, after revealing preliminary bid talks. The directors are keen to do a buyout but may have to team up with another builder or construction group. The shares have bounced back from 80p last month after they were hit by a profit warning.

GEN. CRUTCHFIELD TAPES A MESSAGE TO CALM THE TROOPS

Nothing about the grind of cubicle life that a week at the beach won't cure. For a week. Now, to the bidness at hand:*

Talk about educational television: The Big I popped in a videotape of Ed Crutchfield's recent address to First Union's 70,000 employees, and discovered that the Green Bank's CEO favors the militaristic banking-as-war metaphor just as much as Supreme Allied Commander Hugh McColl Jr. of crystal hand grenade renown.

Crutchfield taped the speech to calm the troops in the aftermath of First Union's May profit warning to Wall Street, which has left the Charlotte bank with a battered stock price.

``We won World War II. But there were some pretty nasty, tough, gosh-what's-going-to-happen-to-us kind of days. Quite frankly, we're having a day like that.''

In an interview with the bank's Jill Flynn, Crutchfield discusses what happened to knock almost $1 a share off '99 earnings projections, whether that makes First Union a takeover target (uh, no), and Wall Street analysts, whose reaction to the second profit warning he labels ``a little bit of a hysteria in a teapot.''

``Analysts have about a 30-day maximum attention span,'' Crutchfield explains in the tape, which was supplied to the Big I through - shall we say - unofficial channels. ``When you're trying to build a corporation you can't have the luxury of a 30-day attention span. You've got to invest for the future.''

Crutchfield goes on: ``As to the takeover business . . . this company is not for sale. It's never been for sale. I've never had a conversation in my career about selling it to to anybody. I never intend to. I will personally never, never vote to sell this company. You can put that in your pocketbook.''

Crutchfield also jokes that he agrees with a comment made to him that despite the bank's stumbles, First Union is ``still going to make enough money this year to buy China.''

   A global bidding war for British thread maker Hicking Pentecost has a


distinctly Charlotte flavor. American & Efird, the thread-making unit of Charlotte-based Ruddick, is slugging it out with Coats Viyella PLC, the world's largest manufacturer of sewing thread.

Coats is based in London, but it employs 225 at its North American headquarters in Charlotte and has roughly 1,800 workers at three N.C. plants.

Ruddick, which wants Hicking for access to new geographic markets and to strengthen its non-apparel thread business, opened the bidding June 29 with an offer of 1.75 pounds a share ($92 million total). Coats quickly countered with an offer of 2.05 pounds a share.

Coats spokeswoman Jane Brosnan says the North American division isn't directly involved in the action and declined comment on how - or even if - the acquisition of Hickings might affect Coats America's Charlotte operation on South Stream Boulevard in the Coliseum area.

*

And while the Big I ponders that impending beach trip, we share the following pearl of wisdom about achieving success:

``The secret is working every day.''

This comes to us from Robert Ingle, chairman and chief executive of the Southeastern grocery chain that carries his name. Looks like Ingles Markets' stock is working hard for shareholders, paying a 4.33 percent dividend - a hair more than Duke Energy's dividend yield.

Insider hears that Rick and Diane Siskey closed July 1 on their dream-home-to-be: the Whiteford Blakeney home at the corner of Sharon Road and Sharon Lane. You know, the one with a football field for a front yard.

The $2.8 million purchase price gives the Siskeys a 6,500-square-foot house with four bedrooms on 9.7 acres - and nice neighbors, too. Next door is Family Dollar's chairman, Leon Levine, who's no doubt still busy celebrating June's healthy 8.2 percent gain in same-store sales.

Rick Siskey, chairman of The Siskey Cos., a private equity and investment banking outfit, says the couple may opt to move the 39-year-old house onto a back lot and build new. If they choose to renovate, plans call for adding between 3,500 and 5,500 square feet of space.

A piece of Charlotte and N.C. history comes with the house, too. Blakeney, who died in 1991, was a prominent Charlotte lawyer who argued the case against court-ordered busing before the U.S. Supreme Court in the landmark Swann case. He also represented J.P. Stevens in its 17-year battle against unions that culminated in 1974 with a successful organizing campaign later depicted in the movie ``Norma Rae.''

*

A tip of the Big I's fedora to Isaiah and Hellena Tidwell, who will be honored tonight at the Afro-American Cultural Center for their years of service to Charlotte.

Isaiah, formerly regional executive of Wachovia's southern region of North Carolina, since June has been working in Atlanta, where he now serves as Wachovia's president of Georgia banking. Hellena most recently served as vice president of resource management at the Arts & Science Council.

The two are well-known for their volunteer efforts, and the breadth of organizations they have touched is apparent in the list of organizations sponsoring the invitation-only event: Afro-American Cultural Center, ASC, Central Piedmont Community College, the Charlotte Chamber, Davidson College, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Education Foundation, Foundation for the Carolinas, Johnson C. Smith University, Presbyterian Healthcare and University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

``These are all organizations that either Hellena or Isaiah or both of them, in most cases, have been very involved in over the years,'' said Scott Belford, ASC spokesman.

*

Brazil is ramping up for a big push to expand its furniture exports. A group of government representatives came to the heart of the U.S. furniture industry in June to tap the expertise of Ingeborg Hegenbart, SouthTrust Bank's International Woman of Action (not her official title).

``Brazil exports $400 million a year (in furniture), but only 12 percent goes to the U.S.,'' says the SouthTrust vice president, who says Brazil wants to boost exports to $2.3 billion by 2003.

The Brazilian delegation was led by Jeff Holmes, a former international sales manager for Broyhill whom Hegenbart knew way back in 1980 when she was working as a consultant to the furniture manufacturer. In addition to their discussions with Hegenbart, the group also visited extensively with several furniture retailers, Hegenbart says.

Hegenbart and the group lunched at Patou French Bistro, the Park Road restaurant where, says Hegenbart, ``I have my own table.''

*

Melvin Tennant, president and CEO of the Charlotte Convention & Visitors Bureau, arrived home from a business trip July 2 to find 40 pink flamingos adorning his front lawn . . . birthday greetings from his former secretary, Terry Nelson.

Nelson, who left her job at the CCVB after her husband was transfered to Memphis, says she just wanted to help Tennant over the hump. ``This is his big Four-Oh,'' says Nelson. ``He was kind of whining about it and I told him I didn't want to hear it because my last one was the big one.''

As somebody who's been there and done that, the Big I can only say: We feel your pain, Melvin.

*

And by the way, where does one find 40 flamingos for a birthday greeting? This being relationship-oriented Charlotte and all, Nelson first contacted the folks at A Basket O' Carolina, who did a lot of gift baskets for her when she was at the CCVB. They referred her to Charlotte Arrangements, which put her in touch with Extravaganza Events & Props, an event planner/prop house off Mint Street that claims it's prepared to handle birthdays requiring up to 100 flamingos.

Mark Middlesworth, owner of 2-1/2-year-old Extravaganza, says his company supplies props for events but also is building its own events planning business. The six-person outfit had a hand in Bank of America's name-change gala last Tuesday at Founders Hall, where the Big Bank bid adieu to the NationsBank moniker with a 40-by-18-foot B of A banner, 35-foot red, white, and blue air tubes, confetti cannons and ``all kinds of pyrotechnics going off.''


   No flamingos, we're told.

   *

   Charlotte didn't get the 2000 Republican National Convention, but the Queen
City will get some hotel bookings out of the deal anyway, as it turns out.

   Seems the National Association of Miniature Enthusiasts - yup, the acronym


is NAME - was booked into the Adam's Mark Hotel in Philadelphia for its August 2000 convention. But the hotel had a clause in the contract that allowed it to cancel the reservation in the event the GOP picked Philly to host its big bash.

``They bagged our convention,'' says Bob Hastings, a Charlottean who serves on NAME's board.

What to do? The folks at the Adam's Mark in Charlotte were more than happy to accommodate the NAME convention, says Hastings, who had been eager to bring the annual gathering of hobbyists to Charlotte. The convention is expected to draw about 1,200 collectors and makers of dollhouses and everything else miniature.

As Texas Banking Commissioner, Catherine Ghiglieri battled NationsBank's plans to fold its Texas bank into its holding company. Ghiglieri argued that the move would violate Texas' ban on interstate branching. NationsBank, now known as Bank of America, eventually prevailed in a case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court last year.

Now, Ghiglieri has left the government to form her own consulting firm, Ghiglieri & Co., in Austin. A recent mailing found its way to the Big I's desk. Among the services she pitches: crisis management, training programs and legislative consultation, though there is hardly a mention of her banking expertise.

*

And finally, the Big I acknowledges receipt of a fax from reader Bill Hensley congratulating us on avoiding any reference to Crutchfield & McColl in our July 5 column. Nothing against Ed and Hugh, but our astute reader points out there are plenty of ``talented, intelligent, well-known business execs out there who were worthy of a little ink now and then.''

 Excluding Ukraine and Belarus, unit case volume fell 1% compared with a year earlier, when volumes grew 8%, the soft-drinks company said. 

 Although price rises in the central European region and operating efficiencies in Italy will help offset the lower sales volumes, the company reiterated comments made at the annual meeting - that currency fluctuations also will affect its cash operating profit. 

 Neville Isdell, the company's chairman and chief executive, expressed confidence in CCB's longer-term prospects. 

 "We remain confident in our ability to generate shareholder value through profitable volume growth over time," he said.

 BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - The Bel-20 blue chip index was seen opening stronger on Monday after Friday's firm close on Wall Street   , but volumes would remain low with the onset of the summer holiday period, analysts said. 

 The formation on Sunday of a new government coalition of Liberals, Socialists and Greens - the latter taking power in Belgium for the first time - would have no effect on the market, they added. 

 "I think the market will open higher because of Wall Street and because (market) interest rates are flat," said analyst Koen Maes at brokerage Cordius. 

 Maes said investors had anticipated the make up of the new coalition, led by Liberal Guy Verhofstadt, and were unperturbed. 

 "It's a non-event for the Belgian market. We are in a European environment," agreed Werner Wuyts, analyst at Dierickx Leys. 

 Wuyts said the fact that Monday was the last day of the two-week forward trading period could lead to some selling pressure later in the day from investors needing to square long positions. 

 That meant the Belgian bourse might underperform neighbouring markets but would not necessarily drag it down into negative territory. 

 "It depends on how Wall Street opens and how (market) interest rates react during the day," he said. 

 * Wuyts said he expected an end to the free-fall in electronics group Barco , triggered by a profit warning on Thursday evening. He forecast Barco shares would stabilise around Friday's closing level of 122.00 euros. 

 But Maes predicted Barco's nose dive would continue. 

 "I think it could fall to below 115 to 120 (euros) for certain and start to stabilise around those levels," Maes said. 

 He did not expect Barco shares to recover for at least six months. ((Gillian Handyside, Brussels newsroom +32 2 287 6810, fax +32 2 230 7710, belgium.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 The two are well-known for their volunteer efforts, and the breadth of organizations they have touched is apparent in the list of organizations sponsoring the invitation-only event: Afro-American Cultural Center, ASC, Central Piedmont Community College, the Charlotte Chamber, Davidson College, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Education Foundation, Foundation for the Carolinas, Johnson C. Smith University, Presbyterian Healthcare and University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 

 "These are all organizations that either Hellena or Isaiah or both of them, in most cases, have been very involved in over the years," said Scott Belford, ASC spokesman. 

 Brazil is ramping up for a big push to expand its furniture exports. A group of government representatives came to the heart of the U.S. furniture industry in June to tap the expertise of Ingeborg Hegenbart, SouthTrust Bank's International Woman of Action (not her official title). 

 "Brazil exports $400 million a year (in furniture), but only 12 percent goes to the U.S.," says the SouthTrust vice president, who says Brazil wants to boost exports to $2.3 billion by 2003. 

 The Brazilian delegation was led by Jeff Holmes, a former international sales manager for Broyhill whom Hegenbart knew way back in 1980 when she was working as a consultant to the furniture manufacturer. In addition to their discussions with Hegenbart, the group also visited extensively with several furniture retailers, Hegenbart says. 

 Hegenbart and the group lunched at Patou French Bistro, the Park Road restaurant where, says Hegenbart, "I have my own table." 

 Melvin Tennant, president and CEO of the Charlotte Convention & Visitors Bureau, arrived home from a business trip July 2 to find 40 pink flamingos adorning his front lawn ... birthday greetings from his former secretary, Terry Nelson. 

 Nelson, who left her job at the CCVB after her husband was transfered to Memphis, says she just wanted to help Tennant over the hump. "This is his big Four-Oh," says Nelson. "He was kind of whining about it and I told him I didn't want to hear it because my last one was the big one." 

 As somebody who's been there and done that, the Big I can only say: We feel your pain, Melvin. 

 And by the way, where does one find 40 flamingos for a birthday greeting? This being relationship-oriented Charlotte and all, Nelson first contacted the folks at A Basket O' Carolina, who did a lot of gift baskets for her when she was at the CCVB. They referred her to Charlotte Arrangements, which put her in touch with Extravaganza Events & Props, an event planner/prop house off Mint Street that claims it's prepared to handle birthdays requiring up to 100 flamingos. 

 Mark Middlesworth, owner of 2{-year-old Extravaganza, says his company supplies props for events but also is building its own events planning business. The six-person outfit had a hand in Bank of America's name-change gala last Tuesday at Founders Hall, where the Big Bank bid adieu to the NationsBank moniker with a 40-by-18-foot B of A banner, 35-foot red, white, and blue air tubes, confetti cannons and "all kinds of pyrotechnics going off." 

 No flamingos, we're told. 

 Charlotte didn't get the 2000 Republican National Convention, but the Queen City will get some hotel bookings out of the deal anyway, as it turns out. 

 Seems the National Association of Miniature Enthusiasts -- yup, the acronym is NAME -- was booked into the Adam's Mark Hotel in Philadelphia for its August 2000 convention. But the hotel had a clause in the contract that allowed it to cancel the reservation in the event the GOP picked Philly to host its big bash. 

 "They bagged our convention," says Bob Hastings, a Charlottean who serves on NAME's board. 

 What to do? The folks at the Adam's Mark in Charlotte were more than happy to accommodate the NAME convention, says Hastings, who had been eager to bring the annual gathering of hobbyists to Charlotte. The convention is expected to draw about 1,200 collectors and makers of dollhouses and everything else miniature. 

 As Texas Banking Commissioner, Catherine Ghiglieri battled NationsBank's plans to fold its Texas bank into its holding company. Ghiglieri argued that the move would violate Texas' ban on interstate branching. NationsBank, now known as Bank of America, eventually prevailed in a case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court last year. 

 Now, Ghiglieri has left the government to form her own consulting firm, Ghiglieri & Co., in Austin. A recent mailing found its way to the Big I's desk. Among the services she pitches: crisis management, training programs and legislative consultation, though there is hardly a mention of her banking expertise. 

 And finally, the Big I acknowledges receipt of a fax from reader Bill Hensley congratulating us on avoiding any reference to Crutchfield & McColl in our July 5 column. Nothing against Ed and Hugh, but our astute reader points out there are plenty of "talented, intelligent, well-known business execs out there who were worthy of a little ink now and then." 

 We couldn't agree more, Bill. And sorry about that lead item at the top of today's column.

At year's halftime, market enjoys surprising lead

We're halfway through the year, and that marks a good time to check in on forecasts made just six months ago when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 9,181, yields on long-term government bonds were about 5 percent, and the smart money was saying the Dow and S&P 500 simply couldn't turn in another year of 20-plus percent gains.

Fast forward to the end of the first half, and you have the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes all reaching new highs, with the Dow nudging the 20 percent gain mark. Well, the year's not over yet, and who knows where the market indexes will finish, but the first-half action certainly has some pros revising their forecasts.

At the start of the year, index funds were all the rage. A series in this column detailed how only 13 percent of actively managed funds had beaten the S&P 500 index in the preceding year, and fewer than 25 percent had outperformed the 500 in the four preceding years. The case for indexing was clear, but the open question was: which index?

Some said it was time for the small companies to take their turn, and predicted that the lagging Russell 2000 index would finally take the lead. (It had lost 3.5 percent for all of 1998.) But at mid-year 1999 the average small-cap fund had gained only 8.35 percent, while the once-scorned Dow industrials had posted nearly twice the gain of the S&P 500.

Most surprising to many traditional analysts has been the continued outstanding performance of the Nasdaq index, which is dominated by a few large high-tech companies such as Microsoft. Year to date it's leading the race with a gain of about 26 percent as of Thursday. Just because an index is up doesn't mean all the stocks in it have participated at the same rate. Many small Internet companies have lost 50 percent or more of their market value, as reality adjusts from some element of hype.

Mutual funds held a few surprises of their own. The best performing fund group for the month of June was emerging market equity funds with a one-month gain of 11.40 percent, according to the Wiesenberger survey. This category has led the entire year with an increase of 33.23 percent since Jan. 1. But back in January many market forecasters were fearing a renewal of financial problems in emerging markets.

Stocks weren't the only investments that had a mind of their own this year - in contrast to the minds of the soothsayers. Oil started the year at the single-digit levels, drawing prediction of major oil company bankruptcies and global deflation. Instead at mid-year crude oil is trading around the $20-a-barrel level, double its January price.

Yet oil prices are not really signaling inflation. That's obvious from the prices of other raw materials and commodities. In fact, most metals and raw materials markets are mired in record low territory. Gold plunged to under $260 an ounce - a 20-year low - as the Bank of England deemed the metal to be no longer precious, and sold 25 tons of its stash. A reminder, though, that unlike most raw materials including grains and crude oil, gold is never really consumed. All the gold ever mined stillexists, somewhere, above ground or lost at sea.

Tremendous renewable supplies of grains such as corn and wheat can certainly offset the demand in a slowed-down world. Prices of grains hit a 27-year low in early July. Soybeans traded at $9 a bushel in 1997 and now are $4; corn was $5 a bushel and now farmers get just over $2. While Internet investors are prospering, farmers face financial woes unless the weather changes before harvest time.

So much for fears of the return of inflation. And that being the case, why did the Federal Reserve raise rates even a quarter of a point? Economist Bob Genetski points out that inflation fears are just one component of interest rates. The other driving force is economic growth - specifically productivity increases, which are now gaining 2 percent annually. That's good news for the business world, but it does create a demand for capital to invest in business, and a willingness to pay higher rates. The market actually led the Fed; 30-year bond yields are over 6 percent - up 1 full percentage point since last December.

The American farmer may be feeling the pain, but homebuilders, retailers and service businesses are reporting profits, and giving a boost to stock prices. General Electric, whose market capitalization is second only to Microsoft, recently reported that net income increased 15 percent - the highest quarterly profit in the company's history. The record came even as sales were $1.2 billion less than in the 1998 fourth quarter. Rising profits were attributed to productivity gains and cost cutting.after warning of unexpectedly low numbers. The current market rule: Disappoint on earnings, and you'll be destroyed.

On the global scene there was one more surprising event. The euro, which made its debut in January to much fanfare at nearly $1.20, dropped in value to just over parity. At $1.02 it marked a decline of more than 15 percent on fears of economic problems in Europe and the aftereffects of the Kosovo war.

Bottom line: The consensus of economic and market forecasters got it wrong in many areas for the first half of 1999. But, in all fairness, those were forecasts made for the year ahead, not for six months. This is only half-time. It's not over yet. Terry Savage is a personal-finance author based in Chicago.

Music, magazines, pots and pans: Experts watch as Starbucks grows and wonder if a good name can be stretched too far.

The way Karen Sack sees it, the growth and expansion pressures on Starbucks are typical of the demands Wall Street often puts on public companies.

"They've got to find ways to grow," says Sack, an analyst for S&P Equity Group in New York City. "They can't sit still. It's just too competitive. It's all a question of what their growth strategy is."

Uncertainty about that basic question caused Starbucks' stock price to sink more than 40 percent earlier this month after the company stunned investors with news of an expected $19 million revenue shortfall for 1999 and lower profit projections.

That news stung all the more because the company raised prices in May by an average of 10 cents a cup.

Starbucks cited overly optimistic retail revenue projections and $4 million in start-up costs for its developing Internet business.

Sack and other analysts, however, point to the missed projections and downward profit adjustment as warning signs that Starbucks might be heading in the wrong direction.

Many analysts say the larger question is whether Starbucks is risking too much by trying to extend its brand name to products and services beyond its core business of specialty coffee.

"I think it puts a cloud over the company, to some degree," Sack said. "Wall Street doesn't like uncertainty. Analysts start worrying that they're going too far afield. There's a lot of suspicion."

Some analysts, pointing to other retailers whose electronic commerce efforts have turned into financial black holes, say such uneasiness is not surprising or unwarranted.

But Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz insists the company's retail stores remain a top priority. He quickly adds, however, that the Internet offers significant potential for the company to expand globally and extend its brand beyond coffee.

"We have a significant opportunity to create a breakthrough Internet strategy in a multibillion-dollar, underserved category," Schultz said during a conference call last month with analysts and investors. "We're not just throwing up a Web site. We're not being cavalier about it. We're trying to build a long-term business here."

Schultz declined to be interviewed for this story. But during the June 30 conference call, he said the company's research has identified housewares, specialty foods and home furnishings as areas that together represent a $100 billion-a-year market, which Starbucks could begin to tap.

Starbucks' interest in those areas fueled speculation several weeks ago that the company was on the verge of acquiring national housewares retailer Williams-Sonoma. Both companies have declined comment.

But it's now expected that Starbucks will reveal details about its long-range Internet plans later this month. That is likely to include news of one or more partners with whom Starbucks would presumably co-market coffee, music, kitchenware, housewares, food and furniture.

Williams-Sonoma continues to be talked about as a possible partner. Microsoft also has been rumored as a potential manager of Starbucks' Internet operation. Some analysts believe that could happen because Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei sits on Starbucks' board.

Such alliances would make sense, following the recent investment by Starbucks and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in New York-based Oxygen Media, a network of Internet sites aimed at women.

The decision to pursue an Internet strategy is based on research suggesting that 70 percent of the 10 million customers who visit Starbucks' retail stores each week are affluent, computer-savvy consumers who would be attracted to a Starbucks' Web site. Once there, Starbucks is confident customers trust the Starbucks brand enough to purchase products besides coffee.

Scott Waltmann, an assistant vice president at Merrill Lynch in New York, said Schultz's ideas should not be discounted just because some stray from the core business.

"I do believe that most are looking at this in a simplistic fashion," Waltmann said. "If you're a retailer and you're not exploring e-commerce, you're behind the eight ball. (Schultz) definitely has a vision that he wants to translate, communicate to his customers. I think he's legitimately on to something here."

To prepare for its Internet push, Starbucks is forming a new subsidiary called Starbucks X, which will oversee the company's online endeavors, as well as other ventures such as its publishing partnership with Time Inc., its alliance with Internet chat provider Talk City, and its venture with Oxygen Media.

But Laurie Breidenbach, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle, said that while Starbucks' reputation and brand name remain largely unshaken in the Pacific Northwest, Wall Street sees the situation much differently.

In addition to its Internet expansion strategy and constantly growing retail operations, Starbucks also has other major partnerships with prominent companies, including Kraft Foods, Pepsi Cola, United Airlines, Starwood Hotels, former NBA star Earvin "Magic" Johnson, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream and others.

"Their core business is very strong (and) I think the idea of leveraging a brand is a good idea," Breidenbach said, but "that's a lot for one company to digest. It's hard for any company to do so many different things."

Laura Richardson, an analyst with Portland's Pacific Crest Securities, agrees with Breidenbach. But when Starbucks fully explains its Internet strategy and reveals the identities of its partners, investors' negative perceptions are likely to wane.

"We're all waiting for the strategy to unfold," Richardson said. "The pieces and alliances are yet to come."

Starbucks spokesman Alan Gulick said the company, which first began selling stock to the public seven years ago, has established a significant record of achievement by experimenting with sometimes unconventional ideas. He insists talk about the company being unfocused and undisciplined is off base.

" We have all the tools to play in the Internet arena," Gulick said. "Now we're taking the road less traveled again."

But analysts like Waltmann of Merrill Lynch say the company has some fence-mending to do.

"They've lost some confidence," Waltmann said. "They'll have to repair that."

Starbucks stock, after peaking in May at a record high of $41 a share, has fallen sharply in recent days, trading near its record lows in the mid-$20s.

Even so, the stock is off just 10 percent from its close at the end of 1998. Many analysts, including Waltmann of Merrill Lynch, continue to recommend it based on the company's track record of sound management, steady growth and profitability.

"I think this Internet approach will end up being a savvy, inventive, intelligent approach to building a brand," Waltmann said.

"In the long run, they always deliver."

 Millennium Odds Favor a Rebound for Casino Stocks

 Donald Trump knows how to bottom fish. In April, he scooped up $1 million in Trump Hotel and Casino Resorts Inc. shares for $3.75 to $4.48 apiece. 

 "From Donald's perspective, the stock is cheap," one analyst said of the 250,000-share buy. The same is true, apparently, for chief executive Nicholas Ribis, who picked up 24,000 shares at similar prices. 

 The stock commenced an upturn aided by an analyst's short-term "strong buy" recommendation that pushed it up to nearly $6.50 a share. It settled back down again before taking another bounce last week on word that Trump was near a refinancing of his massive debt. Still, at 6 1/16, the stock is a far cry from its 52-week high last July of $8.87. 

 Casino stocks, with a few exceptions, have been analysts' lament for a long time, despite considerable run-ups so far this year. Trump Hotels, whose stock is up 62 percent so far this year, is still down nearly 20 percent in the past 12 months. A newcomer, 7-month-old Park Place Entertainment, doesn't have to worry about 12-month results yet. The Hilton spinoff's recent $3 billion offer for Caesars has helped give its investors a year-to-date return of more than 70 percent. 

 But, analysts say, just wait until the millennium. 

 "Investors will get into this group (casinos) early in the fourth quarter, betting on a tremendous week in Las Vegas and into the next year," predicts Joseph Coccimiglio, gaming analyst for Prudential Securities Inc. in New York. "You'll see some pretty extraordinary results." 

 Merrill Lynch's Naomi R. Talish is in the same camp. 

 "Momentum will build in the third quarter as people begin getting excited about all the New Year's activities that we expect in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City," she said. 

 To Michael Pollock, publisher of Michael Pollock's Gaming Industry Observer, the optimism stems from several roots: 

 --The success of new mega-resorts in Las Vegas that so far contradicts gloomy predictions of an oversupply of rooms. 

 --A National Gambling Impact Study Commission report that is essentially favorable to casinos. 

 --The seeming resilience of the gaming markets in the face of new competition, coupled with a slowdown in the emergence of new casino destinations, such as Indian gaming in Connecticut and racetrack slots in Delaware. 

 "If anything," said Pollock, "Atlantic City is behind Las Vegas in terms of cause for optimism, but I see in the long term that the analysts view the fundamentals in Atlantic City as generally favorable." 

 Critical to the industry, and to investors, is the ability of the major Las Vegas properties to weather the explosion in room supply --to more than 120,000 -- and, like the Atlantic City properties, to cut costs and operate efficiently. 

 So far, so good, say Coccimiglio and Talish. 

 Bellagio, the $1.9 billion resort built by Steve Wynn's Mirage-Resorts Inc., opened last September and has been fully occupied since. 

 Mandalay Bay, the $950 million destination built by Circus-Circus, now Mandalay Resort Group, opened for Memorial Day to critical acclaim and popular acceptance. 

 The Venetian, a $1.4 billion Las Vegas resort built by entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson, is also deemed successful despite being plagued by delays and staggered openings. In addition, Park Place Entertainment Inc. is scheduled to open its $760 million Paris in September. 

 Those four properties alone add 12,655 rooms to the Las Vegas stock. 

 "This summer is somewhat of a test because Bellagio is upscale and tends to attract an upscale market," Coccimiglio says. "The heat may hurt. How hot it gets and how much it hurts is the question. 

 "Mandalay Bay is in a better position for summer family travel than Bellagio is, which may affect the relative attractiveness of the Mandalay group to Mirage at this point." 

 Merrill Lynch's Talish said that although Bellagio is doing well, Mandalay Bay is doing extremely well, and the existing properties --MGM Grand, Harrah's, Bally's and Mandalay's other mega-resort, the pyramid-shaped Luxor -- were also doing well. 

 Nowhere is all this more evident than in the companies' stock prices. 

 Mandalay's year-to-date return is 71 percent, one of the industry's best performers, though it's a somewhat less-attractive 18.8 percent for the past 12 months. Mirage's shares were up about 16 percent so far this year, until a profit warning this month knocked that gain down to 4.6 percent, for a 12-month return of minus 27.9 percent. An unkind cut for investors. Harrah's shares are up about 35 percent so far this year, but still down about 5 percent from a year ago. 

 What's an investor to do? 

 Prudential's Coccimiglio says investors can choose between two philosophies: investment in expansion as personified by Mirage-Resorts, which is using its cash flow to finance such projects as Bellagio in Las Vegas, Beau Rivage in Mississippi and the $1 billion Le Jardin in Atlantic City; or a philosophy of cost-cutting and debt reduction, as both Park Place Entertainment and Harrah's Entertainment and, most likely, Mandalay will do for the foreseeable future. 

 Mirage will be spending in excess of $1 billion on Le Jardin in Atlantic City, plus it will participate with Boyd Gaming in the adjacent $750 million Borgata, but Mandalay, Park Place and Harrah's are most likely to buy back stock or pay down their debt, Coccimiglio said. 

 "It looks so far that the market is preferring the paydown strategy. They really punished Mirage's stock and that pretty much reinforces that investors want to get rewarded now in the short term rather than invest in a long-term project that takes a long time to build," he said. 

 Talish, too, is optimistic for the group. 

 "The companies are focused on improving their balance sheets," she said. 

 There is, Pollock says, reason for such optimism. 

 The trend for the casino companies is to control operating costs, cut down on promotional expenses and, in general, get more out of each dollar spent, from payroll to purchases, he said. 

 Consider Trump's casino empire. It uses its subsidiary, Trump Casino Services, to provide consolidated services, including human resources, payroll, and purchasing. By executive vice president Robert Piccus' calculation, that saves the company about $32 million a year. 

 Yet, until very recently, Trump's stock lagged. Why? 

 The conventional Wall Street wisdom was that the company, with $1.84 billion in long-term notes, was simply too deeply in debt. Trump's empire financed its various casino expansions through high-yield bonds, with interest rates as high as 15.5 percent. 

 That seemingly changed -- as witnessed by a one-day jump of 33 percent in its stock price on Thursday -- because of two things: a focused move by Trump to reduce the company's indebtedness and market expectations of an increase in cash flow. 

 Wall Street's interest was further piqued, although somewhat negatively, when Trump announced Friday that the company would close the World's Fair casino -- saving another $13 million to $15 million in annual losses -- and replace it with a new $750 million gaming hall on land quietly acquired near Convention Hall. 

 At the June meeting of New Jersey's Casino Control Commission, CEO Ribis blew away two other options analysts thought Trump had: selling the company or buying back the stock and taking it private. 

 Some analysts suggested that a sale, a move that failed to generate any interest a year ago because of the company's $1.8 billion debt, could work now because of the consolidation sweeping the industry, an increase in casino stocks in general and Trump's in particular, and the attractive placement of Trump's three properties in the nation's second-largest gambling venue. 

 Park Place Entertainment, for example, is paying $3 billion for Caesars, the analysts note, a price most agree is top dollar even for a prime acquisition. 

 Anything in this volatile industry is possible, observers say, but whether Trump could get even $1.8 billion for his casino empire, let alone more, remains to be seen. 

 But with his latest moves, Trump seems to be taking that option off the table, too. 

 In a statement Friday, Trump, in his typically flamboyant style, had this to say: 

 "Clearing away the World's Fair will give us the flexibility to develop the kind of world-class signature property that has made the Trump Organization the dominant developer in New York. 

 "We are going to bring the magic of Manhattan to the Boardwalk."

 WALL Street stocks squeezed out moderate gains last night aftert spending much of the session in the red, writes Douglas Hamilton. 

 Analysts said a profit warning from Waste Management and investor disappointment over aluminium giant Alcoa's earnings weighed on Big Board prices for much of the day. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average shook off some of the jitters in late trading and closed 52.24 points firmer at 11,187.36. 

 "The market was a bit on the nervous side because of the Waste Management news," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice-president at Fahnestock & Company, a leading brokerage. "The other disappointment is the Alcoa action." 

 Ackerman said the market was awaiting consumer and producer price data due out next week. 

 Waste Management led the New York Stock Exchange's most-active list, dropping sharply after the company said late on Tuesday that it will not meet Wall Street's second-quarter and full-year earnings targets because of lower-than-expected revenues from its North American operations. 

 Shares in Alocoa, the world's biggest alumiumn producer, skidded after the company reported second-quarter earnings per share of 64 cents against 62 cents in the same period a year earlier. 

 The figure beat an earnings estimate from First Call - a Wall Street firms that measures corprate performances - by a penny. But one analyst said Alcoa had been expected to beat the published consensus, with some Wall Street observers forecasting that Alcoa could earn as much as 69 cents per share in the second quarter. 

 "That was the whisper number," said Chuck Bradford at Bradford Research. "They didn't beat that. ".

 MARKET SAVVY Profit Warnings Hit Companies' Stocks Earnings: Waste Management, Sterling Commerce and Airborne are among the casualties.

 A barrage of corporate warnings Wednesday about weak earnings hammered the stocks involved, but Wall Street still views second-quarter profit disappointments as the exception, not the rule. 

 The casualties list Wednesday included garbage firm Waste Management, drug distributor Bergen Brunswig, software firm Sterling Commerce and shipper Airborne Freight. 

 Even so, earnings tracker First Call said the number of companies that have warned of weaker-than-expected quarterly results totaled just 239 as of Wednesday morning--down from 379 in the first quarter and 493 a year ago. 

 Chuck Hill, research chief at First Call in Boston, said the trend still suggests that second-quarter earnings overall will be robust. Analysts now expect an 11.3% year-over-year gain, on average, for major blue-chip firms. Final results could be closer to 15%, he said. 

 Still, that won't help investors caught in these stocks Wednesday: 

 * Waste Management suffered the biggest one-day hit, plunging $19.63 to close at $33.94--a 37% decline on huge trading volume of 70 million shares--after it said second-quarter profit will disappoint because of a $250-million revenue shortfall in North America. 

 The company gave no explanation, fueling concerns about its leadership, analysts said. Chief Executive John Drury is recovering from surgery for brain cancer. 

 "They've been aggressive in increasing their prices," said Edward Okine, an analyst with Forum Capital Markets who rates the stock a "buy." "Some of their customers must have gone on to their competitors." 

 The firm said second-quarter earnings before merger-related costs will be 67 cents to 70 cents a share, up from 41 cents a year earlier but down from the 78 cents analysts had expected. 

 Worse, the company said sales weakness will "similarly impact future quarters." It sees full-year earnings of $2.65 to $2.70 a share, versus expectations of $3.01.

 Thai Stock Prices Tumble 2% on Profit-Taking; Other Asian Markets Fall, but Seoul Bucks Trend

 Stock prices in Thailand tumbled 2%, prompted by profit-taking after a blistering first half and lingering concerns about the much-maligned banking sector. 

 Most other Asian markets also declined, though South Korean stocks bucked the trend as the benchmark index closed above the 1000 mark for the first time since October 1995. 

 Stock prices fell on most major European markets, too, dragged down by technology and telecommunications shares. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.02, or 0.01%, to 224.54. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.77, or 0.48%, to 161.08. 

 Thailand, the country that ignited the Asian financial crisis two years ago, has been at the forefront of the region's return to financial health: The stock market is up nearly 45% this year following some aggressive corporate restructuring and a reduction in Thailand's crippling foreign-debt levels. 

 As if to underscore Bangkok's new desire for financial independence, some officials now advocate paying off the $17.2 billion loan package to the International Monetary Fund ahead of the June 2000 schedule. 

 But with second-quarter bank earnings due at the end of the month, the market is braced for new evidence that, despite progress, the banking crisis may not have bottomed out yet. 

 "I still think there's a long way to go," cautions Marc Halperin, portfolio manager of the Federated Global Financial Services Fund in New York. "Nonperforming loans have decelerated but they're still going up. I don't think they will peak until sometime during the second half of this year." 

 The Thai central bank's decision on July 2, 1997, to abandon the baht's peg to the U.S. dollar led to a plunge in the currency, marking the start of the Asian financial crisis. At the time, Thailand was running a current-account deficit that amounted to nearly 8% of its gross domestic product, and its bank credit exceeded 100% of GDP. 

 Since then, about 430 billion baht in bad loans, or around 16% of total bad loans, have been restructured and several of the small to midsize banks have been nationalized. The current account this year is now projected to be in surplus by an amount equal to 8% of GDP. 

 But as the government looks to reprivatize the banks, success has been mixed. Recently, all bank shares came under pressure after the central bank said it would reopen the bidding for a majority stake in Nakornthon Bank, throwing into doubt Standard Charter's plan to buy it. 

 Yesterday, however, central bank governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul indicated that takeover talks between the United Kingdom and the Thai banks have resumed. 

 Even so, the Thai banking sector fell 2.69%, pushing down the SET Index 10.71 to 516.11. Some of the best-known banks that have led the stock-market recovery did worse. Thai Farmers Bank shares fell 5% to 110 baht, while Bangkok Bank shares were down 8% to 124 baht. 

 While the share prices of these banks have doubled since the beginning of the year, they have declined recently and nervous investors continue to take profits before their quarterly earnings are released late this month. 

 "The restructuring is about half done," says Scott MacDonald, chief economist for KWR International, a New York economics-research firm. "The big banks are strong enough to survive, but the process of recapitalization is going gradually." 

 In South Korea, meanwhile, the Kospi closed at 1005.98, up 16.55. The Kospi crossed 900 less than a week ago, has already increased 79% from last year's closing of 562.46, and has more than doubled from this year's low of 498.42. 

 "As the market passes 1000, there is a feeling that it's because of a fundamental change and not just abundant cash," says Choo Hee Yeop, a strategist at Dongwon Securities in Seoul. 

 He points out that the government was actively supporting small and midsize venture companies rather than large business conglomerates, which are blamed for the economic crisis. Mr. Choo also says that unlike previous rallies before the economic crisis, this rally wasn't fueled by borrowed money -- credit to speculative individual investors has become much tighter since the crisis. 

 Koh Won Jong, head of research at Nomura Securities in Seoul, said that although the market is buoyed by expectations for increased profit at local companies, in many cases the increase comes from the low cost of financing debtthanks to low interest rates, which hover around the 8% level. Three-year corporate-bond yields, a benchmark for long-term interest rates, closed at 7.85% yesterday. Mr. Koh says once inflation starts to pick up and interest rates rise, earnings could start to fall again. 

 Seoul was up 0.7% in late-morning trading Thursday. 

 In TOKYO Wednesday, the Nikkei 225 Index fell 91.83, or 0.5%, to 17958.90 as profit-taking struck again. Big blue-chip names were off recent highs, but there was buying in some sectors that have lagged behind the broad index. The construction sector gained 1.3%, while Magara Construction was up 11% to 379 yen. Toshiba shares fell 10 yen to 940 yen after news it will buy International Business Machines' stake in a joint venture the companies established in 1996. 

 Tokyo had risen 0.4% at the close of Thursday's morning session. 

 In HONG KONG Wednesday, the Hang Seng Index slid 115.17, or 0.8%, to 14257.44. Share placements by two blue chips pressured the market. Cable & Wireless HKT shares fell 6.5% to 20.20 Hong Kong dollars after China Telecom sold a 1.3% stake in the company for 3.15 billion Hong Kong dollars. Shares of China Resources Enterprises were off 8.4% to 14.15 Hong Kong dollars after it placed 137.1 million new shares at 13.85 Hong Kong dollars. 

 The Hong Kong market had regained 0.9% in early trading Thursday. 

 In LONDON Wednesday, the FTSE 100 Index closed down 23.2, or 0.4%, at 6597.40 after setting a new high during the previous session. Granada shares closed up 4.7% at 662.5 pence, while Carlton Communications shares climbed 4.7% to 570 pence. The media companies' shares rose in anticipation of good subscriber figures today from their jointly owned digital-TV service ONDigital. Shares in BSkyB, which owns the rival Sky Digital service, dropped 11 pence, or 1.8%, to 595 pence. 

 In FRANKFURT, the Xetra DAX fell 24.40, or 0.4%, to 5588.50. SAP preferred shares fell 4.9% to 392.13 euros on talk that the company might issue a profit warning. "This rumor is at play every single quarter," a spokesman said. SAP will release its second-quarter and first-half earnings July 20. RWE shares dropped 2.6% to 45.30 euros. 

 In PARIS, the CAC 40 fell 30.31, or 0.7%, to 4662.20. With no response from Elf Aquitaine to TotalFina's 42 billion euro unsolicited takeover bid, shares in the two oil companies fell on profit-taking. Elf was down 1.1% to 178.90 euros, while Total shares fell 2.6% to 13 euros.

 HCR Manor Care Shares Slide 17% In Wake Of  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of HCR Manor Care Inc. tumbled Wednesday on the heels of the company's earnings warning and an analyst downgrade. 

 Citing the delay in closing the sales of its assisted-living properties, the health-care provider late Tuesday said it expects to post less-than-expected earnings. 

 The company said it would report earnings of between 30 cents a share and 35 cents a share before gains and charges. The mean estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by First Call was for earnings, excluding items, of 44 cents a share. In the year-ago period, HCR (HCR) posted earnings of 32 cents a share. 

 Wednesday, brokerage Raymond James cut HCR to "accumulate" from "buy," compounding the stock's difficulties. 

 At the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, HCR Manor Care's shares were down $4.125, or 17%, at $20.375 in active trading. 

 The company said lower revenue and higher training and transition costs, facility-marketing expenses, development costs, start-up losses, system conversions and other merger-integration expenses also hurt earnings for the second quarter. 

 The company is still evaluating April and May results and will report second-quarter earnings Aug. 2. 

 Separately, HCR Manor Care said it sold 14 of its assisted-living projects to third-party joint-venture companies, and 21 residences were either sold to Alterra Healthcare Corp. (ALI) or placed in escrow awaiting funding. 

 HCR Manor said proceeds from the sale of the 21 sites to Alterra sale would be about $140 million. The sales to Altera are part of an asset-sale deal covering 28 assisted-living facilities. Closing on the seven other assisted living residences are pending final regulatory, financing or construction completion approval. 

 Those closings are expected in the third quarter. When all sales are completed, HCR Manor expects total proceeds of about $200 million.

 THINGS have been a bit dismal of late at the Iomega Corporation, the maker of Zip, Jaz and other data storage units and computer disk drives. The stock of Iomega, a full-fledged member of the former highflier club, traded at $27 three years ago. On Friday, it closed at $4.6875, down 36 percent for the year. 

 The company made a big splash selling relatively inexpensive add-on disk drives for personal computers. Now, though, Iomega's offerings have lost some allure. The company -- which had most of the market for high-capacity, portable disk drives -- faces rampant competition, and new computers come with so much memory installed that consumers need less of the extra storage today that Zip and Jaz disks provide. Zip drives, which sold for $200, now fetch around $79. 

 On June 18, Iomega said it expected to report a shortfall in earnings for its second quarter and to post a loss of between 5 cents and 10 cents a share. Its revenues have dropped from earlier quarters, and Iomega attributed the decline to continued weakness in sales of its Jaz line and to a component shortage that led to lower-than-expected sales of Zip drives. Iomega also said it would lay off almost 10 percent of its staff and take a restructuring charge of $45 million. 

 Jodie K. Glore, president of Iomega, said the restructuring charge would probably improve results at the company. Iomega hopes that its new Clik drive, an almost paper-thin storage disk designed for notebook computers, will revive sales. 

 The lone ray of sunshine in this gloomy picture comes from two Wall Street analysts who currently recommend buying Iomega. John Dean at Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of Citigroup, rates the stock 1-S, the firm's most aggressive buy. The ''S'' stands for speculative. In the wake of the company's profit warning, Mr. Dean cut his 12-month target price on Iomega's stock to $9 from $11, but he said the company still offered a long-term payoff. 

 Daniel Kunstler at J. P. Morgan Securities also likes the stock. Last April, Mr. Kunstler reduced his recommendation from outright ''buy'' to what he calls a long-term buy, presumably warning investors that a rebound at the company might take some time. No other big-name Wall Street firms are currently recommending Iomega shares. 

 Normally, any break in the me-too analysis emanating from big brokerage firms is welcome. It isn't often, after all, that Wall Street offers a contrarian view on a company like the one Mr. Dean and Mr. Kunstler have taken on Iomega. 

 But before they win plaudits for independent thought, one detail is worth noting. Last year, Iomega replaced its credit line of $60 million with a $150 million line that expires next year, secured by company inventories. The lead bankers on the financing are J. P. Morgan Securities and Citicorp Securities. 

 Representatives of J. P. Morgan Securities and Citigroup say it is strictly a coincidence that they, Iomega's lead bankers, are also the only major firms currently recommending its stock. But if Iomega decides to raise money in the equity markets anytime soon, would anyone be surprised if one or both of these firms won the job of underwriting an Iomega offering? 

 One other question: Is this what Congress has in mind as it moves to knock down the barriers between investment banking and commercial lending once and for all? 

 Graph: Some Say 'Buy' The graph shows the weekly closes for Iomega Corporation since January 1999.

 NEW YORK MARKET - Stocks rally as Fed decides to wait and see.

 WITH the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate increase out of the way, money managers see a summer rally and more new highs for US stocks after their best week since October 1988. "It's off to the races again," said Henry Cavanna, fund manager at JP Morgan. "Everyone knew the Fed would raise rates, and the concern was it might do more. But it said the best possible thing by removing the bias [to tighten]." 

 The surprise announcement that the Fed would wait for fresh evidence of accelerating inflation before raising rates again means investors will focus on earnings in coming weeks. Mr Cavanna sees a broad-based rally. 

 Stocks may even have their best rally since the summer of 1989; the only time in the last decade that the S&P 500 index gained 10 per cent between Independence Day and the Labor Day weekend in September. 

 And although the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all touched new highs last week, with "investors willing to see improvement in forward earnings", Mr Cavanna is optimistic that there are more records ahead. 

 For the week, the Dow industrials rose 5.6 per cent, closing at a record 11,139.24 on Friday, after advancing for six straight days. The S&P 500 jumped 5.8 per cent, and the Nasdaq climbed 7.4 per cent. All three indexes had their highest percentage gains in any week since last October. 

 US equity markets will be closed on Monday for Independence Day. 

 Analysts are forecasting that profit for companies in the S&P 500 will rise 11.4 per cent in the second quarter. That would be the highest growth rate in almost two years. "We are through most of the earnings-warning period, and we are moving into the actual reporting period," said Joseph Stock, manager at Meridian Investment. "Looks like we will come through reasonably well." 

 Although interest rate concerns eased last week, investors will watch each new economic release for signs of inflation just the same. While the Fed has moved to a neutral bias, some money managers aren't ruling out more rate increases this year. 

 "Every number is important," said Joseph Williams, manager at Commerce Bank. "In the long term, we remain negative and believe rates will move higher. With world economic growth, the US economy won't slow on this one quarter-point rate increase."

 A SHARP rise in bond yields - which saw the benchmark 30 year long bond yield jump to 6.04 per cent - cancelled out most of the enthusiasm generated by the overnight decision on interest rates and monetary policy. A rise in the index of manufacturing activity raised some fears of further rate rises but a bullish outlook for corporate earnings helped the Dow Jones to a 44 point gain by midday. Nasdaq also advanced. AOL, MCI WorldCom and C-COR Electronics gained but coffee chain Starbucks fell following a profit warning.

 US Shares Higher In London; Pft Warning Hits Starbucks

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--U.S. shares are higher in London-based trading Thursday, although shares in Starbucks Corp. are taking a beating after Wednesday's profit warning. 

 Late Wednesday, the U.S. coffee retailer said it expects to report fiscal 1999 earnings of 54 cents a share, below analysts' 60-cent a share estimate. 

 Starbucks' shares, which sank in after hours trading Wednesday, were down $11 in London at $26-7/16, having closed on Wall Street Wednesday at $37-9/16. 

 A market maker at Instinet said he expects the Dow Jones Industrial Average to open higher this session although he doesn't discount the potential for profit-taking. 

 Wednesday, the DJIA climbed 155.45 points, or 1.4%, to 10970.80 points, after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates by 25 basis points and not the 50 basis points some had feared. 

 "It was such a strong move (Wednesday) that profit-taking is a possibility, although we did see some profit-taking just ahead of the Fed's announcement on interest rates," the market maker said. 

 But he said he expects any pullback to be met with fresh buying, after the Federal Open Market Committee's switch back to a neutral bias on interest rates soothed market sentiment. 

 At 1200 GMT, the S&P 500 September futures contract was up 2.50 at 1384.20 and U.S. 30-year treasury bonds were down 16/32 at 89-20/32 with a yield of 6.001%. 

 AOL shares were up $2 at $112-1/2 in London, after the company said it will give away free personal computers to its CompuServe Internet subscribers.

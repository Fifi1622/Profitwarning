Scramble for Vodafone as blue chips retreat - Stock Market.

VODAFONE demonstrated its newly expanded grip on the London market yesterday as institutional investors scrambled to buy stock in the heavyweight mobile phone operator while simultaneously selling baskets of leading shares.

Vodafone completed its merger with AirTouch of the US yesterday and starts trading today as a single entity that accounts for 6 per cent of the value of the entire FTSE 100.

Dealing in the stock dominated the market, with 180 million shares - or around 25 per cent of all trading in blue chips - changing hands.

The combined effect of the related programme trading, together with continued nervousness on US interest rates, sent the market sharply lower, with the FTSE 100 closing down 98.6 points at 6,307.1. Second-line stocks were protected from the brunt of the sell-off, with the FTSE 250 finishing the session 17.8 points weaker at 5,851.4.

Once again, banks were high among the casualties, with Bank of Scotland 34 1/2p weaker at 843 1/2p, Royal Bank of Scotland 45p adrift at #12.75 and NatWest 47p worse at #13.54.

Blue Circle, off 23p at 431 3/4p, led the FTSE 100 fallers as it continued to feel the after-effects of its gloomy trading statement on Monday. The stock has lost more than 8 per cent of its value since rejoining the blue chip index last week, and at this rate appears a strong candidate to drop out once more.

Tobacco stocks also lost their puff after bearish comments on Monday evening from the US group Philip Morris. Geoffrey Bible, chief executive, said in a meeting with analysts that international tobacco volumes would be down on last year while this year's profits will be flat. Though there is little direct correlation between the fortunes of the US group and its UK rivals, sentiment on the sector suffered, with BAT shedding 17 1/2p at 593 1/2p, Imperial Tobacco 18 1/2p worse at 717 1/2p and Gallaher 7 1/2p off at 392 1/2p.

Among those heading the other way, BOC Group, the industrial gases company, firmed 13p to 1225p on a suggestion that Air Liquide, its French rival, had made a new takeover approach. Although those close to BOC, Air Liquide and Air Products of the US all deny that talks have resumed, investors see the situation as a stand-off that is likely to end with BOC losing its independence.

A bullish note from Dresdner Kleinwort Benson helped Orange, the mobile phone operator, up 19p at 924p. The broker reckons the company has been overlooked by investors in favour of Vodafone and rates the stock a buy, with a share price target of #12.00.

Royal & SunAlliance, the composite insurer tipped as the subject of a #10bn approach from CGU, managed to advance 10p to 572 1/2p despite confusing signals from brokers.

Warburg Dillon Read has reiterated its buy advice and set a 700p price target, claiming that talk of a bid has put increased pressure on RSA's management to deliver value to shareholders.

Goldman Sachs is also bullish, but HSBC Securities has cut the stock from add to hold in the belief that a bid is unlikely to emerge.

Among retail stocks, Storehouse resumed its rise, adding 14 1/2p to 141 1/2p, as dealers shrugged off Monday's denials of a bid from Debenhams and suggested the company was still very much in play.

Elsewhere in the FTSE 250, Williams, the security and fire protection group, slid a further 16 3/4p to 406 1/4p on a report that its talks with Tyco International have run into trouble.

SEP Industries, the engineer which returned from suspension on Monday after admitting an accounting error had blown a hole in its figures, perked up 2 1/2p to 8 1/2p as bargain hunters sniffed around the stock.

But gloom continued to prevail among its mid-cap rivals, with Senior leading the FTSE 250 down as it fell a further 10 1/2p to 130 1/2p after last week's profit warning. This time the damage could be traced to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, which has cut its rating from hold to reduce.

TT Group, which warned of below-par interims on Monday, lost a further 2p to 131 1/2p, despite an upgrade from Merrill Lynch.

Further down the market Surrey Group, the bookmaker, ticked up 1/4p to 2p on volumes of nearly 5 million shares in anticipation of an announcement from the company later this week.

GILT-EDGED: UK government bonds failed to find direction ahead of the US interest rate decision. The largest advances were posted by five-year issues, which rebounded from recent underperformance.

At Liffe, the September gilt future closed 18p ahead at #110.95 on volumes of 33,000 contracts. In the cash market, Treasury 7 per cent 2002 added 18p at #104.24, with Treasury 8 per cent 2021 losing 5p to #141.97.

NEW YORK: Stocks closed sharply higher after a big drop in new home sales calmed Wall Street's jitters about interest rate rises. The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 160.20 at 10,815.35.

 MCI WorldCom sinks with growth fears.

 NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - Shares in MCI WorldCom Inc.  fell in heavy trading on Wednesday amid worries about revenue growth at the No. 2 U.S. long-distance company. 

 MCI WorldCom was off $6.31 at $88.31 in early afternoon dealings, rising a bit from a loss of almost $7. 

 The shares were the most active on the Nasdaq stock market. Almost 33 million shares had changed hands, almost four times normal daily levels, by early afternoon. 

 Analysts said the shares were hurt by comments from PaineWebber analyst Eric Strumingher, who trimmed his estimate for year-over-year consolidated revenue growth for the second quarter to a range of 16 to 16.5 percent from 17.2 percent. 

 MCI WorldCom posted growth of 17 percent in the first quarter. 

 In a report, Strumingher blamed weaker-than-expected growth in the domestic voice sector for the cut in his forecast. 

 He maintained his estimate for second-quarter earnings at 45 cents per share but said, "We don't see much potential for upside to this estimate." 

 According to First Call Corp., which tracks earnings forecasts, analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the quarter is 44 cents a share. 

 One of the factors hurting MCI WorldCom was a profit warning late Monday from Frontier Corp. , the No. 5 long-distance company. Frontier cited price erosion and loss of a British wholesale customer. 

 Simon Flannery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the Frontier announcement could presage a long-distance price war among telecommunications companies. 

 Polina Ialamova, an analyst at Madison Securities in Chicago, said she had also shaved her estimate for revenue growth in MCI WorldCom's core communications services, to more than 17 from more than 18 percent. 

 However, she also said margins likely would improve. 

 "A large chunk of revenues would be coming from higher-margin areas like Internet data and international revenues," she said. 

 Analysts said MCI WorldCom shares likely were not affected by news that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating possible anti-competitive practices in the undersea cable industry. 

 The probe focuses on a trans-Pacific consortium of more than 30 companies, including MCI WorldCom. ((-New York technology desk, (212) 859-1730)).

 FOCUS-Reckitt shares fall as costs rise.

 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - Shares in British household goods company Reckitt & Colman Plc fell for the second day on Tuesday as analysts cut profit forecasts by around 10 percent in the wake of a briefing with the company. 

 Acting Chief Executive Mike Turrell said he had told analysts that the group expected the cost of cutting stock levels in 1999 to be around 10 million pounds ($15.82 million) higher than initially estimated. 

 Turrell, who has taken the reins since the abrupt departure of Vernon Sankey in February, said Reckitt now expected the costs of trimming stocks to be nearer 40 million pounds. 

 He also told Reuters that Reckitt would spend 15 million pounds to defend the market share of its Lysol disinfectant in the competitive United States against planned new products from its arch-rival Clorox Co. 

 Analysts promptly trimmed estimates for 1999 pre-tax profits to around 190-195 million pounds from between 210 and 220 million pounds, sending the company's shares 2.4 percent lower to close at 679.5p - extending Monday's 3.8 percent fall. 

 The downgrades were the latest blow to the shares, which were hit last November by a shock profit warning. 

 But Turrell remained unperturbed. "I am comfortable with those new forecasts," he told Reuters. 

 In March, the company announced a radical cost-cutting plan to cut overheads, trim stock levels and halt costly promotions as it unveiled a 11.4 percent slide in its 1998 underlying pre-tax profits to 265.4 million pounds. 

 Amid market talk of management problems in Latin America, Turrell conceded that there had been "inappropriate behaviour" by some managers at its Mexico unit to boost sales. "They built up big sales to reach their targets at any given period, which were then returned to the company in the shape of credits," he said, adding that the company was also looking into its Argentine management practices. 

 The company has said it hopes to name a chief executive by August 4, when it publishes half year results. ((London newsroom +44 171 542 5106, fax +44 171 542 2120, uk.equities.news@reuters.com)).

 LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks in London drifted in early trading on Tuesday as investors searched for reasons to buy but held back owing to uncertainties concerning a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates, dealers said. 

 "Everyone's waiting for any comment regarding the meeting, but no statement is likely until tomorrow so trading has been quiet," said a dealer. 

 "People are also watching their screens to see if there is an uptick in the bonds market, possibly from short-covering, which would induce buying in the stock market," he added. 

 Stocks expected to make a rebound on any buying spree may come from the recently beaten down drugs, technology and financial sectors, dealers said. 

 By 1036 GMT, September S&P futures on Globex had slipped 1.5 points to 1,342.5 and fair value was estimated at 1,343.54, indicating a cautious start for the Dow. 

 Shares of tobacco company Philip Morris  weakened slightly on light volume following Monday's announcement that 1999 earnings would be about two cents below expectations although its business segments were strong. 

 The stock was bid at $39-3/4 and the offer price was $40. On Monday, the stock closed at $41. 

 Disk drive maker Seagate Technology Inc.  fell $6-58 to $23, again on light volume in reaction to Monday's profit warning announcement. 

 The company expects fourth quarter earnings to be between 32 to 37 cents a share compared with earlier expectations of 49 cents. The company expects to announce fourth quarter results on July 15.

 Golden State Vintners Issues  Profit Warning

 GREENBRAE, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Golden State Vintners Inc. late Monday warned it expects to post fourth-quarter and 1999 earnings below analysts' estimates, citing a reduced grape harvest and softness in bulk wine sales. 

 In addition, the Greenbrae, Calif.-based wine concern announced it hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise it on strategic alternatives. 

 The company said it expects to record earnings for 1999 of between 70 cents and 75 cents a share. The mean estimate of three analysts surveyed by First Call was for net income of about seven cents a share in the fourth quarter and 99 cents a share for the year. 

 However, Golden State Vintners said it is reviewing inventory costing methodology to minimize variations and improve earnings visibility. The company said it expects to complete the review in coming weeks, and announce possible earnings projection changes with its fourth-quarter earnings report. 

 Golden State Vintners attributed its lower earnings to a reduction in the California grape harvest that cut processing volume and lower spot market wine sales. The company also said a softness in the pricing and volume of its bulk wine sales reduced earnings. 

 The company (VINT) said it is reviewing projected earnings for 2000, and expects current bulk wine inventory to allow "additional incremental sales" next year. 

 For 1998 Golden State earned $4.2 million, or 41 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $112 million. However, that included $11 million in charges.

 Atiq vs. Goliath: Advanced Micro Bets (Again) That a Chip Will Be Its Salvation --- Fresh  Profit Warning  Signals Intel Still Calls the Shots With  Cut -Throat Pricing --- Can Mr. Raza Change AMD?

 SUNNYVALE, California -- Atiq Raza may have the toughest job in Silicon Valley. 

 The president and chief operating officer of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is charged with rallying his troops to attack the nearly impenetrable fortress of industry leader Intel Corp. In case you haven't heard, the battle is going badly. 

 AMD announced Wednesday that losses will be far worse than expected for the second quarter, in another sign that Intel's most potent counter-weapon, price-cutting, is taking a withering toll on AMD. 

 But the battle is not only an external one. Mr. Raza, a 50-year-old Pakistani engineer who arrived in the U.S. with $3,000 (2,900 euros) in his pocket in 1979, is heir apparent to an industry legend whose legacy needs changing. 

 Under W. J. "Jerry" Sanders III, a 62-year-old super salesman who drives Bentleys and lives in a mansion near Beverly Hills, AMD has repeatedly come up with promising chip designs only to stumble in manufacturing them. Mr. Raza's job is to deliver on yet another of Mr. Sanders' promises. He is pushing his team to churn out a chip called the Athlon, previously known as the K7, which is expected to take the speed crown from Intel -- and maybe save the company. 

 "My hopes for AMD are higher than ever," says Keith Diefendorff, an analyst at Micro Design Resources. "But only if they can figure out how to manufacture the thing." 

 Besides AMD, National Semiconductor Corp. is the only other significant Intel rival in the market, and it already is planning to head for the exit. That means that if AMD can't recover from its own mistakes, the consequences for the computer industry will be huge: Computer makers will have to rely on Intel for most of their chips and consumers will pay higher prices and wait longer for innovations. 

 Mr. Raza has to deliver results fast, or pressure from investors may make AMD's long-complacent board take radical action, upending the current succession plan in which Mr. Raza is expected to replace Mr. Sanders as CEO in 2002. 

 As AMD failed to dislodge Intel with its K5, K6 and K6-2 chips, shareholders and corporate governance experts have pressured Mr. Sanders to bring outsiders onto the board and restrain his multi-million-dollar compensation packages. Mr. Sanders says his pay reflects performance and he wants to satisfy shareholders who are "in it for the long term, not 140 days." 

 The calls for change may get stronger with Wednesday's announcement. The company posted a loss of $128.6 million, or 88 cents a share, in the first quarter ended March 28, after forcing analysts to reduce their expectations in three separate profit warnings. Analysts subsequently believed AMD would lose 40 cents a share in the second quarter, but have once again been negatively surprised. The company said in a statement Wednesday that it now expects an operating loss of about $200 million for the second quarter. Intel, meanwhile, remains enormously profitable because it makes monopoly profits on high-end machines and can afford to cut low-end prices. 

 While it made manufacturing improvements in the second quarter, AMD expects it will sell only 3.7 million microprocessors, fewer than the 5 million it sold in the first quarter, because customers who were burned by AMD's supply problems last quarter turned to Intel chips. The company made the announcement after the close of markets, but rumors of the pre-announcement forced AMD's stock price to tank Wednesday morning. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AMD fell $1.0625, or 18%, to 18.1875. 

 For now, Mr. Raza must change the internal workings of AMD so that the Athlon launch and follow-up products roll out smoothly. While Mr. Sanders mingles with the Hollywood elite more comfortably than his own engineers, Mr. Raza is more low key. Known for inspiring his engineers, he once said while at his former company, "we got the chip out and there wasn't a single divorce." 

 The son of an engineer, he grew up in Lahore, Pakistan. His parents came from an aristocratic family but lost everything in the partitioning of India and Pakistan. Before getting bachelor's degrees in physics and philosophy at the University of London and a master's degree in materials science at Stanford University, Mr. Raza helped poor Pakistanis get access to fresh water and electricity. He lives comfortably in a large house in the Silicon Valley suburb of Morgan Hill. 

 Mr. Sanders, who hits mandatory retirement in three years, calls Mr. Raza "the Michael Jordan of microprocessor design." After a few more years of coaching, Mr. Raza will be both a great basketball and baseball player, says Mr. Sanders. "Our belief is old men for counsel, young men for war," he quips. 

 And war it is. The Athlon, which Mercury Research estimates could sell for $300 to $600, compared with AMD's average chip price of $78, is the company's hope to break free of Intel's suffocating price cuts on the low end consumer market. With Athlon, AMD can take the battle to Intel's strongholds in high-end consumer machines, corporate desktops and the highest-end servers and workstations. 

 "We haven't lost our window of opportunity," says Mr. Raza, pointing to a spreadsheet in his spotless white office at the company's headquarters here in Sunnyvale. "Intel can demolish our profit and loss picture because they cut prices in the one market where we participate and then keep their other prices high. We have to fight them in those other markets too." 

 But, he concedes, "It's impossible for AMD to become profitable without breaking out of the area where it is stuck. It has to execute flawlessly. Profits are a good deodorant for Intel, hiding their mistakes. But we stink. Our mistakes show up on the bottom line." 

 Producing the Athlon on time isn't Mr. Raza's only challenge. Mr. Raza has never run a company with 13,000 employees, although his track record shows nothing if not determination. 

 After several years in Silicon Valley, Mr. Raza in 1988 became engineering chief at Nexgen Inc., where he earned his stripes in guerrilla warfare. In a cash crunch, he recapitalized the company and took over as CEO in 1991. 

 Under him, Nexgen persevered to get a chip onto the market but was often ridiculed for producing "white papers" and delays. After going through $100 million in capital and nine years in development, the company launched a chip to compete with Intel's Pentium in 1995. Out of cash, Nexgen turned to AMD, which paid an extraordinary $615 million in stock for the 140-person company because of its unique design expertise and methodology. 

 While others with abrasive styles didn't last at AMD, Mr. Raza thrived as the company's chief technical officer. Respectful in dissent, Mr. Raza alone argued that AMD had to invest in a technical infrastructure well beyond microprocessors. Mr. Sanders felt such moves doomed Nexgen, but he eventually realized that AMD needed to counter Intel by investing in other components like chip sets. 

 When AMD couldn't get enough working K6 chips out of its factory, Mr. Raza slept only a few hours a night until he figured out why. He followed the chain of command when giving orders, but he reached "all the way down for data collection so that he knew more than the person reporting to him," says AMD vice president Richard Heye. Finding coordination problems, Mr. Raza unified AMD's warring manufacturers and designers, earning respect up and down the ranks. 

 While not a designer on the Athlon team, Mr. Raza organized the project and chose its key managers. In contrast to Intel's large design teams with hundreds of people, the Athlon squad had a manageable 120 engineers, small enough that experienced managers could see the big picture and easily relate decisions to individual engineers. The team designed the chip in just 17 months, less time than some chip projects took at Intel. 

 By all accounts, the Athlon chip is relatively easy to make and AMD has lined up an impressive number of component suppliers -- many of whom are disaffected with Intel -- who will grease the launch of the Athlon with their own related products. Key computer makers like International Business Machines Corp., Gateway Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. are expected to use the Athlon in coming months. 

 Mr. Raza knows Athlon won't change things overnight, but patience may be the one thing he shares with Mr. Sanders, who has battled Intel for decades. With bleak earnings ahead, they may be lonely at the top for some time longer. 

 "I got tired of the roller coaster at AMD," says Greg Favor, a key AMD chip architect who jumped ship to a network chip maker recently. "But Atiq sticks with it. Even if it is an enormous uphill battle, inside and outside the company."

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Shares in U.S. high-technology companies Microntech and SCMM are falling in London-based trading midday Thursday, ahead of what is expected to be another losing day on Wall Street. 

 Microntech was trading down 2 1/2 at $41 1/2, after the group reported a wider-than-expected loss of $27.7 million in its fiscal third quarter. This was attributed to a renewed slump in the company's core memory-chip market and lagging shipments of its personal computers. 

 SCM Microsystems was 7 1/2 easier at $47 after a profit warning. SCMM said it expects income between $1.5 million and $2 million, or 10 to 13 cents a share, compared with expectations of 24 cents a share. 

 Also, Advanced Micro Devices said that it expects an operating loss of about $200 million for the second quarter ended June 27, far worse than analysts' expectations. Although market participants are somewhat used to this kind of disappointment, a London trader expects the stock to suffer later in the session. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average index is seen as heading lower later in the session, based on the S&P 500 June futures contract, which at 1150 GMT was down 2.90, at 1339.60. The DJIA fell 54.77 points to 10666.86 points on Wednesday, registering closing losses for the third day running this week. 

 U.S. 30-year treasury bonds were up 10/32 at 88.05, with a yield of 6.133%.

        The Federal Filings Health Care Index continued to decline -- though
not as drastically Wednesday -- as the overall Index slipped a slight 0.3%.
Seven of 10 sub-indexes lost ground, with six of that number losing more
than 1.0% each.
        Physician Practice Management stocks gave up 1.9%, followed by the
Diagnostic Imaging/Lab Services group, which stood 1.6% lower by the final
bell.  In the latter group, Diagnostic Products Corp. (DP) slid 1 11/16
(5.7%) to 28 1/8.  Shares of Beckman Coulter Inc. (BEC) sloughed off 2 11/16
to 49, a 5.2% decrease.  Cytyc Corp. (CYTC) was down 1 5/16 to 19 3/4
(6.4%).
        The Skilled, Long Term Care Index lost 1.5%, as Sunrise Assisted
Living Inc. (SNRZ) left 1 1/16 -- the highest point-loss tally in the sector
-- or 3.0%,to finish at 34 3/4.  In news related to the skilled, long term
care industry, NewCare Health Corp. (NWCA) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy,
Lenox Healthcare Inc. said.  Lenox Healthcare agreed to manage NewCare's
ongoing operations starting June 1.
        As reported by Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday, Lenox Healthcare said
NewCare obtained debtor-in-possession financing.  Lenox Healthcare believes
the financing is sufficient to meet NewCare payroll and vendor obligations.
        Yesterday, the NASDAQ Stock Market changed the halted trading
status of NewCare's shares to "additional information requested."  NASDAQ
said NewCare Health's trading will remain halted until the company fully
satisfies the request for additional information.  NewCare Health's shares
closed Tuesday at 18.75 cents.
        Both the Home Health/Ambulatory Care and the Pharmaceutical

        In news reported last night by Dow Jones Newswires, MedPartners Inc.
(MDM) said a judge denied a MedManagement Acquisitions Corp. motion seeking
a temporary restraining order to disrupt the sale of MedPartners assets to
KPC Acquisition Corp.
        MedPartners also said a judge rejected MedManagement's request for
an expedited hearing to determine whether the dispute should be subject to
arbitration.  As reported, MedPartners had previously signed a letter of
intent for a deal with MedManagement, but said the transaction wasn't
completed in the required time frame.
        The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 54.77 points to 10666.86

PACIFICARE HLTH SYS INC. (PHSYA)       71 5/8 -2 1/2   -3.4%  $5.94 $6.76
Dow Jones Newswires reported that shares of PacifiCare continued to fall
Wednesday as the managed care company warned analysts that some second-
quarter estimates were too high.  On Tuesday, the company called certain
analysts and told them to lower their expectations for the upcoming quarter.
PacifiCare now expects to report earnings between $1.45 per share and $1.50
per share, compared with the Zacks Investment Research consensus estimate of
$1.45 per share and First Call consensus estimate of $1.58 per share,
according to several analysts.
The profit warning came as a surprise to many, especially since the company
had been touting its growth prospects in recent weeks.  When the first-
quarter results were released in early May, PacifiCare, in a press release,
increased expectations, saying it saw earnings per share growth between 40%
and 45% for the year.
That positive projection excluded the effects of a  buyback of 13% of its
shares from its largest shareholder, UniHealth Foundation. UniHealth's stock
ownership is the reason PacifiCare has two classes of shares.  The company
has proposed combining the classes.
A PacifiCare spokeswoman told Dow Jones the company was surprised by the
market's reaction to the earnings news, since PacifiCare had been
"communicating the same message" for some time.  The company was trying to
temper some of the "tremendous amount of enthusiasm by Wall Street" that
followed the first-quarter earnings and get some analysts "back in line,"
she said.  PacifiCare chose not to release a formal statement because it
doesn't believe the adjustments are material.
While the company said its original projections of 40% to 45% earnings
growth in 1999 excluded any gains from the share buyback, the new guidance
includes such additive effects, though the company believes it will add only
a few cents to the year-end figure.
Including the buyback, PacifiCare now expects to earn between $6.20 and
$6.31 per share in 1999, the spokeswoman said.

 First Call Says Pace Of 2nd-Quarter Profit Warnings Is Down

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The pace of second-quarter profit warnings by U.S. companies is down compared to last year, according to data compiled by First Call, which tracks companies' earnings. 

 Wall Street is in the midst of its profit-warning season, as some companies admit to investors that the companies aren't going to earn as much in the current quarter as the companies expected. But this year, companies appear to have less to atone. 

 Of the 311 companies that have pre-announced earnings for the three months ending June 30, 55%, or 170, expect to do worse than analysts' expectations, said Chuck Hill, First Call's director of research. 

 That sets a pace for negative pre-announcements to decline from a year ago, when 493 companies, or 66%, issued warnings that results would be worse than expected. The wave of bad news in the year-ago second quarter came as a result of economic turmoil in Asia that since has abated. 

 "Are we totally back to business as usual?" Hill said. "Not quite, but closer." 

 In the first quarter of 1999, 379 companies, or 53%, issued announcements that warned of worse-than-expected results. The slightly higher rate of negative pre-announcements in the current quarter reflects seasonal factors, Hill said. Adjusted for this, the second quarter looks a lot like the first quarter, he said. 

 Hill noted that no sector in particular is experiencing an unusual number of pre-announcements, unlike in the first quarter, when a number of software companies, beset by year 2000 problems, said they would do worse than earlier forecasts. 

 One earnings outlook that bears watching is Gillette Co. (G), Hill said. Consumer-products companies often are the "canary in the coal mine," feeling the effects of unfavorable economic trends in advance of other sectors, Hill said. "It's not enough to say there's a problem here," Hill said of Gillette's forecast, "but it's something to watch." 

 Last week, Gillette warned that second-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' estimates. The company said it expects to post earnings of 26 cents a share, compared with 33 cents a share a year ago, because of "softer" than expected sales at its Braun, stationery and toiletries businesses. The Boston maker of razors also cited slower-than-expected recovery in key overseas markets, including Brazil, Germany, Japan and Russia.

 Advanced Micro Dn -2: K7 Chip Delayed To July - Analyst

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) shares slid 6.5% Wednesday on concern that the chip maker might issue a second-quarter profit warning or announce a delay in the shipment of its K7 chip during a conference call scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EDT. 

 The Sunnyvale, Calif., company wouldn't disclose the details of the conference. 

 Industry observers said they believe the news could be negative, given the decline in the company's stock price. Advanced Micro's NYSE-listed shares recently changed hands at 18, off 1 1/4, or 6.5%, on volume of 2.4 million shares. Average volume is 1.6 million shares. 

 "A lot of people are very fearful that it could be some sort of earnings shortfall or some sort of problem," said Erika Klauer, a Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst. 

 A weak second quarter would follow Advanced Micro's substantial first-quarter loss of $128.4 million, or 88 cents a share, when a host of production problems restrained sales. Before restructuring charges, the company's first-quarter loss was 81 cents a share. 

 Some analysts speculated that the company might be having production troubles again, this time with its new K7 chip. 

 The chip, designed to perform better than top offerings from rival Intel Corp. (INTC), is scheduled to begin shipping in June. 

 "My understanding is that it's been pushed to July," said Lawrence Borgman, a Jospehthal & Co. analyst. "They've had problems in the past (so) it wouldn't be all together surprising that there would be delays."

 Dow, rate worries drag down Bel-20 index .

BRUSSELS, June 22 (Reuters) - The Bel-20 blue chip index, weighed down by weaker early trade on Wall Street	  and interest rate worries, closed 0.76 percent lower at 3,216.58 points in cautious trade on Tuesday, analysts said.



The Dow was hit by an upturn in U.S. bond yields as traders started to grow nervous before the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-setting Open Market Committee meeting on June 29-30, they said.


 Computer services company Real Software  was the biggest loser with a 4.34 percent slide to 116.70 euros. 

 Analyst Werner Wuyts at Dierickx & Cie said some investors were offloading Real Software stock because the share price failed to meet their "exaggerated" expectations. 

 "They had bought the shares based on valuations of more than 140 euros per share and expectations it would get a weighting of three percent in the Bel-20," Wuyts said. 

 "It didn't even get a weighting of two percent," he said. 

 Fortis (B) was the only Bel-20 stock to finish in the black with a rise of just 0.03 percent to 31.90 euros. 

 It had been dogged in recent days by news its Dutch sister Fortis (NL) was launching a share and convertible bond issue valued at around two billion euros to help pay for the purchase of American Bankers' Insurance . 

 Brokerage KBC Securities maintained an "accumulate" rating on the stock. 

 Analysts expected Fortis (B) to hold on to current levels. "I don't see it go to 34 (euros) but not fall to 29 either," said Wuyts. 

 Utility holding company Tractebel  and its Electrabel  subsidiary, which both rose on the back of an upgrade by KBC Securities on Tuesday but ran out of steam, ended down 0.07 percent and 1.66 percent at 136.90 and 309.00 euros respectively. 

 * Outside the index, cinema group Kinepolis  nosedived 10.41 percent to 80.00 euros on persistent investor disappointment over a profit warning by Kinepolis's German partner Cinemaxx . 

 Kinepolis had closed at 113.00 euros on June 10 before Cinemaxx issued its profit warning. 

 Cinemaxx, in which Kinepolis has a 30 percent stake, said it lost 1.2 million marks in the nine months to March 31, 1999, while visitor numbers had fallen by an estimated 20 to 25 percent in the first quarter of 1999. 

 "(The Cinemaxx profit warning) was a shock to investor confidence," said Wuyts. 

 * Koramic Building Products  added 0.52 percent at 48.00 euros on news its Austrian unit Wienerberger  was buying brickmaker General Shale from the Etex/Marley Group for $260 million. ((Bert Lauwers, Brussels newsroom +32 2 287 6815, fax +32 2 230 7710, bert.lauwers@reuters.com)).

 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 A Good Week for the Dow Despite Rate-Hike Threat

 With the stock market getting a double dose of good news from Washington last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 365 points to 10,855, a 3.5% gain, leaving the key index just 2% below its record high of 11,107, set on May 13. 

 After weeks of concern about rising inflation and interest rates, investors were cheered Wednesday when the government reported that consumer prices were unchanged in May. That news ignited a rally in the depressed bond market and a surge in stocks that lifted the Dow by 190 points and boosted the Nasdaq by 103 points, its largest one-day point gain ever. 

 Then on Thursday, the normally inscrutable Alan Greenspan strongly suggested that the Federal Reserve will increase short-term rates later this month. The anticipated rate rise of a quarter point, however, didn't dampen spirits on Wall Street because of hopes that it will be the last such move. 

 Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Cohen, who coined the term "flu shot" to describe the Fed's widely anticipated 1997 rate hike -- it only briefly slowed the market's surge that year -- trotted out the metaphor again last week. Cohen's view is that a modest tightening, like a flu shot, may sting momentarily, but will ultimately prove beneficial by slowing a robust economy, thus prolonging the long expansion and forestalling any inflation pressures. 

 The Dow was up in each of the five sessions last week, capped by a 14-point gain in a triple-witching session Friday. 

 The Nasdaq surged 115 points to 2563 on the week, a 4.7% advance, lifted by strong gains in Microsoft and Cisco Systems. Microsoft rose 6 7/8 to 85 while Cisco jumped 7 11/16 to 119 3/8. Internet stocks got crushed Monday, hitting some of their lowest levels since January, but then rebounded strongly with Yahoo and Amazon.com finishing higher on the week. America Online dipped as low as 89 1/2 Monday, but then rallied to end the week at 112 1/2, up 13 points. 

 So far this year, the Dow is up 18.2%, better than its entire gain in 1998. The S&P 500 was up 3.8% last week to 1342 and now has risen 9.2% this year. The Nasdaq has gained 16.9% year to date. 

 -- Gillette's warning Thursday of a second-quarter profit shortfall caused by weak international markets prompted a sharp selloff in its shares and raised concerns about whether other multinational companies are experiencing similar pressure. 

 "The issue is whether Gillette's problems are unique or broad-based," says Jim Engle, chief investment officer at Wood Struthers & Winthrop, an investment arm of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. Engle notes that the dollar's 12% rise against the euro this year is dampening the profits of U.S. multinationals. He adds that economies in developing countries also may not be rebounding as quickly as anticipated. 

 Gillette fell 5 1/8 to 42 3/16 Friday, putting mild pressure on other consumer stocks, including Avon Products and Coca-Cola. Gillette was off 6 1/2 in the five sessions and now has fallen 34% from its record high of 64 1/4 set on March 24, before the company's April warning about a profit miss. 

 The Street seems to view Gillette's problems as isolated, but Coke also could be vulnerable, argues Bill Pecoriello, beverage analyst at Sanford Bernstein. "The same markets in which Gillette is having trouble, Japan, Brazil and Germany, also are very important to Coke," Pecoriello says. "The emerging markets may have bottomed, but they're not rebounding rapidly yet." He notes that Coke and Gillette issued back-to-back profit warnings last summer. 

 Coke fell a point to 63 7/16 last week, hurt by its European contamination scare. Coke's stock has been held up in recent months by widespread hopes that the company will regain its former glory in the second half of 1999 and start posting double-digit profit gains after several quarters of outright earnings declines. But Pecoriello says Coke may fall short, jeopardizing the company's ability to hit the current Street profit target of $1.40 a share for the year. Pecoriello also lacks confidence in Coke's ability to reach the current Street consensus of $1.60 a share in 2000. He argues that Coke is no bargain at 45 times projected 1999 earnings, given its dicey profit outlook. 

 Gillette fell so sharply Friday partly because the company recently had left the impression with Street analysts that the quarter was on track. Gillette's blade business may be strong, but it has been hurt by weakness in stationery, pens and electric razors. 

 Gillette could find support around 40 because of interest from investors wanting to pick up one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks at a depressed price. Gillette now trades for 33 times projected 1999 profits -- not much more than the market multiple. With Coke and Gillette down last week, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway fell 1,600 a share to 69,900. Coke and Gillette are two of Berkshire's largest holdings. 

 -- If 1998's market advance was driven largely by rate declines, this year's rally has been fueled by profits. During the first quarter, operating earnings for the companies in the S&P 500 rose 10.5%, and the second-quarter profit outlook is even better, according to Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call. 

 "We're on target for 15% growth in the second quarter," Hill says. Pacing the S&P will be the technology sector, which could show profit growth of 40% versus the year-ago quarter, he feels. Drug companies should post double-digit profit gains, while energy and basic-material producers will be less of a drag on earnings than in the first quarter. General Motors should provide a big boost to overall corporate profits because its results will compare with strike-depressed levels of a year ago. The GM strike cut about two percentage points from S&P profit growth in last year's second quarter. 

 "The third quarter may be even better," Hill adds, estimating that S&P 500 earnings could rise 20% in the period. 

 Compaq Computer's latest profit warning Thursday that it may post a second-quarter loss of 15 cents, versus already-reduced expectations of 20 cents in profits, is another sign of the tough conditions in the personal-computer business. Compaq fell 9/16 to 21 3/4 and now has dropped 57% from its January high of 51 1/4. 

 "We're telling people to stay away," says Richard Gardner, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "The PC market gets more competitive with each passing day." Gardner is neutral on both Compaq and Dell Computer, saying Dell, which rose about 2 1/2 to 36 45/64 last week, could decline to 30. 

 Gardner says PC unit growth remains strong in the double digits but he sees no revenue growth for the industry this year because of falling prices. But Compaq may base around 20 because of the company's high asset value, which Gardner estimates could total 50 a share. "Compaq is compelling from a value perspective," he says. Compaq owns Alta Vista, the Internet search engine, among other non-PC businesses. 

 -- AMR, parent of American Airlines, seems more interested in lifting the stock price of its 82%-owned Sabre Group Holdings than in supporting its own underperforming shares. 

 AMR is considering a spinoff of a partial interest in Sabre's online travel agency, Travelocity, which might provide a fresh lift to Sabre, whose shares are up 44% in the past 12 months. 

 But AMR continues to rule out a spinoff to its shareholders of its controlling interest in Sabre; the move likely would give an appreciable boost to AMR shares, which are down 19% in the past year. At current share prices, AMR's interest in Sabre is worth over $40 per AMR share, far more than the implied value of $24 on AMR's airline business. Sabre rose 1 1/2 last week to 64 1/8 while AMR dropped 2 to 64 3/4. 

 AMR's airline business is effectively valued at just six times this year's estimated, strike-depressed profits and at four times last year's earnings. Some institutional holders are pushing for a Sabre spinoff, which they say could add at least $10 to AMR's stock price. They add that Wall Street's patience with Don Carty, AMR's chief executive, is starting to wear thin. Those investors maintain that AMR is a bargain, and that investors enamored of Sabre should purchase AMR instead. 

 -- The thin ranks of sizable companies with low price/earnings multiples has dwindled even further in the current quarter because of the revival of many depressed industrial stocks. 

 So it's worth taking a look at the remaining stocks in the S&P 500 that still possess single-digit P/E multiples. Given the market's current height, these low-P/E stocks may provide safety and considerable upside potential. 

 The accompanying list of 15 companies includes some well-known names like General Motors, Delta Air Lines, Lehman Brothers and Loews. There also are a handful of homebuilders: Centex, Kaufman & Broad Home and Pulte, whose stocks have been hit by fears about higher rates and the sustainability of the current housing boom. This trio could prove attractive if the worst fears about the housing cycle fail to materialize. The 15-company list was compiled by Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown chief economist Ed Yardeni based on I/B/E/S earnings estimates for 1999. 

 Delta is representative of the perennially inexpensive airlines, which now have the lowest P/E of any major group in the S&P. Delta, which fell a point last week to 56, now fetches just 8.5 times projected 1999 profits. It not only has a rock-bottom P/E but also holds a valuable interest in Priceline.com, the Internet seller of airline tickets that's now worth around $1.7 billion, or about $12 per Delta share. 

 Lehman has recovered nicely from its troubles following the Russian economic crisis last summer. But the company gets little respect in the investment community because it's viewed as a volatile bond shop without a presence in the two current glamour businesses on Wall Street: asset management and online trading. 

 Loews, the holding company controlled by New York's Tisch family, looks inexpensive by several measurements. At a price of 80, it has a single-digit P/E and languishes beneath its book value of $96 a share. Loews also trades for little more than the current market value of its stakes in CNA Financial and Diamond Offshore Drilling. This means investors are paying a nominal amount for Loews' cigarette unit, Lorillard, which could be worth $40 a share or more. Loews also has a cash position of about $10 a share. Loews believes its stock is undervalued, having repurchased 2% of its outstanding shares in the first quarter at an average price of $80 a share. 

 Be forewarned. Seemingly cheap stocks can be cheap for a reason. Take Fruit of the Loom, the underwear maker, whose stock has looked like a bargain for some time. Its shares, which stood at 34 last summer, fell another two points last week to a new low of 9 3/16 after the company announced a profit shortfall. 

 -- Some big US West shareholders were relieved last week when Qwest Communications International lobbed in a hostile takeover offer for the Baby Bell because they believe Global Crossing, which has a competing offer for US West, is little more than a "late-stage venture capital company" with fragile, high-priced stock, according to one US West holder. 

 Both Qwest and Global Crossing are upstart telecommunications companies whose shares have soared on Internet hopes. But Qwest is farther along in its business plan than Global Crossing and has much higher revenues. The betting on Wall Street is that Qwest has a good shot at wresting US West away from Global Crossing. 

 US West shares rose 3 1/8 to 58 last week, finishing about 14% below the current value of Qwest's all-stock offer. Qwest's original offer for US West was worth $80, but the value declined to $67 because Qwest's stock fell 6 15/16 to 37 15/16 as growth and momentum investors piled out. 

 "I'm not thrilled about getting Qwest's stock," said one institutional holder. "But at least it's a real company." 

 Qwest's shares now are down from an April peak of 52 3/8, cutting its market value to $25 billion, less than US West's $30 billion. Qwest is also making a hostile bid for Frontier, the old Rochester Telephone, which said late last week that it is leaning toward the Global Crossing bid. 

 The growth and momentum crowd wasn't happy that Qwest and Global Crossing want to hook up with a stodgy Baby Bell. But these investors should realize that when the market accords upstarts huge valuations, management is tempted to use high-priced stocks to buy substantive companies. 

 An obscure but important tax issue could be the reason that the only two bidders for US West are smaller companies. Under the tax code, US West's spinoff in 1998 of MediaOne Group could be subject to a huge tax bill if US West reaches a merger in the next year in which it doesn't end up with a majority stake. This makes it more difficult for a larger telecom company to enter the bidding fray. US West's chief executive, Sol Trujillo, has been criticized for not waiting until 2000 before shopping US West and enabling a larger company to more easily bid for the company. 

 US West's stock still could have some upside potential. "You could get a higher bid from Qwest and you also could get a cash component," the investor adds.

 Compaq shocks market again with Q2 35C/shr results divergence - board to  cut  $2bn.

 Compaq, the world's second largest computer company and by far the world's largest PC group, shocked the market for the second quarter in a row by warning that it expected to make a loss of around 15 cents per share for the second quarter compared to Wall Street's expectations of a 20 cents per share profit. Chairman of the board Ben Rosen, who was instrumental in forcing out CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer after the surprise first quarter loss of 50 cents per share, blamed continuing operational difficulties (including the absorption of DEC), falling computer prices and slowing demand in Western Europe and warned that the outlook for the second half of 1999 remained obscure. However Rosen said the company planned to cut around $2bn of costs (which could result in charges of around $3bn in the third quarter) but was unclear on the details of this or how soon this would impact the bottom line. 

 [NB: Compaq, whose share price of around $22 compares with $50 at the beginning of the year, does appear to have seriously lost its way in an industry where the rate of change is so fast and profit margins so fine (at least on the PC side - Compaq is lucky enough to have some other theoretically higher margin businesses which could carry it for a while providing it can correct its present problems) and in an industry where few companies get a second chance. To date the company, whose traditional strength was in its dealer relationships, has totally failed to emulate the direct sales model of Dell, Gateway and others and at the same time, in pursuit of its $50bn sales level target acquired both Tandem and DEC in relatively quick succession (a couple of moves which appears to have totally overloaded its management, who understandably, for essentially a one product one theme company, had little experience in the takeover and restructuring of more complex businesses. As a result of its problems apart from Pfeiffer himself, who appeared to have been pretty badly treated considering how much he had already contributed to the company and who had some genuine talent, Compaq appears to have lost several other managers who no doubt enjoyed being part of the company's raging successful years but now have neither the stomach or the skill for the probable scenario of several years of painful recovery and consider they can cash in the Compaq association for a new job more easily now than in a couple of years when the name may have been seriously devalued. For the immediate future the company, which has made similar statements before and failed to achieve them has now set a target of doing 25% of its business through direct sales channels by the fourth quarter and has said it will set up 17 callcentres and an Internet e-commerce sales system by the end of 1999. The question of a new CEO remains unresolved and given the relatively high standing in the industry of Pfeiffer, the fairly dominant character of Rosen and the mess the company is in it seems likely the company, in an industry where there are plenty of good, exciting, well paid and low risk jobs going, is likely to have a hard time finding someone with the right level of reputation and skills, who can work to the board's no doubt excessive expectations and who would actually like to do the job. Unfortunately for Compaq there is no Steve Jobs in the background waiting to come in and do the job largely for love nor does Compaq ever seem to have inspired the loyalty amongst its customers that Apple or even to a lesser extent Dell has done.].

 Gillette Dn 10% On 2Q Outlook; 3 Analysts  Cut  Ratings >G

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Although investors appear uneasy with Gillette Co.'s (G) pessimistic outlook for the second quarter as evidenced by the 10.3% drop in the company's stock price and heavy trading volume Friday, only three analysts have reduced their ratings on the consumer-products manufacturer. 

 After the closing bell Thursday, Gillette reported it expects to post a low single-digit percentage increase in second quarter sales, and about a 20% decrease in earnings per share from the 33 cents a diluted share reported a year ago, both of which fall below Wall Street's estimates. 

 Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call Corp., said out of 14 analysts, eight maintained their ratings for the Boston manufacturer; two haven't reported any changes; one has restricted coverage; and three downgraded. 

 Hill didn't identify these three analysts. 

 Earlier, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. said it reduced its rating on the company to long-term buy from buy. The firm's research note stated Gillette's "earnings rebound is likely to take longer than we originally expected" based upon the second-quarter warning. 

 Hill added that 12 of the 14 analysts cut their second-quarter earnings estimates, bringing the First Call consensus of analysts down to 26 cents a share from 29 cents. In April, when Gillette announced that its second-quarter earnings could potentially fall short of the Street's views, analysts reduced their estimate of 35 cents a share. 

 Additionally, this second profit warning prompted these same 12 analysts to cut their earnings estimates for 1999 to $1.27 from $1.34 and for 2000 to $1.47 from $1.58, according to Hill. 

 Shares of Gillette recently traded at 42 7/16, down 4 7/8, or 10.3%, on volume of 20.2 million shares, compared with average volume of 3.2 million shares.

 Gillette Shares Slide After Latest  Warning  On  Profit , Sales

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Investors shaved the market value of Gillette Co. Friday after the consumer-products company warned second-quarter earnings and sales will fall short of analysts' already diminished estimates. 

 Shares of Gillette (G) fell $5.25, or 11%, to settle at $42.063, on hefty volume of 30 million, easily vaulting it atop the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange. Average daily trading volume is about 3.2 million 

 Gillette issued the warning - its third such guidance for the current quarter - after the markets closed Thursday. The company blamed "softer" than expected sales at its Braun, stationery and toiletries businesses. 

 Gillette also cited a slower-than-expected recovery in key overseas markets, including Brazil, Germany, Japan and Russia, but said it remains confident that the company will return to "more traditional" growth rates by the end of this year. 

 In its warning Thursday, Gillette indicated it will post earnings of around 26 cents per share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by earnings tracker First Call had been for earnings of 29 cents a share, down from 33 cents a share in the year-ago period. The firm said it will report a "low single-digit increase" in sales and about a 20% drop in per-share earnings. 

 Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, said out of 14 analysts who follow the company, eight maintained their ratings for the Boston manufacturer; two haven't reported any changes; one has restricted coverage; and three downgraded the stock. Hill didn't identify these three analysts. 

 However, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. said earlier Friday it reduced its rating on the company to "long-term buy" from "buy." The firm's research note stated Gillette's "earnings rebound is likely to take longer than we originally expected" based upon the warning. 

 Also Friday, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut its rating on Gillette to "market perform" from "buy." No further information was available on that downgrade. 

 First Call's Hill added that 12 of the 14 analysts surveyed cut their second-quarter earnings estimates, bringing the mean estimate down to 26 cents a share. In April, when Gillette said its second-quarter earnings could potentially fall short of the Street's views, analysts reduced their estimate to 29 cents a share from their previous forecast of 35 cents a share. 

 The warning  prompted these same 12 analysts to cut their earnings estimates for 1999 to $1.27 from $1.34 and for 2000 to $1.47 from $1.58, Hill said Friday. 

 Gillette, suffering from the uneven global economy, in April reported first-quarter earnings rose only slightly and told analysts it expected second-quarter earnings per share would fall more than 10% from the year-earlier period. About a week before that warning, Gillette said first and second-quarter earnings would be below expectations, prompting analysts to lower their forecasts. 

 Gillette Thursday also said it will increase its share buybacks to 75 million shares from 50 million. The company expects the repurchase of the original 50 million shares to be completed by the end of this year. New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of Gillette closed Thursday at $47.31, down 43.75 cents. Gillette has about 1.1 billion shares outstanding. 

 Gillette said its largest business, blades and razors, should make "good progress," led by the MACH3 razor, which is exceeding expectations. 

 The company said the weak sales outlook takes into account divested businesses, including Jafra International and rechargeable batteries, and the "negative effect of exchange." Other new products, including Duracell Ultra and the Oral-B CrossAction toothbrush, are increasing sales and market share, Gillette said.

 MSC Industrial Shares Drop Sharply After Firm Issues  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)- Shares of MSC Industrial Direct Co. slumped Friday after the company revised its third-quarter earnings outlook, prompting several firms to lower their ratings on the stock. 

 After the markets closed Thursday, the metalworking-supplies maker said it expects to report fiscal third-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share. Last month, the company reported that it expected third-quarter earnings to come in just a a penny shy of the 26-cents-a-share mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by earnings tracker First Call. 

 In the year-ago period, the direct marketer of such industrial products as cutting tools and measuring instruments posted earnings of 21 cents a share. 

 At Friday's close, shares of MSC Industrial (MSM) were down $5.25, or 32%, at $11.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, after shedding nearly 12% Thursday. Volume totaled 3.3 million, dwarfing its daily average. 

 To explain its revised earnings estimate Thursday, MSC noted a declining growth rate in May. In its May preannouncement, the company reported a slowdown in the manufacturing sector and cited investment costs associated with its new Nevada distribution center, the Internet and its year 2000 effort. 

 "The magnitude (of the revision) surprised everybody," Banc of America Securities analyst Edward Lee said. 

 The company had been ignoring the slowdown in growth for the past three quarters, burying its problems under minor housekeeping type adjustments in order to meet consensus estimates, Lee added. "The company's fundamentals are still the same" as they have been over the past three quarters," he wrote. 

 BancBoston Robertson Stephens & Co. analyst Andrew Jeffrey, who downgraded MSC to "market performer" from "buy," said in a research note, "while we believe MSC has been a high quality name in the past, we are confounded by the degree to which management underestimated its cost structure, leading to this mishap just six weeks after the first preannouncement." 

 Jeffrey said "this significant unmitigated slowdown may be indicative of the degree to which the Internet is altering the traditional industrial distribution channel." 

 BancBoston was one of several firms that downgraded the stock. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. downgraded it to "market perform" from buy. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut the stock to "neutral" from "outperform." 


Company officials weren't immediately available for comment Friday.

 INTERVIEW-Lockheed to  cut  transport plane costs. 

 By Pierre Tran

 LE BOURGET, France, June 12 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp  aims to make deep cost cuts in its new C-130J military transport plane as part of its plan to turn round its the division, President Micky Blackwell of the U.S. aerospace group's aeronautics sector told Reuters at the Paris air show. 

 The aeronautics wing recently announced plans to lay off 2,000 workers due to delayed deliveries of the C-130J and cost problems on its F-22 fighter. The group issued a profit warning for 1999 and said the second quarter would be in loss. 

 "We are trying to make this (C-130J) the most affordable airplane we have ever built. We are modernising our complete C-130J line using something we call "lean thinking," Blackwell said in an interview. The payoff would come with new orders. 

 Lockheed Martin, headquartered in Marietta, Georgia, is also continuing discussions, on a non-exclusive basis, on possible cooperation with European majors Aerospatiale Matra , British Aerospace Plc  and Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG . 

 But it seems no new deals were envisaged in the short term although talks have been going on for five years. He held up Lockheed's cooperation with BAe on its bid for the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter as an example of transatlantic cooperation. 


Lockheed wants to make "substantial cost reductions" on the $50 million to $55 million price tag on each C-130J and has talked to suppliers such as engine maker Allison, owned by Rolls-Royce Plc	  , to cut their prices, he said.



Blackwell declined to say how much it wanted to slice off the price tag but said the lower prices would help export efforts and offset the announced delays in deliveries of the C-130J to the U.S. Air Force.



"Export sales are ahead of schedule promised five years ago but not as swift we would like now," he said.



Lockheed has sold 25 C-130Js to Britain and Italy and has offered the turboprop plane in a major competition for a military transport required by eight European NATO countries.



The U.S. Marine Corps wants 50 transporters at a rate of four or five a year and he said he believed the service had the political clout to get the funding.



The U.S. Air Force has pushed back C-130J deliveries to 2004 and Lockheed Martin has had to cut production back a third to 19 aircraft for 1999 instead of a planned 24.



Blackwell reiterated he would not take a stake in Airbus Industrie's A3XX 550-seater plane as Lockheed would "not invest in a single commercial plane." Lockheed got out of the civil aircraft business when its sole product proved to be a dead end.



But Lockheed is open to customising Airbus airliners for military uses such as refueling tankers or surveillance platforms, he said. ((Paris air show newsroom +33 1 41 69 35 98)).

 Lockheed Forecasts Loss On Rising Costs, Delays 

A Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup

 Lockheed Martin Corp. said that rising costs, rocket-launch failures and various delays would drag its second-quarter earnings into the red, falling far shy of earnings estimates. 

 Citing delays in rocket launches, as well as in deliveries of commercial satellites and of its C-130J aircraft, the second-largest U.S. aerospace company also said it was sharply cutting its earnings outlook for 1999 and 2000. 

 "Clearly, our forecasts about some key programs have not been realized, and we have not executed consistently across the corporation to our expectations," said Vance Coffman, Lockheed Martin's chairman and chief executive. 

 The Bethesda, Maryland-based company said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of 10 to 15 cents a share (9.6 to 14.4 European cents), far shy of analysts' expectations that Lockheed would post a profit of 72 cents a share. The company had earnings of 76 cents a share for the year-earlier second quarter. 

 "We will continue to examine operational, organizational and strategic alternatives, and we are prepared to make further changes necessary to achieve outstanding performance and increase shareholder value," Mr. Coffman said. 

 The company expects diluted per-share earnings of at least $1.50 for this year, sharply lower than both the $3.10 per-share consensus analysts' estimate collected by market-research firm First Call and the $3.11 earnings per share in 1998. 

 "No one was expecting it to be this bad," said Jeff Pittsburg, partner in Goldes Pittsburg Institutional Investors. 

 Breaking down the ways performance will be hurt in 1999, the company said timing delays cut net-earnings expectations by $125 million, or 31 cents a share, while performance issues cut earnings by $205 million, or 54 cents a share. It also said slower deliveries of its C-130J will hurt earnings to the tune of $275 million, or 70 cents a share. 

 Lockheed said it expects to deliver 30 of its C-130J aircraft in 1999, coming in on the low end of its expected production range of 30 to 35 aircraft. It added that the C-130J delays will cut 2000 earnings by $110 million, or 26 cents a share. 

 Lockheed also said it expects to earn $2.15 a share in 2000, down from a First Call estimate of $3.39 a share. Lockheed noted that timing delays have shaved $140 million, or 33 cents a share, off of 2000 earnings, while performance issues would cut them by $345 million, or 84 cents a share. 

 The profit warning cast a sense of uncertainty over Wall Street. Lockheed shares fell 14%, or $5.5625, to $34.875, at one point hitting a new intraday low of $33.75 Wednesday. 

 Many analysts were left wondering, despite the company's remarks, just how quickly Lockheed can fix the situation. 

 "They have got a bunch of problems to solve, and none of it is going to happen that quickly," said John Pincavage, an analyst for Warburg Dillon Reed LLC. "It will carry on through 1999 and 2000, and at this point, we don't know if it will go on longer than that." 

 Analysts differed on how Lockheed will handle its operational problems. "The fix is already underway," said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Pierre Chao, who said he plans to maintain his strong buy rating. 

 Some analysts contended that, aside from the recent management changes at the company's plant in Georgia, where it manufactures C-130J cargo planes, officials were vague on details about a plan of action.

P&G stock falls as change is detailed

Investors appeared skeptical of Procter & Gamble Co.'s long-awaited restructuring, dropping its shares $2.56-1/4 to $94.25 as the plan was detailed Wednesday.

The largest U.S. maker of household products said it will cut 15,000 jobs worldwide, close about 10 plants and take charges of $1.9 billion. Chief Executive Durk Jager, who took over in January, wants to tame bureaucracy at the 162-year-old company and help speed the development of new products and their delivery.

But P&G said fiscal fourth-quarter unit sales, or the number of products sold, will be less than some analysts expected, and that the reorganization won't significantly help profit for the next year. ``People have run out of patience,'' said analyst Ajay Mehra at Columbia Management, which holds 32,000 shares and has been selling its stake this year. ``Earnings aren't the issue. There's no volume growth. We've had empty promises for three quarters.'' - Bloomberg News

this year and next will be less than expected because of high costs and delayed deliveries. Lockheed shares fell $5.56-1/4, or 14 percent, to $34.87-1/2.

The company blamed the shortfall on delayed manufacturing of its C-130J cargo plane, fewer orders for its commercial satellites and postponed launches of its Atlas and Proton rockets. The warning is Lockheed's fourth reduction since November of its 1999 profit forecast and raises questions about whether

 Cleveland-Cliffs to miss Q2, '99 EPS targets.

 CLEVELAND, June 10 (Reuters) - Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., a leading supplier of iron ore products to the struggling steel industry, said Thursday its second quarter and full year earnings will fall short of Wall Street estimates. 

 The company, which manages six iron ore mines in North America, blamed the profit warning on weaker iron ore sales and production and on the delayed start-up at a plant in Trinidad and Tobago. 

 Cleveland-Cliffs had been expected to earn $1.22 per share in the current quarter, down from $1.48 a year earlier, and $3.80 per share for the year, versus a profit of $4.75 in 1998, according to research tracking firm First Call. 

 U.S. and Canadian steelmakers, faced with the outage of several blast furnaces and cheap imports that have become a hot political issue, have cut back on their demand for iron ore, the company said. However, it said that lower steel imports and strong demand contributed to a more encouraging outlook. 

 Just a month ago, at the company's annual shareholder meeting, Chief Executive John Brizno recognised the volatile nature of its industry and warned that a recovery in iron ore was trailing that in the steel industry. 

 The company's iron ore pellet sales in the second quarter are expected to be about 2.2 million tons, well below a record high of 3.9 million tons in the second quarter of 1998. It said sales for the year will fall to 9.5 to 10.0 million tons from record sales of 12.1 million tons in 1998. 

 Because pellet inventories will end the year close to the levels at the start of 1999, and because sales are expected to fall, Cleveland-Cliffs said it will cut its production by at least 2.0 million tons over the next six months. 

 "It is premature to make any projection as to which mines might be affected by production curtailments, but given the magnitude of the reduction in our sales outlook, significant curtailments are likely at most locations," the company said in a statement. 

 At the Cliffs and Associates Limited HBI plant in Trinidad and Tobago, the start-up problems have held back production but the project is expected to get "on track" in the year's second half so it can capitalise on an improved ferrous metallics business. 

 Ahead of the announcement, its stock closed unchanged at 36-11/16 on the New York Stock Exchange, about a third lower than where it traded a year ago.

 Ford CEO Warns Of Lower Bonuses Unless Results Rise

 DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co.'s chief executive has warned the company's roughly 50,000 white-collar workers in the U.S. that their 1999 bonuses won't be as high as expected unless corporate-performance indicators -- including profits -- improve. 

 Ford described an e-mail message sent by Chief Executive Jacques Nasser last month as an effort to refocus salaried workers on improving the business, not a profit warning. "This is not an indicator of a change in profit forecast," said a spokesman. "We're just trying to set some pretty high goals for people." 

 Mr. Nasser, who took over as CEO in January, is pushing the No. 2 auto maker hard to focus more on their consumers and post markedly higher profits. In an effort to motivate the white-collar ranks outside the top executive level, Ford this year replaced its profit-sharing program, under which salaried workers got an annual payment based strictly on corporate profits. Ford now offers performance bonuses, which are tied to the company hitting targets for profits, customer satisfaction and warranty costs, as well as personal performance. 

 Mr. Nasser's message warned that current results would mean that employees would get only 80% of their target bonuses. The message was first reported yesterday in the Detroit News. 

 Ford has made no public forecasts for profit this year, but the company hasn't discouraged securities analysts from predicting it will extend its string of 12 consecutive quarters of improved profits. According to First Call, analysts' consensus estimate for 1999 earnings is $5.55 per share, up from $5.28 in 1998. 

 Ford stock closed down 75 cents at $55.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, hurt along with other auto makers by concerns rising interest rates could cut into sales. Investors appeared unconcerned about the profit outlook. 

 "Everybody in Detroit is struggling for their stretch goals," said David Garrity, an auto analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. He said he is standing by his forecasts for the company. Mr. Garrity issued a report early yesterday rating Ford stock an "add." 

 General Motors Corp. has warned that the probability of hitting its most optimistic "stretch goals" is significantly lower than that of meeting traditional business goals. GM hasn't made public any traditional goals for 1999, however. GM officials have said they won't be able to meet their stretch target of 32% market share in the U.S. this year, but are confident of hitting the $4 billion goal for profits in North America.

 Dow seen higher, Philip Morris boosts trend.

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were seen opening higher with an upgrade in Philip Morris - a Dow stock - boosting the blue chips, but trading was expected to remain cautious with bond yields over 6 percent. 

 "The bond yields are taking a little bit of steam out of it," said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Philip Morris should help the Dow. We'll open higher unless the bonds break down," he added. 

 Philip Morris was trading at 40-1/8 on the Instinet electronic broker system, up from a close of 39-1/16 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral. 

 The long bond was down 6/32 to yield 6.01 percent. 

 June S&P Futures were up .50 points, indicating a slightly higher opening. 

 Meanwhile, news that BellSouth Corp. is considering acquiring Qwest Communications International Inc. after its recent decision to buy a 10 percent stake in the long-distance carrier is expected to add to the uptrend as well. 

 That merger news is expected to balance out a profit warning from Lockheed Martin. 

 "It looks like we'll have a slightly higher opening," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. "Today we do have an earnings warning but the possibility of the Qwest merger should balance that out." 

 Wall Street will keep a close watch on developments in Kosovo, the bond market and on several stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average. 

 Stocks took a beating on Tuesday after bond interest rates soared to the highest level in more than a year and heightened worries about the market's valuations. 

    The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 143.74 points, or 

  1.32 percent, at 10,765.64. 

    "Basically yesterday's debacle was from bond yields at 6 percent 

  and the selloff was overdone," said Cardillo. "We will keep a 

  close watch on Kosovo as well." 

    The Yugoslav military was still poring over a NATO plan for the 

 withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo early on Wednesday, a source at the talks told Reuters. 

 Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin Corp. said it was cutting its earnings outlook for 1999 and 2000 due to a faster-than-anticipated rate of increased costs and recent rocket-launch failures and subsequent delays of further launches and commercial satellite deliveries. 

 Elsewhere among the Dow stocks, International Business Machines Corp. said it had agreed to acquire Whistle Communications Inc., a maker of a new class of computers that supply Internet services targeted at small businesses. IBM closed at 116-3/8. 

 Eastman Kodak Co. said it would name Daniel Carp, its current president and chief operating officer, to the additional post of chief executive officer. 

 "We're going to get a positive opening, we've got a momentum see-saw going here and now we will go back up," said Thom Brown, managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood. The Tuesday selloff in stocks came on the heels of a jump in the yield for the benchmark U.S. 30-year bond to 6 percent, up from Monday's close of 5.97 percent. 

 The long bond was trading up 2/32 this morning to yield 5.99 percent.

 The US Airways Group Inc. said yesterday that its second-quarter profit might be as much as 16 percent less than analysts had forecast because of higher costs and fewer travelers than expected in May. US Airways said profit would be about $1.80 to $1.85 a share, less than the $2.15 forecast by analysts surveyed by the First Call Corporation and the $1.95 it earned a year earlier. Its shares fell $2.6875, or 5.2 percent, to $48.875, leading a decline in other airline stocks. The warning follows a similar announcement last week from the UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines.

LOCKHEED WARNS OF 2ND-QUARTER LOSS; STOCK PRICE FALLS

PRINCETON, N.J. - Lockheed Martin, the No. 2 U.S. aerospace company after Boeing, said it expects a second-quarter loss and said profit this year and next will be less than expected because of high costs and delayed deliveries.

Lockheed shares were down $5.75, or 14 percent, to $34.688 in late trading. That's the biggest one-day price drop since Lockheed's merger with Martin Marietta in March 1995 and the lowest price in more than 3 1/2 years.

The warning is Lockheed's fourth reduction of its 1999 profit estimates since November and raises questions about whether the company is managing its problems. It blamed delayed manufacturing of its C-130J cargo plane, fewer orders for its commercial satellites and postponed launches of its Atlas and Proton rockets.

"This (warning) is way beyond what I had ever thought," said Todd Ernst, a Prudential Securities analyst who has a "hold" rating on the stock.

Lockheed's profit has declined for the past five quarters. It said last week it will cut as many as 2,000 jobs because of slow sales and high costs for the C-130J.

It isn't the only big aerospace company that's retrenching: Boeing said last month it plans to eliminate 7,000 jobs at it military-aircraft division in St. Louis after losing a bid to sell its F-15 fighter jet to Greece.

Lockheed expects a loss of 10 cents to 15 cents a share in the second quarter, excluding nonrecurring items. It was expected to earn 72 cents, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call.

The company said it expects to earn at least $1.50 a share this year and at least $2.15 next year. Analysts expected earnings of $3.10 in 1999 and $3.39 in 2000, according to First Call.

Lockheed said in April that the delays and rising costs could cause it to miss the average earnings estimate of analysts for this year by 10 percent.

The company said the annual production rate of the C-130J this year will be between 16 and 19 aircraft, below the 24 it had projected. It also said it will have only eight launches of its Atlas rocket; earlier it projected as many as 12 launches.

Lockheed said excessive costs attributable to the C-130J will cut earnings by $275 million, or 70 cents a share, in 1999. Launch delays will cut earnings by $125 million, or 31 cents, and other performance issues will cut earnings by $205 million, or 54 cents.

In addition, previously expected gains from divestitures of $125 million, or 31 cents, might not materialize this year, it said.

 Lockheed Martin Forecasts 2nd-Quarter Loss, Surprising Wall Street

 BETHESDA, Md. -(Dow Jones)- Lockheed Martin Corp. Wednesday issued a profit warning that surprised even the most pessimistic on Wall Street, saying it will post a loss for the second quarter and that earnings for the next two years will fall dramatically short of current estimates. 

 The profit warning sent Lockheed shares (LMT) tumbling $5.563, or 13.7%, to $34.875. Trading volume of 10.5 million shares dwarfed the average daily turnover of 1.7 million shares. 

 The nation's second-largest aerospace company (LMT), which has suffered a recent string of missteps involving failed satellite launches and military-aircraft production problems, said it now expects to lose between 10 cents and 15 cents a share in the second quarter. Analysts surveyed by First Call were looking, on average, for a profit of 72 cents a share, compared with the year-ago quarter's $1.52 a share. 

 Looking ahead, Lockheed said it expects to earn at least $1.50 a diluted share in 1999 and at least $2.15 a share in 2000, excluding the impact of one-time and unusual items. The mean estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by First Call is for earnings of $3.10 a share in 1999 and $3.39 a share in 2000. For the year ended Dec. 31, 1998, the space, defense and information company earned $1 billion, or $2.63 a diluted share, on sales of $26.27 billion. The earnings outlook excludes most of the previously anticipated portfolio shaping gains to reflect the uncertain timing of these items. 

 "Clearly our forecasts about some key programs have not been realized, and we have not executed consistently across the Corporation to our expectations," said Vance Coffman, Lockheed Martin's chairman and chief executive officer. 

 The company attributed its reduced estimates to rising costs, recent launch-vehicle failures, delays in commercial satellite deliveries and problems with its C-130J transport aircraft program. 

 Earlier this week, Lockheed executives hoped to brighten Wall Street's grim view of the outlook for the aerospace and information company by raising the 1999 estimate of savings from its new efficiency initiatives to between $800 million and $1 billion from an earlier target of $650 million. The company had hoped to allay analysts' fears that it wouldn't be able to produce savings from its turnaround effort, which was instituted after its recent troubles. 

 The efficiency initiative, known as "LM21," is a centerpiece of Coffman's campaign to restore investor confidence in the company. It aims to save Lockheed as much as $3 billion during the next few years. It would require the most efficient practices in various units to be spread over every department in the diversified producer of military aircraft, rockets, satellites and information and telecommunications services, from fighter-jet design engineering to weapons production. 

 But in an indication that further setbacks were possible, Lockheed last Friday said it would cut nearly 20% of its work force at its Marietta, Ga., operations. The move, which affected 2,000 jobs, was aimed at ensuring the company would stay within its established budget for developing the Air Force's next-generation F-22 fighter jet. 

 "They have got a bunch of problems to solve and none of it is going to happen that quickly," said John Pincavage, an analyst for Warburg Dillon Reed LLC. "It will carry on through 1999 and 2000 and at this point, we don't know if it will go on longer than that." 

 Separately, Lockheed also announced that it agreed to sell its Sanders Telecommunications Systems business to Transcept Inc., a newly formed affiliate of investment firm Spencer Trask & Co. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. 

 Lockheed said that when the transaction closes, Transcept will be jointly owned by Spencer Trask, Lockheed Martin and financial investors. The company expects the sale to close in July. 

 The company said it expects Transcept's operations to continue at the current site in Manchester, N.H., for the near term. About 50 Sanders employees will transfer to Transcept, Lockheed said.

 United starts summer fare sale, others follow suit.

 CHICAGO, June 8 (Reuters) - United Airlines, the world's largest carrier which last week said its second-quarter earnings would fall below analysts' estimates, said on Tuesday it would cut fares an average of 25 percent for the summer and other airlines quickly followed suit. 

 AMR Corp.'s  American Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc.  and Houston-based Continental Airlines Inc.  said they would match the sale by United, a unit of UAL Corp. . Northwest Airlines Corp.  and U.S. Airways Group Inc.'s   USAir also matched, as is typical with a fare sale. 

 While the sale appears to be more extensive than a sale announced last month by Northwest Airlines, analysts noted that it comes off a higher base, as airlines raised their regularly scheduled fares over the Memorial Day weekend. 

 "It's one, coming off a higher fare base and two, a year ago, they were steeper," Glenn Engel, analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said, comparing the sale to cuts at this time last year. 

 Aside from cutting fares, United's sale also allows a flier to bring up to two companions at even cheaper prices. While Northwest had also offered less expensive companion fares last month, those were limited to children, while United's has no age restriction, a United spokesman said. 

 A reduced round-trip fare from New York to Chicago is $238 excluding taxes and fees, with companions travelling for $138. Fares must be bought at least 14 days in advance and not later than June 18. In addition, air fares available from United's Web site are also on sale from the newly expanded Los Angeles hub. 

 The nationwide fares are available between June 22 and Sept. 30, require a Saturday night stay and are nonrefundable. United said they are valid on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays, with the prices higher on other days. All international fares are subject to additional charges. An example of a New York to London fare is $398. 

 Airlines in general have seen their revenues hit as low-fare carriers are enticing customers away and businesses cut down on travel expenses, while added capacity means more seats need to be filled. 

 "The biggest risk isn't the fares, it's people trading down," Engel said, referring to business passengers seeking less expensive seats than typical last-minute business fares. 

 Aside from United's profit warning, American Airlines has also warned about revenues and on Tuesday, US Airways Group Inc. said its profits for the quarter would fall below analysts' estimates because of unexpectedly light traffic in May. 

 UAL shares were down $2.125 at $64.25 on Tuesday afternoon. AMR was down $2.1875 at $67.50, Delta was down $1.375 at $59.625, US Airways was down $2.0625 at $49.50 and Northwest was down $1.25 at $31.25.

 Hotel industry braces for slip in revenue growth.

 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Hotels are bracing for a slight fall off in revenue growth for the rest of 1999, triggered by an abundant supply of rooms and uncertainty in the U.S. economy, according to industry executives and analysts. 

 And hospitality industry executives are not sure how long the lull will last, though they say some regional hot spots continue to boom. 

 Both hotel and resort companies and the Wall Street analysts who track them agree that occupancy rates for the second half of 1999 will slip. While bookings soften as the year closes out, revenue per available room, or RevPar - a key measure of hotels' fiscal health, will fall. A slow down in earnings growth is set to follow. 

 Jason Ader, a senior leisure analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co., said earnings growth for hotel companies in 1999 will come in below the robust 15 percent growth they enjoyed in 1998. 

 "With the slowed RevPar trends and supply growth, and what looks like an economy that may be negatively impacted by rising interest rates, our expectations are only for 10 to 12 percent earnings growth this year," he said, speaking at New York University's Hospitality Industry Investment Conference here. 

 "Our outlook is less optimistic than it had been just six months ago," he said. 

 Supply growth is starting to slow, Ader said noting that he expects about 3.5 percent more hotel rooms to open in 1999 among all classes of hotels. Room supply grew at 4 percent in 1998. 

 "The good news from an investment perspective is those numbers are down a bit from last year," he said. "Our expectation is that those supply numbers will shrink, finding equilibrium sometime around 2001." 

 Another investment banking firm, BT Alex. Brown, has pegged supply growth for the year at 3.7 percent. For 2000, BT Alex. Brown predicts supply growth at 2.8 percent. 

 Others, primarily hotel executives, say the downturn should not last that long, noting that a number of markets - Atlanta and Phoenix, for example - are still hot for new development and ripe for hotel expansion. 

 Chief operating officer of Equity Inns Inc. , Howard Silver, agrees that "supply is the issue" in the industry overall. But, he said, his company pegs the downturn in revenue growth ending sometime within the next year. 

 Still, as the heads of many hotels discuss the fear of overbuilding and the effects of the industry slowdown, they were clear to point out that this downturn does not compare with the massive oversupply of the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

 "With the downturn, we can see where we've overbuilt and where we have not," said Horst Schulze, president of Host Marriott Corp.'s Ritz-Carlton Hotel Co. "But the danger now is not as great as in the 1980s." 

 The discussion comes on the heels of Promus Hotel Corp.'s  move to cut its earnings targets for 1999 and 2000 because of softness in second quarter hotel revenues. 

 In its profit warning late last month, Promus blamed most of the reduction in its projected growth on internal issues at its Doubletree hotel line. Some of the drop, however, was linked to industry wide weakness, it said.

 USAir Says 2nd-Quarter Earnings Will Fall Far Short Of Estimates

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- US Airways Group Inc. on Tuesday became the latest airline to issue a profit warning, saying it expects second-quarter earnings to fall short of analysts' expectations by as much as 16% because of softer-than-expected traffic and higher-than-anticipated expenses. 

 In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, US Airways (U), the nation's sixth-largest air carrier, said it sees second-quarter earnings totaling about $1.80 to $1.85 a diluted share, excluding items. That compares with the $2.15-a-share mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call and the $1.95 a share the airline earned a year ago. 

 Last week, Arlington, Va.-based US Air issued a somewhat discouraging 1.2% drop in May traffic from the year-ago period. That suggested a slimmer second-quarter top line. But lower ticket prices stemming from stepped-up competition led to the company's Monday evening declaration of bottom-line weakness, said Thomas Longman, analyst with Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder. 

 The profit warning from US Air comes just days after Chicago-based UAL Corp. (UAL), the parent of No. 1 carrier United Airlines, warned that second-quarter and full-year profit would fall below expectations as well because of weak domestic revenue in May and other factors. UAL put second-quarter profit at between $2.40 and $2.80 a fully distributed share, down from its previous forecast that earnings would be "broadly in line" with 1998 second-quarter results of $3.24 a fully distributed share. 

 The airline said it reduced its year-over-year capacity growth forecast for 1999 to 6%, with 5% growth in the second quarter, 8% in the third and 6% in the fourth. It didn't cite a previous forecast in its filing. 

 On the bright side, analysts said the slowdown in capacity growth should help ease some glutted East Coast markets, improving profit margins at US Airways and boding well for the entire industry. 

 In addition to weaker traffic, earnings were hurt by higher costs, driven by the resolution of certain labor contracts earlier than planned, US Airways said. Expenses associated with the company's transition to a new computer system also contributed to the increase in expenses, the airline said. 

 Risks remain for the company beyond the second quarter, analysts warned. 

 "In contrast to other airlines, US Airways bookings suggest continued downward pressure on load factors in the summer," wrote Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Glenn Envy in a research note. He kept his investment rating at "market performer", but lowered his 1999 earnings-per-share estimate to $4.75 a share from $5.00. That is below First Call's previous target of $5.75 and the company's 1998 bottom-line profit of $5.60 a share, which included a $3 million rent expense credit. 

 Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette analyst James Higgins, meanwhile, reduced his second-quarter forecast to $1.85 from $2.10 and cut his 1999 forecast to $5.40 from $6.05. 

 "With the change in our earnings forecast, we are now pushing into the fourth quarter the period in which we expect operating earnings to turn up at US Airways," said Higgins, who left his US Airways stock rating at "buy" and his 12-month price target at $60. 

 Buckingham Research analyst Helane Becker noted, however, that the company's planned share-repurchase program could alter those earnings-per-share figures. She currently projects 1999 earnings of $5.50 a share but added, "we're not convinced it will stay that way." 

 Wary investors sent shares of US Airways (U) down $2.688, or 5.2%, to close at $48.875. 

 Meanwhile, the way the profit warning was disseminated could raise some eyebrows among watchdogs of corporate practices. 

 After Monday's close, the company faxed a letter to analysts and certain investors, but didn't broadly distribute the news until Tuesday morning, and then only through an 8-K filing with the SEC, skipping the more conventional practice of issuing a press release. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission has warned companies to be careful about how material information is disseminated, since those who get an early word about an important development at a company could purchase or sell the stock at the expense of those who haven't yet learned the news, along the lines of insider trading. 

 But there is a fine line in what can be deemed providing the analyst community "guidance" and what is considered "material"; materiality is ultimately determined by the courts, an SEC spokesman said. He declined to comment on the materiality of US Airways' news dissemination. 

 Asked why US Air didn't issue a press release, a spokesman said "the 8K was filed (Tuesday) morning, well before the market opened, in compliance with the law and our own standards for full and prompt disclosure." 

 Separately Tuesday, the airline said it is offering $338 round-trip fares for tickets bought via the Internet for travel between Los Angeles and six eastern cities, including Baltimore, Boston, New York, Newark, N.J., Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Tickets, which must be purchased by June 13, have to be booked at least 14 days before departure. Travel using the Internet fare tickets are valid between June 24 and Sept. 30.

 FOCUS-Reed shares dive on  profit warning .

 LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - Anglo-Dutch publishing group Reed Elsevier warned on Monday that 1999 profits were likely to fall below last year's level, sending its shares spinning lower. 

 The firm blamed tougher-than-expected competition at its U.S. Lexis-Nexis legal database unit and weak advertising revenues at business-to-business publisher Cahners Business Information. 

 "These revenue trends currently indicate that the results for the combined businesses of Reed Elsevier are likely to be lower in the year to December 31, 1999 than those achieved in 1998," it said ahead of an analysts' briefing in New York. 

 Shares in Reed International Plc, the London arm of the group, were the biggest decliners in the FTSE 100 index, dropping 29 pence or six percent to 452p by the close. Elsevier NV stock shed 35 cents or 2.8 percent to 12.00 euros in Amsterdam. 

 Analysts at brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette downgraded both shares to "underperform" from "market perform". 

 Anthony de Larrinaga, media analyst at WestLB Panmure, said he was lopping eight percent off his 1999 profit forecast for the group following the warning, after previously predicting flat results this year. 

 De Larrinaga now expects the group to report pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items of 720 million pounds ($1.16 billion) down from 773 million pounds in 1998. 

 "We were aware that life was getting a lot tougher for them this year and I did factor in a 15 percent decline in profits this year for Lexis-Nexis, but clearly it's going to be more than that," he said. 

 Dutch broker Insinger trimmed its forecast of 1999 earnings per share to 57 cents from 60 cents. 

 Reed-Elsevier, which in March said it expected no significant profit growth during the current year, gave no details of the scale of the likely profit fall. 

 It said Lexis-Nexis was facing a more difficult competitive environment in U.S. legal and online business, which media analysts put down to fierce competition from rival online legal publisher Westlaw, owned by Thomson. 

 Cahners, meanwhile, whose titles include Variety and a range of specialist business and travel publications, is struggling in the face of weak advertising trends. Its advertising revenues turned down in the second half of 1998 and the poor conditions have continued into 1999. 

 Jeremy Andrews, of stockbroker Greig Middleton, said Reed-Elsevier was being hit by the explosive growth of the Internet, which has raised competition and placed growing demands on publishers. 

 "Reed along with a number of other media companies is becoming a victim of the Internet and it is showing through in the figures...The problem with electronic delivery is that customers want more and more and don't want to pay for it," he said. 

 Investors were also disgruntled by confusion surrounding the release of the profit warning. "The issues are understood but the further muddle in terms of handling investor relations will cause some concern," said Nick Ward, analyst at Commerzbank Global Equities. 

 At the end of May, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported Reed-Elsevier had told investors net profits would fall 10 percent in 1999 because of disappointing returns from Lexis-Nexis and weak advertising in Britain. The Dutch arm of the group at the time dismissed the newspaper report. 

 The company, which has been searching for a new chief executive for the past 10 months, said it would make a full trading statement along with its interim results on August 5. ($1=.6222 Pound).

 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - European ADRs, or American Depositary Receipts, climbed Monday amid talk of consolidation in the oil sector and merger speculation in the telecommunications industry. 


The Bank of New York's index of leading European ADRs	    rose 0.25 percent to 132.40 while the index of Latin American ADRs  climbed 0.24 percent to 94.14. The Dow	  rose 57.30 to 10,857.


 The euro hit fresh lows on the suspension of talks to end the war in Kosovo, but U.S. ADR traders downplayed the significance of the suspension for ADRs for the time being. 

 "The euro does not seem to be a major theme on ADRs. Most of today's themes are outside of the currencies. Acer's  gains (after its deal with IBM  ) is taking anything related to chips and technology up. The oil and gas consolidation with Elf Aquitaine and others is another theme and telecoms are another story," said one ADR trader. 

 The market has lost is recent nervousness, he added. 

 BG PLC   rose 1-7/16 to 29-9/16 on speculation Royal Dutch/Shell Group  could try to buy the company. Both firms declined comment. Royal Dutch ADRs rose 7/8 to 59-3/16. 


Elf Aquitaine   ADRs rose amid the French firm's increased bid for oil firm Saga Petroleum ASA	



Deutsche Telekom   ADRs rose 3/4 to 41-3/8 amid speculation it was making a possible bid for Energis . The German firm denied the speculation.



Vodafone Group   ADRs rallied 2-1/2 to 204-7/8 on positive comments from analysts who expect strong first-year results.



News of Taiwanese Acer Inc.'s $8 billion, 7-year deal with IBM to buy each other's equipment buoyed other semiconductor chip stocks, ADR traders said.



Baan Co   ADRs rose 1-1/4 to 15-1/16. SAP AG   rose 3/8 to 32-3/4.



On the downside, Reed International PLC   was one of the largest percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange, with its ADRs down 2-1/8 at 28-3/4. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette cut its rating on the stock to underperform from market perform after the company's profit warning.



In Latin America, traders kept an eye on U.S. markets and upcoming economic data because many of the region's markets would be vulnerable to a U.S. interest rate hike.



Telefonos de Mexico		ADRs rose 15/16 to 76 in thin trade.

 UAL warning fuels fears for U.S. airline outlook.

 (Stands for scheduled AIRLINES-PROFITS) 

 NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - A profit warning from the world's largest airline signals a turbulent summer for U.S. carriers that face competition from discount airlines amid lingering concerns about a surge in airline seats. 

 United Airlines' profit warning late Friday followed a warning about revenues last month from the No. 2 U.S. carrier American Airlines, and sent airline stocks down in early trade on Monday before they turned up late in the afternoon. 

 "It's clear that there's some pressure on profitability in the industry," said David Swierenga, senior economist for the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group. "Revenues are increasing slowly, but costs are being driven up more rapidly," he said. 

 But even though the misfortunes could hold back some of the fare increases the industry usually enjoys each year, shares in United's parent, UAL Corp., finished 56 cents higher at $66.38. 

 United said discount carriers hurt its domestic traffic in May, though it declined to name the carriers. United competes with the low-priced carriers, Midway and Frontier, at its hubs in Chicago and Denver respectively. 

 Wall Street analysts said United's warning fuels investor worries, which began in mid-May with unexpectedly weak passenger traffic figures and with a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit against American Airlines . 

 The lawsuit, which alleges that American illegally drove out smaller airlines from its Dallas hub, was followed a week later by industry figures showing April's industry-wide decline in passenger traffic was nearly double what analysts had forecasted. 

 Wall Street got a further warning a day later, when American parent AMR Corp told analysts that its revenue performance in April was weaker than that of its peers. 


Since mid-May airline stocks have fallen nearly 11 percent, as measured by the XAL	  index of airline stocks.



However, on Monday airline stocks ended higher buoyed by a broader market rally and by what some analysts said may have been positive comments made during a transportation conference in New York from which reporters were barred. Shares of AMR rose $1.19 to $69.69, while shares of Delta Air Lines Inc., the No. 3 U.S. carrier, ended $1.81 to $61.



But analysts are still cautious about passenger traffic and revenues, which have been weak despite three fare increases this year that have boosted average leisure fares by about 11 percent.



"The second quarter numbers have absolutely been coming down for the airlines," said Helane Becker, airline analyst at Buckingham Research.



Meanwhile, the growth rate in the supply of airline seats has nearly doubled over last year, and fuel costs, the industry's second-largest operating expense after labour, have risen about 40 percent since the first quarter.



Additionally, business travel - which industry-wide represents 40 to 45 percent of the seat volume but up to 70 percent of revenues - has been weak as U.S. firms continue to put a lid on corporate travel budgets.



Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel said there are signs that business travel has improved. But, he added: "The question is, how much will business travel rebound as '99 progresses."



The industry's worries could be good news for consumers, however.



Airlines raise fares five or six times in a typical year, but some analysts said the industry could have a hard time raising fares a fourth time this year if demand remains soft and the growth in airline seats accelerates in the second half.



"I think the airlines are going to attempt another fare increase to offset ... rising oil prices, but if demand continues to be lackluster, it becomes less likely that a fare hike will succeed," said BT Alex Brown analyst Susan Donofrio.

 U.S. Firm to Buy British Textile Maker

 Battered by weak markets, troubled industrial threads and knitwear group Hicking Pentecost has bowed to a UKpound 58 million rescue bid from Wall Street rival Ruddick Corporation. 

 "Was it an opportunistic move by them? I suppose most people like to get their timing right," said Hicking chairman Tudor Davies. 

 His board is urging shareholders to accept the 175 pence-a- share cash offer, a 47 1/2 pence premium to the overnight price. It would be folly to refuse. 

 Hicking issued a profit warning last July and axed jobs in a bid to cut manufacturing costs. Profits for the year to March collapsed from UKpound 9.5 million to UKpound 4.7 million. Sales fell 8 percent to UKpound 125 million. 

 Significantly, two of Hicking's major shareholders are fund managers M&G and Prudential, with 16 percent between them. The groups are poised to merge, leaving them with dominant stakes in many medium-sized companies with poor records. 

 Brokers expect a round of bids for these companies as the fund giant unloads its holdings and reinvests elsewhere. 

 Glamorgan-based Hicking's shares have fallen from a peak of 386 pence in 1996. Before yesterday's offer, they were selling on a miserly multiple of just over five-times earnings. A swansong dividend of 5.6 pence keeps the total unchanged at 8.3 pence.

Short-term rates hit 9-month high

WASHINGTON - Interest rates on short-term treasury securities rose in Tuesday's auction to the highest level in nearly nine months.

The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 4.620 percent, up from 4.495 percent last week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 4.750 percent, up from 4.570 percent.

The three-month rate was the highest since Sept. 21, when the bills sold for 4.635 percent. The six-month rate was the highest since last Sept. 14, when the rate was 4.755.

The Federal Reserve said that the average yield for one-year treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.93 percent from 4.89 percent.

Chemical firms reach merger accord

STAMFORD, Conn. - Crompton & Knowles Corp. and Witco Corp. agreed Tuesday to a merger valued at $1.96 billion, forming one of the world's 10 largest specialty chemicals makers and helping the former rivals cut costs.

Each share of Witco will be traded for 0.9242 share, or about $978.9 million based on Crompton's closing share price Friday, in the new company called C&K Witco, which will also assume $979 million in Witco debt. Crompton shareholders will own 55 percent, and Witco shareholders will own the rest.

Shares in Crompton rose 1 1/4 to 19 5/8, while Witco shares rose 15/16 to 18 7/16.

Rite Aid restates 3 years of earnings

CAMP HILL, Pa. - Rite Aid Corp., the third-largest U.S. drugstore chain, Tuesday restated its last three years of earnings after a review of its accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Fiscal 1999 earnings were lowered by 9 percent, 1998 earnings were cut by 3.3 percent and 1997 earnings were raised slightly. Most of the last two years' restatements were to change accounting for acquisitions, store closings and relocations.

Rite Aid bought several chains in recent years. Analysts said in March that the SEC was investigating Rite Aid's acquisition accounting, after the company issued a profit warning that rocked its share price.

Rite Aid's shares rose 1 11/16 to 26 11/16.

AmSouth to create regional banking giant

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - AmSouth Bancorp plans to buy First American Corp. of Tennessee in a $5.3 billion stock deal, creating one the largest banks in the Southeast.

The deal will create a bank with $40 billion in assets and 680 branches in nine Southeastern states, including the fast-growing markets of Tennessee and Florida.

The acquisition was originally worth $6.3 billion, but investors pushed shares of AmSouth down nearly 14 percent Tuesday.

AmSouth shares fell 3 15/16 to 24 7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. First American stock rose 2 13/16 to 43 5/8, also on the NYSE.

Despite the AmSouth decline, analysts said the acquisition had the potential to make the Birmingham-based bank a regional powerhouse.

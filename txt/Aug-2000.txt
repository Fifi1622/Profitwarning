 NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Shares of Gap Inc. hit a 52-week low on Thursday, falling more than 15 percent as analysts downgraded the youth-oriented retailer after it reported a sharp drop in August sales, and amid a weaker retail sector. 

 Shares of the San Francisco-based retail giant dropped $3-14/16 to $21-9/16, well below the previous year-low of $25-1/16, and making it the second-largest percentage loser and third-largest net loser on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Gap closed on Wednesday at $25-7/16 and fell in after-hours trading after it issued a business outlook warning and reported disappointing sales, citing poor performance at Old Navy stores, marketing problems and "less momentum in back-to-school sales." 

 One analyst said Gap's problems were "predominantly Gap-specific" and not industry wide. 

 "While Gap cited reduced traffic and slower consumer spending as reasons for its disappointment, we are not convinced that these conditions pervade the entire speciality retail industry," said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Richard Baum in a note. 

 Gap led a decline in high-profile retail stocks on Thursday, as investors digested mixed August sales figures. Abercrombie & Fitch and Target Corp. were delayed in opening trading. When Abercrombie opened it fell 3 to $22-1/4, after reporting a 3 percent decrease in August sales. Target dropped $3-13/16 to $22-1/8, on a profit warning. 

 Speigel Group Inc. , which sells clothes and furnishing through catalogues and its Eddie Bauer stores, slipped in opening trading after reporting a 20 percent fall in August sales. 

 Gap said its same-store sales fell 14 percent in August from last year amid "uncertainties" in apparel retailing, adding that it faced "risks and challenges" in the third and fourth quarters. This was the second time this month the company had warned about a difficult business environment. 

 Gap's Old Navy stores performed worse than its other brands in August with same-store sales dropping by an amount in the mid-20 percent range. 

 Gap was also hit by analyst downgrades from Credit Suisse First Boston, Banc of America and Salomon Smith Barney. 

 CSFB's Richard Baum downgraded Gap to a hold from buy, and cut earnings estimates for fiscal 2000 to $1.25 from $1.35, and reduced fiscal 2001 estimates to $1.60 from $1.70. 

 Baum said Gap merchandise was not marketed well, and the retailer experienced particular weakness in denim. 

 "When Gap does not success at the basics, they do not typically produce positive overall results," Baum said. 

 Banc of America also downgraded Gap to market perform from buy and Salomon Smith Barney cut Gap to neutral from buy. 

 Merrill Lynch cut earnings estimates for fiscal 2000 by 9 cents, to $1.28. 

 "We believe the stock will be challenged to outperform until there are sign of revitalisation within Old Navy and therefore are maintaining immediate term rating of neutral," Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note.

 Recall Won't Solve Michelin's Problems --- Firestone's Woes Offer Only Temporary Boost --- French Tire Maker Continues to Contend With Rising Raw-Material Costs

 PARIS -- Groupe Michelin will get a temporary boost from Firestone's recall woes, but that won't be enough to offset the difficulties that prompted the French tire maker to issue a profit warning in July. 

 Michelin will increase production of some tire models five-fold over the next three months to help replace the 6.5 million light-truck tires recalled by Bridgestone Corp.'s Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. unit. 

 Earlier this month, Bridgestone/Firestone asked Michelin to help supply replacements for the recalled tires. A letter from Pete Selleck, head of Michelin's small tire business in North America, on the company's Web site explains that Firestone has agreed to reimburse customers up to $100 (111.17 euros) per tire if they buy Michelin replacements. 

 To make room for additional truck tire capacity, the French company is shifting manufacturing of some other products out of three factories in Oklahoma, Alabama and Nova Scotia, says Nancy Banks, a spokeswoman at Michelin headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand, France. 

 Michelin has extended the hours of its U.S. consumer hotline to handle a 30% increase in calls from drivers of Ford trucks anxious to replace faulty Firestone tires suspected of causing hundreds of accidents and 62 deaths. 

 Michelin will temporarily increase its 23% share of the $22.5 billion U.S. tire market thanks to the recall, industry analysts say. But they also figure Bridgestone/Firestone will fight to regain lost ground once the recall crisis dies down, perhaps by next spring. And Ford, for which Bridgestone/Firestone is the No. 1 tire supplier with 35% of the company's business, is considered unlikely to reverse decades of close ties with Firestone by turning over big contracts to rivals. 

 Moreover, the entire tire industry is being squeezed by raw materials prices, which have risen as much as 10% from a year ago. So far, tire makers have been unable to pass those higher costs on to consumers. 

 "Michelin, along with Goodyear, is in the best position to gain from Firestone's problems," says Gregory Melich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. "But the tire industry still faces a lot of challenges. Oil prices are going up and it remains a fiercely competitive business." 

 Indeed, Michelin management cut production in June, in large part because of weakness in the key North American market, and followed in July with a profit warning. The company said operating profit for the first half of the year would fall short of last year's equivalent-period figure of 611 million euros. It also said it would miss its goal of 9.5% operating margins for the full year. 

 Analysts, who chopped earnings estimates by as much as 20% after the warning, say the benefit from additional truck tire sales during the rest of the year will be modest. Investors seem to agree. Michelin shares, which dropped 14% after the profit warning to 32 euros a share, have only regained some of the lost ground since the Firestone recall was announced. In trading on the Paris Bourse Tuesday, the company's stock fell 1.5% at 34.68 euros. 

 Meanwhile, to meet the increased demand for truck tires, Michelin has added production hours at the plants that produce them. Its North American factories are now operating at 100% capacity with employees working three shifts a day, seven days a week, said Ms. Banks, the spokeswoman. The company has also ordered additional tire molds for those plants, which will raise production capacity further as they arrive over the next months. 

 It will take some months for Michelin and other tire makers to work through the spike in demand. The 6.5-million-tire recall amounts to about 2% of all car and light truck tire sales in North America in a year, say analysts. It takes a typical factory about a year to build that many tires, according to Michelin. 

 But while they scramble to boost production, Michelin's executives are concerned that customers will view the company as taking advantage of Firestone's woes. Mr. Selleck declined to be interviewed for this article. "This is obviously going to make our sales figures go up," said Ms. Banks. "But it is not the way any manufacturer wants to gain market share. It's not something we're gloating about." 

 Michelin, which started by building bicycle tires a century ago, has long been publicity shy. But the arrival last year of 36-year-old Edouard Michelin at the head of the company is slowly beginning to change that. Mr. Michelin, who ran the company's North American operation a decade ago, is trying to foster more open relations with the investors and analysts. For example, after Michelin announced its profitwarning, the company took the unusual step of inviting a group of analysts to its headquarters in central France to answer questions.

 U.S. stocks seen opening lower, market eyes bank deal.

 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Stocks were seen edging down at the opening on Wednesday as investors square positions after the market's recent run-up, while they fret over the cloudy outlook for earnings in the days to come. 

 News of a major merger in the investment banking sector drew Wall Street's attention in the hours before the opening. 

 Credit Suisse,, confirmed it will buy U.S. investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette for $11.5 billion. 

 "Its certainly going to be a focal point for traders, because they don't have anything to chew on," said Paul Cherney, market analyst at S&P Marketscope. 

 Credit Suisse also said it planned a retention fund of $1.2 billion to help keep DLJ staff in its bid to propel Credit Suisse First Boston, its investment banking arm, into the ranks of Wall Street's premier investment banks. 

 DLJ's shares shot sharply higher on Tuesday as talk of the merger swirled through Wall Street. 

 Just ahead of the opening, the Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for September were down 5.50 points at 1512.80, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures were off 13.00 points at 3,963.50. 

 But stocks will likely continue to be whipsawed in thin trading with many market participants on vacation ahead of the long U.S. Labour Day weekend. Financial markets are slated to be closed on Monday, Sept. 4. 

 "Volume is so light," said Larry Wachtel at Prudential Securities. "You're certainly overdue for some kind of pullback, but these are the last two days of the month, and you sometimes get some very quirky things happening." 

 Worries about corporate profits, which have dogged Wall Street in recent months amid signs of a slower U.S. economic expansion, could reemerge after a profit warning from appliance maker Whirlpool. 

 Whirlpool said on Wednesday its earnings for the third and fourth quarter will fall well below Wall Street estimates, hit by Circuit City Stores Inc.'s decision to quit selling major appliances. 

 Later on Wednesday, at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT), investors will take a look at the U.S. leading indicators report for July. 

 Economists in a recent Reuters survey predicted a 0.1 percent decline in leading indicators vs an unchanged reading in June. 

 But the report is unlikely to stand out amid the rush of economic data scheduled for this week, with the closely watched U.S. employment report for August expected on Friday, traders said. 

 On Tuesday, fresh U.S. housing data stirred concern about the direction of interest rates when the figures showed new home sales surged to their highest level in seven years in July, helping send blue chips stocks lower. 

 Some analysts said the data, which indicated the U.S. economy continues to run at a solid clip, may have shaken the market's conviction that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady for now, although some called it an excuse for traders to take profits on the market's climb in recent weeks. 

 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) finished down 37.74 points, or 0.34 percent, at 11,215.10. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) held a small loss of 4.25 points, or 0.28 percent, at 1,509.84. 

 But the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC) finished up 11.58 points, or 0.28 percent, at 4,082.17. 

 Earlier in the week, major stock indices rose to their highest levels since this spring, lifted on Wall Street's growing belief that the Fed was through hiking interest rates, at least until after the presidential election in November.

 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Stocks were expected to tick a touch lower at the start of trading on Wednesday as investors cash in on solid gains in recent weeks and fret over the outlook for corporate profits in the quarters ahead. 

 "After an 8.6 percent pullback in the Nasdaq since August 10, you'd expect some profit-taking to come in and it's here today," said Larry Wachtel at Prudential Securities. 

 But stocks will likely continue to be whipsawed in thinned trading conditions with many market participants on vacation ahead of the long U.S. Labour Day weekend. Financial markets are slated to be closed on Monday, Sept. 4.

 Talk of a major merger in the investment banking sector is also likely to draw Wall Street's attention in early trading. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment banking arm of Switzerland's No. 2 bank Credit Suisse, is expected to announce a bid to buy U.S. investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette at a press conference on Wednesday morning, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. 

 The deal, valued at $90 a share, or around $12.5 billion, aims to propel Credit Suisse into the ranks of Wall Street's premier investment banks, the source said. 

 DLJ's shares shot sharply higher on Tuesday as talk of the merger swirled through Wall Street.

 Ways to Brighten a Dull Household-Goods Sector

 NEW YORK -- First the pantry, now the space underneath the kitchen sink. 

 Much in the same way that major merger activity has swallowed up the food sector in recent months, similar consolidation could sweep through the household-goods group, albeit not in the immediate future. The sector -- feeling the pressure from growing retailers, declining volume levels and the need for global breadth -- has seen profits take a punch over the last few years. 

 The industry, once characterized by consistent double-digit earnings growth, is struggling to achieve single-digit profit gains. Among the profit-warning weary: Procter & Gamble Co., Gillette Co. and Dial Corp. 

 Mergers, say several investors, analysts and fund managers, could unlock earnings power. With partnerships, manufacturers could level the playing field against bigger supermarket chains, open opportunities overseas and cut costs substantially. 

 Perhaps one of the biggest proponents of consolidation in the household-goods group is Banc of America Securities LLC analyst William Steele. In a 239-page report titled "Global Consumer Products: A `Brand' New Industry Ahead," Mr. Steele writes that "significant" merger and acquisition activity will take place over the next few years. 

 "Larger companies will shed tertiary brands, international companies will merge with complementary North American companies and middle-tier companies will redefine their core categories," he writes. 

 Mr. Steele supports his thesis by discussing the lack of consistent earnings, which he attributes to a loss of pricing power, consolidation by retailers and a lack of new markets. He believes that mergers and acquisitions over the next 12 to 18 months "will be driven by companies seeking to achieve an ideal mix of brands and categories." 

 So what is going to happen, he says, is that large companies will divest noncore brands and focus on main businesses. Evidence of this strategy appeared as recently as this week, when P&G, Cincinnati, said it may sell its Clearasil acne-treatment brand. 

 In the next group of large companies, including such household names as Kimberly-Clark Co, Irving, Texas, Gillette, Boston, and Colgate-Palmolive Co., New York, mergers are also possible, Mr. Steele writes. European companies are seen merging with North American concerns to form stronger global partnerships. Also middle-tier companies will either be bought or buy brands to create dominant franchises within certain categories. 

 Mr. Steele's hypothesis about the future of the group is arguably the sharpest-toned out there. But there are others who support the notion that consolidation eventually will happen. They're just waiting for matters to go from bad to worse. 

 For example, Greg Fontana, a buy-side analyst for John Hancock Funds, which owns such consumer-products stocks as Estee Lauder Cos., New York, and Clorox Co., Oakland, Calif., says there "possibly" may be consolidation in the sector, but "there would have to be more pain in the group for that to happen." 

 Meaning, the consumer group is going to have to hit a low similar to the one reached by the food sector, which put up with declines in volume, sales, profits and stock prices for years before the chief executives of some of the major players finally decided to relinquish independence and merge with another. 

 Among the most notable food acquisitions: New York's Philip Morris Cos.'s purchase of Nabisco Holdings Corp., Unilever's buy of Bestfoods, and Diageo PLC's, sale of its Pillsbury unit to General Mills Inc., Minneapolis. All took place more than a year and a half after Wall Street first started publicly clamoring for consolidation in the food industry. 

 There are some related examples playing out in the household-goods industry. Among them: Dial, P&G, Clorox and Gillette. From profit warnings to management upheavals to underwhelming acceptance and integration of acquisitions, these companies have been underperformers in the last year. 

 So what's a consumer-products company to do? What is its breaking point? 

 The chief executives "get so frustrated that the stock isn't going up -- and not just going up, going down, even as they [may] deliver good earnings," says Marvin Roffman, president of Roffman Miller Associates, which among other stocks owns Sara Lee Corp. P&G and Gillette. "Yes, I see consolidation happening."

 Wachovia to eliminate 1,800 jobs

 Wachovia Corp., North Carolina's third-largest banker, said Monday that it will fire 1,800 employees, 8.5 percent of its work force, in an effort to boost lackluster earnings. 

 The announcement comes toward the end of a turbulent summer in which Charlotte-based First Union and Bank of America announced major job cuts. 

 "If you live in North Carolina and you happen to be in the banking business, then there's a good chance you're worried about keeping your job," said Tony Plath, assistant professor of banking at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 

 Wachovia, which has 30 Triangle branches and the region's largest share of deposits, will do its heaviest job cutting at its headquarters in Winston-Salem. There, the company plans to eliminate 365 of its 5,140 jobs. 

 The Triangle will largely escape the reductions, said Jack Clayton, executive in charge of Wachovia's central region. The company will cut 10 of its 780 positions in the Triangle, less than 2 percent of its work force. 

 In all, about 800 North Carolinians will lose their jobs. Companywide, about 65 percent of the layoffs will be in middle to upper management, and 35 percent will be "front-line" employees such as tellers, back office personnel and loan officers, Wachovia spokesman Jay Reed said. 

 All of the state's three largest banks have been looking for ways to increase earnings and prop up stock prices as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and the economy cools. A slowing economy can reduce demand for banking services and make it more difficult for customers to repay loans. 

 Wachovia's stock, which closed virtually unchanged at $56.81 on Monday, has not recovered from the profit warning it issued in June, when it said its earnings would fall short of the expected $1.34 a share. Its share price has lost almost 20 percent since then. 

 Wachovia's second quarter profit fell 44 percent to $137.6 million, 68 cents a share, from $247.6 million, $1.21 a share, a year earlier. 

 The job cuts will reduce the company's annual expenses by $100 million and are designed to increase its pretax earnings by $425 million through 2002, Reed said. The bank also will take a pre-tax restructuring charge of $80 million to $100 million, primarily to cover severance costs, Reed said. 

 Wachovia's loan portfolio could be part of the reason for investor jitters. The company led a syndicate of banks that lent $263 million to Carmike Cinemas Inc., a theater chain that recently filed for bankruptcy protection, and it also helped arrange a line of credit for Heilig-Meyers Co., a furniture maker that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a month ago, Bloomberg News reported. 

 That the Triangle was largely spared came as refreshing news during a summer of cutbacks at the state's largest banks. In June, First Union announced a restructuring that could eliminate as many as 3,500 of the bank's 70,000 employees nationwide, according to some estimates. A month later, Bank of America disclosed plans to eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs, nearly 7 percent of its 150,000 employees nationwide. 

 Neither First Union nor Bank of America has specified how many jobs it would cut in the Triangle. 

 So why did Wachovia, which has $70.8 billion in assets and 700 branches in five Southeastern states, spare the Triangle from the worst of the cuts? 

 Although the company's performance has been lackluster nationwide, the bank's Triangle operations have "hummed along quite nicely" the past year, Clayton said. The bank's loan portfolio in the Triangle has grown by 31 percent in the past 12 months to $1.7 billion from $1.3 billion, he said. The bank's deposits in the Triangle grew by a healthy 8 percent during the period, to $2.54 billion from $2.36 billion. 

 Given such numbers, it is no surprise that Wachovia left its Triangle operations largely intact, Plath said. "One thing you don't do is cut where you're generating above-average loan growth," he said. "Wachovia needs all the loan growth it can get, and the Triangle is one of the strongest markets in North Carolina." 

 Wachovia's 21,300 employees have less to worry about than those at First Union and Bank of America, said Mark Davis, director of research at Banc Stock Group Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based research firm that tracks banking stocks. Unlike First Union and Bank of America, which are cutting employees to capitalize on merger deals, Wachovia is cutting staff to boost earnings. 

 "Because [Wachovia's] entire motivation is to boost performance, then it should continue to spare areas like the Triangle," Davis said.

 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 Nasdaq, S&P Push Past Key Psychological Barriers

 Without much fanfare, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq crept higher last week, returning above the important psychological benchmarks of 1500 and 4000, respectively. Stocks responded to economic reports that appear to indicate that the economy is slowing, but not precipitously. Sales of homes and durable goods both declined, and the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its Tuesday meeting. 

 "I think the Fed is done until after the election. It would take terrible inflation data for the Fed to raise rates during the Presidential election campaign," says Jim Weiss, head of equities at State Street Research & Management. And that, of course, is good news for the stock markets. 

 For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 146 points, or 1.32%, to 11,192.63. The S&P 500 tacked on 14.74 to close at 1506.46. And the Nasdaq fattened up by 112.34 points; it finished at 4042.68, a gain of 2.86% on the week. 

 But the strong gains the market has reaped this summer haven't engendered much enthusiasm, perhaps because the stock averages remain stuck in a trading range. Consider that, over the past month, the Dow has risen 6.48%. But on a year-to-date basis, the index has fallen 2.65%. Also, August's gains came in small increments that don't inspire news headlines, but they have added up to nice results in the past month or two. 

 "This is not a barnstorming rally," says Weiss. "It's a very selective, halting, newsdriven rally." 

 Robert Doll, the chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, believes the market is stuck in a period of trendless volatility. The S&P 500 has moved by more than 1% on 42% of the days from the start of the year through July 31. Yet it is up only 2.53% this year. Likewise, the Dow has traveled more than 18,000 points, but is now only about 300 points below where it started January 1. And the Nasdaq has moved more than 3% on 32% of its trading days and over 1% on 80% of the time, yet the index is virtually unchanged since the year began. 

 "The market has been like a roller coaster. The ride ends where it began, but in the middle you lose your hat and maybe your stomach too," he explains. The market might break out of the range, Doll speculates, in the fourth quarter as investors gain confidence that the economy will slow to a sustainable pace. 

 -- Emulex investors got whiplash Friday. The company's shares plummeted after a fake press release, chock full of news that every investor dreads to hear, was disseminated. Shares rebounded during the day Friday after the hoax was uncovered. Needless to say, a hodgepodge of regulatory bodies are reportedly investigating. 

 The false press release said that Emulex, a fiber channel-adapter company, would restate fourth-quarter earnings. The report also claimed Emulex's CEO had quit and that the company is being investigated by the SEC. The deceptive news devastated the stock. From Thursday's close of 113 1/16, it plummeted to 43 Friday morning. When the truth was revealed, the shares rebounded and closed Friday at 105 3/4. Unusual activity in the company's options before the news was released is also under investigation. 

 "Emulex shareholders should be assured that our business is at record levels and the fundamentals of our business and my commitment to this company have never been stronger," said Chief Executive Paul Folino in a statement rebutting the false release. The false news was distributed over the Web-based news dissemination service Internet Wire, and quickly spread after being picked up by Bloomberg, Dow Jones and various chat rooms. 

 -- Computer shares helped boost the averages. IBM shares climbed almost nine points on the week to 129, Apple Computer rose 6 to 56 13/16, and three points were added to Gateway. Enthusiasm seemed to stem from investor optimism about IBM's second-half results. 

 Tech shares, in general, have fared well this summer, but the returns don't come close to matching what investors got used to last year. The accompanying table shows that the winners in the Nasdaq 100 have provided impressive but much lower returns this year than they did during the same period in 1999. Meanwhile, this year's losers have had a much more detrimental impact. "Last year, anything tangentially related to technology outperformed," says Jason Trennert, managing director at the ISI Group. This year, there have been more losers, as some promised growth rates failed to materialize. In other words, say goodbye to the no-brainer tech market. 

 -- The Disaster-of-the-Week award goes to Bausch & Lomb. The eye-care company warned that 2000 earnings would come in at $2.69-$2.74 a share. The stock plummeted because analysts expected earnings of $3.15. The problem: lower-than-expected demand for contact lenscare items, problems meeting demand for surgical intraocular lenses, competition in the hearing-product market and a weak euro. The company's response: It fired Carl Sassano, president and chief operating officer. Shares fell 21 5/8 on the week to 34 15/16. 

 -- Maytag shares jumped six points, to 41 1/4, over the past five trading days, thanks to a report that the home-appliance manufacturer is in talks to be acquired by Sweden's Electrolux, maker of the Frigidaire brand. The price tag is reportedly in the $4 billion area. 

 -- Investors in Lernout & Hauspie got more bad news Friday. The Belgian voice-recognition company said Gaston Bastiaens would resign as chief executive and president, but remain on the board. The move comes as the company is in the middle of auditing its sales information after The Wall Street Journal questioned the accuracy of Lernout's sales to certain customers in South Korea. The company said Bastiaens' resignation was voluntary and unrelated to concerns about sales practices. However, investors seem skeptical. Lernout's shares fell four points Friday, to 30 1/16. And amidst all this confusion, the company filed a shelf registration to sell up to $250 million of common stock. 

 -- Old-fashioned industrial stocks fared well last week, with Honeywell International, General Electric and Boeing among the biggest gainers in the Dow. On Thursday Honeywell continued to make good on its July promise to divest non-core operations. The company hired Salomon Smith Barney to sell its auto-related consumer-products businesses, which include products like Prestone anti-freeze, Fram air filters and Autolite spark plugs. The unit generated $1.1 billion in revenues last year. 

 The news follows the company's August 18 announcement that it would sell its Bendix brake-pad unit and Pharmaceutical Fine Chemicals business, and that it was on track to hit its 76-cent third-quarter earnings target. These reports are slowly helping investors forget just how badly Honeywell management disappointed when they announced in June a second-quarter earnings shortfall. The letdown shook investors' confidence and sent its shares skidding from the low 50s to the low 30s. Last week the shares climbed almost 4 1/2 points to 39 7/8. 

 Honeywell also received a boost from lower interest rates and renewed confidence that the economy would not fall off a cliff. Along those lines, Boeing shares rallied nine points to 54 1/8 last week, marking a new 52-week high. The aircraft manufacturer also had some good news of its own. The company's Delta 111 rocket had its first successful delivery of a dummy satellite to orbit. In addition, Credit Suisse First Boston aerospace and defense analyst Pierre Chao raised his recommendation on commercial aircraft suppliers to Overweight from Hold (though, as we point out in "The Right Stuff" on page 17, Boeing's long-term dominance of the domestic commercial aircraft market faces a new threat). 

 Dow heavyweight General Electric also managed to hit a new 52-week high of 59 9/16 on Thursday and closed the week up three points. The company was the beneficiary of news that Wal-Mart will begin to sell major home appliances and feature GE products in select stores. The test program will include refrigerators, freezers, microwaves, dishwashers, washing machines and dryers. The first appliances will be introduced into about a dozen U.S. stores by yearend. In a separate program, in October Wal-Mart will begin selling GE-branded housewares and small appliances under an exclusive licensing agreement. 

 -- Albertson's was considered a safety stock until a profit warning showed that non-tech doesn't necessarily equate to non-risk. Last week the grocery-store operator revealed it will generate lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal second quarter, ending August 3, thanks to an increase in operating expenses and a decline in comparable-store sales in July. Heightened competition didn't help either. The news sent Albertson's shares tumbling and brought down the stocks of other grocers as well. 

 Albertson's earnings should come in at 50 cents per share, excluding costs related to its $12 billion acquisition of American Stores Co. last year. Analysts were expecting a much better result: 62 cents. 

 In the wake of the dour news, Albertson's promised aggressive cost cutting -- $250 million of slashed expenses next year alone -- to boost future results. But shareholders and the ratings agencies weren't buying it. Albertson's shares fell nine points during the week to 21 7/8. And Moody's Investors Service changed the company's A2-bond rating outlook from stable to negative. S&P likewise placed Albertson's single-A rating on CreditWatch with negative implications. 

 The pain spread to Safeway and Kroger as investors feared the increased competition in the sector from aggressive expansion and Wal-Mart's entrance into the business. Safeway shares ended the week at 50 1/8, down a point, and Kroger shares ended largely unchanged, despite the market's rally. Wal-Mart finished the week flat, at 50 1/2. 

 -- Consumers might be spending up a storm, but it's sure not hitting the bottom lines of consumer non-durable stocks. Two of the worst offenders: Gillette, with shares down 26% so far this year; and Procter & Gamble, whose shares have lost 43% of their value. All this misery has some investors starting to believe that shares in the group have to be close to their lows and possibly headed back north. 

 One positive sign: managements are actually starting to do something to fix their companies' problems. Last week Gillette announced it had entered a pact to sell its stationery operations, which include Paper Mate, Parker and Waterman writing-instrument brands and Liquid Paper correction fluid, to Newell Rubbermaid. Similarly, P&G revealed it is exploring the divestiture of its Clearasil acne skin-care brand. True, these companies will need to do more to energize their shares, but at least they're moving in the right direction. 

 Meanwhile, investors haven't given the companies any credit for the beginnings of a potential turnaround. Shares of Gillette were largely unchanged on the week at 30 3/16, or 22 times expected 2001 earnings of $1.38. Similarly, Procter & Gamble shares lost a quarter-point. They now trade at 19 times expected 2001 earnings of $3.37. Those intrepid enough to consider buying consumer shares seem to be betting on Gillette over P&G. 

 "Gillette is trading below a market multiple for the first time I can ever remember," says Ed Shill, principal and chief investment officer of QCI Asset Management. He'd still like the company to sell off some other assets, like its Braun division, but otherwise the company's core razor business is doing well. And if worse comes to worst, there's always the possibility that the company could become an acquisition target. 

 "If they don't fix the company themselves," says Shill, "someone is going to do it for them." And with folks like Warren Buffett and Henry Kravis, of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., as shareholders and board members, it's a good bet underperformance won't be tolerated for long.

  Nasdaq, S&P Push Past Key Psychological Barriers
  By Jacqueline Doherty



Without much fanfare, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq crept higher last week,
returning above the important psychological benchmarks of 1500 and 4000,
respectively. Stocks responded to economic reports that appear to
indicate that the economy is slowing, but not precipitously. Sales of
homes and durable goods both declined, and the Federal Reserve left
interest rates unchanged at its Tuesday meeting.


 "I think the Fed is done until after the election. It would take terrible inflation data for the Fed to raise rates during the Presidential election campaign," says Jim Weiss, head of equities at State Street Research & Management. And that, of course, is good news for the stock markets. 

 For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 146 points, or 1.32%, to 11,192.63. The S&P 500 tacked on 14.74 to close at 1506.46. And the Nasdaq fattened up by 112.34 points; it finished at 4042.68, a gain of 2.86% on the week. 

 But the strong gains the market has reaped this summer haven't engendered much enthusiasm, perhaps because the stock averages remain stuck in a trading range. Consider that, over the past month, the Dow has risen 6.48%. But on a year-to-date basis, the index has fallen 2.65%. Also, August's gains came in small increments that don't inspire news headlines, but they have added up to nice results in the past month or two. 

 "This is not a barnstorming rally," says Weiss. "It's a very selective, halting, newsdriven rally." 

 Robert Doll, the chief investment officer of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, believes the market is stuck in a period of trendless volatility. The S&P 500 has moved by more than 1% on 42% of the days from the start of the year through July 31. Yet it is up only 2.53% this year. Likewise, the Dow has traveled more than 18,000 points, but is now only about 300 points below where it started January 1. And the Nasdaq has moved more than 3% on 32% of its trading days and over 1% on 80% of the time, yet the index is virtually unchanged since the year began. 

 "The market has been like a roller coaster. The ride ends where it began, but in the middle you lose your hat and maybe your stomach too," he explains.

And if worse comes to worst, there's always the possibility that the company could become an acquisition target. 

 "If they don't fix the company themselves," says Shill, "someone is going to do it for them." And with folks like Warren Buffett and Henry Kravis, of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., as shareholders and board members, it's a good bet underperformance won't be tolerated for long.

Phony `news' means wild ride for Emulex; Stock plunges, then recovers, after fake press release hits the wires

A bogus Internet news release picked up by financial news agencies sent a network equipment maker's stock plunging more than 60% Friday, but the shares recovered after the company refuted the reports.

Shares of Emulex tumbled to $43 from their previous close of $113.063 after false news circulated that the California-based company was restating its earnings, that its CEO had quit, and that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Emulex, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., makes devices and software that connect data-storage equipment to computer networks.

Trading in Emulex's stock was halted at midmorning on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Trading resumed in the early afternoon after the company denied the reports, originating on Internet Wire, a six-year-old online distributor of press releases.

Emulex executives say they are cooperating with authorities in investigating the matter. Paul Folino, the president and CEO of Emulex, appeared in an interview on CNBC Friday to reassure investors.

The stock recovered to close at $105.75 in regular trading, down $7.313.

Visibly annoyed by the sequence of events, Folino said, "You'd like to think that all you need to do is continue to focus on your business, but unfortunately from time to time something like this happens."

He called the episode a lesson for investors "to just be cautious in what you look at and do your homework before you react."

The fictitious press release said Emulex would revise its fiscal fourth-quarter 2000 earnings of 25 cents a share to a loss of 15 cents a share, and that it also planned to restate its fiscal 1998 and 1999 results.

Financial news wires Bloomberg and Dow Jones carried reports based on the bogus press release. Reuters and The Associated Press do not monitor Internet Wire, which was created to compete with Business Wire and PR Newswire, and did not run stories based on the fake release.

Folino discouraged speculation that a disgruntled former employee of Emulex could have engineered the hoax, citing the company's low 3% turnover rate, but suggested the probe may focus on Internet chat rooms and that investigators will look for unusual trading activity among short-sellers.

"Today, people do these chat rooms and put rumor and innuendo into the marketplace," he said. "Obviously, this is beyond innuendo, but something done for personal gain. Short positions are the first place people look. We'll let the SEC and FBI do the homework on that."

The incident raised new concerns about the accuracy of information distributed via the Internet. Other companies have also seen their stocks manipulated by false information disseminated online and such bogus data even prompted a bank run in Colombia.

Lucent Technologies' shares fell in late March after a fake news release was posted on an Internet bulletin board saying that Lucent would report lower earnings. And in April of last year PairGain Technologies' stock jumped more than 30% after a former employee duped investors with a fake Internet news story saying the company was about be taken over.

Mike Terpin, CEO of Internet Wire, said in a statement that the hoax was perpetrated by someone claiming to be with a public relations agency representing Emulex.

Terpin said his company "deeply regrets that this incident has occurred and for any problems or confusion it has caused for Emulex, the company's investors and the marketplace in general."

Terpin said it was the first incident of its kind for his company. Terpin did not return repeated phone calls seeking an explanation of his company's procedures for confirming the identity of people posting press releases.

Rick Stine, the managing editor of Dow Jones News Services, said Dow Jones only began using the service about six weeks ago after getting assurances from Internet Wire that its security procedures were sound.

"I want to hear from Internet Wire what happened on their end, if some sort of safeguard was dropped, if it was human error," Stine said. "Until we hear something from them that makes us feel more comfortable, we're going to call every company to verify any press release we receive from them."

The editor in chief at Bloomberg, Matt Winkler, said his agency should have been more careful in how it handled the story.

"The issue is us how rigorous are we as reporters and editors," Winkler said. "This is really about news judgment, it's not about the external source."

BUSINESSES BEWARE

Emulex Corp. isn't the first company to find its stock rising or falling because of a bogus press release or news report. As the market for financial news expands, so does the temptation to use technology to manipulate that news. Other recent hoaxes:

-- April 1999: PairGain Technologies Inc. rose as much as 31% after a fictitious news item said the company was being purchased.

-- April 1999: Business Wire, a distributor of press releases, sued three people for putting out a phony announcement over its wire about a fictitious investment opportunity. The three said it was an April Fool's Day joke.

-- March 2000: Lucent Technologies Inc. temporarily lost about $7 billion of market value after a day trader posted a fake profit warning on an Internet message board.

-- July 2000: AutoNation Inc. said a buyout offer it received from a company calling itself Pegasus Capital Group Inc. was "nonsensical" and that a press release from Pegasus was probably part of a hoax.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR: Tonight on MONEYLINE, Wall Street rocked by two big market blowups: Bausch & Lomb (URL: http://www.bausch.com/) plunges 20 points, Next Level Communications (URL: http://www.nlc.com/) losing even more. 

 But the nightmare for Next Level didn`t stop the Nasdaq from advancing yet again, the index today clawing itself out of bear market territory. 

 More gripping accounts of highway disaster:

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I thought we had a flat tire. The tires on the car started spinning, rolling. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: Some drivers taking their fight to court, as one tire expert says Firestone must take more dramatic action. 

 And a potential boom for a business caught up in one of the most explosive debates of our times: We`ll talk with the CEO of one company at the forefront of stem cell research. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, and welcome to MONEYLINE. Stuart is off tonight. 

 Investors on Wall Street today had to contend with spectacular stock blowups from two very different companies: Next Level, a high-tech upstart, and Bausch & Lomb, founded nearly 150 years ago. But in a show of perseverance, Wall Street managed to end solidly higher for the fourth straight day. 

 The Dow actually struggled much of the session before some buyers swept in during the final hour. It ended up 38 to 11,182. Volume there was more than a hundred million shares. 

 A much smoother ride for the Nasdaq, which closed up 42 to 4,053, just points from its high for the session. One point five billion shares traded. That rally came despite a monster drop in the network equipment supplier Next Level. It plunged nearly 50 points, or 54 percent, on one dramatic analyst`s downgrade. 

 And Bausch & Lomb tumbled $20, or nearly 36 percent in its second huge sell off in a month, that after issuing a profit warning. 

 More on both of those stories in a moment, but first we will check in with Susan Lisovicz, who spent the day at the New York Stock Exchange -- Susan. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, today`s rally came in directionless trading for much of the session and in low volume, the 12th slowest day of the year here. Some analysts said the markets are in a vacuum right now in the wake of that Fed decision earlier  this week, and with no catalyst driving stocks. 

 But there were lots of company-specific stories with big moves. Bausch & Lomb blindsided the Street. Many analysts said they thought the company`s problems were only temporary. But the collapse of that stock did not set the tone for the session. 

 Dow movers were led by Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , enjoying big gains for a second day. Management changes at General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) digested favorably on the Street. Boeing (URL: http://www.boeing.com/) hit  a new 52-week high. Credit Suisse First Boston says the company is essentially sold out through the year 2002. Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) and GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) also gained on the day. 

 But oil stocks were out of favor today, as investors locked in profits after a big run-up there. Amerada Hess (URL: http://www.hess.com/) one of the biggest losers after closing near its 52-week high yesterday. Chevron (URL: http://www.chevron.com/) and ExxonMobil (URL: http://www.exxon.mobil.com/) were also hurt by downgrades from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 

 One analyst said today`s rally, which came in fits and starts, seems to indicate the markets want to break out of their trading range and move higher, this in a month that`s been very good for the blue chips. August is the first month since late April that the Dow closed above 11,000 -- Willow. 

 BAY: Susan, thanks. Susan Lisovicz at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The Nasdaq rebound accelerated today, the index now down just less than 20 percent from its high. For many on Wall Street, that means the Nasdaq is out of the bear market. Today is the ninth session out of 10 that the Nasdaq has ended the day in the plus column, up nearly 10 percent this month. 

 John Metaxas joins us now from the Nasdaq marketsite with more on what drove the action today -- John. 

 JOHN METAXAS, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, with this close at the 4,053 level, the Nasdaq is now within 16 points of where it started the year. So at the open tomorrow, if things go well it could be in positive territory for the year. 

 The index was driven by the biotech stocks today, up nearly 5 percent as a sector after those new guidelines for stem cell research. The stem cell stocks just went into the stratosphere. Biotech index for the year is now up some 46 percent. 

 Though it was a strong session throughout, seven of the eight Nasdaq sectors were higher, there were a couple of high-profile train wrecks today. 

 Next Level Communications, as you report, down nearly $50, Lehman Brothers raising concerns whether its biggest customer, Qwest Communications (URL: http://www.qwest.net/) , will move forward aggressively with plans to deploy their product. 

 And Cysive (URL: http://www.cysive.com/) , another stock, perhaps a harbinger of the earnings warning season we`ve come to expect in September, Cysive warning Wall Street to expect weaker-then-expected third quarter financial results, the stock down 42 percent. 

 Krispy Kreme (URL: http://www.krispykreme.com/) proved you don`t have to be an Internet stock or a biotech stock to do well. This came public in April at $20 a share. Today it surged 23 percent, or nearly $15, to close at just over 78. They beat expectations with their earnings results and guided Wall Street higher for next year. 

 And finally, VA Linux (URL: http://www.valinux.com/) had a good day, too. They beat Wall Street expectations. A strong session for the Nasdaq, but remember this: We`re still a thousand points away from the all-time high. 

 BAY: John Metaxas at the market site, thanks. 

 BAY: A closer look now at what erased more than $4 billion from Next Level`s market value. Triggering the slide, as John just mentioned, a downgrade from Lehman Brothers analyst Stephen Levy, warning that a big customer of Next Level, Qwest, may not follow through on broadband initiatives started by Qwest merger partner U S West . 

 In his research note, Levy said, "We believe this believe this removes the potential for one of the most important sources of significant upside to our revenue projections." 

 Next Level quickly responded, the CEO saying, "Qwest U.S. West has not informed us of its future plans." 

 Investors clearly were not comforted. Today`s plunge leaves Next Level stock down more than 40 percent from this year and down nearly 80 percent from its high. 

 And Bausch & Lomb investors were also blindsided today, leading to its worst sell-off in at least three decades. The company set off a profit alarm for this year and next. In a conference call, the chairman said, quote, "I say I find these results unacceptable would be a gross understatement." 

 And the company took swift action, firing Carl Sassano, the president and chief operating officer, a 25 year veteran of Bausch & Lomb. But that move did little to calm the uproar among investors and among analysts. 

 Greg Clarkin has been following this story all day and he joins us now -- Greg. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT: And Willow, this is a profitwarning that clearly shocked many of the analysts who follow Bausch & Lomb, many of whom were led to believe that Bausch & Lomb`s the problems were short term. Now today, not only did that stock take a beating, but so did management`s credibility. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN (voice-over): Just a month after saying its problems were short-term Bausch & Lomb drops a bombshell, telling Wall Street its business is far weaker than it realized. The news shocked analysts. 

 LARRY KEUSCH, GOLDMAN SACHS: I was actually quite floored, because again we had many conversations with the company management over the last  several weeks, and they essentially assured us that they felt that their new expectations were conservative, again the issues were temporary in nature. So to find that something now that appears to be very systemic throughout the company was troubling in the magnitude of the declines in the earnings expectations were just enormous. 

 CLARKIN: Analysts were expecting Bausch & Lomb to earn 93 cents a share this quarter, $1.06 next quarter, $3.15 for the full year. But the company says profits will be way below those levels, and all of next year will be weaker than expected as well. 

 Analysts say Bausch & Lomb`s biggest problem is in its biggest business, contact lenses, where new products have failed to bring in new customers. 

 TIM DWYER, A.G. EDWARDS: Some of the newer product categories are cannibalizing some of the older technologies. So instead of having your permanent contact lenses, maybe now you`re wearing dailies or two-week disposables. So what we have here is a little bit of a paradigm shift in the consuming public`s purchase pattern. 

 CLARKIN: With the latest sell-off, Bausch & Lomb shares are trading around $35, down from $80 just weeks ago. 

 JOANNE WUENSCH, ING BARINGS: At this stage, I`m taking the show-me route. You need to show me numbers, you need to show me products, you need to show me revenue ramp. We`ve had last quarter revenue growth was flat. It`s difficult to get behind a company where they`re not growing their top line. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: Now in another move that stunned Wall Street, Bausch & Lomb fired its president and COO and eliminated the positions entirely. But even that did little to appease analysts, many of whom believe even more bad news may be on the way from this company -- Willow, 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin, thanks. 

 Another management shakeup, this one at General Motors. Chief Financial Officer Michael Losh will leave September 1st, as new CEO Rick Wagoner sets up his management team. The GM veteran will be replaced temporarily with John Finnegan, who may find himself confronting Carl Icahn. The financier last week said he would seek to purchase up to 15 percent of the company. GM was a big winner on the Dow today, but the stock is down 22 percent from its high. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, durable goods orders shatter a record. We`ll bring you the numbers and tell you what they mean for the economy. 

 Plus, some hints about where Alan Greenspan thinks we`re heading, as we check the minutes from the June Fed policy meeting. 

 And fraud allegations from Washington for a company running dozens  of adult Web sites: Did the promise of free thrills come with a high price tag? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: New orders for big-ticket items posted their biggest drop on record last month. Durable goods plunged 12.4 percent in what`s been quite a volatile stretch. 

 Ceci Rogers looks at whether this is further evidence of an economic downshift. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CECI RODGERS, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): July saw a dramatic fall-off in orders for new aircraft and for such goods as circuit boards and home appliances. The result: a record drop in orders for big-ticket manufactured items. Though the Commerce Department report is notoriously volatile from month to month, analysts saw signs of broad weakness. 

 Excluding transportation, orders fell 6.7 percent, a sharp reversal from June`s five-tenths of a percent rise. Coming just two days after the Federal Reserve`s decision to keep interest rates steady, the report underscored perceptions of a slowing economy. 

 MICHAEL MARZANO, GREENWICH NATWEST FUTURES: The point that caught a lot of traders` attention was this is the largest single decline on record. And it gave credence to the Fed`s comment that they do see slowing in the economy. 

 RODGERS: The one notable increase in orders last month was for industrial machinery, including big outlays for new computers. But the growing sense among economists is that the Fed is not likely to raise interest rates any time soon. 

 JOSHUA FEINMAN, DUETSCHE BANK ASSET MGMT.: They`re out of the way at least for the next couple of months. I think they are pretty solidly on hold. They`re pretty happy with the way demand seems to have slowed just a little bit in the economy. 

 RODGERS: Manufacturers of large trucks, for example, have cut production 

 and laid off workers because of weakening sales. Analysts say consumer auto sales are slowing but only moderately. 

 GREGORY KAGAY, PAINEWEBBER: The outlook is for some slowing through the fall, probably 17.2 million units this year -- still above last year, but that would suggest the pace slows for the balance of the year. 

 (on camera): The drop in demand for costly manufactured goods confirms what  a survey of purchasing executive has been saying for several months: that is, the manufacturing economy has hit a plateau and may be in the early stages of a slowdown. 

 Ceci Rodgers, CNN Financial News, Chicago. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: That slowdown has clearly been noticed by the Federal Reserve, at least judging by the minutes released today of the Fed`s June policy- meeting. The notes reveal that the committee members were unanimous  in voting not to raise interest rates six weeks ago. The members all agreed that demand seemed to be slowing, and that prior interest rate hikes would probably continue to clamp down on the economy. But the Fed vowed to stay vigilant on inflation and warned that it may further tighten rates in the future. 

 The Fed news and durables` data pushed long-term interest rates even lower today. The yield on the 10-year note is 5.71 percent, near its lowest level in a year; while the 30-year long-bond is yielding 5.65 percent. The bond market is keenly awaiting tomorrow`s revised report on second-quarter GDP growth. 

 Phone giant Verizon (URL: http://www.verizon.com/) Communications announced plans today to spin off its wireless unit. Verizon Wireless is jointly owned by Vodafone AirTouch (URL: http://www.vodafone- airtouch-plc.com/) and Verizon Communications, and is one of the nation`s largest mobile service providers. In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company estimated that its IPO could raise five billion dollars. By trying to unlock the value in its wireless unit, Verizon is following in the footsteps of competitor AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) . It spun off its Wireless (URL: http://www.attws.com/) arm back in April. 

 But since then, AT&T Wireless shares have plunged 16 percent. On the news, Verizon Communications ended the day up more than one point. Just yesterday, it agreed on a settlement officially ending the 18-day-old employee strike. 

 Coming up, stem-cells research: Is it a scientific breakthrough that can help millions or an ethical outrage? We`ll take an in-depth look  next on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: After the bell tonight, a better-than-expected profit report that got a less-than-stellar reaction. Sycamore Networks (URL: http://www.sycamorenet.com/) , which makes fiber-optic equipment reported quarterly profits that topped analysts` expectations on solid revenue growth. Still, Sycamore stock fell 2 1/2 in light trading after falling during the regular session. 

 And shares of Crossroads Systems (URL: http://www.crossroads.com/) are down more than 2 1/2 or nearly 25 percent. Now, here it`s easier to understand why. The company, which makes data-routing equipment, posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss. 

 Checking tonight`s MONEYLINE "Movers," Genzyme Molecular (URL: http://www.genzyme.com/) jumped 2 1/2. The biotech firm said today it licensed its patent rights for a gene linked to colon cancer. Fellow biotech, Human Genome Sciences (URL: http://www.hgsi.com/) soared 20 3/4 points. Robertson Stephens started coverage of it with a buy rating. American Management Systems (URL: http://www.amsinc.com/) plunged more than 6 3/4 or 31 percent. A jury ordered the information technology firm to pay nearly $475 million in a contract dispute. 

 In tonight`s "Tech Watch," we take a closer look at the controversy surrounding stem-cell research. As we told you last night, new guidelines will allow your tax dollars to support such medical research. At issue: stem cells taken from human embryos. Religious and pro-life groups call it a moral outrage. But supporters say the list of potential medical benefits is endless. Biotechs at the forefront of this scientific initiative are rallying for the second day in a row, including StemCells (URL: N/A) . It soared 30 percent. Geron (URL: http://www.geron.com/) jumped more than six points, and Aastrom Biosciences (URL: http://www.aastrom.com/) gained 1 1/2. That`s 54 percent. But Aastrom shares are still off 53 percent from the high hit earlier this year. 

 Joining us now, R. Douglas Armstrong, president and CEO of Aastrom Biosciences (URL: http://www.aastrom.com/) . 

 Doug, welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 R. DOUGLAS ARMSTRONG, PRESIDENT & CEO, AASTROM BIOSCIENCES: Thank you, Willow. It`s a pleasure to be here. 

 BAY: What do these new guidelines mean to biotech companies like yours? 

 ARMSTRONG: Well, I think it`s important to understand this field that we`re addressing, which is the use of normal human cells to treat medical diseases. This is important because we`ve largely capped out many drug approaches to diseases, such as cancer, osteoporosis, other types of  very important medical modalities. 

 Human cells are being used to be able to successfully treat some of these disorders. 

 BAY: But Doug, can you explain, though, why embryonic stem cells are somehow better for your research than adult stem cells? 

 ARMSTRONG: Well, if you`re going to have cells to treat a patient, you have to have a source, and there are different sources. At Aastrom, we had been  focusing on using stem cells from adult human bone marrow, umbilical cord blood for very effective treatments. Embryonal stem cells have the potential to really broaden the flexibility and number of medical applications. So this represents more of a long-term developmental approach for many medical treatments. 

 BAY: The opposition to the use of these embryonic stem cells is, as you well know, pretty serious. Can the opposition at this point prevent federal funding? 

 ARMSTRONG: Well, I can`t really comment on that. I think there are always ethical positions on many types of treatments. There are ethical issues on  kidney transplants, yet that`s a very important medical procedure. I think what`s more relevant here are the broader issues. 

 What we`re beginning to see are barriers being dropped that will enable cell therapies to move forward into the medical marketplace and offer very legitimate and important treatments. And they`re not really long-term. Many of these are here today. 

 BAY: So can you give us, if they`re not long-term, can you just give us a sense of what, for example, this research will mean to you? How long before you develop therapies and get them on the market? 

 ARMSTRONG: Well, there`s two parts to this. One is, is learning how to grow and produce cells that can be used for a specific treatment in the laboratory. The other piece is how do you move that in a product format into the medical marketplace. 

 What Aastrom has developed is a product format that does this. It takes basic research, laboratory procedures, puts it in a product format to move into medical treatments. 

 As an example, we have active products and clinical programs for producing normal cells that can provide normal blood and immune system cells in leukemia patients. We have a product that`s acted clinically to produce normal bone progenitor cells to give healthy bone in severe osteoporosis. 

 BAY: Doug -- Doug Armstrong, Aastrom Biosciences, thanks for putting this into perspective for us tonight. 

 ARMSTRONG: Thank you. 

 BAY: Coming up after the break, investigators start looking for what brought down the Gulf Air plane. The latest in the "MONEYLINE News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Turning to news outside of business, more on the plane crash  in the Persian Gulf. Wolf Blitzer joins us from Atlanta for the "MONEYLINE News Digest" -- Wolf. 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNNFN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow. 

 Investigators began work today after yesterday`s crash of the Gulf Air Airbus in Bahrain. Divers worked all night to recover the bodies of the 143 victims from the shallow waters of the Persian Gulf. The plane`s data recorders also were recovered. 

 U.S. aviation investigators and representatives of Airbus joined the investigation. Relatives began the identifying process. More than 30 of the victims were children traveling with family at the end of the summer holidays. 

 In Washington today, Mexico`s president-elect, Vicente Fox, held talks with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who took time off from the president campaign for these official duties. 

 On the agenda were trade and Fox`s proposal to have a more open border between Mexico and the United States. Tomorrow, Fox is scheduled to meet George W. Bush in his capacity as governor of Texas. 

 Gore quickly returned to the campaign trail, traveling to the University of Maryland for a speech on higher education. He outlined his plans to create tax credits for college tuition. 

 Higher education was also Bush`s theme of the day. Campaigning in New Orleans, he proposed increasing federal aid to colleges serving blacks and Hispanics.

 BLITZER: In Montana today there was a welcome light rain, but firefighters said they would need a lot more of it to help them bring the wildfires under control. More than 1.4 million acres are on fire nationwide. 

 The huge firefighting effort suffered its first casualties. Two men were killed by a lightning streak yesterday as they worked to contain a fire in Utah. Four others were injured. All six were inmates who were fighting fires as part of a prison program. 

 Those are some of the top stories. Join us later for "THE WORLD TODAY." That`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific -- Willow. 

 BAY: Wolf, we`ll see you then and we`ll see you back in Washington. You`ll be with us all next week. 

 Wolf Blitzer, thanks. 

 Still to come in the next half hour of MONEYLINE, a cyberspace sex scam as  tens of thousands of Web surfers end up paying for what was supposed to be free. Those stories when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Willow Bay. 

 Tonight on MONEYLINE, a solid day on Wall Street marked by spectacular slides in two companies, as a vision-care icon and a tech upstart watch investors head for the exits. Lesser known indices rising today, some to record levels. We`ll check out what the charts may  tell us about the broader market. Plus, a rising concern on Wall Street: not so much what the economic numbers say, but whether the government will shell out the funds to compile the data. 

 But first, more on tonight`s top story: Wall Street heads higher for the fourth straight session. It was a slow summer rally that gained steam through the day. The Nasdaq pushed higher for the ninth time in 10 sessions, closing near session highs, up 42 points or more than one percent 4,053, only 16 points shy of the break-even point for the year. 

 And blue-chip shares gained ground as well, picking up 38 points to close above 11,182, though still down nearly three percent in 2000 -- driving today`s action, Hewlett-Packard and Boeing gained more than three. General Motors was up nearly four as the automaker said its CFO would resign September 1st. But J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) slipped more than two, and ExxonMobil lost over 1 1/2 after several brokerages downgraded the major oil companies. 

 But turning to the biggest losers of the day: Bausch & Lomb dropped 20 after warning of weak earnings, and fired its No. 2 executive. And Next Level slumped nearly 50 points or 54 percent after Lehman Brothers projected declining revenue from one of its largest customers. 

 But while the major indexes work on a slow, but steady recovery after a forgettable first half of the year, some of the more obscure numbers on Wall Street tell a different and far more positive story. 

 Allan Chernoff has been reading the charts for us. 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, just another average day for the stock market? Well, perhaps if you`re looking at the Dow and the Nasdaq. But market internals tell a different story. As a matter of fact, today was a record-setter. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF (voice-over): A record-setter for some of the lesser-known indices that don`t grab headlines, but are closely watched by market pros. The broad-based value line index is at an all-time high. It`s up 11.5 percent on the year. And the S&P midcap index, tracking 400 medium- sized stocks, is the market star, up 19 percent this year at a new high. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was off a quarter of a point, holding just below its all-time high reached Wednesday. 

 JOHN ROQUE, ARNHOLD AND S. BLEICHROEDER: There are encouraging signs beneath the surface. They don`t show up readily in the popular averages --I mean, Nasdaq is not advancing four percent a day, and the Dow and the S&P aren`t doing, you know, something of the same order -- but what`s encouraging is that more stocks are participating in this advance than at any time since 1994. 

 CHERNOFF: More stocks have been hitting new 52-week highs. The 10-day moving average of new highs is at its best level in more than a year. And still other analysts are encouraged that the New York Stock Exchange financial index is only points away from its record. Financial stocks often lead rallies. 

 TIMOTHY GHRISKEY, DREYFUS CORPORATION: We have seen a broadening of the market. From about mid-July to almost mid-August, we saw a lot of strength in value stocks, specifically the financials and the utilities. 

 CHERNOFF: And a contrarian indicator is flashing a bullish sign. Investment-newsletter advisers have been losing confidence in the market for four consecutive weeks. Analysts interpret that to mean a growing number of investors have gotten their selling out of the way, paving the way for gains down the road. 

 ALAN ACKERMAN, FAHNESTOCK & CO: Well, I`m looking for a strong fourth- quarter rally and I believe it will be led by the big stocks in areas such as technology and financials and health care. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: So, even with the Dow industrials down 2.7 percent on the year, there are many pockets of strength in the market and indications that plenty of stocks are heading higher -- Willow. 

 BAY: Allan Chernoff, thanks. 

 And our guest says her analysis shows a healthy market over the long term, but she is cautious about the short term. 

 Joining us is technical analyst Bernadette Murphy of Kimelman & Baird. 

 Bernadette, welcome back to MONEYLINE. 

 BERNADETTE MURPHY, KIMELMAN & BAIRD: Thank you very much, Willow. 

 BAY: So is your reading of the charts leaving you feel as positive as the analysts we just heard from? 

 MURPHY: Yes, it is, particularly since we`re having a broadening of the market. The weak point in the market since 1998 has been the focus on an increasingly narrow number of issues. And that is changing  now. 

 BAY: And that`s been, of course, colored by the rise of the indexes, like the Dow. 

 MURPHY: That`s right. And where we are seeing the broadening is in the New York composite, which represents over 2,700 stocks listed. 

 BAY: Let`s take a look at the chart. I believe we have that to pull up. And you can you tell us what you see there. 

 MURPHY: Right. 

 BAY: Now, where do you see cause for concern? 

 MURPHY: It`s just that the market has had a very good run over the summer. And so... 

 BAY: OK, so we see that run-up as of August. 

 MURPHY: Right. 

 BAY: And that makes you think what? 

 MURPHY: Well, on a longer-term basis, we have had the New York composite break to a new high in July. And again in August, it set a new high. So those are positive for the long term. On a short-term basis, the market in Dow points is well up over 700 points. And so I could see a little give-back there. Also, we`re seeing a little stress come into the bond market and a little bit in the currency market. 

 BAY: A little stress, you mean? 

 MURPHY: Well, I think that we are rather extended in the bond market right now. I could see a slight pullback there -- also in the currency market --and we have had a little bit too much enthusiasm in the listed market of stocks. So that combination might cause a short-term pullback. However, that will not alter the longer-term positive trend. 

 BAY: Longer term, positive, short term, pullback, perhaps on the Dow. What about the Nasdaq? Does the lack of breadth there pose a concern? 

 MURPHY: The breadth in the Nasdaq market has been terrible for years now, because of the focus on the Nasdaq 100, the largest capitalization stocks in the Nasdaq market. And I think that for investors, they really should not go looking for bottom-fishing, I think they should go with strength when it comes to the Nasdaq stocks. 

 BAY: So when it comes to the Nasdaq, go for strength means, what, the big names? 

 MURPHY: The big names and those that are advancing. BAY: So some of the ones you like there would be... 

 MURPHY: Oh, it would be like an Intel. I could be an Oracle -- Sun Microsystems. These stocks don`t have huge areas of overhead resistance, where people bought them one time before, saw them go down. Now, when the prices get back up there, they say: Oh, I can get even here. And they`ll sell. 

 BAY: So, over on the Dow, what are the some of the areas you think investors might want to take a look at? No, I know you -- like a lot of other folks we`ve been hearing from this week -- really like financials. 

 MURPHY: Oh, I have liked financials, yes. 

 BAY: But which ones? 

 MURPHY: Well, in the Dow, I think J.P. Morgan is terrific. The other day it broke out -- well, actually a few sessions back -- it actually gapped up on volume, and has moved out to a new high. It`s pulling back now. 

 BAY: Is that perhaps a good time to buy with that little pullback? 

 MURPHY: Oh, I think the pullback provides the buying opportunity, yes. And it`s ahead of the other money center banks. And I think that`s a positive, too. It`s a leader. 

 BAY: Bernadette Murphy, thanks, as always, for joining us on MONEYLINE. 

 MURPHY: My pleasure. 

 BAY: Coming up next on MONEYLINE: Delicious doughnuts lead to an exceptional quarter for Krispy Kreme. We`ll have the details. And economists, analysts and investors all depend on accurate economic data. But could government belt-tightening hurt the quality of these market-moving reports -- that story, when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: A sweet quarter for Krispy Kreme (URL: http://www.krispykreme.com/) , and an even sweeter response from investors. Profits jumped 260 percent to $3.6 million. Helping the company: continued strong sales and an increase in store openings. Those factors also prompted Krispy Kreme to raise its earnings forecast for the year to $1 a share. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn 85 cents a share. Earlier today on CNNfn, Krispy Kreme`s CEO commented on the company`s strong performance. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 SCOTT LIVENGOOD, CHAIRMAN & CEO, KRISPY KREME: It`s just a continued, you know, focus on the business, focused on the fundamentals, making sure the growth works, open stores on time, and continue to deliver the best doughnuts we know how to make. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: And investors responded with euphoria. Shares of Krispy Kreme jumped nearly 15 today, or more than 23 percent, to 78 5/16, and that added an impressive $193 million to its market cap in just one day. While for the first half of this year, Krispy Kreme`s revenues totaled just $141 million. 

 Other big movers today: Maytag (URL: http://www.maytagcorp.com/) jumped nearly 3 3/4 or almost 10 percent on news that it is reportedly in talks to be acquired by Swedish appliance firm, Electrolux (URL: http://www.electrolux.com/) . Palm (URL: http://www.palm.com/) gained 2. Goldman Sachs started coverage of the maker of handheld electronic organizers, adding it to the firm`s recommend list. VA Linux (URL: http://www.valinux.com/) Systems jumped almost 7. Several analysts making positive comments on the Linux software maker after it reported a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter loss late yesterday. 

 Despite today`s gains, it`s been on a downtrend, off nearly 82 percent from its high. 

 Wall Street will get a full dose of economic news tomorrow with the revised figure of second-quarter gross domestic product. Analysts forecast the economy grew at 5.3 percent, a touch faster than they initially thought. But there`s a looming worry over the future of this report and other key economic numbers. 

 Bob Beard reports on the fight over funding government data. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BOB BEARD, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This cartload of economic data is going into the calculations for gross domestic product, a report which can move markets and helps the Federal Reserve determine monetary policy. 

 But the part of a Commerce Department that puts out these numbers says it`s been underfunded by Congress for seven years. It warned some economic reports may be eliminated, so quality doesn`t suffer, though it hasn`t decided which ones may be cut. 

 ROBERT SHAPIRO, UNDERSECRETARY OF COMMERCE: There are a range of possibilities. All of them would be damaging to the American economy and the American government. 

 BEARD: The man responsible for reports like GDP and international trade says the numbers are as accurate as possible, but admits there are problems. 

 STEVE LANDESFELD, BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: The fact that we haven`t been able to put the resources behind measuring that new economy, mean the quality of that data is, frankly, deteriorating rather sharply. 

 BEARD: Landesfeld wants an additional $10 million from Congress over the next two years for computer upgrades and projects to measure the impact of the new economy. He`s getting lobbying help from private-sector economists. 

 DIANE SWONK, BANK ONE: As that data is further compromised, we`re putting ourselves in the same boat as emerging markets when it comes to that. That is a very dangerous placing to for Investors. 

 BEARD: The U.S. House has left the BEA`s budget unchanged at $44 million a year. But the U.S. Senate? It`s giving it $5 million more for next year. 

 (on camera): If it doesn`t get more money, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will be forced to consult with customers over the next year, including the Fed, to determine which economic reports must go.

 BAY: Coming up, as lawsuits mount regarding Firestone tires on Ford SUVs, the automaker fights back against charges that its vehicles contributed to the problem. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: New developments today in the case of Firestone tires, implicated in dozens of accidents involving Ford Explorers. Ford Motor today fought back against accusations that its SUVs contributed to the tire problems, defending the safety record of its SUVs. 

 Kelli Arena has been following the story from Washington. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KELLI ARENA, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ford today fiercely defended its top-selling explorer SUV, insisting the vehicle is in no way responsible for deaths associated with Firestone tires. 

 HELEN PETRAUSKAS, FORD MOTOR COMPANY: My evidence for that is the superb performance of the Explorer when its equipped with Goodyear tires. It`s the superb performance of the Explorer when its equipped with tires that are not subject to the recall. 

 ARENA: Facing intense scrutiny, the automaker shifted the focus back to Firestone. 

 TOM BAUGHMAN, FORD TRUCK ENGINEERING: All of their adjustment data, whether  its adjustments for uneven tire wear, or tire out of balance or property balance claim, or personal injury claim, those all reside in the tire manufacturers databases, not in Ford databases. 

 ARENA: Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone are facing a storm of lawsuits stemming from the tire failures, which are connected to at least 62 deaths and hundreds of injuries. 

 SHAWNA FEUCHT, PLAINTIFF: We were 15 minutes away from our destination when I thought we had a flat tire. The car started spinning, rolling, and it`s just horrible. 

 ARENA: Bridgestone/Firestone says it still doesn`t know what caused its tires to fail, but tire expert Max Nonnemaker says he does. 

 MAX NONNEMAKER, INDEPENDENT TIRE CONSULTANT: In the manufacture of the tire, they will use materials that are dry or set up. You don`t get the chemical crosslinking of the molecules, which is necessary for the proper  bond. 

 ARENA: Nonnemaker is working with plaintiffs attorneys, who are calling for a broader recall of Firestone tires. Firestone dismissed Nonnemaker as a professional witness. 

 JOHN LAMPE, BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE: How anyone who has not even been in the industry and not been involved in the manufacturing process for 10 years, 15 or 20, it`s just inconceivable to me how they can claim to be an expert. 

 ARENA: But there are also sworn videotaped depositions from former employees who worked at the company`s Decatur plant, where many of the recalled tires were made. 

 In his deposition, former worker, Darrell Batson, said not all tires got a final inspection. 

 DARRELL BATSON, FMR. FIRESTONE EMPLOYEE: I personally didn`t do it. I had seen where the lines got a little heavy, the guys felt, some of the guys felt it wasn`t necessary, just throw them down the shoot or  down the line. 

 ARENA (on camera): The Senate commerce Committee chaired by John McCain has called for hearings next month along with the House Commerce Committee. That very public probing of the tire troubles will begin on September 6th. 

 Kelli Arena, CNN Financial News, Washington.

 BAY: A different kind of legal trouble for a onetime hedge fund manager. Federal prosecutors today charged Michael Berger with securities fraud, alleging that he concealed losses from investors, as the funds he managed dropped in value by more than $400 million.

 BAY: The Federal Trade Commission and the New York state attorney general have filed suit against the owners of several adult Web sites, which lured viewers with officer of free erotic pictures. But Internet users who clicked onto the sites, such as Playgirl.com, say they were unknowingly charged for the promise of free thrills. 

 Steve Young looks at a case of Web surfer beware. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNFN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): To some it looked too good to be true: free male hunks over the Internet. Just enter your credit card number to prove you`re at least 21 years old. But federal and state authorities say Crescent Publishing Group -- which runs Playgirl.com, three dozen other adult Web sites and an adult magazine --fraudulently billed thousands of consumers. 

 STEVE BAKER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: We believe this outfit may be taking in $10 million a month. We`ve got one period of a little over a year where  we think they took in, in the neighborhood over $150 million from consumers. 

 YOUNG: The Federal Trade Commission says site visitors were often billed recurring charges of up to $90 a month. The commission says it has  tens of thousands of complaints and believes there could be hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide. One of them is an Evans, Louisiana hairdresser, Carol Kalenda. 

 CAROL KALENDA: I got my credit card bill back and I had a $60 charge from a company for this adult site, and I was shocked, because, you know, I had not authorized them to, you know, to charge that to my account, and as far as I was concerned, I did not, you know, use it. 

 YOUNG: Authorities say the adult site operators used tricks to maximize their profits, such as involuntarily diverting Web surfers to their site from someplace else -- that`s called "page jacking" -- or making it all but impossible to escape -- that`s called "mousetrapping." 

 The FTC says to avoid detection Crescent Publishing became a sort of multiplying chameleon. 

 BAKER: We`ve got 65 different corporations that are defendants. In other words, when complaints became too high under the name of one corporation, they simply started another corporate name. So, that helped disguise the number of complaints that were coming in. 

 YOUNG: Crescent Publishing did not return our repeated phone calls. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: The FTC and the New York attorney general have filed suit asking the U.S. District Court to freeze the assets of the adult Web sites and halt the alleged illegal billing practices pending trial. They say to process its credit card charges Crescent Publishing is now using a bank in Guatemala -- Willow. 

 BAY: Guatemala. Steve, are there other examples that you found of companies like this that trick you into giving your credit card number? 

 YOUNG: One of the most pernicious -- they tell you that they are going to try to protect you from scams, but they have to be sure that you are their customer, and you do that by giving them your credit card. 

 BAY: And then you`re in trouble.

 UPDATE 2-Bausch & Lomb stock tumbles after warning.

 (adds analyst quotes, background, stock price in graph 1-7, 16-17) 

 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Eye care company Bausch & Lomb Inc. said on Thursday it fired its President and Chief Operating Officer Carl Sassano and warned that revenues would be flat or slightly lower for the rest of the year, sending the stock tumbling 34 percent. 

 The Rochester-based maker of contact lenses, lens care products and eye surgery equipment said that excluding the $228 million Groupe Chauvin acquisition last month, revenues for 2000 are now expected to be flat to down from the year earlier due to slower growth in the vision care segment, price pressure on U.S. generic drugs, product supply constraints and a weak Euro. 

 Including the deal, however, 2000 revenues should grow in the range of two to four percent. 

 The warning sent the stock reeling, down 19-3/8 to 36-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, and sliced off more than $1 billion in market value in early morning activity. The stock was the largest percentage loser on the Big Board. 

 "This is a blindside, this is (like) walking across the street and getting hit by a Mack truck," said analyst Lawrence Keusch of Goldman Sachs. "Four weeks ago the company was suggesting that these issues were temporary in nature. We've certainly known there has been weakness in lenscare solutions and the pharma business but the magnitude of the declines in earnings expectations is troubling." 

 Investor confidence in the eye care company has tumbled ever since Bausch & Lomb posted disappointing second quarter results in July. The stock dropped more than 45 percent from a year high of 80-7/16 on July 18 to a close Wednesday of 55-3/4. 

 "This company has problems and though it's hit bottom here, it's not going to go anywhere for while," analyst David Gruber of Lehman Brothers said. "Clearly, investor credibility has disappeared, so it's become a show-me stock. 

 Bausch & Lomb said that earnings per share, including the impact of the French eye care deal, should be about $0.70 to $0.72 in the third quarter, and $0.83 to $0.85 in the fourth quarter, and end the year in the range of $2.69 to $2.72 before one-time items. 

 Analysts were expecting Bausch & Lomb to report third quarter 2000 earnings of $0.93 per share, $1.06 for the fourth quarter and $3.15 for the year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 For 2001, the company sees revenue growth in the mid-single digits, excluding the Groupe Chauvin acquisition, and in upper-single digits including the acquisition. Earnings per share in 2001 should be in the range of $2.87 to $2.92, compared to $3.84 per share expected by analysts. 

 "We are deeply disappointed and frustrated to have to reduce our sales and earnings expectations for the remainder of 2000 and for 2001," said William Carpenter, chairman and chief executive of Bausch & Lomb. 

 "We are moving aggressively to address these issues and we are committed to taking the right actions to improve our 2001 results over these revised projections," he said. 

 Carpenter added that the company was undertaking a complete review of how it is structured and managed. 

 "I promise that our response will be swift, comprehensive and effective," he said. "The number one priority of this management team is to develop and implement plans to improve our performance." 

 The company said it eliminated the position of president and chief operating officer and said that Carl Sassano, who currently holds that position, will be leaving the company. 

 But Wall Street analysts were sceptical that the elimination would turn the company around. 

 "The real question here is how aware Bill Carpenter was of these problems. Clearly these issues did not develop overnight," Lehman's Gruber said, adding the profit and sales warning is a sign of a "control and awareness issue." 

 Bausch said Nielsen research data indicated modestly reduced consumer demand for all lens care products in the first half of 2000. Data for the most recent few weeks - as well as customer orders - suggest that consumer demand is softening even further, and markets outside the U.S. appear to be following the same trend, the company said. 

 Expectations for Bausch & Lomb's drug business in the U.S. and Germany were also revised. Full year 2000 revenues in the pharmaceuticals segment, excluding the Groupe Chauvin acquisition, are expected to decline 11 to 13 percent from 1999, with the third quarter down in the mid-teens and the fourth quarter down more than 20 percent, including the negative impact of currency.

 NEW YORK, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Eye care company Bausch & Lomb Inc. said on Thursday it fired its President and Chief Operating Officer Carl Sassano and warned that revenues would be flat or slightly lower for the rest of the year, sending the stock tumbling 34 percent. 

 The Rochester-based maker of contact lenses, lens care products and eye surgery equipment said that excluding the $228 million Groupe Chauvin acquisition last month, revenues for 2000 are now expected to be flat to down from the year earlier due to slower growth in the vision care segment, price pressure on U.S. generic drugs, product supply constraints and a weak Euro. 

 Including the deal, however, 2000 revenues should grow in the range of two to four percent. 

 The warning sent the stock reeling, down 19-1/4 to 36-1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange, and sliced off more than $1 billion in market value in early afternoon activity. The stock was the largest percentage loser on the Big Board. 

 Bausch & Lomb's rating was cut by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Banc Alex Brown after the news, both to market performer from buy. 

 "This is a blindside, this is (like) walking across the street and getting hit by a Mack truck," said analyst Lawrence Keusch of Goldman Sachs. "Four weeks ago the company was suggesting that these issues were temporary in nature. We've certainly known there has been weakness in lenscare solutions and the pharma business but the magnitude of the declines in earnings expectations is troubling."

 "To say that I find these results unacceptable would be a gross understatement," said William Carpenter, chairman and chief executive of Bausch & Lomb in a conference call. "We can and we will improve our 2001 results over these projections." 

 Carpenter said his goal was to generate 15 percent earnings growth over the next few years and would release a performance update no later than the date the third quarter results are posted. He added that the company was undertaking a complete review of how it is structured and managed. 

 "I promise that our response will be swift, comprehensive and effective," he said. "The number one priority of this management team is to develop and implement plans to improve our performance." 

 The company said it eliminated the position of president and chief operating officer and said Carl Sassano, who currently holds that position, will be leaving the company. Eliminating the job will allow Carpenter to be "even closer in touch with the day-to-day activities of the business."

 Ahold sticks to fcast amid U.S. sector dip.

 AMSTERDAM, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Dutch supermarkets group Koninklijke Ahold NV said on Thursday it was sticking to its forecast 17-20 percent earnings per share growth for 2000 despite a profit warning from a U.S. peer early this week. 

 Ahold, which generates 55-60 percent of its revenues and 60 percent of its profits in the U.S., was confident it would reach its goal. 

 "So far, so good. We're very satisfied (with our prospects)," Ahold spokesman Jan Hol told Reuters. 

 Albertson's Inc, the second largest U.S. supermarkets chain, said on Tuesday its earnings would fall short of previous expectations, prompting a slew of analyst downgrades and pressuring the sector's shares. 

 But U.S. analysts have said the weaker outlook was limited to Albertson's, and that Kroger and Safeway had said their businesses remained strong. 

 Ahold, the world's sixth biggest supermarket chain in sales terms, said earlier this month it would buy Sara Lee's PYA/Monarch food service business for $1.57 billion and combine it with U.S. Foodservice, which it bought in March for $3.6 billion. 

 Ahold shares had rallied to new year high at 34.65 euros on Wednesday, but sank about six percent to a low of 32.00 euros in Thursday morning trade pressured by weakness in the sector. Shares in French peer Carrefour also weakened by about 3.4 percent. 

 SG Securities also said on Thursday it had cut its recommendation for Ahold shares to "Neutral" from "Outperform", citing uncertainty in the food distribution sector in the U.S. 

 But Dutch broker Amstgeld said in a note to investors it believed Ahold's U.S. operations were in good shape, except for its New York-area Edwards chain, and maintained its "Outperformer" rating.

 AMSTERDAM, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Shares in Dutch supermarket group Ahold slid sharply on Thursday on worries that its U.S. business may suffer following a profit warning from a rival there earlier this week. 

 At 0805 GMT, Ahold shares were off 5.9 percent at 32.23 euros, slightly above the session low of 32.00 euros. 

 Dealers said the weakness also appeared to be a pullback from recent bullish movement, after Ahold reached a new year-high at 34.65 euros on Wednesday. 

 Ahold, which generates more than half its turnover in the United States, came under some pressure after U.S. supermarket operator Albertson's Inc said on Tuesday it expects to report lower-than-expected second quarter earnings due to weak sales and higher operating costs. 

 SG Securities also said on Thursday it had cut its recommendation on Ahold shares to "Neutral" from "Outperform".

 Boise, Idaho-Based Grocery Chain Not Looking to Expand

 Albertson's Inc., the long-rumored suitor of the Rainbow Foods chain, now appears to be a long shot to become a player in the Upper Midwest food market. 

 Gary Michael, chairman and chief executive at Boise, Idaho- based Albertson's, told securities analysts this week that the company doesn't intend to expand into new territories and will cut back on capital spending in its existing markets. 

 On Wednesday, Albertson's spokeswoman Jenny Nixon qualified those remarks only slightly. 

 "That doesn't mean we wouldn't do an acquisition if the right deal came along, but right now our focus is going to be on growing sales at our own stores," she said. 

 Last month, sources said that Albertson's was the top bidder to buy Rainbow. Representatives from the company had been seen in several Rainbow stores and a purchase was believed to be close. The companies have declined to comment on those reports. 

 Albertson's has hit a rough patch in the road to building a national grocery power. It warned analysts and shareholders on Tuesday that its second-quarter results will fall far below Wall Street expectations after a sluggish month of July, weaker sales and higher operating costs. 

 The company expects earnings for the quarter ended Aug. 2 will be about 50 cents per diluted share before merger costs; analysts had expected 62 cents. 

 "The way I interpret Mr. Michael's comments is that Albertson's won't be coming here (the Twin Cities) anytime soon," said George Dahlman, analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. 

 Fleming Cos., the food wholesaler that moved from Oklahoma City to the Dallas area earlier this year, put Rainbow and other conventional supermarket chains on the auction block in April. Fleming, the No. 2 wholesaler behind Supervalu, said it wants to focus on food distribution and operating large supercenter stores. 

 Albertson's is the No. 2 supermarket retailer, after Kroger. It was believed to be bidding on Rainbow to gain access to the Upper Midwest food market after a $12.5 billion purchase of American Stores Inc. in 1999 strengthened its food retailing position in Chicago and other Midwest markets. 

 Fleming said Wednesday it has agreed to sell six Thompson's Food Basket stores in the Peoria, Ill., area to Sullivan's Foods, will close six other Thompson's stores, and will keep operating one of the Illinois chain's stores. 

 Besides Rainbow stores, Fleming has corporate-owned Sentry Foods in Wisconsin, Baker's Supermarkets in Nebraska and ABCO Desert Market stores in Arizona on the auction block. Thompson's was the smallest chain in Fleming's offerings. 

 Albertson's stock continued to tumble Wednesday for the second consecutive day since warning that profit would miss forecasts. Company shares closed down $3.75, to $22.69 per share. That's more than half off its 52-week high of $52.25. 

 Fleming, meanwhile, closed down 75 cents at $15.69 per share in Wednesday trading.

 Analysts say sell Michelin's Bridgestone bounce.

 PARIS, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Auto analysts are advising clients to sell shares in French tyre maker Michelin while the price is still buoyed on the back of a massive product recall by rival Bridgestone Corp . 

 Michelin shares have risen from a five-month low of 31.50 euros to trade above 35 euros since Bridgestone announced on August 9 it would recall some 6.5 million Firestone brand tyres due to safety concerns. 

 Analysts are predicting the recall will give a slight boost to the French rival's profits this year and next as Michelin benefits from the damage to the Bridgestone/Firestone image. 

 But they remain pessimistic about market fundamentals and the company's broader earnings outlook and see the bounce as a good opportunity to sell the shares ahead of first-half results next month. 

 "We would recommend investors benefit from possible share strength within the next two weeks in the Firestone context to sell their shares," said Schroder Salomon Smith Barney analyst Remy Dumoulin in a note to clients on Wednesday. 

 He estimated the Firestone recall and after-market share gains at the expense of Firestone could add a total of 0.30 euros to Michelin earnings per share over the next 16 months 

 But Dumoulin cut his earnings estimates by 10 percent to reflect what he expects will be a 25 percent decline in first-half profits this year and weakening demand in North America, which provides over a third of Michelin's revenues. 

 In a note to clients on Monday, J.P. Morgan analyst David Moorcroft called Michelin's long-term outlook bleak and estimated the Firestone impact had been fully priced in. 

 BRIDGESTONE DISCOUNTING COULD WORSEN PRICING PICTURE 

 "Companies like Michelin and Goodyear may well get a bounce from the Bridgestone recall, but when it all dies down Firestone will be left with a lot of capacity and could start vicious price discounting," he told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 He said any Bridgestone discounting aimed at regaining lost market share would only worsen an already difficult pricing environment in the global tyre industry. 

 He also cast doubt on Michelin's ability to turn extra sales into profits without incurring significant additional costs. 

 "We consider a share price of 35 euros to only be sustainable in the short-term, for as long as positive newsflow persists," Moorcroft wrote in the research note. 

 Michelin, along with its major competitors, has been plagued for some time by decreasing volumes and rising raw materials prices. Despite strong economic growth in the United States and Europe, tyre companies have had trouble passing on their price increases. 

 Late last month, Michelin warned that operating profits would fall in the first half of the year - news which sent its shares reeling. The Firestone recall has pushed the stock back near pre-profit warning levels. 

 At 1100 GMT on Wednesday, the shares were down 0.81 percent at 34.42 euros. Michelin will report first half results on September 19.

 NEW YORK, Aug 23 (Reuters) - UBS Warburg said Wednesday it cut ratings and price targets on Kroger Co. and other food retailers in the wake of Albertson's Inc. profit warning. 

 - said it is downgrading Kroger to a hold from buy and lowering its price target to $23 from $25. With Kroger and Albertson's overlapping in various regions - particularly the Northwest, it is likely that Kroger will experience the same heightened competitive pressures Albertson's is currently battling. 

 Shares of Kroger were down 1-5/8 at 21-3/4. 

 - said it lowered the price target on Delhaize America Inc. to $16 from $18 per share. 

 Shares of Delhaize were down 1/8 at 15-7/16. 

 - said it lowered the price target on Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. from $17 to $16. 

 Shares of Great Atlantic and Pacific were down 5/8 at 14-3/4. 

 - said it cut price target on Safeway Inc. to $50 from $52. Safeway's earnings will likely be the most robust and therefore justify a premium to the group. 

 Shares of Safeway were down 3-15/16 at 49-1/8. 

 - said it is downgrading view on the sector following Albertson's profit warning Tuesday. Albertson's announcement signals the beginning of longer-term concerns. 

 - said expects group share price performance to be hit as evidence of heightened competition and margin erosion is now emerging.

 BOISE, Idaho (AP) - A warning from Albertson's Inc. that its quarterly profits may be smaller than expected pushed the stock price for the nation's second-largest supermarket chain down 17 percent. 

 Albertson shares sank $4.562 to $22.438 in afternoon trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Albertson's said it expects to report lower-than-projected earnings for its fiscal second quarter because of a decline in comparable store sales in July and an increase in operating expenses. 

 Company officials said they now expect earnings of about 50 cents per share, excluding merger-related costs, and 46 cents per share, including merger-related costs. Analysts had forecast 62 cents per share. 

 Albertson's second-quarter results will be reported Sept. 5. 

 Meantime, officials promised a vigorous cost-cutting campaign to boost future earnings. 

 Peter Lynch, Albertson's president and chief operating officer, said he has established "a renewed culture of thrift," and vowed to slash expenses next year by $250 million and trim capital expenditures by $500 million in the next 2 1/2 years. 

 The company said newly acquired stores, including the Acme chain, American Stores Co. and Lucky stores in California, were performing well. But they cited "significant market entry activity by competitors" as a reason for the lower earnings projection. 

 "We're a healthy company," spokeswoman Jenny Enochson said. "We're still going to make money, but it's not as much as the market expected or that we expected."

Orica set on blasting way to top in US

Orica will continue its aggressive drive to dominate the $1 billion US explosives market despite concerns from investors that the group is pursuing growth without adequately addressing sliding margins and poor returns on capital.

The growth strategy of the world's biggest maker of explosives has come under scrutiny since August 9, when it surprised the market with a warning that its profit this financial year will be 5 per cent to 10 per cent lower than last year's $156 million.

Institutional shareholders reacted negatively to presentations by the management of the explosives division in Sydney and Melbourne on Thursday and Friday.

Analysts are concerned that Orica is too focused on growth targets for explosives, such as boosting revenue by 15 per cent per annum over the next five years, rather than repairing torn margins caused by rising gas input prices in the stagnant US explosives market.

While conceding that returns on assets in the US explosives division had fallen to single-digit levels, Orica's managing director, Mr Philip Weickhardt, said Orica remained committed to having market leadership in the US.

"To try and suggest that, because of the current temporary difficulties, the fundamental direction of the business is wrong, is incorrect," Mr Weickhardt said. "You don't run a business on the basis of two months' performance," he said.

Orica shares slumped more than 12 per cent to their lowest level in almost seven years following the August 9 profit warning, prompting speculation that the group could become subject to a fresh takeover play from Wesfarmers.

However, Mr Weickhardt dismissed speculation of a break-up, saying that the sum of the diversified industrials businesses was worth more than the parts.

He said he had held no discussions formally or informally with the management of Wesfarmers.

Natural gas prices in the United States have doubled over the past four months, but Orica and major competitor Dyno have been unable to pass on the increases because of excess supply.

Analysts remain concerned that growth in the offshore explosives business will not offset declines in the Australian explosives market as well as losses in the company's non-core AVC plastic operations.

UBS Warburg recently cut earnings forecasts by 16 per cent while Ord Minnett cut its forecast by 12 per cent with the later blaming Orica for exacerbating excess supply conditions in the US by the expansion of its Carseland plant over the past 18 months.

 1. Dangers of Shopping Come to Light: Prices aren't the only things falling at discount chains. Falling merchandise has accounted for thousands of injuries and some deaths in warehouse-style stores, according to a Times examination of court records from around the country. Despite numerous lawsuits and millions of dollars in jury awards and settlements against various discount retailers and warehouse superstores, the toll continues to mount. Only last month, a 41-year-old Connecticut man was killed at his neighborhood Home Depot when a 2,000-pound pallet of landscaping timbers fell and pinned him to the ground. Several retail giants, including Home Depot and Wal-Mart, say their stores are safe and that they are constantly improving safety procedures.  (Davan Maharaj) 

 2. Firestone Tire Woes Mount: The massive Bridgestone/Firestone tire recall continued to make headlines as the government announced a growing case file linking suspect models to tire failures resulting in at least 54 deaths. The data showed that most motorist complaints about the suspect Firestone-brand tires involved failures on the rear wheels, a type of failure that's particularly treacherous in sport-utility vehicles traveling at highway speeds. The Times also reported that State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance had noticed an unusually high accident rate involving Firestone tires and took its concerns to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as early as July 1998--nearly two years before the agency opened its inquiry May 2. Bridgestone Corp. set plans to ratchet up production to meet demand for replacement tires, but a possible roadblock emerged Friday: The company's 8,000 unionized workers said they'll terminate a temporary contract covering nine U.S. plants if a permanent agreement isn't reached by Sept. 1. 

 3. News Corp. Deal Could Clip UPN: TV industry experts said it looks like curtains for UPN after News Corp.'s announcement that it won a bidding war with Viacom Inc. for Chris-Craft Industries. News Corp.'s agreement with Chris-Craft also could bring a sea change in broadcasting as rivals race to match News Corp.'s added clout in owning more than one station in large markets, including Los Angeles. As for Viacom's UPN, News Corp. isn't expected to renew the affiliation agreements with Chris-Craft stations that have been crucial to the network's survival. 

 4. Murdoch Sees Better Days Post-'Titan': Rupert Murdoch said his Fox film division had a "pretty horrible year" as News Corp. reported that losses in the unit dragged profit down in its fiscal fourth quarter. Murdoch largely blamed animated sci-fi bomb "Titan A.E." for the disappointing corporate performance and pointed to the successful release of "X-Men" and the film unit's new executives as reasons he sees better times ahead. 

 5. Cell Phones' Use of Music Targeted: Taking a page from the Napster debate, EMI Music Publishing filed a copyright suit against a Santa Monica "dot-com" that helps people change the ring of cell phones into beeping melodies of popular songs. The suit targets Global Music One, parent of YourMobile.com. 

 6. Profit Warning from United: UAL Corp.'s United Airlines resorted to incentives to keep its business fliers and warned of disappointing third-quarter earnings because of lost business as it continued to struggle with a crisis of flight delays and cancellations. The developments added to United's growing role as the central figure in passengers' furor with the airline industry over travel disruptions this summer. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, in fact, called United "the poster child" of the industry's problems as he announced an emergency meeting for Monday to discuss ways to improve airline service. United claims that labor problems play a big role in the disruptions. 

 7. Icahn Puts Pressure on GM: Billionaire financier Carl Icahn took aim at one of the biggest targets on Wall Street with a plan to buy a major stake in General Motors Corp., which has long been criticized for not doing more to boost its stock. Some analysts speculated Icahn would pressure the auto maker's management to further unlock the value of its Hughes Electronics Corp. Icahn plans to buy more than $15 million of GM shares but less than 15% of outstanding shares, GM said. The disclosure alone pushed GM's shares up $4.56, or 7%, to close at $70 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. They had fallen 38% between April 30 and June 30. 

 8. Heilig-Meyers Flees California: The nation's largest home furnishings retailer, Heilig-Meyers Co., said it will close 302 stores, including all of its 81 outlets in California, as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. About 1,400 workers in California and 3,000 in other states will be fired under the restructuring, which also includes closure of the company's distribution center in California. Heilig-Meyers said leasing store space and shipping merchandise was more expensive in California than in its East Coast markets. Frantic expansion and delinquent loans in the firm's installment payment plan led Heilig-Meyers to seek protection from creditors, analysts said. The closings will leave 569 stores in 29 states.  (Indraneel Sur) 

 9. Garment Industry Losing Jobs: Employment in the Los Angeles garment industry dipped below 100,000 this year for the first time since the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994, with nearly 13,000 jobs lost since 1997 alone, according to state employment data. A new analysis of state figures from 1995 to 1997 showed that the loss of blue-collar sewing jobs were masked by a surge in white-collar employment. 

 10. Southland Home Sales Plummet: Sales of new and existing homes dropped sharply in Los Angeles and Orange counties during July, but not for lack of demand, analysts said. A thin supply of homes on the market led to a 17% drop in sales in Los Angeles County, the steepest monthly slide since the early 1990s, and a 21% drop in Orange County, according to DataQuick Information Systems. The decline came even as mortgage rates began to slip from an average 8.2% in June, generally the highest level in four years. Last week mortgage rates fell below 8% for the first time this year, to an average 7.96%, Freddie Mac said.

 LONDON -- The chiefs of British Telecommunications PLC and AT&T Corp., two old-line telephone behemoths struggling to keep pace with faster-moving rivals, have put out feelers about the possibility of combining their businesses, people familiar with the situation say. 

 Though no formal merger discussions have taken place, AT&T's chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, and BT's chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, have held conversations in the past month about exploring a possible union of their two companies, these people say. The companies haven't involved investment banks or their boards of directors in the talks, these people say. 

 The two men have privately discussed the idea of a combination during their regular meetings about Concert, the global joint venture between AT&T and BT that provides phone and data services to large corporate customers. While this isn't the first time such discussions have taken place -- the two companies broached the idea during the creation of Concert last year -- the latest conversations are more serious and have focused on specific issues relating to a combination of their businesses, these people say. 

 But they caution that no deal is imminent, and it's still unclear whether the informal talks will lead to negotiations. What's more, there would be tremendous hurdles to any transaction. Cultural and management issues, which have sunk far smaller deals, would be especially thorny in a cross-border merger of this size. 

 And, of course, there are regulatory hurdles. While the Concert venture had to clear close scrutiny by antitrust and telecommunications regulators in the U.S. and Europe, both companies control vast amounts of trans-Atlantic phone capacity and probably would have to agree to certain disposals for any deal to pass muster. 

 In an interview Thursday, Sir Peter said that although AT&T and BT "work quite well" in their Concert venture, the two companies have "had no discussions."  However, Sir Peter wouldn't comment on whether there have been overtures from either or both sides.  And when asked whether he would rule out a merger between AT&T and BT, Sir Peter said: "I am very open-minded." 

 An AT&T spokesman declined to comment. 

 Both companies' stock prices have taken a beating in recent months. Ma Bell's stock has fallen 39% this year, after hitting a 52-week-low of $29.63 last week, because of the decline in consumer long-distance prices and revelations starting in April that overall revenue growth would be less than previously expected because of shortfalls in the Business Services unit. BT's stock is down significantly this year, largely because of intense competition in its core phone business in the U.K. and because of the company's lack of management control in its European investments. Investors also have found it difficult to place a value on BT's highflying operations, such as the wireless unit. 

 BT shareholders might balk at a potential merger with AT&T because it would expose them to the highly competitive U.S. market, as well as to AT&T's woes. It's happened before: BT's shareholders were wary of a planned acquisition of MCI Communications Corp. after the U.S. company issued a profit warning. BT's management acquiesced, and MCI was subsequently snatched away by WorldCom Inc. 

 But for both companies, a combination offers the prospect of efficiencies of scale, new revenue streams and opportunities in the global Internet market. 

 A merger between AT&T and BT, if successful, would create a $185 billion (202 billion euro) titan: AT&T's stock market value is now about $105 billion, and BT's is about $80 billion. Joined together, they would be one of the largest fixed-line operators; the world's third-largest wireless company, with 26 million subscribers, and the largest provider of phone and data services to multinational companies. 

 AT&T and BT would be able to wring out huge cost savings by eliminating overlaps in their global networks, call centers and back-office operations, such as billing. AT&T would seek to exploit BT's large but under-leveraged customer base; BT's revenue per customer is lower than AT&T's in the U.S. BT also has struggled to reap the full benefits from its wireless assets. Its U.K. mobile-phone unit, Cellnet, was bigger than that of British rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC five years ago, but now Vodafone's subscriber base in the U.K. surpasses Cellnet's. 

 For both AT&T and BT, the idea of a combination stems in part from both companies' need to solidify their businesses and bolster their shares. BT's  management faces eroding profits in its domestic business and unproven international investments. While other former phone monopolies in Europe have spun off or plan to spin off high-flying businesses like mobile services or Internet operations, the British phone giant has taken a more cautious approach, to the chagrin of many investors. 

 AT&T has had its own trials. It is faced with the vast task of intergrating recently acquired cable-television assets with its domestic network and providing a package of local, long-distance and cable-TV services to millions of Americans. The company also has discovered that many longtime business customers who provide the company's biggest chunk of revenue are starting to desert. 

 AT&T's Mr. Armstrong and BT's Sir Peter are very different personalities. Mr. Armstrong is viewed as a forceful and brash executive. Sir Peter has a gentler approach but isn't likely to take a back seat in a merged company. 

 In the past year, BT has considered several merger prospects in an effort to gain scale. While it succeeded Thursday in taking control of German telecom operator Viag Interkom, agreeing to pay more than 7 billion euros to double its 45% stake, not all of its efforts have borne fruit. Earlier this year, BT walked away from merger negotiations with Spain's Telefonica SA after Juan Villalonga, then chairman of Telefonica, insisted on retaining control of the combined company, people familiar with the situation say.

 AT&T, BT Chiefs Explore Possible Union --- Armstrong, Bonfield Held Informal Talks Recently, But Deal Isn't Imminent

BT, meanwhile, faces intense competition in its core phone business in the United Kingdom. Investors also have found it difficult to place a value on BT's highflying operations, such as the wireless unit. 

 BT shareholders might balk at a potential merger with AT&T because it would expose them to the highly competitive U.S. market, as well as to AT&T's woes. It has happened before: BT's shareholders were wary of a planned acquisition of MCI Communications Corp. after the U.S. company issued a profit warning. BT's management acquiesced, and MCI was subsequently snatched away by WorldCom Inc. 

 But for both companies , a combination offers the prospect of efficiencies of scale, new revenue streams and opportunities in the global Internet market. 

 A merger between AT&T and BT, if successful, would create a titan; AT&T's stock-market value is now about $105 billion, and BT's is about $80 billion. Joined together, they would be one of the largest fixed-line operators; the world's third-largest wireless company, with 26 million subscribers; and the largest provider of phone and data services to multinational companies.

Its U.K. mobile-phone unit, Cellnet, was bigger than that of British rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC five years ago, but now Vodafone's subscriber base in the U.K. surpasses Cellnet's. 

 For both AT&T and BT, the idea of a combination stems in part from both companies' need to solidify their businesses and bolster their shares. The overtures come at a time when AT&T management, believing that the parts of the company are worth much more than where the stock is trading, is considering a wide range of options to boost shareholder value, including spinning off or selling certain assets, or effectively breaking up the giant into smaller pieces. One intriguing scenario being discussed internally, people familiar with the matter say, is joining AT&T's struggling but cash-generating long-distance phone business with Liberty Media Group, the programming business owned by AT&T that trades as a tracking stock, and then spinning off the combined entity. Liberty is headed by cable pioneer John Malone, who sits on AT&T's board. 

 BT's management faces eroding profits in the company's domestic business and unproven international investments. While other former phone monopolies in Europe have spun off or plan to spin off highflying businesses such as mobile services or Internet operations, the British phone giant has taken a more cautious approach, to the chagrin of many investors. 

 AT&T has had its own trials. It is faced with the vast task of integrating recently acquired cable-television assets with its domestic network and providing a package of local and long-distance telephone and cable-TV services to millions of Americans. The company also has discovered that many longtime business customers who provide the company's biggest chunk of revenue are starting to desert. 

 On the downside, a marriage with BT might be seen as a repudiation of Mr. Armstrong's bold phone-over-cable strategy. The plan has cost AT&T $92 billion in acquisition costs alone, and billions more in upgrade expenditures, which continue. AT&T has little to show for its efforts in the way of local phone customers thus far. As of the end of June, AT&T had 122,000 local phone customers wired up, a pittance out of the 60 million long-distance customers it currently claims. 

 Some reckon that if the cable strategy was yielding big results, AT&T wouldn't feel compelled to consider another big deal. A deal with BT, said one telecommunications executive, would be one way for AT&T to hang on. "This is two former big guys trying to stay that way," he said. 

 AT&T's Mr. Armstrong and BT's Sir Peter are very different personalities. Mr. Armstrong is viewed as a forceful and brash executive. Sir Peter has a gentler approach but isn't likely to take a back seat in a merged company. 

 A combination with BT would help create a gargantuan telecom company with a global reach. But it could potentially make AT&T even harder to value on Wall Street. The latter has become a sore point with AT&T board member Mr. Malone and other investors, who believe the company is already going in too many directions too quickly. (Mr. Malone is also one of AT&T's largest individual shareholders.) Some investors also think the company lacks vision under Mr. Armstrong and is resorting to financial gymnastics -- announcing one deal after another without solid execution of anything --  to pump up the stock price. 

 Mr. Armstrong himself dismissed talk of a BT merger last year, saying publicly that the last thing he wanted to do was to be in the local phone business in the U.K. But that, of course, was before AT&T's stock price went into a tailspin and confidence in Mr. Armstrong's leadership had begun to erode. 

 In the past year, BT has considered several merger prospects in an effort to gain scale. While it succeeded yesterday in taking control of German telecom operator Viag Interkom, agreeing to pay more than seven billion euros ($6.4 billion) to double its existing 45% stake, not all of its efforts have borne fruit. Earlier this year, BT walked away from merger negotiations with Spain's Telefonica SA after Juan Villalonga, then chairman of Telefonica, insisted on retaining control of the combined company, people familiar with the situation say.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks were mostly lower at midday Friday, while semiconductor shares continued to prop up the technology sector. Investors were cautious ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting despite optimism about the interest-rate outlook. 

 Bonds moved higher. The 10-year Treasury note was up more than 1/8, or $1.25 for each $1,000 invested, bringing the yield down to 5.77%. The 30-year bond was up 11/32 to yield 5.68%. 

 The dollar was mixed. It traded at 90.77 cents to the euro and 108.15 yen to the dollar, compared to 91.70 cents to the euro and 108.59 yen to the dollar late Thursday in New York. 

 At noon EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 23.07 at 11032.57 after rising 47.25 points Thursday. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 5.48 to 3946.35 after advancing 79.67 in the previous session. 

 Chip stocks continued to advance. The sector, which has been supported by upbeat expectations, got a boost from encouraging comments from Merrill Lynch. 

 Shares of Agilent Technologies rose 9 7/16, or 20%, to 55 15/16 after the maker of test and measurement equipment reported healthy growth in net income just a month after issuing a profit warning. Sun Microsystems rose 3 11/64 to 122 39/64 after the tech bellwether's board declared a two-for-one stock split, subject to shareholder approval. 

 General Motors jumped 3 5/16 to 68 3/4, helping curb the Dow industrials' losses, after the company reported that billionaire financier Carl Icahn plans to buy more than $15 million of GM's common stock. GM also said its common stock is undervalued. 

 But the Dow was held back by broad weakness. Rate-sensitive financial shares, which had helped lead the market higher Thursday, pulled back Friday. Dow components J.P. Morgan and Citigroup contributed to the decline.

 Unions representing 87,000 striking telephone employees have decided to continue negotiating with Verizon Communications in hopes of ending a 13-day strike, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers spokesman Jim Spellane said. 

 Talks reportedly "fell apart" early Friday despite substantial movement on the key concerns of the unions, which enabled them to avert their planned exit from negotiations at midnight Thursday. 

 While negotiations "did not take a good turn in the end, they have not totally fallen apart," said Spellane. "People are still at the hotel and are still talking. There is still some hope as long as people are there talking." 

 --- 

 British Internet-auction firm QXL.com has slashed the amount it is willing to pay for Ricardo.de by about 75% after the German company's shares tumbled and its results weakened. 

 United Kingdom-based QXL agreed in May to merge with Ricardo in an all-stock deal that originally valued its German counterpart at 1.1 billion euros ($1 billion or 674.5 million pounds). 

 QXL last week said it had received new information on Ricardo and was rethinking its offer. QXL Friday said under the revised deal, the maximum amount payable for Ricardo will be 171.2 million pounds ($256.2 million or 279.2 million euros.

 Stocks Edge Lower As Investors Pause Before Fed Meeting

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks edged lower Friday as investors paused ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates. But strength in the semiconductor and auto sectors helped limit losses in the broader market. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 9.16 points, or 0.1%, to close at 11046.48, ending the week up just 20 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 10.53, or 0.2%, to 3930.34, snapping a five-session winning streak but finishing the week up 3.8%. 

 Other major indexes slipped Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.35 to 1491.72, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 2.24 to 668.95, and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks shed 0.95 to 515.51. 

 Caution ahead of Tuesday's Fed meeting led to choppy trading Friday, keeping the markets within a narrow range as investors were unwilling to make major commitments. Stocks were at their lows for the day in midafternoon trading before narrowing their losses. 

 Paul McManus, senior vice president and director of research of Independence Investment Associates, said the market was restrained Friday following a week where fresh economic data helped support stocks and bolster Wall Street's optimism that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged. 

 He said the market doesn't appear poised to make significant broad-based gains in the short term, although interest-rate sensitive stocks such as banks and insurance issues should benefit from the Fed's much-anticipated rate decision. "I don't expect that the market is going to do that much," Mr. McManus said. "It's just going to be continued rotation into different groups." 

 Chip stocks continued to advance Friday, limiting losses on the Nasdaq market. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index posted its sixth-consecutive session of gains, rising 2.2% and ending the week up 19%. The sector, which has been supported by upbeat expectations, got a boost Friday from encouraging comments from Merrill Lynch. 

 Analysts with Merrill Lynch argued that the industry's fundamentals are healthy and stock prices are at attractive levels. Texas Instruments (TXN), STMicroelectronics (STM), Analog Devices (ADI) and National Semiconductor (NSM) were among the advancers. Dow component Intel (INTC) rose 11/16 to 70 3/4 at 4 p.m. EDT. 

 The auto sector also showed strength, with the S&P automobile index gaining 3.4%. Shares of General Motors (GM) rose three points to 68 7/16 following news that billionaire financier Carl Icahn plans to buy more than $15 million of the auto maker's common stock. 

 But shares of J.P. Morgan (JPM), which along with financial shares helped the Dow industrials rise Thursday amid hopes about the interest-rate outlook, fell 1 5/16 to 143 11/16 Friday, weighing on the Dow industrials. Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 7/8 to 82 15/16 following recent gains. 

 Barry Hyman, chief market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said investors are now cautious and will be looking to the Fed's comments accompanying its decision for hints about future monetary policy. He described Friday's trading as tentative and sloppy as investors await the Fed. 

 "We've had a very nice rally in the blue chips [in recent weeks]. I'd like to see the market consolidate before the Fed meeting," Mr. Hyman said, so it is prepared to move higher if the Fed offers encouragement about its outlook on interest rates. 

 The Nasdaq composite's gains this week left it down just 3.4% for the year but off 22% from its March 10 high. Meanwhile, the industrial average remained above the key 11000 level that it closed above last Friday for the first time since late April. But the average remains down 3.9% for the year and off 5.8% from its Jan. 14 high. 

 Analysts expect continued tentativeness on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the Fed's rate decision. But with the prospect of another rate increase all but out of the way, Joseph DeMarco, a managing director at HSBC Asset Management Americas, said Wall Street's focus will shift more toward how deeply corporate profits will be hit as the U.S. economy slows. 

 "I think the market is going to kind of trade sideways in that pretty identifiable trading range for the better part of the next couple months until we see what's going to happen with earnings," Mr. DeMarco said. It will be a market where individual stocks may make inroads, not necessarily the broader indicators, he noted. 

 But others are more optimistic about the market's outlook as Wall Street nears the end of the summer season, which has been marked by lackluster volume. Phil Dow, director of equity strategy at Dain Rauscher Wessels, said the economic and corporate picture is poised to bring strength to stocks. 

 "I think we're reaching an important point. Not just the [Fed] meeting, but also the end of the summer," said Mr. Dow. "Many traders think nothing can happen before Labor Day, but we could see a rally." 

 On Friday, shares of Agilent Technologies (A) rose 10 1/8, or 22%, to 56 5/8 after the maker of test and measurement equipment reported healthy growth in net income just a month after issuing a profitwarning. And Sun Microsystems (SUNW) rose 2 15/16 to 122 3/8 after the tech bellwether's board declared a two-for-one stock split, subject to shareholder approval. 

 News that AT&T's chairman has held informal talks with the chief of British Telecommunications about exploring a possible union sparked a mixed reaction. People close to the situation cautioned that no deal was imminent. Shares of AT&T (T) edged up 1/16 to 32 1/4, while shares of British Telecom (BTY) in the U.S. advanced 4 15/16 to 128 1/2. 

 Meanwhile, the market received some encouragement from economic data released Friday morning. The Commerce Department said the trade gap between the U.S. and its global trading partners grew to $30.62 billion in June. But the smaller-than-expected deficit suggests a pause in the recent trend of increasing U.S. reliance on foreign capital. 

 The data didn't offer anything to change Wall Street's expectations that Fed will leave interest rates unchanged Tuesday. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 in a campaign to curb inflationary pressures and slow U.S. economic growth. 

 Outside the U.S., European shares closed mixed. In the Asian-Pacific region, stocks finished mostly lower Friday. South Korea and Hong Kong led decliners, but Tokyo's market advanced. 

 In major market action: 

 Stocks edged lower. On the Big Board, where 817 million shares traded, 1,600 stocks declined and 1,171 advanced. On the Nasdaq market, 1.44 billion shares changed hands. 

 Bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note was up nearly 1/4, or $2.50 for each $1,000 invested, bringing the yield down to 5.766%. The 30-year bond was up 1/4 to yield 5.686%. 

 The dollar was mixed. It traded at 90.63 cents to the euro and 108.38 yen to the dollar, compared with 91.70 cents to the euro and 108.59 yen to the dollar late Thursday in New York.

 TECH WEEK IN REVIEW: E-Commerce Visions Haunt Starbucks

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) makes good coffee. It also makes lousy Internet investments. 

 Last summer, Starbucks gave up on its fuzzy plans to take its brand to cyberspace, after weak coffee sales led investors to shave 28% off the stock in one session. But its faith in the Internet didn't waver, and the company quickly took stakes in delivery service Kozmo.com Inc. and in furniture site Living.com Inc. 

 But this week, Living.com said it plans to file for bankruptcy protection, and Starbucks said it would take a charge of $20.6 million, or seven cents a share, to write down its investment. Also, Starbucks's $25 million investment in Kozmo doesn't look so hot: After a round of layoffs earlier in the summer, Kozmo pulled its initial public offering Friday and is looking to merge with bitter archrival Urbanfetch.com. 

 Starbucks's other Web bets - Cooking.com and Talk City Inc. (TCTY) - aren't sure things either. Cooking.com is closely held, but Talk City is public, and now trades under $2 a share, down from a year high of $29 in January. 

 Now, the company says, its Internet ambitions are gone for good - e-commerce is out, and c-commerce is back in. Focusing on its real-world coffee stores isn't exactly a contrarian call to make: Investors have turned their backs on almost all Internet retailers, and most e-tailers have no clear path to profitability. 

 This time, at least, Starbucks isn't suffering alone. Even Web-savvy Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) has seen its Internet investments take big hits. Like Starbucks, Amazon is an investor in Kozmo and Living.com. But it also has stakes in public firms Drugstore.com Inc. (DSCM), NextCard Inc. (NXCD), Ashford.com Inc. (ASFD), Audible Inc. (ADBL) and Pets.com Inc. (IPET). Of those five, all trade below $7 a share. 

 Hardware and Software 

 Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) agreed to acquire NewPort Communications Inc. for about $1.32 billion in stock, the chip maker's second major deal this month. 

 Corel Corp. (CORL) said Michael Cowpland resigned as president, CEO and chairman. Derek Burney will serve as interim CEO of the struggling software maker. 

 The Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) antitrust case should go directly to the Supreme Court for a final ruling and not be delayed by appeal, the government said, citing the case's importance to the U.S. economy. 

 Linux will be released in a new and improved version this fall, said Linus Torvalds, who oversees the system. 

 A federal judge ruled in favor of the film industry in a case involving software used to copy DVD movie files. 

 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) wrongfully fired a female executive who charged that the software company had improperly examined a product from rival SAP AG (SAP), a jury ruled. 

 Intel Corp. (INTC) agreed to acquire closely held communications-products maker Ziatech Corp. for about $240 million. 

 TV manufacturers plan to increase production of sets that can show high-definition, digital broadcasts, despite a scarcity of programs for them and a review of technical standards that may lead to design changes. 

 Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) is expected to be awarded a contract valued at more than $150 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to build a supercomputer for nuclear-weapons testing. Separately, Compaq unveiled new products for playing digital music, accessing the Internet and receiving wireless e-mail that it says are intended to lessen the distinction between the use of the Internet at home and work. 

 Internet and Online 

 Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. (NTT) will go ahead with its $5.5 billion purchase of Verio Inc. (VRIO), an Internet Web-hosting concern, after winning support from U.S. officials who had been badly divided over the deal's national-security implications. 

 Healtheon/WebMD Corp. (HLTH) has started laying off some its workers, becoming the latest Internet company to resort to pink slips to cut expenses. 

 Federal regulators questioned America Online Inc. (AOL) and Time Warner Inc. (TWX) about their proposed merger, honing in on such issues as cable access to multiple Internet-service providers. 

 General Motors Corp. (GM) plans a venture with its dealers to compete with independent online car-sale sites. The proposed site would provide information about rivals' products.

 Shoe Carnival earnings off, slowing store openings.

 EVANSVILLE, Ind., Aug 17 (Reuters) - Discount shoe retailer Shoe Carnival Inc. on Thursday reported a 48 percent drop in second-quarter earnings and said it plans to open only about 15 new stores in 2001, down from 32 planned for this year, due to a soft retail environment. 

 Net earnings in the fiscal second quarter, ended July 29, were $1.7 million, or 14 cents per diluted share, down from $3.3 million, or 24 cents per share, in the year-ago second quarter. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected Shoe Carnival to earn 13 cents a share. Analysts cut their earnings forecasts after a profit warning from the company last month. 

 Net sales rose 15 percent to $95.6 million from $83.2 million a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year - "same-store" sales - fell 2.1 percent. 

 Shares of Shoe Carnival were up 1/8 to 6-1/4 in morning trade on Nasdaq. 

 "Despite the strong start to the back-to-school selling period, we have elected to be more conservative in our store opening programme in 2001 due to the uncertain state of the overall retailing environment and the effect rising interest rates may have on consumer spending," Mark Lemond, president and chief executive of Shoe Carnival, said in a statement. 

 "Therefore, we currently expect to open approximately 15 stores in the year 2001. We may elect however to resume a more aggressive store opening programme in the second half of next year if economic conditions warrant it," he said. 

 During the first six months of 2000, 16 new stores were opened, including 10 in the second quarter. Another 16 stores are expected to be opened in the second half of 2000, bringing the total new stores to 32 for the year. 

 One store will be closed in September 2000. A charge for the closing costs of about 1 cent per share is included in second quarter net earnings. 

 As a percentage of sales, gross profit margins for the second quarter of 2000 were 28.6 percent, compared with a record high 30.2 percent last year. 

 Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 24.8 percent from 23.4 percent a year earlier.

 Telecom Sector Pressures European Markets; Shares Rally in Brazil

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- European stock markets closed mostly lower Thursday, pressured by further weakness in many telecommunications issues as Germany's auction for mobile-phone licenses concluded. 

 Most markets across the Americas closed higher, with Brazilian stocks rallying on hopes that Moody's Investors Service will upgrade that country's credit ratings. Canadian shares set a new record in Toronto. 

 In Asia earlier, stocks closed mixed in light trading. 

 London's Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index slipped 13.8 points, or 0.2%, to close at 6518.2 on volume of 1.4 billion shares. Shares of Vodafone Group, which have the heaviest weighting in the index, dropped 4.4%. 

 British Telecommunications fell 1.1% amid news it plans to buy an additional 45% stake in Germany's Viag Interkom for 6.65 billion euros ($6.09 billion). David Harbage, a fund manager at Barclays Stockbrokers, said investors are concerned about the short-term cost of the acquisition to BT. 

 Shares in oil companies were a bright spot in the market, lifted by rising prices on London's International Petroleum Exchange. Shell gained 2.3% and BP Amoco added 1.5%. 

 Frankfurt's Xetra DAX closed down 36.84 points, or 0.5%, at 7278.43. E.On, which is selling its Viag Interkom stake to BT, lost 3%. It also issued a profit warning for full-year results. 

 Deutsche Telekom rebounded from morning losses to close up 0.9%. 

 After 14 days and 173 rounds, Deutsche Telekom walked away as the top bidder in the auction for next-generation mobile-phone licenses, which ended Thursday with total bids reaching 98.81 billion marks ($46.26 billion). The figure was far above the 60 billion marks analysts initially had expected. 

 MobilCom rose 3.3% after saying the price it paid for its mobile-phone license was appropriate and in line with international standards. Debitel, a SwissCom unit, surged 12% after it pulled out of the auction. 

 Jeremy Batstone, head of research at Natwest Stockbrokers, said investors are cautious about telecom stocks because each company will have to assume substantial levels of debt to promote the new mobile-phone technology. With the German auction out of the way, telecom companies now need to prepare for the French and Italian auctions, he said. 

 In Paris, the CAC-40 closed down 48.74 points, or 0.7%, at 6635.34 after ending at an all-time high Wednesday. Market bellwether France Telecom fell 3%. 

 Elsewhere in Europe, main indexes fell 0.8% in Milan, 0.7% in Zurich and 1.7% in Madrid. But the AEX index in Amsterdam edged up 0.3% and Stockholm's SX General index rose 0.7%. 

 Across the Atlantic, Sao Paulo's main stock index, the Bovespa, closed up 371.75 points, or 2.2%, at 17702.52, nearly erasing Wednesday's 2.3% tumble. Stocks rallied after Moody's placed Brazil's credit ratings on review for possible upgrade based on what it sees as ongoing structural changes in the country's economy. 

 Moody's potential upgrade of Brazil's ratings also sparked optimism in Mexico. 

 Mexico City's IPC index rose 58.89 points, or 0.9%, to 6536.87, supported by gains in telecommunications and media stocks. Market bellwether Telefonos de Mexico L shares rose 1.3%. Conglomerate Grupo Carso A1 shares jumped 4.4%. 

 Market watchers also said strong U.S. equity markets helped the IPC. The Nasdaq Composite index climbed nearly 80 points, or 2.1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47 points, or 0.4%. 

 Blue-chips closed at another all-time high in Toronto with fairly broad support, after pausing for a day Wednesday. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index climbed 67.17 points, or 0.6%, to 11098.15, building on records set Monday and Tuesday. 

 Toronto also benefited from the upward move in New York. Overall, 10 of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. 

 Earlier, Tokyo stocks fell 1% on profit-taking, snapping a four-day rally. Hong Kong shares also slipped, while stocks in Taiwan and the Philippines rose. 

 Tokyo's blue-chip Nikkei 225 index slid 195.00 points, or 1.1%, to close at 16161.03, giving back about half of the 380-point gain made over the previous four sessions. Decliners beat advancers by 3 to 1 on volume estimated at 447.1 million shares, down from 524.9 million shares Wednesday. 

 Trading remained thin amid a lack of major market-moving incentives. 

 Hong Kong's recent rally sputtered Thursday, with the blue-chip Hang Seng index easing 112.14 points, or 0.6%, to 17622.01. Still, analysts suggested the upward trend is likely to resume amid relief that the U.S. looks unlikely to raise interest rates again soon. Hong Kong rates normally move in tandem with U.S. rates because of the territory's monetary peg to the U.S. dollar. 

 Trading was dominated by Pacific Century CyberWorks as its merger with Hong Kong telecom giant Cable & Wireless HKT became effective. CyberWorks lost 2.9%, with trading in its shares accounting for about 10% of the day's volume. The weakness was attributed to concerns that HKT shareholders may sell new CyberWorks shares issued to them, triggering pressure on the shares. CyberWorks will issue 8.67 billion new shares after the merger. 

 In Manila, Philippine shares staged a technical rally led by oversold banking stocks and other blue chips. Traders said the expected release of at least a dozen foreign tourists held hostage for months by Muslim rebels also helped spur positive sentiment. However, government negotiators later said the release isn't expected until Friday because of bad weather on the island of Sulu where the hostages are being held. 

 The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index surged 26.67 points, or 1.8%, to close at 1499.74. 

 In Taipei, Taiwanese shares also rose almost 2% as optimism over the outlook for the semiconductor industry continued to lure investors. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange added 1.8%. 

 In Singapore, the Straits Times Index climbed 1% for its sixth consecutive gain. Underpinning the advance was a better-than-expected trade report which showed the republic's exports were up more than 15% in July from a year earlier. Kuala Lumpur's composite index of Malaysian issues tacked on or 1.4%, but Bangkok's SET index of Thai stocks lost 1.5%.

 UPDATE 1-Novell 3rd-qtr net tops forecasts - sets buyback.

 PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug 16 (Reuters) - Novell Inc., a maker of computer network and directory management software, on Wednesday said quarterly earnings dropped more than fivefold - not quite as far as analysts had forecast - and announced plans to buy back as much as $500 million of its stock. 

 For the fiscal third quarter ended July 31, Novell said net income fell to $8.57 million, or 3 cents a share, from $49.3 million, or 14 cents, in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales fell 17 percent to $270.0 million from $326.8 million. 

 Profit per share in the latest period was slightly ahead of the consensus forecast of 2 cents, according to a poll of analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial. The stock added 1/16 to close at 10-15/16 on the Nasdaq, before the results were announced late Wednesday afternoon. 

 Novell, which recently reorganized itself into three business units to streamline operations, has struggled because of falling sales to big distributors. In late May, the company blamed the slack results on a stumbling sales force. The grim news cut short what had been been a comeback for the once-struggling company, based in Provo, Utah. 

 The results "are pretty much what we had indicated," said Dennis Raney, Novell's chief financial officer, in an interview. "I think we are getting our arms around the problem and we know what the issues are and I think we're starting to execute on that issues." 

 Still, he said the situation will "take some time to turn around." The company said in late May that it would take up to nine months to correct the problems at the maker of software to help manage users on large computer networks. 

 Novell also said that business was hurt by disappointing sales in Europe, in addition to the continuing slow sales to large distributors such as Tech Data Corp., Ingram Micro Inc. and others. 

 Raney also said that sales in the fourth quarter will be essentially unchanged from those in the third quarter. He added that the company will likely break-even on a per-share basis in the fourth quarter. The consensus forecast for Novell's fourth quarter is for earnings of 4 cents a share. 

 Raney also said that a RedHerring.com story published on Tuesday, citing sources close to the company, which said Novell was considering spinning off some of its divisions as separate companies, was inaccurate. 

 "We are not breaking the company up," Raney said. "That story was incorrect." 

 Novell shares have fallen 73 percent this year and have plunged from year-high of $44.56 reached Feb. 17, before the company issued its profit warning.

 Target Profits Rise, But Its Stock Slips

 Strong sales at its namesake discount chain helped Target Corp.'s profits rise 15 percent for the second quarter, meeting expectations, but its stock dropped as investors and analysts showed concern that profits will slow for the rest of the year. 

 The company reported net income of $258 million, or 28 cents per share, after an extraordinary gain for the three months ended July 29, up from $224 million, or 24 cents per share, for the same period a year ago. The company reported a $1 million extraordinary gain in the most recent quarter, and a $4 million charge in the year-ago period, both debt-related. 

 The per-share profits for the Minneapolis-based retailer met the expectations of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research. (The company split its stock 2- for-1 effective July 19.) 

 Sales rose 7.3 percent to $8.25 billion. Still, some industry trends -- slower customer traffic and weakness in apparel sales -- point to uncertainty for the second half of Target's fiscal year, said analyst Dean Ramos of George K. Baum & Co. in Minneapolis. 

 Anxious investors sent Target shares down $2.81, to $27.13 per share, a nearly 10 percent decline. The retailer's shares are hovering near its 52-week low of $25.94. 

 "You have a fair amount of investor concern as to what's going to happen in the third quarter and fourth quarter," said Ramos, who lowered his numbers on Target for the third quarter and the year. Target has tough numbers to meet from last year's third quarter and the company is expected to have higher costs from opening more stores in the third quarter -- 40 openings are planned this year, vs. 33 a year ago, he said. 

 Other chains, such as Gap Inc., have missed second-quarter forecasts and said profit growth may slow in the second half of the year. J.C. Penney on Tuesday beat its second-quarter profit target set by analysts by one penny but issued a warning for the rest of 2000. Retailers, including Target, have said they're experienced a slowdown in customer traffic in the past couple of months. 

 Target officials said during a conference call Tuesday the company plans to ratchet up the rollout of its SuperTarget concept, which adds a full grocery line to its discount store concept, by about 50 percent over the next decade, said Asma Usmani, an analyst for Edward Jones & Co. The company now plans to open 300 to 350 of the larger format stores, up from its initial target of 200. It operated 16 of the stores at the end of last year, and planned to double that number this year. Although more aggressive, the pace remains modest compared with industry leader Wal-Mart, which operates more than 720 supercenters, adding 150 last year alone. 

 Usmani believes Target's aggressive plans for its supercenter stores will help drive traffic and increase general merchandise sales. 

 Target's discount chain continues to drive the company. Sales for the discount chain rose 9.9 percent in the quarter vs. 3.9 percent at the corporation's Dayton's, Hudson's and Marshall Field's department stores. Sales for the Mervyn's chain rose 1 percent. Target discount stores accounted for 80 percent of the company's $8.25 billion in sales. 

 Mervyn's and the department stores were hurt by soft sales in adult clothing and cool weather in the Midwest and Northeast, analysts said. Apparel accounts for about one-third of Target's total business. 

 Target repurchased 7.7 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $29.67 a share in the second quarter. The continuation of the stock repurchase plan will dilute profits in the third quarter and perhaps the fourth quarter, analyst Ramos said.

 RUPERT Murdoch's $9 billion United States television station acquisition received a hot and cold reception on the Australian sharemarket yesterday despite evoking positive responses from analysts and ratings agencies. News Corp confirmed speculation overnight it would buy Chris-Craft Industries in a $US5.35 billion ($A9.2 billion) cash and stock deal. 

 The addition of the 10 Chris-Craft stations to the 23-station Fox Television network takes the group past rival networks NBC and ABC and puts it on equal footing with frontrunner CBS. "We are acquiring stations with tremendous upside potential, particularly given Fox's strength in local news, entertainment, programming, sports and sales," Mr Murdoch, News Corp's chairman and chief executive, said. Mr Murdoch said the extra stations would give Fox 13 stations in the United States' top 10 markets and 20 stations in the top 20 markets. 

 "Fox will now have duopolies in three of the largest television markets in the US: New York, Los Angeles and Dallas," he said. Investment house Merrill Lynch estimates potential duopoly cost savings for News Corp of $US40 to $US50 million in the four new markets. New York-based Merrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen said the deal would give News Corp more clout in the buying and selling of programming. While News Corp stock climbed higher on Wall Street overnight, it had a mixed performance on the Australian Stock Exchange after Monday's trading halt. The ordinary shares powered 70, or 3.3 percent, higher to $22. But the company's preferred scrip suffered a 1.8 percent decline, ending down 34 to $18.43. "It was a News Corp day, its day was very strong," William Noall dealer and financial adviser Brad Shallard said. News Corp's efforts helped drag the ASX200 up 8.2 points to 3323.1. The All Ordinaries index firmed 7.9 points to 3283.8, within easy reach to set a new record closing high today. And in Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones jumped to its best close in more than four months. Mr Shallard said the News Corp deal was positive because assets would not be sold to fund it, nor would it add to debt. "It will give them more mass and more might," Mr Shallard said.

 News Corp will issue about 73 million American depositary receipts, equal to about 292 million preferred shares, to buy Chris-Craft Industries Inc, BHC Communications Inc and United Television Inc. In the local bourse, the big winner was Australia's third largest telco, AAPT, which rocketed 20.7 percent to $7.12. Investors scrambled for the stock after Telecom New Zealand said it would offer $7.25 a share for the 20 percent of AAPT it did not already own. Away from the telco sector, Brisbane heavy engineer Evans Deakin was the surprise performer, adding 8 to $2.13 despite issuing a profit warning for 1999-00. Notoriously harsh investors were willing to turn a blind eye to the profit warning and instead focused on market gossip that a major player would make a takeover bid of $2.75 a share, as early as tomorrow. "The fact the stock closed up 8 would indicate the market supports the rumour," a broker said. The pharmaceutical industry showed conflicting direction yesterday after one market favourite reinforced its gains with another stunning performance while a former market darling fell from favour. Drug group CSL soared $1.26 to $35.70 after reporting a stronger than expected annual profit of $54.4 million for 1999-2000. Meanwhile, Australian Vaccine Technologies lost 8 to 34 after coming under fire from leading scientists who questioned the claimed effectiveness of AVT melanoma vaccine, M-Vax. In currency, the Aussie dollar made a strong break above US58 and was hovering around US58.3 late yesterday.

 WRAPUP 2-U.S. retailers Home Depot, Target Q2 net up.

 (Adds closing stock prices throughout, more details in paragraphs 24, 26) 

 CHICAGO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. reported higher second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, while J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a sharp drop in operating profits and Staples Inc. reported lower results amid a slowdown in consumer spending. 

 Retailers reporting earnings mostly matched Wall Street expectations, but cautionary statements about the third quarter from some, as well as ongoing wariness about a cooling U.S. economy, pressured stock prices, analysts said. 

 "(The second quarter) was off the trend that had been built for awhile, and initially we're not seeing any kind of a sharp snap back for Q3," Dean Ramos, retail industry analyst with George K. Baum said. "And not only are you not getting people beating the numbers, but they are not being wildly enthusiastic about the back half of the year." 

 Atlanta-based Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported a 23 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter earnings that was in line with Wall Street's expectations. The company said profits were helped by new initiatives, including sales of appliances. 

 But investors, hoping to see Home Depot beat earnings expectations, pushed shares down to close off 4-13/16 to 53-1/2 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Home Depot, which operates 1,011 stores, earned $838 million in the second quarter ended July 30, or 36 cents a share, up from $679 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenue in the quarter rose to $12.62 billion from $10.43 billion in the year-earlier period. 

 Both Target, the No. 4 U.S. retailer, and J.C. Penney, the No. 5 retailer, tempered forecasts for the third quarter. 

 Minneapolis-based Target reported a 13 percent increase in fiscal second-quarter operating earnings that matched analysts' expectations. But the retailer said higher store-opening expenses would dampen earnings growth in the third quarter. 

 Target said earnings before gains and losses from debt extinguishment in the second quarter ended July 29 rose to $257 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, from $228 million, or 24 cents per share. Year-ago earnings per share were adjusted for a two-for-one stock split on July 19. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected Minneapolis-based Target to report a profit of 28 cents a share. Net income was $258 million, up from $224 million a year earlier. 

 Target stock closed off 3-3/16 at 26-15/16 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Total revenues in the quarter rose to $8.25 billion, compared with $7.69 billion in the year-ago quarter. Sales in its upscale discount Target Stores unit rose 9.9 percent to $6.5 billion. 

 J.C. Penney reported a 90 percent decline in operating earnings, and warned that results for the balance of the year would be hurt if sales at its department stores stayed soft. 

 The profit warning helped send shares of Plano, Texas-based Penney down as much as 11 percent before closing off 1-7/8 at 16-1/16 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Penney said income excluding unusual items fell to $11 million, or 1 cent per diluted share, from $112 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected Penney to break even on an operating basis for the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Penney, which operates about 1,100 department stores and 2,600 Eckerd drugstores, said its revenues for the second quarter ended July 29 rose to $7.43 billion from $7.31 billion a year ago. Net income after unusual items fell to $23 million or 6 cents per share from $39 million or 12 cents per share a year before. 

 Staples Inc., the No. 2 office products retailer behind Office Depot Inc., reported its second-quarter net income fell 19 percent, but beat analysts estimates, on better-than-expected sales from its retail stores and online business. 

 Framingham, Mass.-based Staples said it had net income of $42.6 million during the second quarter, down from $52.7 million during the same quarter of the previous year. 

 Earnings per share, including online operations, were 10 cents in the current year's second quarter ended July 29, down from net income of 11 cents per share a year before. Wall Street analysts had estimated Staples operating profit at 9 cents a share, First Call/Thomson Financial said. 

 Total sales for the second quarter increased 20 percent to $2.20 billion, up from $1.84 billion, while sales at same-store stores - those open at least one year - grew 10 percent. Same-store sales include the Staples.com retail Web site. 

 Staples stock ended off 11/16 at 17-7/16 in trade on the Nasdaq. 

 Discount apparel retailer TJX Cos. Inc., based in Framingham, Mass., reported second quarter earnings of $114 million, down slightly from net income of $115.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income per share, however, rose to 39 cents from 36 cents a year ago, helped by a drop in the number of outstanding shares. 

 TJX stock ended down 3/8 at 17 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Among retailers reporting after the market closed, Birmingham, Ala.-based Saks Inc., parent company of upscale department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, posted a second-quarter loss of $4.8 million, in line with analysts' consensus estimates, as sales and gross margin shortfalls in the company's department store business weighed down results. 

 Saks stock fell 1/8 to 9-7/16, close to its 52-week low of 9-1/4, in NYSE trading.

 CHICAGO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. reported higher second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, while J.C. Penney Co. Inc. reported a sharp drop in operating profits and Staples Inc. reported lower results amid a slowdown in consumer spending. 

 Retailers reporting earnings mostly matched Wall Street expectations, but cautionary statements about the third quarter from some, as well as ongoing wariness about a cooling U.S. economy, pressured stock prices, analysts said. 

 "(The second quarter) was off the trend that had been built for awhile, and initially we're not seeing any kind of a sharp snap back for Q3," Dean Ramos, retail industry analyst with George K. Baum said. "And not only are you not getting people beating the numbers, but they are not being wildly enthusiastic about the back half of the year." 

 Atlanta-based Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported a 23 percent rise in fiscal second-quarter earnings that was in line with Wall Street's expectations. The company said profits were helped by new initiatives, including sales of appliances. 

 But investors, hoping to see Home Depot beat earnings expectations, pushed shares down to close off 4-13/16 to 53-1/2 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Home Depot, which operates 1,011 stores, earned $838 million in the second quarter ended July 30, or 36 cents a share, up from $679 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenue in the quarter rose to $12.62 billion from $10.43 billion in the year-earlier period. 

 Both Target, the No. 4 U.S. retailer, and J.C. Penney, the No. 5 retailer, tempered forecasts for the third quarter. 

 Minneapolis-based Target reported a 13 percent increase in fiscal second-quarter operating earnings that matched analysts' expectations. But the retailer said higher store-opening expenses would dampen earnings growth in the third quarter. 

 Target said earnings before gains and losses from debt extinguishment in the second quarter ended July 29 rose to $257 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, from $228 million, or 24 cents per share. Year-ago earnings per share were adjusted for a two-for-one stock split on July 19. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected Minneapolis-based Target to report a profit of 28 cents a share. Net income was $258 million, up from $224 million a year earlier. 

 Target stock closed off 3-3/16 at 26-15/16 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Total revenues in the quarter rose to $8.25 billion, compared with $7.69 billion in the year-ago quarter. Sales in its upscale discount Target Stores unit rose 9.9 percent to $6.5 billion. 

 J.C. Penney reported a 90 percent decline in operating earnings, and warned that results for the balance of the year would be hurt if sales at its department stores stayed soft. 

 The profit warning helped send shares of Plano, Texas-based Penney down as much as 11 percent before closing off 1-7/8 at 16-1/16 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Penney said income excluding unusual items fell to $11 million, or 1 cent per diluted share, from $112 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected Penney to break even on an operating basis for the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Penney, which operates about 1,100 department stores and 2,600 Eckerd drugstores, said its revenues for the second quarter ended July 29 rose to $7.43 billion from $7.31 billion a year ago. Net income after unusual items fell to $23 million or 6 cents per share from $39 million or 12 cents per share a year before. 

 Staples Inc. , the No. 2 office products retailer behind Office Depot Inc. , reported its second-quarter net income fell 19 percent, but beat analysts estimates, on better-than-expected sales from its retail stores and online business. 

 Framingham, Mass.-based Staples said it had net income of $42.6 million during the second quarter, down from $52.7 million during the same quarter of the previous year. 

 Earnings per share, including online operations, were 10 cents in the current year's second quarter ended July 29, down from net income of 11 cents per share a year before. Wall Street analysts had estimated Staples operating profit at 9 cents a share, First Call/Thomson Financial said. 

 Total sales for the second quarter increased 20 percent to $2.20 billion, up from $1.84 billion, while sales at same-store stores - those open at least one year - grew 10 percent. Same-store sales include the Staples.com retail Web site. 

 Staples stock ended off 11/16 at 17-7/16 in trade on the Nasdaq. 

 Discount apparel retailer TJX Cos. Inc. , based in Framingham, Mass., reported second quarter earnings of $114 million, down slightly from net income of $115.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income per share, however, rose to 39 cents from 36 cents a year ago, helped by a drop in the number of outstanding shares. 

 TJX stock ended down 3/8 at 17 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Among retailers reporting after the market closed, Birmingham, Ala.-based Saks Inc. , parent company of upscale department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, posted a second-quarter loss of $4.8 million, in line with analysts' consensus estimates, as sales and gross margin shortfalls in the company's department store business weighed down results. 

 Saks stock fell 1/8 to 9-7/16, close to its 52-week low of 9-1/4, in NYSE trading. 

 Value-priced retailer Kohl's Corp. was a bright spot in the otherwise gloomy batch of retail earnings. Kohl's posted a 42 percent increase in second-quarter net income, helped by solid sales gains in sales in all of its 298 stores. The company said it earned $64.3 million, or 19 cents a diluted share, up from $45.2 million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-ago second quarter.

 CHICAGO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S retailers Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. reported higher second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, while JCPenney Co. Inc. reported a sharp drop in operating earnings and Staples Inc. reported a dip in results. 

 Atlanta-based Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, reported a 23-percent rise in fiscal second-quarter earnings that was in line with Wall Street's expectations. The company said profits were helped by new initiatives, including sales of appliances. 

 But investors, hoping to see Home Depot beat earnings expectations, pushed shares down 2-13/16 to 55-1/2 in morning trade on the New York Stock exchange. 

 Home Depot, which operates 1,011 stores, earned $838 million in the second quarter ended July 30, or 36 cents a share, compared with $679 million, or 29 cents a share, in the same period last year. 

 Revenue in the quarter rose to $12.62 billion from $10.43 billion in the year-earlier period. 

 Target, the No. 4 U.S. retailer, reported a 13 percent increase in fiscal second-quarter operating earnings, meeting Wall Street expectations. 

 Target said earnings before gains and losses from debt extinguishment in the second quarter ended July 29 rose to $257 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, from $228 million, or 24 cents per share. Year-ago earnings per share were adjusted for a two-for-one stock split on July 19. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected Minneapolis-based Target to report a profit of 28 cents a share. Net income was $258 million, up from $224 million a year earlier, and net income per share was unchanged from operating per share figures 

 Shares of Target were off 1-7/8 at 28-1/4 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Total revenues in the quarter rose to $8.25 billion, compared with $7.69 billion in the year-ago quarter. Sales in its upscale discount Target Stores unit rose 9.9 percent to $6.5 billion. 

 Sales at the company's Mervyn's department stores, however, eased 1 percent to $940 million and the company's Dayton Hudson unit department store sales fell 3.9 percent to $661 million. 

 Soft sales in JCPenney's department stores and overall sluggishness in the retail industry hit its results. 

 Many retailers have seen sales level off as the U.S. economy slows and consumers cut back on purchases. Department stores, which have struggled to clear inventories of seasonal apparel this summer, have been hit particularly hard. 

 JCPenney, the No. 5 U.S. retailer, reported a 90 percent decline in operating earnings and warned that results for the balance of the year would be hurt if sales at its department stores stayed soft. 

 "August is a key month for the third quarter, but it has started slowly and below plan," Donald McKay, Penney's chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call. "If this trend continues for any period of time, analysts' (earnings) estimates for the third quarter and fourth quarter could prove to be high." 

 The profit warning helped send shares of Plano, Texas-based Penney down 7 percent. The shares were off 1-7/16 at 16-1/2 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Penney, the No. 5 U.S. retailer, said income excluding unusual items fell to $11 million, or 1 cent per diluted share, from $112 million, or 40 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected Penney to break even on an operating basis for the quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Penney, which operates about 1,100 department stores and 2,600 Eckerd drugstores, said its revenues for the second quarter ended July 29 rose to $7.43 billion from $7.31 billion a year ago. Net income after unusual items fell to $23 million or 6 cents per share from $39 million or 12 cents per share a year before. 

 Staples Inc., the No. 2 office products retailer, reported its second-quarter net income fell 19 percent, but beat analysts estimates, on better-than-expected sales from its retail stores and online business. 

 Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples said it had net income of $42.6 million during the second quarter, down from $52.7 million during the same quarter of the previous year. 

 Earnings per share, excluding online operations, were 10 cents in the current year's second quarter ended July 29, down from net income of 11 cents per share a year before. Wall Street analysts on average had estimated Staples would report earnings before online losses of 9 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks earnings data. 

 Total sales for the second quarter increased 20 percent to $2.20 billion, up from $1.84 billion, while sales at same-store stores - those open at least one year - grew 10 percent. Same-store sales include the Staples.com retail Web site.

 Unbalanced Spin: The market unfairly bashes appliance leader Whirlpool

 The stock market generally rewards industry leaders, but not Whirlpool. Shares of the top global appliance maker and the No. 1 seller in the U.S. have be en bashed this year, falling 35%, to 43, after hitting a recent low of 40, which is where they traded back in 1992. Much of the damage has occurred since mid-July, when Whirlpool announced strong second-quarter profits, but warned of weaker-than-expected earnings in the second half of this year. Then Circuit City, an important vendor of Whirlpool products, said it was getting out of the appliance business. The company now faces the challenge of recouping lost Circuit City sales at a time when industry conditions may have peaked, while at the same time avoiding an all-out price war. 

 But the stock's fans argue that Wall Street has overreacted and that the stock is deeply undervalued. "Whirlpool hasn't gotten credit for all it's done in the past five to 10 years to turn itself into a global company," says Cliff Hoover, a principal at NFJ Investment Group in Dallas, which holds 700,000 Whirlpool shares. "The stock's compelling at these levels." He believes it could double in the next two years-which isn't a stretch, given that it traded at 75 only a year ago. 

 That goes against the conventional wisdom. Most Wall Street analysts are cool on Whirlpool (except for Robert Cornell of Lehman Brothers, who has an optimistic target of 100 for the stock in the next year). And even at these levels Whirlpool, with a 33% domestic market share, isn't a likely takeover target, as another appliance maker would face big antitrust hurdles (<<General Electric>> and <<Maytag>> are the Nos. 2 and 3 appliance producers domestically, followed by Sweden's <<Electrolux>>, which markets the Frigidaire brand. Electrolux has been rumored to be talking to Maytag about a potential combination.) Financial buyers, meanwhile, would have to sell a sizable amount of debt in the inhospitable junk-bond market to pay for any deal. 

 But Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, looks inexpensive by several measures. Its stock trades for under seven times projected 2000 profits of $6.40 a share, way below its historic price/earnings ratio in the past decade in the high teens (see table). 

 It should be said that 2000 profit estimates were pared by around 30 cents a share after the July warning and that the current-year profits include about 50 cents a share in non-cash income from the company's overfunded pension plan. There were no such gains last year, when Whirlpool earned $5.35 a share from core operations. Wall Street expects the company to make about $7 in 2001. 

 Whirlpool's equity market value stands at just $3.1 billion, less than one-third its annual sales of $10.5 billion, a very low price/sales ratio. Even when Whirlpool's debt of $1.8 billion is factored in, the valuation is modest. The company's enterprise value (equity plus debt) is only four times pre-tax cash flow-cheap even by the depressed standards of much of industrial America. 

 In contrast, Maytag, which has seen its stock fall 40% in the past year to 37, still trades at a premium to Whirlpool, fetching nearly 10 times profits and six times cash flow. 

 Whirlpool's chief executive, David Whitwam, also is frustrated by the low stock price. "Our price/earnings multiple doesn't seem rational given the performance of the business and the outlook," he tells Barron's. He notes that Whirlpool's P/E historically has been slightly lower than that of the S&P 500, but now the stock trades at only about one-quarter of the S&P 500's multiple. 

 Whirlpool has stepped up its share-repurchase program this year, buying nearly four million shares in the first half of the year to cut its shares outstanding to 72 million. Sizable further repurchases are expected this year. "If they continue to generate these kind of profits and aggressively repurchase stock, the current share price is unsustainably low," says Harold Levy, a principal at Iridian Asset Management in Westport, Connecticut, a Whirlpool holder. 

 Whitwam points out that Whirlpool has generated 20% growth in quarterly operating profits for 15 straight quarters, an impressive performance. Second-quarter earnings of $1.66 a share were up 28% from the year-earlier level. Some might quibble with Whirlpool's definition of core profits. They include pension gains and exclude such actions as a $60 million after-tax charge for the Brazilian currency devaluation in early 1999. Nevertheless, Whirlpool's profits still have doubled since 1997. 

 Wall Street clearly is skeptical of Whirlpool's ability to maintain anything close to its rapid growth of recent years. The company targets an ambitious 15%20% annual profit gain. But the stock market appears to be anticipating an outright drop in net next year. 

 The company, whose main domestic brands are Whirlpool and the upscale KitchenAid, embarked on an expensive strategy a decade ago to transform itself from a primarily U.S. appliance maker to a global player. It now gets over 40% of its sales outside North America. It has a big presence in Europe, where Whirlpool is the No. 1 brand, and in South America, where it's dominant in the biggest market, Brazil. 

 Whirlpool's strategy of building and buying manufacturing facilities throughout the world and developing the only true global appliance brand has differed from GE's aim of "owning markets and not factories" via alliances with overseas partners. 

 The jury is still out on which approach is better. Whirlpool points to the enormous opportunity abroad, where appliance demand is rising at several times the projected 2%-3% annual pace in the States. Whirlpool has successfully developed common appliance platforms worldwide in an effort to bring new products to market quickly and to streamline production. But a global presence can have its pitfalls. Whirlpool got whacked last year by Brazil's currency crisis and has been exposed to weakening economies in Asia. 

 Whirlpool's biggest critic on Wall Street, Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities, says the company "has too many assets tied up in overseas markets where there are no barriers to entry." Heymann says Whirlpool faces dozens of competitors in Europe and Asia that don't need to hit its profit hurdles and can undercut it on price, resulting in lower margins outside the U.S. The company says its domestic appliance operating margin of 12% is comparable with those of GE and Maytag. 

 Hoover avers that Whirlpool's "global strategy" to build a "Coke-like" appliance brand is just starting to pay off and puts the company in a better position than Maytag, which has minimal international sales. 

 Whirlpool actually has bested mighty General Electric in appliances in recent years with GE Appliance's profits last year below those in 1995. But Whirlpool's detractors worry that a revitalized GE, which plans to introduce a bevy of new products next year, including a still-secret line of energy-efficient refrigerators, will pose a bigger challenge to Whirlpool in the coming years. 

 One of the other main knocks against Whirlpool is that it's too dependent on <<Sears Roebuck>> but has virtually no exposure to the emerging dynamo in appliance sales, <<Home Depot>>. Whirlpool is Sears' biggest supplier, producing many of the Kenmore label products, and gets about 20% of its revenues from Sears. Despite being derided as a retail dinosaur, Sears still accounts for over one in three appliances sold in the U.S. and actually has increased its market share in the past year to 38%. Beyond Sears, Whirlpool also is the biggest supplier to the next two biggest appliance sellers in the U.S.<<Lowe's>> and <<Best Buy>>. 

 Whirlpool, like its rivals, has been eagerly developing high-margin, high-end appliances that appeal to affluent Americans who see their kitchens as status symbols and are willing to plunk down $5,000 for a Sub-Zero refrigerator or Viking range. Maytag probably has had the most success in this area with its European-style Neptune washers and its Jenn-Air ranges. 

 But Whirlpool also has been in the game. The company, for instance, plans to introduce a new high-end washer next month that it believes will offer the best cleaning performance, combined with low energy and water consumption. Reflecting Sears' importance to Whirlpool, the washer-dubbed the Kenmore Elite with Calypso Wash Motion-will be sold initially only in the big retailer's stores. Whirlpool's main innovation is to replace the center agitator in a top-loader with a newly developed wash "plate" at the bottom of the machine. The company maintains that this provides better cleaning and greater usable capacity. The Calypso will sell for $1,099, about double the cost of most high-capacity washers and in line with Maytag's Neptune. Room for margin growth One Whirlpool bull points out that, "unlike the case with a lot of companies, you can argue that Whirlpool has room to expand its [profit] margins." Whirlpool's lower-margin overseas operations hold overall after-tax margins down to 4%, below Maytag's 7%. If Whirlpool could ever duplicate Maytag's margins, it would earn $10 a share. That may be a stretch, but if Whirlpool is able to boost its overseas profitability, it could increase its margins by one or two percentage points. A weaker dollar, obviously, would help in that regard. 

 But perhaps most important, unlike a lot of companies with depressed stocks, Whirlpool doesn't have any major obvious problems like the tobacco companies do. The way the stock is trading, however, it seems to be discounting a recession scenario. But if the market accords the shares a distinctly Old Economy multiple of 10 on the recently pared-backed 2001 earnings forecast of $7 a share, they would trade at better than half again the current level. And that wouldn't take any Washday Miracle.

The company's enterprise value (equity plus debt) is only four times pre-tax cash flow-cheap even by the depressed standards of much of industrial America. 

 In contrast, Maytag, which has seen its stock fall 40% in the past year to 37, still trades at a premium to Whirlpool, fetching nearly 10 times profits and six times cash flow. 

 Whirlpool's chief executive, David Whitwam, also is frustrated by the low stock price. "Our price/earnings multiple doesn't seem rational given the performance of the business and the outlook," he tells Barron's. He notes that Whirlpool's P/E historically has been slightly lower than that of the S&P 500, but now the stock trades at only about one-quarter of the S&P 500's multiple. 

 Whirlpool has stepped up its share-repurchase program this year, buying nearly four million shares in the first half of the year to cut its shares outstanding to 72 million. Sizable further repurchases are expected this year. "If they continue to generate these kind of profits and aggressively repurchase stock, the current share price is unsustainably low," says Harold Levy, a principal at Iridian Asset Management in Westport, Connecticut, a Whirlpool holder. 

 Whitwam points out that Whirlpool has generated 20% growth in quarterly operating profits for 15 straight quarters, an impressive performance. Second-quarter earnings of $1.66 a share were up 28% from the year-earlier level. Some might quibble with Whirlpool's definition of core profits. They include pension gains and exclude such actions as a $60 million after-tax charge for the Brazilian currency devaluation in early 1999. Nevertheless, Whirlpool's profits still have doubled since 1997. 

 Wall Street clearly is skeptical of Whirlpool's ability to maintain anything close to its rapid growth of recent years. The company targets an ambitious 15%20% annual profit gain. But the stock market appears to be anticipating an outright drop in net next year. 

 The company, whose main domestic brands are Whirlpool and the upscale KitchenAid, embarked on an expensive strategy a decade ago to transform itself from a primarily U.S. appliance maker to a global player. It now gets over 40% of its sales outside North America. It has a big presence in Europe, where Whirlpool is the No. 1 brand, and in South America, where it's dominant in the biggest market, Brazil. 

 Whirlpool's strategy of building and buying manufacturing facilities throughout the world and developing the only true global appliance brand has differed from GE's aim of "owning markets and not factories" via alliances with overseas partners. 

 The jury is still out on which approach is better. Whirlpool points to the enormous opportunity abroad, where appliance demand is rising at several times the projected 2%-3% annual pace in the States. Whirlpool has successfully developed common appliance platforms worldwide in an effort to bring new products to market quickly and to streamline production. But a global presence can have its pitfalls. Whirlpool got whacked last year by Brazil's currency crisis and has been exposed to weakening economies in Asia. 

 Whirlpool's biggest critic on Wall Street, Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Prudential Securities, says the company "has too many assets tied up in overseas markets where there are no barriers to entry." Heymann says Whirlpool faces dozens of competitors in Europe and Asia that don't need to hit its profit hurdles and can undercut it on price, resulting in lower margins outside the U.S. The company says its domestic appliance operating margin of 12% is comparable with those of GE and Maytag. 

 Hoover avers that Whirlpool's "global strategy" to build a "Coke-like" appliance brand is just starting to pay off and puts the company in a better position than Maytag, which has minimal international sales. 

 Whirlpool actually has bested mighty General Electric in appliances in recent years with GE Appliance's profits last year below those in 1995. But Whirlpool's detractors worry that a revitalized GE, which plans to introduce a bevy of new products next year, including a still-secret line of energy-efficient refrigerators, will pose a bigger challenge to Whirlpool in the coming years. 

 One of the other main knocks against Whirlpool is that it's too dependent on <<Sears Roebuck>> but has virtually no exposure to the emerging dynamo in appliance sales, <<Home Depot>>. Whirlpool is Sears' biggest supplier, producing many of the Kenmore label products, and gets about 20% of its revenues from Sears. Despite being derided as a retail dinosaur, Sears still accounts for over one in three appliances sold in the U.S. and actually has increased its market share in the past year to 38%. Beyond Sears, Whirlpool also is the biggest supplier to the next two biggest appliance sellers in the U.S.<<Lowe's>> and <<Best Buy>>. 

 Whirlpool, like its rivals, has been eagerly developing high-margin, high-end appliances that appeal to affluent Americans who see their kitchens as status symbols and are willing to plunk down $5,000 for a Sub-Zero refrigerator or Viking range. Maytag probably has had the most success in this area with its European-style Neptune washers and its Jenn-Air ranges. 

 But Whirlpool also has been in the game. The company, for instance, plans to introduce a new high-end washer next month that it believes will offer the best cleaning performance, combined with low energy and water consumption. Reflecting Sears' importance to Whirlpool, the washer-dubbed the Kenmore Elite with Calypso Wash Motion-will be sold initially only in the big retailer's stores. Whirlpool's main innovation is to replace the center agitator in a top-loader with a newly developed wash "plate" at the bottom of the machine. The company maintains that this provides better cleaning and greater usable capacity. The Calypso will sell for $1,099, about double the cost of most high-capacity washers and in line with Maytag's Neptune. Room for margin growth One Whirlpool bull points out that, "unlike the case with a lot of companies, you can argue that Whirlpool has room to expand its [profit] margins." Whirlpool's lower-margin overseas operations hold overall after-tax margins down to 4%, below Maytag's 7%. If Whirlpool could ever duplicate Maytag's margins, it would earn $10 a share. That may be a stretch, but if Whirlpool is able to boost its overseas profitability, it could increase its margins by one or two percentage points. A weaker dollar, obviously, would help in that regard. 

 But perhaps most important, unlike a lot of companies with depressed stocks, Whirlpool doesn't have any major obvious problems like the tobacco companies do. The way the stock is trading, however, it seems to be discounting a recession scenario. But if the market accords the shares a distinctly Old Economy multiple of 10 on the recently pared-backed 2001 earnings forecast of $7 a share, they would trade at better than half again the current level. And that wouldn't take any Washday Miracle.

 United agrees cancellations will  cut  Q3 revenue-WSJ.

 NEW YORK, Aug 11 (Reuters) - UAL Corp's United Airlines agreed with some estimates that recent flight cancellations could erode revenue by $120 million to $150 million in the third quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 A spokesman for the airline said those figures were "in the ballpark", the Journal said in its electronic edition. 

 Massive labour problems initially prompted the airline to cancel thousands of flights from its May to August schedule and additional flight reductions through until October soon followed as the labour dispute persisted. 

 But the cuts were not enough, forcing United to cancel hundreds of flights on the day of departure. The airline normally schedules about 2,400 flights a day. 

 The Journal said Julius Maldutis of CIBC World Markets lowered his estimate of UAL's third-quarter earnings to $2.70 a fully distributed share on Thursday from $3.25. 

 Maldutis thought United had already lost $140 million in revenue from cancellations in the first six weeks of the quarter, the Journal noted. 

 Maldutis said if the airline's problems persisted and more high-fare business fliers booked away from the carrier, the revenue problem would accelerate and United probably would have to issue a profit warning. 

 Earlier this week, PaineWebber Inc's Sam Buttrick lowered his earnings estimates for United's third and fourth quarters, the newspaper said. He also put third-quarter revenue loss from cancellations at $120 million to $150 million. 

 UAL, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday, reiterated its third-quarter earnings guidance made last month of profit in the range of $2.60 to $3.20 a fully distributed share, the Journal noted. 

 The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, which stood at $3.11 a share on Wednesday, was lowered to $3.03 a share on Thursday. 

 Shares of UAL closed down 1-( at 49-/ on Thursday, off a year high of 79 but up from a low of 45-3/4.

 Economic cooling chills U.S. retail sales

 CHICAGO - U.S. store chains Gap Inc., Kmart Corp. and catalogue retailer Lands' End Inc. all reported a slump in second-quarter earnings yesterday, the latest casualties of a cooling economic climate.  

 "It strikes me that some of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve have slowed consumer spending in the second quarter," said Kevin Silverman, analyst with ABN Amro. "You do have a chance for things to pick up, but right now the outlook is softer than it has been in quite some time."  

 Casual apparel retailer Gap reported a 6% decline in net income for its second quarter and warned that its results for the balance of the year could fall below analysts' expectations. Its shares slid US$4 1/4 to close at US$27 on the New York Stock Exchange after making a fresh 52-week low of US$26 1/8 during the day.  

 Kmart said second-quarter operating earnings fell an expected 83%, while Lands' End reported an unexpected second-quarter loss of US$1.9 million.  

 Shares of Troy, Mich.-based Kmart closed up 1/16 at US$7 1/4 in trade.  

 Shares of Lands' End closed off US$2 1/4 at US$28 3/16.  

 Many U.S. retailers have seen their second-quarter earnings sink below those of a year earlier, as higher interest rates and gasoline prices have cut into consumers' disposable income. Retailers were left with bloated apparel inventories, and many had to drastically reduce prices to clear racks of clothing.  

 San Francisco-based Gap said net income for its second quarter ended July 29, fell to US$183.9 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, compared with US$195.8 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same quarter a year before. Sales in the quarter rose 20% to US$2.95 billion.  

 Wall Street analysts on average had expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents a share, according to First Call. Those estimates were revised down after the company last week gave its second profitwarning for the quarter.  

 Gap also said third-quarter earnings could fall to or below the 35 cents a share earned one year ago -- well short of the 41 cents a share expected by analysts.  

 Kmart said earnings were hurt by soft apparel sales.  

 Kmart lost US$448 million or US93 cents per share -- including a US$740-million charge to cover the costs associated with closing 72 stores and nationwide clearance sales -- compared with a year-earlier net loss of US$92- million or 19 cents per share. Sales rose 2.5% to US$8.998-billion from US$8.780-billion.  

 In July, Kmart forecast its second-quarter earnings would fall below Wall Street's expectations, and also announced a restructuring designed to boost profits. Yesterday, it announced plans to invest about US$2-billion in infrastructure improvements over the next two years.

 Gap Shares Tumble 14% Amid Earnings  Decline

 NEW YORK -- Shares of Gap Inc. fell about 14% on Thursday after the apparel retailer posted a 6% decline in earnings and once again cautioned that sluggish sales and slower traffic at its Old Navy stores could hurt profit for the rest of the year. 

 The San Francisco-based company said net income fell to $183.9 million, or 21 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter, from $195.8 million, or 22 cents, a year ago. Total sales grew 20% to $2.95 billion, but sales at stores open at least a year declined 2%. 

 Wall Street analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 20 cents, according to First Call. Those estimates were revised after last week, when the company gave its second profit warning for the quarter. 

 Most U.S. retailers have run up against difficulties in recent months, as unseasonably cool weather in many areas, higher gasoline prices and a lag in consumer spending dampened sales. Still, Gap's woes have been exacerbated by what analysts said was a misjudgment in its fashion focus on teen consumers and an inventory crunch at Old Navy, which contributes 35% of Gap's sales. 

 Gap shares tumbled $4.50 to close at $27 on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a new 52-week low for the company as weeks of logistical problems, lagging sales and two previous second-quarter profit warnings took their toll. 

 The company said it does not see an immediate turnaround in its problems with Old Navy and, given the volatility in the sector, said third-quarter earnings may fall to or below the 35 cents a share earned one year ago. That's well short of the 41 cents a share analysts expected. 

 The company also warned that fourth-quarter earnings might be "slightly lower" than analysts' consensus estimate of 57 cents. 

 "Clearly we've had a tough and disappointing second quarter," said Chief Executive Millard Drexler. "It's very early to predict the quarter as it's only a week-and-a-half into the new season. But it's difficult to know where exactly we're going." 

 The company admitted it may have sold itself short by skewing its merchandise toward the teenage crowd at the apparent expense of older consumers who may have been driven away from Old Navy stores because of the lack of selection. 

 On Aug. 3, Gap said earnings for its second quarter may fall short of expectations because of weak sales. The warning sent Gap shares tumbling and trimmed about $7 billion from the company's market value. 

 Drexler said the company's second-quarter results were dampened by "heavy promotional activity and a meaningful decline in traffic" at the company's Old Navy stores, as well as logistical problems with merchandise delivery. 

 The company also said Thursday that it increased the number of stores it plans to open during fiscal 2000. It plans on opening 130 to 140 new Gap International stores, up from the 120 to 130 previously planned, as well as 150 to 160 Old Navy stores, up from the 120 to 130 previously planned. 

 Gap operates about 3,300 stores worldwide under such brand names as the Gap, Baby Gap, Gap Kids, Old Navy and Banana Republic. 

 As a result of the additional stores and the expansion of its catalog and Internet operations, the company said it expects capital expenditures will be $1.8 billion, up from its previous $1.6-billion estimate.

 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Gap Inc. on Thursday reported a 6 percent decrease in second-quarter net income and warned that results for the rest of the year could fall below analysts' estimates should the volatility in the U.S. retail market continue. 

 The past several months been difficult for the majority of U.S. retailers. Cooler-than-normal weather, higher gasoline prices and a general lag in consumer spending have all dampened sales, and Gap's woes have been further exacerbated by logistical problems at its Old Navy division. 

 The San Francisco-based retailer said third-quarter earnings could fall to or below the 35 cents a share earned one year ago, well short of the 41 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 What more, Gap said analysts' fourth-quarter consensus estimate of 57 cents a share might be "at risk." 

 News of the warning sent Gap shares tumbling in pre-market trading to 28-1/2, down 2-3/4. Shares of Gap closed at 31-1/4 on Wednesday. The 52-week low is 28. 

 "Second quarter was an extremely tough period for us, as it was for many retailers," President and Chief Executive Millard Drexler said in a statement. 

 "We're dealing with challenges in an uncertain retail environment," Drexler said. "But we feel good about our long-term growth opportunities and the fundamental strength of our brands." 

 Net income for the second quarter, ended July 29, fell to $183.9 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, compared with $195.8 million, or 22 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.

 On Thursday, Gap said sales for the second quarter rose 20 percent to $2.95 million from $2.45 million in the same quarter of the previous year. Sales at stores open at least one year decreased 2 percent versus an 8 percent increase last year. 

 Drexler said the company's results were dampened by "heavy promotional activity and a meaningful decline in traffic" at the company's Old Navy stores, as well as some logistical problems with merchandise delivery. 

 The company had previously said that a series of overlapping inventory deliveries made it difficult for the stores to move merchandise off stores shelves as quickly as they would have liked.

 (updates with closing stock info in paragraphs 1 and 6, adds details in paragraphs 11-13, 26-28) 

 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Shares of Gap Inc. fell about 14 percent on Thursday to close at a new 52-week low after the apparel retailer once again cautioned that sluggish sales and slower traffic at its Old Navy division could lead to lower-than-expected earnings for the rest of the year. 

 The fresh warning came as the San Francisco-based retailer posted a 6 percent decline in second-quarter earnings. While that was not quite as sharp as the average analyst estimate, the company last week had guided quarterly forecasts lower - for a second time. 

 Most U.S. retailers have run up against difficulties in recent months, as unseasonably cool weather in many areas, higher gasoline prices and a lag in consumer spending dampened sales. Still, Gap's woes have been exacerbated by what analysts said was a misjudgment in its fashion focus on teen consumers and an inventory crunch at Old Navy, which contributes 35 percent of Gap's sales. 

 Overall, sales in stores open at least a year slipped 2 percent. The company operates about 3,300 stores worldwide under such brand names as The Gap, Baby Gap, Gap Kids, Old Navy and Banana Republic. 

 "This is disappointing because this news is recurring," Bear Stearns analyst Dana Telsey said in research note, referring to the latest warning. "It appears the merchandise problems of the Old Navy division could last longer than originally anticipated." 

 Shares of Gap were tumbled 4-1/4, or about 13.6 percent, to close at 27 on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a new 52-week low for the company as weeks of logistical problems, lagging sales and two previous second-quarter profit warnings took their toll. 

 Gap said Thursday it does not see an immediate turnaround in its problems with Old Navy and, given the overall volatility in the sector, said third-quarter earnings may fall to or below the 35 cents a share earned one year ago. That is well short of the 41 cents a share expected on average by analysts surveyed by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The San Francisco-based retailer also warned that fourth-quarter earnings per share might be "slightly lower" than analysts' consensus estimate of 57 cents. 

 "Clearly we've had a tough and disappointing second quarter," Millard Drexler, Gap president and chief executive, said Thursday. "It's very early to predict the quarter as it's only a week-and-a-half into the new season. But it's difficult to know where exactly we're going," he said. 

 "We think the current environment is uncertain," said Heidi Kunz, chief financial officer at Gap. "The only thing that's really changed here is that the continuation of negative traffic patterns in August at Old Navy makes us somewhat more cautious." 

 The company admitted it may have sold itself short in the first half of the year by skewing its merchandise too much toward the teenage crowd at the apparent expense of older consumers who may have been driven away from Old Navy stores because of the lack of selection. 

 "The teenage business was wonderful, but we didn't want to build a long term business on that market," Drexler said. 

 Drexler said the company has already begun to roll out its Old Navy Collection merchandise, which with its more refined casual business style is geared toward an older audience. 

 Net income for the second quarter, ended July 29, fell to $183.9 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, from $195.8 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. 

 Wall Street analysts on average had expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents a share, according to First Call. Those estimates were revised after last week, when the company gave its second profit warning for the quarter. 

 Telsey on Thursday lowered her rating on Gap's stock to "attractive" from "buy" and said her third-quarter earnings estimate of 56 cents a share was under review. 

 On Aug. 3, the retailer said earnings for the second quarter may fall short of expectations because of weak sales. The warning sent Gap shares tumbling and trimmed about $7 billion off the company's market value. 

 On Thursday, Gap said sales for the second quarter rose 20 percent to $2.95 billion from $2.45 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Sales at stores open at least one year decreased 2 percent versus an 8 percent increase last year. 

 Drexler said the company's second-quarter results were dampened by "heavy promotional activity and a meaningful decline in traffic" at the company's Old Navy stores, as well as logistical problems with merchandise delivery. 

 The company had previously said that a series of overlapping inventory deliveries made it difficult for distribution centres to process merchandise and move it quickly on to store shelves. The clog should be cleared by September, the company said. 

 "(It) appears that the weakness (at Old Navy) is more than we had expected," Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Marcia Aaron said in a note. 

 Aaron cut her rating on Gap to "market perform" from "buy," and said she is concerned that lackluster results from Old Navy could also plague the second half of the year. 

 "(We) do not believe that Gap fully recognised issues at Old Navy until this Spring," Aaron said. "Leading us to believe that merchandise assortments could be an issue for holidays." 

 "The unfortunate part of this is that (the) Gap brand appears to be gaining ground, but it is not enough to offset the weakness at Old Navy," she said. 

 Aaron also lowered her earnings estimates for Gap to $1.35 from $1.47 for fiscal 2001, and to $1.65 from $1.82 for fiscal 2002. 

 The company also said on Thursday it increased the number of new stores it plans to open during fiscal 2000. It plans on opening 130 to 140 new Gap International stores, up from the 120 to 130 previously planned, as well as 150 to 160 new Old Navy stores, up from the 120 to 130 previously planned. 

 The company said it has already increased its store square footage by 32 percent this year, and although it had originally planned to open the new stores in 2001, opted to do a majority of the new openings before the end of the year. 

 As a result of the additional stores and the expansion of its catalogue and Internet operations the company said it expects capital expenditures will be $1.8 billion up from its previous $1.6 billion estimate.

 The San Francisco-based retailer also warned that fourth-quarter earnings per share might be "slightly lower" than analysts' consensus estimate of 57 cents. 

 "Clearly we've had a tough and disappointing second quarter," Millard Drexler, Gap president and chief executive, said Thursday. "It's very early to predict the quarter as it's only a week-and-a-half into the new season. But it's difficult to know where exactly we're going," he said. 

 "We think the current environment is uncertain," said Heidi Kunz, chief financial officer at Gap. "The only thing that's really changed here is that the continuation of negative traffic patterns in August at Old Navy makes us somewhat more cautious." 

 Net income for the second quarter, ended July 29, fell to $183.9 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, from $195.8 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. 

 Wall Street analysts on average had expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents a share, according to First Call. Those estimates were revised after last week, when the company gave its second profit warning for the quarter. 

 Telsey on Thursday lowered her rating on Gap's stock to "attractive" from "buy" and said her third-quarter earnings estimate of 56 cents a share was under review. 

 On Aug. 3, the retailer said earnings for the second quarter may fall short of expectations because of weak sales. The warning sent Gap shares tumbling and trimmed about $7 billion off the company's market value. 

 On Thursday, Gap said sales for the second quarter rose 20 percent to $2.95 billion from $2.45 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Sales at stores open at least one year decreased 2 percent versus an 8 percent increase last year. 

 Drexler said the company's second-quarter results were dampened by "heavy promotional activity and a meaningful decline in traffic" at the company's Old Navy stores, as well as logistical problems with merchandise delivery. 

 The company had previously said that a series of overlapping inventory deliveries made it difficult for distribution centres to process merchandise and move it quickly on to store shelves. The clog should be cleared by September, the company said. 

 "(It) appears that the weakness (at Old Navy) is more than we had expected," Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Marcia Aaron said in a note. 

 Aaron on Thursday cut her rating on Gap to "market perform" from "buy," and said she is concerned that lackluster results from Old Navy could also plague the second half of the year. 

 "(We) do not believe that Gap fully recognised issues at Old Navy until this Spring," Aaron said. "Leading us to believe that merchandise assortments could be an issue for holidays." 

 "The unfortunate part of this is that (the) Gap brand appears to be gaining ground, but it is not enough to offset the weakness at Old Navy," she said. 

 Aaron also cut earnings estimates for Gap to $1.35 from $1.47 for fiscal 2001, and to $1.65 from $1.82 for fiscal 2002.

 WRAPUP 2-Gap, Kmart, Lands' End profits fall in Q2.

 CHICAGO, Aug 10 (Reuters) - U.S. retail chains Gap Inc. and Kmart Corp. and catalogue seller Lands' End Inc. all reported slides in second-quarter earnings on Thursday, as higher interest rates and a slowing economy prompted consumers to trim purchases of clothing. 

 Bucking the trend was women's clothing chain AnnTaylor Stores Corp., which reported higher earnings for the period. 

 "It strikes me that some of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve have slowed consumer spending in the second quarter," said Kevin Silverman, analyst with ABN AMRO. "You do have a chance for things to pick up, but right now the outlook is softer than it has been in quite some time." 

 Earlier, casual-apparel retailer Gap reported a 6 percent decline in net income for its second quarter and warned that results for the balance of the year could fall below analysts' expectations. Kmart said second-quarter operating earnings fell an expected 83 percent, while Lands' End reported an unexpected second-quarter loss of $1.9 million. 

 Many U.S. retailers have seen their second-quarter earnings sink below those of a year earlier, as higher interest rates and gasoline prices have cut into consumers' disposable income. Retailers were left with bloated apparel inventories, and many had to reduce prices drastically to clear racks of clothing. 

 Kmart, the No. 3 U.S. retailer behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck and Co., said operating earnings in the second quarter ended July 26 fell to $23 million, or 5 cents a share, from $138 million, or 26 cents a year before. 

 The discounter's profits, hurt by soft apparel sales, matched the First Call/Thomson Financial revised analyst consensus for a profit of 5 cents a share. 

 In July, Kmart forecast its second-quarter earnings would fall below Wall Street's expectations, and also announced a restructuring designed to boost profits. At the time, the company said it would take a $740 million charge to cover costs associated with closing 72 stores and nationwide clearance sales. 

 After the charges, Kmart lost $448 million or 93 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $92 million or 19 cents per share. Sales rose 2.5 percent to $8.998 billion from $8.780 billion. 

 Shares of Troy, Michigan-based Kmart closed up 1/16 at 7-1/4 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 San Francisco-based Gap said net income for its second quarter, ended July 29, fell to $183.9 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, compared with $195.8 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same quarter a year before. Sales in the quarter rose 20 percent to $2.95 billion. 

 Wall Street analysts on average had expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents a share, according to First Call. Those estimates were revised down after the company last week gave its second profit warning for the quarter. 

 Earnings at Gap were hurt by overall softness in clothing sales, as well as slower traffic at its Old Navy division. 

 Gap also said third-quarter earnings could fall to or below the 35 cents a share earned one year ago - well short of the 41 cents a share expected by analysts. 

 Gap shares closed off 4-1/4 at 27 on the New York Stock Exchange, after making a fresh 52-week low of 26-1/8 earlier in the day. 

 Lands' End reported an unexpected loss of $1.9 million, or 6 cents a share, for its second quarter ended July 28, compared with a profit of $4.5 million, or 14 cents per share, in the same quarter a year before. Sales were $255.5 million, about flat compared with $254.6 million in last year's second quarter. 

 On average, analysts had expected the retailer, known for its preppy-style casual clothing, to report a profit of 7 cents a share. 

 The Dodgeville, Wis.-based company also said it is unlikely to meet it previous forecast for full-year earnings growth of 20 percent. It warned third-quarter earnings and sales would be down from a year ago, although substantial improvement is seen in the fourth quarter. 

 The forecast from Lands' End marked the third time since June that the company had said it would miss sales and profit expectations. Shares of Lands' End closed off 2-1/4 at 28-3/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Near the opening, the stock notched a fresh 52-week low of 26-5/8. 

 AnnTaylor, known for its upscale women's clothing, said net income in the quarter ended July 29 rose to $13.4 million, or 45 cents a diluted share, from $12.4 million, or 39 cents a diluted share, in the year-earlier quarter. Sales rose 15.2 percent from a year before to $306.3 million. 

 The results, helped by higher sales and strong profit margins, failed to offset overall weakness in the retail sector. Shares of New York-based AnnTaylor closed down 13/16 at 35 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 UPDATE 4-Gap shares tumble on new warnings, profit slide.

 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Shares of Gap Inc. fell about 14 percent on Thursday to close at a new 52-week low after the apparel retailer once again cautioned that sluggish sales and slower traffic at its Old Navy division could lead to lower-than-expected earnings for the rest of the year. 

 The fresh warning came as the San Francisco-based retailer posted a 6 percent decline in second-quarter earnings. While that was not quite as sharp as the average analyst estimate, the company last week had guided quarterly forecasts lower - for a second time. 

 Most U.S. retailers have run up against difficulties in recent months, as unseasonably cool weather in many areas, higher gasoline prices and a lag in consumer spending dampened sales. Still, Gap's woes have been exacerbated by what analysts said was a misjudgment in its fashion focus on teen consumers and an inventory crunch at Old Navy, which contributes 35 percent of Gap's sales. 

 Overall, sales in stores open at least a year slipped 2 percent. The company operates about 3,300 stores worldwide under such brand names as The Gap, Baby Gap, Gap Kids, Old Navy and Banana Republic. 

 "This is disappointing because this news is recurring," Bear Stearns analyst Dana Telsey said in research note, referring to the latest warning. "It appears the merchandise problems of the Old Navy division could last longer than originally anticipated." 

 Shares of Gap were tumbled 4-1/4, or about 13.6 percent, to close at 27 on the New York Stock Exchange, marking a new 52-week low for the company as weeks of logistical problems, lagging sales and two previous second-quarter profit warnings took their toll. 

 Gap said Thursday it does not see an immediate turnaround in its problems with Old Navy and, given the overall volatility in the sector, said third-quarter earnings may fall to or below the 35 cents a share earned one year ago. That is well short of the 41 cents a share expected on average by analysts surveyed by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The San Francisco-based retailer also warned that fourth-quarter earnings per share might be "slightly lower" than analysts' consensus estimate of 57 cents. 

 "Clearly we've had a tough and disappointing second quarter," Millard Drexler, Gap president and chief executive, said Thursday. "It's very early to predict the quarter as it's only a week-and-a-half into the new season. But it's difficult to know where exactly we're going," he said. 

 "We think the current environment is uncertain," said Heidi Kunz, chief financial officer at Gap. "The only thing that's really changed here is that the continuation of negative traffic patterns in August at Old Navy makes us somewhat more cautious." 

 The company admitted it may have sold itself short in the first half of the year by skewing its merchandise too much toward the teenage crowd at the apparent expense of older consumers who may have been driven away from Old Navy stores because of the lack of selection. 

 "The teenage business was wonderful, but we didn't want to build a long term business on that market," Drexler said. 

 Drexler said the company has already begun to roll out its Old Navy Collection merchandise, which with its more refined casual business style is geared toward an older audience. 

 Net income for the second quarter, ended July 29, fell to $183.9 million, or 21 cents a diluted share, from $195.8 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. 

 Wall Street analysts on average had expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents a share, according to First Call. Those estimates were revised after last week, when the company gave its second profit warning for the quarter.

 "The unfortunate part of this is that (the) Gap brand appears to be gaining ground, but it is not enough to offset the weakness at Old Navy," she said. 

 Aaron also lowered her earnings estimates for Gap to $1.35 from $1.47 for fiscal 2001, and to $1.65 from $1.82 for fiscal 2002. 

 The company also said on Thursday it increased the number of new stores it plans to open during fiscal 2000. It plans on opening 130 to 140 new Gap International stores, up from the 120 to 130 previously planned, as well as 150 to 160 new Old Navy stores, up from the 120 to 130 previously planned. 

 The company said it has already increased its store square footage by 32 percent this year, and although it had originally planned to open the new stores in 2001, opted to do a majority of the new openings before the end of the year. 

 As a result of the additional stores and the expansion of its catalogue and Internet operations the company said it expects capital expenditures will be $1.8 billion up from its previous $1.6 billion estimate.

 NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Bear Stearns on Thursday said it had cut its rating on Gap Inc. to attractive from buy after the clothing retailer reported a drop in quarterly earnings and issued a profit warning for the remainder of the year. 

 - said Gap lowered its third-quarter earnings forecast to $0.35 a share, which is below analysts' estimates of $0.40. 

 - said that for the fourth quarter, Gap warned that earnings may miss analysts' consensus estimate of $0.57 a share. Bear Stearns' forecast is $0.56 a share, which is currently under review.

 EARNINGS ROUNDUP Wal-Mart Posts 28% Profit Rise; Sales Grow 20%

 NEW YORK -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, said Wednesday its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 28%, in line with Wall Street's expectations, and revenue grew 20% despite sluggish sales in much of the retail sector in the last few weeks. 

 Wal-Mart shares tumbled 7%, however, after the company reiterated that accounting changes will cut third-quarter earnings to about 31 cents a share, or 2 cents below analysts' expectations. 

 The retailer said the shortfall will be made up in the fourth quarter, but the stock fell $4 to $53.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Wal-Mart said net income grew to $1.6 billion, or 36 cents a share, for the period ended July 31, as sales jumped 20% to $46.11 billion. 

 "The second quarter was a good quarter, but not a great quarter," Chief Executive Lee Scott said. 

 The Bentonville, Ark.-based company said customer traffic slowed toward the end of the second quarter, but it sees the slowing as only a slight pause by consumers. 

 "We do not anticipate a slowdown in consumer spending and remain confident that we will report record sales and earnings for the year," Scott said. 

 "The apparent consumer spending slowdown has affected all retailers, but Wal-Mart has been able to adjust expense levels and adjust inventory levels as good as any other retailer or maybe better," said Bill Dreher, a retail industry analyst with Robertson Stephens. 

 The company said operating profit rose 17% at its Wal-Mart stores segment, including its Supercenters, which also sell groceries. Profit at the Sam's Club "members-only" warehouse segment rose 12% to $240 million. 

 The company also said total inventory for the quarter rose 12.2%, and although that level is still significantly below sales growth, it said it has plans to remove $1 billion from total inventory levels by the end of the current year. 

 At a Glance 

 Other earnings, excluding one-time gains or charges unless noted, include: 

 * Federated Department Stores Inc. said its fiscal second-quarter profit fell 54% to $63 million, or 30 cents a share, hurt by late credit card payments at the Fingerhut catalog business acquired by the retailer last year. Sales at the owner of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and other chains rose 1.5% to $4.07 billion. Federated said last month that credit card delinquencies among Fingerhut customers, who tend to have lower incomes than the company's typical department-store shopper, were rising. With that warning, analysts lowered their earnings estimates from 65 cents to 26 cents. Federated said that excluding the incremental Fingerhut bad-debt problem, earnings would have been 74 cents. 

 * MetLife Inc., the No. 1 U.S. life insurer by assets, said its second-quarter earnings rose 18% to $374 million, or 48 cents a share, as cost cutting and strong life insurance sales offset losses in auto and home insurance. The New York life insurer, which converted to a stock company in April, said revenue jumped 30% to $8.2 billion. The results were in line with analyst estimates, according to a First Call/Thomson Financial poll. Strong sales of life insurance helped to offset weakness in home and auto insurance businesses caused in part by storm losses. 

 * Payless ShoeSource Inc. said its fiscal second-quarter profit fell 4.8% to $48.8 million, or $2.16 cents a share, as the shoe retailer paid higher interest on debt related to its most recent repurchase of shares. The earnings beat analyst expectations by a penny. Sales rose 6.4% to $816.9 million, while sales at stores open a year or more gained 2.6%. 

 * Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. said profit from operations fell 15% to $24 million, or 25 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, as store openings and the acquisition of its European licensing business increased costs. The maker of Ralph Lauren, Chaps and Polo Sport clothing, said revenue rose 12% to $487.4 million. The earnings were a penny higher than analysts expected.

 Belgian IPOs scarcer, harder to place - analysts.

 BRUSSELS, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Young, growth and new economy firms will find it harder to make a successful debut on the Brussels bourse due to investor caution and the higher profile of listings on other Euronext bourses, analysts said on Monday. 

 So far this year, only seven companies have braved a Brussels flotation compared with 24 listings for the whole of 1999. Four of this year's newly-listed firms closed lower than their issue price on Friday. 

 With the exception of retailer Arthur , the other underperforming companies Arinso , Best of Internet , IPTE specialise in software and Internet services and technical engineering. 

 "They came into the market when there was still a demand for this type of company," Vincent Van Dessel, director of markets at the Brussels exchange, said. 

 "With the U.S. Nasdaq cooling down since March, these companies are suffering." 

 PROFIT WARNINGS 

 Individual profit warnings were also to blame for investors losing confidence in the sector and affecting sentiment in the wider market, analysts said. 

 "The introduction of Arinso followed by a profit warning just three months later disappointed investors and weighed on sentiment of all companies introduced recently and even last year," said analyst Murielle David at BRG & Co. 

 In June, the software consulting firm said its 2000 turnover and pre-tax profits would be lower than forecast due to difficult market conditions in the United States. Last month, IT services group Bureau Van Dijk cut its 2000 sales forecast, also citing sector wide difficulties. 

 In the face of dwindling hype in technology stocks and greater investor demand for solid corporate results, Van Dessel said IPOs were becoming more difficult to place. 

 "The euphoria is over. The results will prevail," he told Reuters. 

 Another Brussels-based trader agreed, saying the overall market needed a boost before investors became interested in IPOs again: "People only subscribe to IPOs when the market goes up." 

 The blue chip Bel-20 index, which fell to a two-year low of 2,532.24 points in March, has yet to match its all-time high of 3,681.92 points reached in January 1999. 

 "Investors are absolutely not hungry for (small) IPOs. They're hungry for big deals like Interbrew , or Belgacom , if it were to list," he said. 

 With the creation of Euronext, formed from a merger of the Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris bourses, Belgian companies will find competition to win a place on the index even tougher, Luc Van der Elst, head of equity research at Fortis said. 

 "Euronext means easier access to foreign companies. It's harder for new companies to profile themselves against other potential candidates (for investment)," he said.

 CELEBRITY CRUISES: RCL UNIT SAYS SHIP MAY NEED VIBRATION WORK: Royal Caribbean's (RCL) Celebrity Cruises' newest ship, Millennium --which entered service in June -- is undergoing a performance evaluation because of a vibration problem which may force it into dry dock this fall. 

 Millennium, which features gas turbine engines and unusually low vibration and noise levels, has shown signs that, given certain sea conditions, a vibration could be felt in certain areas. 

 The vibration has not been a problem during the ship's current European sailings, but it is possible that calmer seas -- those prevalent during its Caribbean sailings -- could make the vibrations more common, the company said. 

 Celebrity is working with ship builder Chantiers de l'Atlantique in France to determine whether the ship needs to enter dry dock. If dry-docking is necessary, it will not happen until after the ship arrives in New York on Nov. 15. 

 MORTGAGE.COM: LOSSES WIDEN AMID SHIFT TO B2B PLATFORM: Mortgage.com (MDCM) reported higher losses and lower revenue in the second quarter, attributing the results to its shift from a consumer-oriented company to a business-to-business provider. 

 The Sunrise online mortgage lender said its losses rose to $11.1 million from $8.6 million in the second quarter of 1999. But the losses, and Mortgage.com's revenue, were an improvement from the first quarter of 2000. 

 The company said it has reduced its staff by 21.6 percent in the first six months of the year. It also said that 67 percent of its loan applications in June came over the Internet, compared to 34 percent in January. 

 At the end of the quarter, the company said it had $14.7 million in cash. 

 FRESH DEL MONTE: OVERSUPPLIES, FUEL PRICES TRIM PROFITS: Higher fuel prices and transportation costs, the global oversupply of fruit and the continued weak euro all contributed to weak second quarter results at Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP), the Coral Gables producer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables. Despite the difficulties facing the company, which are expected to continue the rest of the year, net sales jumped 9 percent in the second quarter compared to the same period last year but net income fell by some 50 percent because of the market conditions. 

 Pro forma results for second quarter 1999 excluded Hurricane Mitch expenses, net of insurance recoveries of 9 cents per share. 

 REPUBLIC SERVICES: WILL PICK UP GARBAGE IN TORONTO: Republic Services (RSG) said Thursday it has won a contract worth up to $400 million to provide garbage-collection service to the city of Toronto. 

 The Fort Lauderdale company said the five-year contract period will begin Jan. 1 and may be extended for up to 22 years. Wilson Logistics of Toronto will provide trucks. 

 The companies will haul about 330,000 tons of solid waste a year across the border to a Republic-owned landfill in Michigan. 

 CLAIRE'S STORES: SHARES JUMP DESPITE PROFIT WARNING: Despite a warning that second quarter earnings will come in lower than expected, Claire's Stores saw its stock increase by almost 11 percent on Thursday. 

 The stock closed at $19.06, up $1.88. 

 That jump came despite an announcement by the Pembroke Pines teen apparel and accessories retailer that its second-quarter earnings would be 34 cents per share, down about two cents from First Call analysts estimates. 

 Analysts didn't appear rattled because they believe the company is in a good position to rebound with a strong second half. 

 WACKENHUT CORRECTIONS: PROFITS DIP DESPITE STRONG REVENUE GAIN: A big increase in second-quarter revenue wasn't enough to prevent an 11 percent drop in net income at Wackenhut Corrections Corp. (WHC), the operator of private prisons. 

 The Palm Beach Gardens company didn't cite specific reasons for the profit decline Thursday, but it conceded earlier that problems in some of its prisons in Louisiana, Texas and New Mexico would stifle earnings growth in 2000. 

 During the second quarter, the company ended its juvenile detention operation in Jena, La., over allegations of inmate abuse. In Texas, two former guards at a state jail formerly run by Wackenhut were charged with sexual misconduct. Wackenhut is not defending the ex-jailers, now numbering 14 in the case. 

 Wackenhut instituted a number of management controls during the quarter to prevent its prison problems from recurring. Separately, the company said Thursday that its joint venture in South Africa has won a contract to build and operate a $44.6 million maximum-security prison in the country's Northern Province, subject to financing. The contract calls for Wackenhut to run the 3,024-bed prison for 25 years.

 U.S. stocks pare some losses in early morning.

 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared losses in early morning trading on Thursday after opening sharply lower on a new batch of profit warnings from prominent companies in both the technology and retail sectors. 

 The bearish news came as investors were already wary of making big commitments a day ahead of the release of July jobs data, which is likely to influence the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. 

 "You got a horrible closing on the Nasdaq yesterday in which all the gains were surrendered in the final hours," said Arnold Berman, technology strategist at Wit SoundView. "You have tremendous nail-biting over tomorrow's employment numbers. The overnight developments in technology were generally bad." 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC) lost 85.64 points, or 2.34 percent, to 3,572.82. 

 One big loser was chip assembly equipment maker Kulicke & Soffa Industries Inc., which fell 8 to 14 after saying it is delaying some order shipments and that the deferrals "may impact financial performance" for the current quarter and the first quarter of 2001 ending Dec. 31, 2000. 

 Although it is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola Inc.'s decline was weighing on the technology sector. The wireless equipment maker told analysts its handset profitability would not be as strong as expected, London traders said. 

 The stock fell 2-9/16 to 38-5/16. 

 "Motorola is talking down prices and profits," said one dealer at a leading investment bank. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) dropped 9.52 points, or 0.09 percent, to 10,678.01 while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) was down 6.77 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,431.93. 

 The Dow was pressured by its technology components with chipmaker Intel Corp. off 2 at 61-1/4. Analysts said chipmakers in general were pressured by the earnings warnings from both rivals and the wireless sector, which uses chips in wireless products. 

 Shares of Gap Inc., which is not a Dow component, tumbled 7-15/16 to 30 after the retailer said second-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates, marking its second profit warning in one month. 

 Countering some of the pressure in the 30-stock index was Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, which rose 1-14/16 to 55-15/16 after reporting its July sales at stores open at least a year rose 6.5 percent. 

 A smattering of economic data showed the U.S. economy continues to hum along, perhaps too much for the likes of the inflation-busting Federal Reserve. 

 A weekly jobless report showed the labour market is still extremely tight, which has been a key worry of the Federal Reserve. Initial jobless claims inched up to 276,000 in the week ended July 29 from a revised 274,000 in the prior week while economists had forecast a jump to 286,000. 

 June factory orders rose a higher-than-expected 5.5 percent compared with the 4.7 percent rise forecast. 

 The July National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) non-manufacturing index, which measures activity outside the manufacturing sector, came in at 55.5. Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. 

 But analysts said Wall Street remained more concerned about Friday's key labour report, which should indicate whether the super-tight labour market has loosened enough to avoid inflation. That report covers the full month of July. 

 Wall Street has received conflicting signals from recent economic reports with some corroborating a view that the U.S. economy is indeed slowing while others have supported the opposite scenario.

 LONDON, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower in thin European trade on Thursday, with a mixed opening expected on Wall Street and investors awaiting Friday's jobs figures. 

 September futures on the S&P 500 index were virtually unchanged on fair value at 1,447.60 by 1050 GMT, suggesting a flat-to-lower opening for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

 Nasdaq Composite futures were down 46 points on fair value at 3,472. "Generally volumes are kind of light, things are unchanged to a touch lower," said one dealer. 

 Among the issues in focus was fashion retailer The Gap , which reported a decline in July sales and issued a profit warning after the closing bell. 

 Dealers said the stock was quoted at $32-1/2, down about five dollars from the U.S. close, and was offered at $33 on Instinet. 

 Follow-through sales from Wednesday's weakness hit data networking giant Cisco Systems Inc , which was down 50 cents at $60-7/16. On the upside, dealers reported interest in biotechnology firm Chiron Inc after it reported better than expected second quarter profits. Chiron was up $5-3/8 from its U.S. close of $44-3/4. 

 Dealers said there was no price reaction so far to a legal warning to Microsoft Corp from the European Union for allegedly using its market power to gain an edge in the server software market. 

 With little expected on the earnings front on Thursday, dealers said attention was fixed on Friday's payroll numbers. 

 "Basically everyone is looking at the non-farm payrolls on Friday. Today we expect some profit-taking in the Dow, which is up 170 points over the past couple of days and further pressure on the Nasdaq," said one dealer.

 U.S. technology stocks stage late-day rebound.

 NEW YORK, Aug 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, led by a blazing late-day rally in technology stocks but Wall Street remained on edge ahead of a key economic report many believe will shed light on the direction of interest rates. 

 The Nasdaq market took a stomach-churning ride, charging sharply higher in the last two hours of trading after a dramatic decline at the start of the session. 

 "It's a very choppy market with a lot of rotation, and I think that that is going to continue until a trend emerges," said Peter Gottlieb, vice president and portfolio manager at First Albany Asset Management. 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled some 137 points in the initial minutes of Thursday's session, after a slew of negative corporate news from the sector. 

 But the high-tech market snapped back swiftly as bargain-hunting investors scooped up selected technology names. 

 The Nasdaq finished up 101.42 points, or 2.77 percent, at 3,759.88, according to the latest available data. Year to date, the Nasdaq was off 7.60 percent. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, gained 19.05 points, or 0.18 percent, to 10,706.58, lifted mainly by strength in its financial services components. J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. rose 3 to 135. 

 For the year, the Dow was off 6.88 percent. 

 Analysts said growing optimism that Friday's jobs numbers could indicate the era of rising interest rates was nearing an end, was bolstering the banking sector. The Fed has hiked interest rates six times since June, 1999. 

 The Dow's technology components also offered support late in the session. International Business Machines Corp. climbed 1-3/8 to 116-1/16, while semiconductor giant Intel Corp. rose 1-13/16 to 65-1/16. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500, a broader measure of the market, rose 13.86 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,452.56. 

 Early in the session, Nasdaq stocks spun lower after bad news from a computer chip assembly equipment maker stung the semiconductor sector. 

 Kulicke & Soffa Industries Inc. shares tumbled when it said issues relating to order shipments "may impact financial performance" for the current quarter and the first quarter of 2001. Its stock ended down 5-1/2 at 16-5/8. 

 High-tech heavyweight Motorola Inc., although not a Nasdaq component, led the market lower as its stock fell on speculation that the company has changed its outlook for handset shipments. A company spokesman said Motorola hadn't altered its guidance. 

 Motorola finished the session down 3/4 at 36-1/16. 

 But Nasdaq stocks quickly staged a rebound. 

 "There are a whole lot of people out there who want to use this sell-off as an opportunity to pick up these high-flyers on the cheap," said Charles Payne, head analyst at Wall Street Strategies. 

 The Philadephia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index finished the session off 0.38 percent at 950.59, well above its session low of 880. 

 Cisco Systems was the day's most heavily traded stock, climbing 3-7/16 to 64-3/8. 

 In other news, The Gap Inc. tumbled 7-7/8 to 30-1/16 after the retailer said second-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' estimates, marking its second profit warning in one month. 

 A smattering of economic data showed the U.S. economy continues to hum along, perhaps too much for the likes of the inflation-busting Federal Reserve, but analysts were more focused on Friday's July employment figures. 

 "Tomorrow is probably one of the more important economic release days," said John Davidson, chief investment officer at Orbitex Management. "My guess is that as the market started moving up today, people do not want to be short going into those numbers."

 CHICAGO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures opened sharply weaker Thursday but cut losses as the session progressed, coming under pressure from weakness in the technology sector spurred by company-specific news. 

 Standard & Poor's 500 index futures slipped to a 1,433.00 session low soon after the open, approaching support at 1,432.00, Friday's close. The contract's two-month low is 1,424.00, also from Friday. 

 Nearby Nasdaq 100 index futures opened down the 92-point limit, then fell further to a 3,370.00 session low, its lowest level in more than two months. 

 Both contracts pulled away from session lows but remained in negative territory. 

 Late Wednesday chip assembly maker Kulicke & Soffa Industries Inc. said delays in some order shipments "may impact financial performance," and the news weighed on the stock into pit trade Thursday. 

 The Gap Inc. also issued a profit warning Wednesday, dragging down its stock. 

 The market digested the warnings and used them as an excuse to take contracts lower, said David Eberhart, strategist at Optima Investment Research. 

 "It's enough for people to grasp ahold of and take the market lower," he said. 

 In addition, Motorola Inc. , the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker, told analysts that handset profitability would not be as strong as expected, London traders said. 

 The day's weakness emanated from the tech sector, said Chris Dickerson, analyst at Global Market Strategies, but he added that there was no one standout event that took the market lower. 

 Market participants are both concerned and confused, Dickerson said. They are concerned that slowing growth in the economy will hurt earnings, and they are confused in part over whether the Federal Reserve will continue its spate of credit tightening. 

 "The market will indeed continue to work its way lower because of earnings," he said. 

 The session's weakness came a day before the week's key data release, Friday's July jobs report. After Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress in his semi-annual address that the Fed would be closely watching upcoming data releases, the market was anxious ahead of Friday's data. 

 "You don't want to jump out of what could be a freight train," Dickerson said. 

 Fair value of September S&Ps was near a 9.3 point premium. Index arbitrage buy programmes were likely triggered near 11.8 points over cash or more with sell programmes near 7.5 points over or less. September Dow Jones industrial average fair value was near a 53.0 point premium. 

 At 9:37 a.m. CDT (1437 GMT), September S&Ps were 9.00 points lower at 1,443.00, Nasdaq 100s were off 67.00 at 3,440.00, Dow futures fell 25 to 10,740, Russell 2000s were down 8.00 at 495.50, Midcap 400s were off 5.10 at 494.00 and Nikkeis fell 600.0 to 15,600.0

 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The Gap Inc. stock's price dropped sharply in after-hours trade on Wednesday, after the clothing retailer reported a decline in July same-store sales and warned second-quarter profits will be below estimates. 

 On the Instinet electronic trading system, the Gap was last set at 32-1/2, down from its close at 37-15/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. In regular NYSE trading, Gap rose 15/16. 

 On Island, Gap was last executed at 37.6250 on that order-matching system. 

 After the regular session, Gap said its fiscal second-quarter earnings per share will be 2 to 3 cents below the 23 cents per share that is the consensus of analysts' estimates. 

 The Gap, whose clothing long has been popular with teenagers, college students and devotees of Casual Friday office wear, also said its same-store sales fell 1 percent in July from June. 

 Meanwhile, the stock of Onyx Pharmaceuticals rose in the after-market, adding to hefty gains seen since Tuesday, following a positive report about the company's virus-based cancer treatment. 

 Onyx, the most active stock on Island, last traded at 18.0625 on the electronic system, up from its close at 17-1/2. On Nasdaq, Onyx gained 2-9/16 from its close on Tuesday. Onyx was last quoted at 18.00 on the Instinet system. 

 According to an article by researchers published in this week's Nature Medicine journal, a study showed the firm's genetically engineered ONYX-015 virus produced lasting results against tumours in patients with head and neck cancer when combined with standard chemotherapy. 

 In a separate announcement, Richmond, Calif.-based Onyx said Wednesday it entered an agreement with private U.K.-based biotechnology firm EPTTCO Limited to expand the former's anti-cancer virus portfolio. 

 Meanwhile, the stock of Amkor Technology Inc. rose in after-hours trade Wednesday after the company reported improved second-quarter earnings that beat estimates. 

 Amkor, a provider of contract semiconductor packaging and test services, traded at 27.3750 on Island, up from its Nasdaq close at 26. Amkor last fetched 27-3/4 on Island. 

 The company said per-share earnings in the second quarter rose to 33 cents from 13 cents in last year's corresponding period, beating estimates that it would earn 30 cents a share in the latest quarter. 

 Net earnings per share, including the amortization of goodwill and acquired intangibles, rose to 20 cents from 10 cents in last year's second quarter. 

 Shares in video game developer Activision rose after the company said it sees second-quarter and full-year earnings per share at 20 cents and 56 cents, respectively, by far beating estimates of 5 cents and 51 cents a share. 

 Activision, which also reported a smaller-than-expected loss for the first quarter, last traded at 9.4375 on Island - up from its close at 8-7/8 on Nasdaq. ((-Haitham Haddadin, Wall Street Desk, 212-859-1881,

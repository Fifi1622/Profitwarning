 Apple Loses 52% As Stocks Fall Back

 NEW YORK, Sept. 29 -- Stocks fell sharply today, led by a slumping technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer Inc. revived anxiety about corporate earnings. Apple shares plummeted almost 52 percent on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Apple's news that earnings would be substantially lower than expectations because of slower-than-expected sales helped push the markets lower. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92 -- 196.45 lower than a week ago. The drop nearly wiped out the Dow's gain of almost 196 points on Thursday. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50 to 3,672.82, off 130.94 for the week. The Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51, down 12.21 for the week. 

 The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies warned that profits would fall short of expectations. 

 "It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day," said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. "This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak euro." 

 Those issues have kept the market down for most of September. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that warn of disappointing earnings. 

 The market got a brief respite from the anxiety Thursday, but Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid some of those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75. 

 Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell $9.29 to $46.75. Hewlett Packard was off $9.25 at $96.88. Lucent slipped $1.25 to $30.50. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56, furthering a decline that began last week when it warned of weak earnings. 

 "We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market, because the fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.  G. Cowen Securities. "But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple warn, and if you owned those stocks, you got decimated." 

 An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2 to $42. But many other "old-economy" companies appeared less affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement. 

 Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $8.29 to $65 on rumors it might become the next financial services company to be acquired. The company declined to comment. 

 Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up $1.69 at $41.44. 

 Many energy issues also rose. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to $48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at $82.31. 

 Other Indicators 

 *   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.71, to 663.04; the American Stock Exchange index rose 14.51, to 954.31; and the Russell index of 2,000 small stocks fell 2.44, to 521.37. 

 *   Advancing issues balanced declining ones on the NYSE, where consolidated trading volume fell to 1.41 billion shares, from 1.43 billion on Wednesday. On the Nasdaq, decliners slightly outnumbered advancers and volume totaled 1.83 billion, down from 1.91 billion. 

 *   The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $0.63 per $1,000 invested, and its yield fell to 5.80 percent. 

 *   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and fell against the euro. In late New York trading, a dollar bought 108.14 yen, up from 107.63 yen late Wednesday, and a euro bought 88.39 cents, up from 87.91 cents. 

 *   Light, sweet crude oil for November delivery settled at $30.84 a barrel, up 50 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

 *   Gold for current delivery fell to $273.60 a troy ounce, from $275.60 on Wednesday, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Commodity Exchange.

 NEW YORK -- Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by a slumping technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety about corporate earnings. 

 The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies, including Apple and Intel, warned that their profit reports would fall short of expectations. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92, down 196.45 compared to a week ago. Friday's drop nearly wiped out the Dow's nearly 196-point gain of the day before. 

 Broader indicators also fell after rebounding Thursday. 

 The NASDAQ composite index fell 105.50 to 3,672.82, off 130.49 for the week. The Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51, down 12.21 for the week.

 An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2 to $42. But many other old-economy companies appeared less affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement. 

 Procter & Gamble was unchanged at $67, retaining gains made Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart was unchanged at $5.88. 

 Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $8.29 to $65 on rumors it might the latest financial services company to be acquired. The company declined to comment. 

 Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up $1.69 at $41.44. 

 Many energy issues also rose. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to $48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at $82.31. 

 Also Friday, the Commerce Department released a report showing Americans' incomes grew by 0.4 percent last month in addition to a 0.3 percent gain in July. But spending rose faster, by a brisk 0.6 percent in both July and August. 

 Advancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.13 billion shares, compared with the 1.19 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index was off 2.44 at 521.37, up 2.55 from a week ago. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.77 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.51 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.48 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 0.70 percent.

Apple's Plunge Dampens Markets; Dow, Nasdaq fall after stock sinks

A rotten Apple landed with a splat on Wall Street yesterday.

Apple Computer's warning late Thursday that its fourth-quarter profits won't measure up sent the company's shares plunging more than 50 percent -- wiping out $9 billion in market value.

The rest of the market was caught in Apple's downdraft, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 173.14 points to close at 10,650.92.

For its part, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index tumbled 105.50 points, or almost 3 percent, to 3,672.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 points to 1,436.51.

Although Apple is not viewed as a bellwether of tech trends -- Intel's profit warning last week was a far more profound blow -- investors seized on the Cupertino computer maker's misfortune as a handy excuse to unload stocks as the third quarter limped to a close.

"The market's not in a good mood," said Rick Welty of Welty Capital Management in Lafayette. "There have been profit warnings and plenty of them."

No fewer than 60 companies alerted analysts this week that their next earnings reports won't meet expectations.

Caterpillar Inc. became the latest to reach for the Prozac when it announced after the closing bell yesterday that it expects quarterly earnings to be as much as 15 percent below analysts' anticipated 68 cents a share.

"Apple had a major impact," said John Scarborough, a partner with the San Francisco investment firm of Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough. "The market is so skittish, all it takes is one major piece of news to have a real serious effect."

Apple plummeted $27.75 to close yesterday at $25.75 -- a fraction of its 52-week high of $75.19. The company warned that its quarterly profit will be between 30 and 33 cents per share. Analysts had been expecting 45 cents.

UNITED LOSSES EXPECTED

Adding to investors' gloomy sentiment was an announcement from UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, that it foresees third-quarter losses as a result of recent flight delays and cancellations. The company's stock fell $2 to $42.

Meanwhile, Intel Corp. shed $2.88 to close at $41.56 amid reports that it may delay the unveiling of its much-anticipated Pentium 4 microchip. The company issued a statement saying the chip is still scheduled to debut by the end of the year.

"Investors are just a little more sensitive than usual," said Gary Schlossberg, an economist at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco. "There's a lot of uneasiness."

He said market players remain wary of the state of the U.S. economy, although recent indicators clearly suggest a slowdown is under way. Slower growth would almost certainly deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates and could in fact lead to a rate cut.

Schlossberg said investors also were spooked by a sudden uptick yesterday in oil prices. After coming down 20 percent in recent days, crude oil for November delivery rose 50 cents to $30.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

This doesn't bode well for Monday's stock action. Analysts expect the market to lose a bit more ground before investors shake off the blues and begin bargain hunting.

MORE IN STORE?

"September was a lousy month, and October probably won't be much better," Schlossberg said.

Actually, it could be worse. The Nasdaq has lost only 7.4 percent since June 30 and the S&P 500 a mere 1.2 percent. The Dow ended the third quarter in positive territory, climbing 1.9 percent.

No one thinks beleaguered tech stocks are out of the woods. Apple's profit warning sent a shiver through the rest of the computer sector, with Dell Computer falling $2.63 to $30.81 and Hewlett-Packard declining $6.81 to $97.

And the dot-coms? Investors are still fleeing in droves. TheGlobe.com, which once broke records by surging more than 600 percent in its initial public offering, dropped 22 percent to just 78 cents yesterday after it warned of a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.

TheGlobe's shares have come down 93 percent in the past year.

The one bright spot ahead: Stocks usually do well right after presidential elections, as the uncertainty of November's contest is finally laid to rest.

Analysts say that while the market is likely to remain volatile for the next few weeks, it should look firmer by the time Santa is ready to pay a visit.

 UAL Stock Falls 7% on Forecast Earnings: The company expects 3rd-quarter loss, blaming canceled flights, delays and higher costs.

 CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. hit a new patch of rough air Friday and its shares plunged 7% after the owner of United Airlines warned it expected a third-quarter loss from flight cancellations, delays and higher costs for jet fuel and wages. 

 Swamped by thousands of labor- and weather-related flight cancellations this summer, the world's largest airline also said it may post a loss in the fourth quarter. The last time the company lost money was in 1993. 

 UAL shares fell $2 to close at $42 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day, its shares hit $40.25, a new low for the year. 

 The company, which has agreed to acquire US Airways Group Inc. for $4.3 billion, warned in July that it will fall short of analysts' earnings forecasts for the second half of the year. 

 Analysts on average expected United to earn 97 cents a share in its third quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, with estimates ranging from 30 cents to $2. 

 Analysts' consensus estimate for United's fourth quarter was 63 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Estimates ranged from a loss of 20 cents to $2.35. 

 One analyst said he was surprised by United's latest forecast. "I knew that the situation was deteriorating there, but I wasn't expecting a loss," said Ray Neidl, an analyst with ING Barings. 

 Neidl said he believed the cost of the pilots' new labor contract and the cost of winning back customers who were angered by United's problems this summer were greater than expected. 

 But Merrill Lynch airlines analyst Michael Linenberg said in a research note he was not surprised. After downgrading United's rating to "accumulate" from "buy" on Friday, he cut his estimate for the company's third quarter to a loss of 50 cents a share from a profit of 30 cents. 

 He also cut his full-year 2000 earnings estimate to $4.75 a share, from $5.80, and his 2001 estimate to $6.50 from $8. 

 "The third quarter has been a difficult period for United," James Goodwin, UAL chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "The disruptions to our operations throughout the quarter greatly inconvenienced our customers and front-line employees, reducing revenues significantly." 

 Goodwin added, "On the cost side, while we are pleased that we were able to reach a tentative pilot contract, the financial implications of the agreement, coupled with the higher price of jet fuel, will further impact our results." 

 United Airlines agreed on a new labor contract with its pilots union in late August, putting the pilots' wages 10% to 12% above the industry's top pay. 

 The contract came after a summer of flight cancellations and delays due in part to the pilots' refusal to work overtime. 

 United said it may also be affected by other union agreements currently being negotiated. 

 United has been in talks with its mechanics union since January. Earlier this month, the National Mediation Board said it will assign a mediator to the talks. 

 The company's flight attendants said earlier this week that they were demanding an immediate wage increase equivalent to 5% above the pay at current industry leader Delta Air Lines Inc. The two sides are meeting Tuesday. 

 Other airlines shares dipped in sympathy. Shares of AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, fell $1.88 to close at $32.75; Delta closed down $1.81 at $44.38 and U.S. Airways lost $1.44 to close at $30.44, all on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 At a Glance 

 Other earning outlooks: 

 * Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment, said it expects its third-quarter profit to be about 15% below analysts' consensus estimate of 68 cents per share. However, the Peoria, Ill.-based company said its outlook for the full year remains unchanged, with revenue expected to improve slightly over 1999 and profit expected to increase moderately. In 1999, Caterpillar reported sales and revenue of $19.7 billion and profit of $946 million, or $2.63 per share. 

 * Snack food and soft-drink maker PepsiCo Inc. is expected to post an almost 15% gain in third-quarter earnings next week, as its snack brands continue to chip in with solid growth and beverages are boosted by an easy comparison with the prior year. Analysts on average expect the maker of Frito-Lay snacks, Tropicana juices and Pepsi and Mountain Dew soda to report earnings of 39 cents a share for the quarter ended Sept. 2, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. That would be a 14.7% increase from last year's third-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share. 

 * After warning earlier this week that its third-quarter profit would fall short of Wall Street expectations, DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler side said it will not meet a $2-billion cost-cutting target this year. The German-American company warned its Chrysler unit would report a loss of about $531 million for the current quarter, in contrast to a profit of $880 million last year. The head of the Chrysler Group attributed the malaise to rising interest rates and fuel costs, too much costly inventory to offset the launch of new minivans, and fat incentive spending industrywide.

 Investors rekindle love affair with RIM: Shares soar friday: Strong second quarter fuels stock, revenue targets

 The market has fallen madly in love with Research In Motion Ltd. again. The stock soared 19.7% to $149 yesterday on better-than-expected second-quarter results. 

 Revenue for the handheld computer maker totalled US$42.5-million, well above estimates in the mid-US$30-million range. 

 The market's love affair with this stock (RIM/TSE) drove it to a high close of $227 in March. But alas, the love didn't last and the stock fell as low as a close of $35.45 in May. 

 But after the surprising second quarter, Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Ray Sharma pushed his fiscal 2001 revenue estimate to US$188.9-million, from US$180.7-million, and his fiscal 2002 estimate to US$341.1-million, from US$303-million. His 12-month price target is US$108, 45 times his fiscal 2001 revenue estimate. Yesterday's U.S. close (RIMM/NASDAQ) was US$98 9/16.

 BAD WEEK FOR THE SAUDI PRINCE Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal had a tough week, losing a few hundred millions in the profit-warning induced meltdowns of Apple Computer Inc. and Priceline.com Inc. 

 The Prince's Apple (AAPL/NASDAQ) stake was worth US$667-million Thursday, but Apple plunged 51.9% yesterday after its warning. He had invested US$100-million in Priceline (PCLN/NASDAQ), but it fell 45.7% on the week. Lucky for him, his personal fortune is worth US$20-billion and his stake in Citigroup Inc. added more than US$200-million to his net worth this week.

 MERRILL'S TOP 15 Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch & Co., ranked the best "enterprise hardware" technology analyst by Institutional Investor magazine every year since 1989, delivered his top 15 tech picks to the Toronto Society of Financial Analysts' forecast dinner on Thursday. 

 Two Canadian names made the cut -- Nortel Networks Corp. and Celestica Inc. -- but many U.S. tech heavyweights, including Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc., did not. 

 The picks: Nortel and Corning Inc. (photonics stocks); EMC Corp., Network Appliance Inc. and Veritas Software Corp. (storage); Solectron Corp. and Celestica (supply chain); Broadcom Corp. and Novellus Systems Inc. (semiconductors); Aether Inc. and LM Ericsson AB (wireless); and America Online Inc. and Yahoo! Inc!. (Internet).

 SPAM SCAMS The Ontario Securities Commission is warning people to be wary of emails from 'insideportfolios.com,' the Financial Group of Naples, Florida, or an entity calling itself "Sizzle Stock Picks." The OSC cautioned that spamming -- mass transmission of promotional e-mail messages -- is a growing vehicle for stock manipulations. 

 --- 

 A SOFTER BOOM? The bears and bulls have been slugging it out over Nortel all month. At issue is whether Nortel's sales will slow next year due to slower spending by phone companies. The bears have the upper hand so far, knocking 24.9% off the stock this month. But the tussle is not over. 

 Paul Sagawa, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, cut his 2001 revenue estimate for Nortel this week to US$40.9-billion, from US$43-billion and his net income estimate to US94 cents a share, from US96 cents. Consensus was US98 cents.

 RATE WATCHING Central banks will be centre stage next week. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank meet on Thursday. Analysts said Britain and the U.S. were highly unlikely to make any moves. 

 "With the ECB governing council, I think there's a risk they could go and raise rates again ... but I'm expecting them to stay unchanged too," Audrey Childe-Freeman, economist at CIBC World Markets, told Reuters.

 BIG SCREEN DRAMA Imax Corp. (IMX/TSE) cannot get out of the doghouse. The big-screen movie company put itself up for sale in July, but still has not found a taker. Some say the trend of financial distress in the movie theatre business is making it difficult to find a buyer. But the company swung back at those dissing the company, blaming short sellers for stirring up controversy and causing the stock to drop. 

 It didn't help much. The stock is still down 20.8% on the week and 36.7% on the month.

 NO ENERGY WORRIES High energy costs are eating into profits at all kinds of industrial companies. But Cominco Ltd. (CLT/TSE), a zinc miner, is neatly hedged. 

 It has its own power dam in B.C. and it has been selling excess power into the U.S. northwest. Cominco's second-quarter profit included $12.5-million or 15 cents a share from power sales, which was 60% of total profits of 25 cents a share. 

 Greg Barnes, analyst at Canaccord Capital, expects power sales to account for 5 cents to 10 cents a share of third-quarter profits, which forecasts to be 50 cents a share.

 AT HOME WITH TED Ted Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Communications Inc., sure likes At Home Corp., the high-speed Internet services provider. At Home's (ATHM/NASDAQ) stock is down 67.1% this year, but Mr. Rogers ponied up US$14.7-million buying one million At Home A shares last month in addition to the one million he bought in May. Mr. Rogers sits on At Home's board and Roger Communications is a partner with At Home.

 B2B IPO Shares of Mediagrif Interactive Technologies Inc. created a splash when they began trading for the first time on a "when issued" basis on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday. 

 The Montreal-based company, which sold 4.1 million shares at $12 each in its initial public offering, saw its stock (MDF/TSE) jump more than 7%. The stock added another 45 cents yesterday to close out the week at $13.35. Mediagrif develops and operates business-to-business e-commerce marketplaces, considered a high-growth area on the Internet.

 FULL MONTY Jean Monty, the chairman and chief executive of BCE Inc., was on the cover of Barron's last weekend, the star of a glowing article about BCE's bold multi-media strategy. BCE's struggling U.S. stock (BCE/NYSE) rose 5/8 in New York to US$23 13/16 on Monday in reaction to the article, but analysts and the media jumped on Mr. Monty for the "desperate" suggestion that BCE stock should be worth US$40. 

 In fact, as Mr. Monty was at pains to tell financial analysts in Toronto Thursday evening, he had merely pegged the total net asset value of BCE's various businesses at US$40 a share, and acknowledged the share price probably deserves to trade at some discount to that amount. 

 Nowhere in the Barron's piece did he actually say the shares should be worth US$40.

 WRAPUP 1-Asia cheers Wall Street, passes on Apple.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Major Asian stock markets marched upward on Friday, focusing on a U.S. stock rally and largely shrugging off a surprise earnings warning from computer giant Apple Inc issued after the U.S. market closed. 

 But the latest in a slew of high-profile warnings is expected to take a bit out of European and U.S. technology stocks. Analysts said while an Apple warning was not in the same league as that from Intel Corp last week, the negative news might portend more trouble in the computer hardware sector. 

 "The bombshell wouldn't be as great but...I would expect a weak (U.S.) opening anyway and a lot of soul-searching among the analysts as to the sustainability of the end product producers," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. 

 In foreign exchange markets, the euro sulked in thin, edgy trade after Denmark's rejection on Thursday, but the spectre of possible central bank buying of euros helped forestall a sharp drop. 

 At 0616 GMT the euro was holding its breath at $0.8804 in thin trade, down from highs around $0.8865 on Thursday, but above New York's $0.8772 trough touched just after the final Danish referendum result showed the "no" camp winning with a surprisingly comfortable margin of 53.1 to 46.9 percent. 

 Despite Apple, Tokyo shares were resilient, lifted by buying on hopes fund managers would select stocks to dress up their portfolios before closing their books on Friday, the last trading day for the first half of the financial year. 

 The Nikkei 225 finished 0.77 percent higher at 15,747.26. 

 "So far, the uplifting impact of U.S. shares has had a stronger impact than the Apple announcement. Additional help is coming from window dressing-related buying ahead of the half-year book closing," said Masahiro Fukuda, senior portfolio manager at DLIBJ Asset Management. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 1.84 percent to close at 10,824.06 on Thursday, while the Nasdaq leapt 3.34 percent to finish at 3,778.32. 

 But Apple's fourth quarter profit warning slashed almost half the value off its stock in after-hours trade and dragged down other computer makers Gateway Inc and Dell Computer Corp. 

 The warning appeared to catch many analysts by surprise and came after U.S. shares put up a robust performance in regular trading hours as consumer products behemoth Procter & Gamble reassured investors on its promised financial performance. 

 APPLE FACTOR IN TAIWAN 

 A sell-off in semiconductor shares by foreign funds slammed Taipei's stock market. Apple's revelation prompted institutional investors to take a cautious position on computer and electronics components makers who mostly export to U.S. firms. 

 Acer Inc, Taiwan's largest personal computer maker, closed T$1.10 off at T$34.50. The benchmark TAIEX ended off 2.02 percent at 6,432.36. 

 Hong Kong shares rallied as investors latched onto Wall Street's strength while ignoring the Apple factor. 

 Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) hogged the limelight. The telecoms stock was up 0.56 percent at HK$8.95 after the company announced a smaller-than-expected HK$35 million interim loss. 

 The Hang Seng Index was up 1.98 percent to 15,720.85 by 0635 GMT. 

 Korean telecoms stocks took heart from U.S. share gains, buoyed by a bullish SK Telecom. The KOSPI finished 1.22 percent higher at 613.22. 

 Australian shares posted their fifth successive gain by the close, although some analysts warned of a volatile start to next week in the aftermath of Apple. The S&P/ASX 200 closed 0.25 percent higher at 3,298.8. 

 In Singapore, the broader market firmed but technology stocks were hit by the Apple news, particularly NatSteel Electronics, a major manufacturer for Apple. The Straits Times Index was up 0.89 percent at 1,982.43 by 0636 GMT.

 Apple  profit warning  sends PC stocks lower.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Apple Computer Inc.'s share price was chopped in half on Friday morning after the computer maker warned that its fourth-quarter profits would be sharply lower, and dragged down other personal computer stocks. 

 Apple's warning that fourth-quarter results would be as much as 33 percent below Wall Street forecasts shook up investors in computer stocks who were already jittery after Intel Corp. said last week it would post a revenue shortfall. 

 Wiping out 13 months of gains, Apple dropped $27 to $26-9/16 in heavy trade on Nasdaq. The Cupertino, Calif., company was off 64 percent from its record closing high in March. Apple was by far the most active issue on Nasdaq and was among the biggest losers in percentage terms. 

 Apple's yellow flag Thursday was the latest in a string of such warnings from big U.S. companies. It was one of the few negative surprises since Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs returned in 1997 to head the company he co-founded. 

 "I think that at this stage ... if you disappoint (investors), the market is very unforgiving," said Peter Gottlieb, a portfolio manager at First Albany Asset Management in Chicago. 

 Among other personal computer makers, Dell Computer Corp. slipped 2-11/16 to $30-3/4; Gateway Inc. fell $10.30 to $45.60; and Compaq Computer Corp. dropped $3.55 to $27.12. 

 The American Stock Exchange's computer hardware index slid 13.12 percent. The gauge has fallen 27 percent this month from a record high. 

 The declines in Apple and other PC makers helped send U.S. market indexes lower. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 107 points, or 1 percent, at 10,719. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 66 points, or 1.74 percent, at 3,712. 

 Among the computer shares in the Dow index, Hewlett-Packard Co. dropped $8-7/8 to $98. International Business Machines Corp. was off $6-1/4 at $111-11/16. 

 Apple blamed the expected profit decline on a sales slowdown that hit all geographical regions, its key education product market, and its centrepiece product, the new Power Mac G4 Cube. 

 Apple said it expected to report fourth-quarter earnings, excluding investment gains, between 30 and 33 cents per diluted share. Most industry analysts had forecast a profit of 45 cents a share. 

 Apple said it expected revenues between $1.85 billion and $1.9 billion. The company said it would trim growth targets for its next fiscal quarter and year. 

 Fund managers said Apple's warning pointed out the dangers of overoptimism in the technology sector. The area has been a key driver behind a record expansion of the U.S. economy and markets. 

 "There were some pretty aggressive forecasts out there for the tech sector," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners. 

 Rick Meckler, senior managing director at Liberty View Capital in Jersey City, N.J., said Apple's situation underscored a persistent weak demand for personal computers. 

 He added, "You don't want to be losing sales in a market that is losing sales in general, and that is Apple's problem."

 U.S. stocks soured by one bad Apple.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended the third quarter on a sour note on Friday, as a profit warning from computer maker Apple Computer shattered investors' hopes of an end to September's barrage of negative earnings forecasts. 

 "Just when we thought we were done with negative pre-announcements, the Apple surprise came," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., referring to the recent series of company warnings. "It literally took the legs out from under the market, both physically and psychologically." 

 The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index ended down 105.50 points, or 2.79 percent, at 3,672.82, near its low for the day, based on the latest available figures. 

 For the year, the Nasdaq composite is down 9.74 percent. For the week, the index is off about 3.4 percent. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 172.33 points, or 1.59 percent, to close at 10,650.92, reflecting the downslide of its technology components. 

 For the year, the Dow is off 7.4 percent. Since the close last Friday, the blue-chip index has fallen 1.81 percent. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index finished Friday down 21.78 points, or 1.49 percent, at 1,436.51. The S&P 500 so far this year is off 2.23 percent. In the last week, the index fell just 0.84 of a percent. 

 The stock of Apple Computer Inc., Nasdaq's most active issue, lost nearly 52 percent of its value, falling $27-3/4 to close at $25-3/4, lopping about $10 billion off the company's market capitalisation. 

 Calif.-based Apple's warning late Thursday, after the close of regular trading, that its earnings would miss estimates by as much as 33 percent due to slower-than-expected sales this month also sparked a broad sell-off in other computer-related issues. 

 It heightened concern among investors that the entire industry is facing slower growth. Their confidence was already shaken following a bombshell warning of weaker-than-expected sales late last week by leading computer chip maker Intel Corp. 

 "Having two of those tech-related, demand-related issues has got some major concern coming into the day," Jefferies' Hogan said, referring to the Apple and Intel warnings. 

 The Apple surprise hit newswires after the close of trading on Thursday. The computer maker, known for its stylish PCs trimmed in translucent colours, became the latest in a series of high-profile companies, including photography powerhouse Eastman Kodak this week, to tell investors that its financial results would disappoint. 

 The announcement quickly dispelled the bullish sentiment that emerged on Thursday when stocks staged a rare September rally, touched off when consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co. said its performance was on track. On Friday, Procter & Gamble edged up 1/16 to $67. 

 The Nasdaq saw widening losses among makers of computers, semiconductors, telecommunications equipment and related stocks such as those offering Internet services. 

 The Nasdaq market breadth was negative on the last trading session in the July-to-September quarter, with declines beating advancers 22 to 19, on volume of 2.0 billion shares. 

 But the advance-decline ratio was slightly in favour of the plus side on the Big Board - 1,454 advancers, compared withi 1,412 decliners - on volume of 1.14 billion shares. 

 The American Stock Exchange's computer hardware index slid 13.28 percent while the S&P computer hardware index also extended losses in later trade and closed down a hefty 7.51 percent. Other computer hardware companies that suffered on Friday included Dell Computer Corp., down $2-5/8 to $30-13/16; Compaq Computer Corp., down $3.09 to $27.58, and Gateway Inc., down $9.15 to $46.75. 

 Hewlett-Packard Co., one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average, fell $9-7/8 to $97, a drop of 9 percent - chopping about 50 points off the blue-chip index. 

 Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff cut his ratings Friday on all five major personal computer makers, saying the downgrades, while spurred in part by the Apple announcement, were prompted more by concerns with "the macro picture" in the sector. 

 "Our concern relates to the multiple negative data from industry (Intel, Apple, Lexmark, SCI, cell phones, telecom spending, weaker component prices, etc.) and macro-economic (currency, oil, slowing growth) issues," Neff said. 

 The Dow was also pulled lower by other technology components, including International Business Machines Corp., down $5-7/16 to $112-1/2, and No. 1 chip maker Intel Corp., off $2-7/8 at $41-9/16. 

 But gains were seen in some Dow stocks, such as drug giant Merck & Co., up $1-5/16 at $74-7/16, and chemical producer DuPont Co., up $1-3/8 at $41-7/16. 

 Another warning came from UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines, the world's largest airline. UAL stock dropped as much as 7 percent after it warned that it expected a third-quarter loss from flight cancellations, delays and higher costs for jet fuel and wages. UAL stock fell $2 to close at $42, off 4.55 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange, pressuring other airline stocks. 

 "I think that at this stage ... if you disappoint (investors), the market is very unforgiving," said Peter Gottlieb, a portfolio manager at First Albany Asset Management in Chicago.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks got crushed on Friday, the last trading day of the third quarter, on a nasty profit warning from Apple Computer Inc., while bonds and the dollar ended the session mixed. 

 "Just when we thought we were done with negative pre-announcements, the Apple surprise came," said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., referring to the recent series of company warnings. "It literally took the legs out from under the market, both physically and psychologically." 

 In New York, oil futures prices rose after six straight days of decline triggered by U.S. President Bill Clinton's announcement last Friday he would tap U.S. emergency reserves to insure adequate heating oil supplies this winter. 

 The 10-year U.S. Treasury note gained as the stock market carnage prompted investors to buy debt. But the long bond dipped and the two-year note was flat. The bond market also got a lift from the view that the Federal Reserve will leave U.S. interest rates unchanged when it meets this Tuesday. 

 The euro gained ground against the dollar, still getting mileage out of the ever-present threat of more intervention by the world's major central banks to keep it out of sick bay. 

 The dollar, however, briefly surged to five-week highs against the Japanese yen of 108.50 yen after Japan reported its biggest-ever drop ever in consumer price data, and officials expressed concern about weak consumer spending. 

 But it was the U.S. stock market that grabbed most of the spotlight, as personal computer maker Apple's profits warning pushed technology stocks and all major indexes lower. This pricked the balloon of joy felt on Wall Street on Thursday when consumer products giant Procter & Gamble said its earnings would meet expectations. 

 The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index ended down 105.50 points, or 2.79 percent, at 3,672.82, near its low for the day, based on the latest available figures. 

 For the year, the Nasdaq composite is down 9.74 percent. For the week, the index is off about 3.4 percent. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 173.14 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 10,650.92. 

 For the year, the Dow is off 7.4 percent. Since the close last Friday, the blue-chip index has fallen 1.81 percent. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index finished Friday down 21.78 points, or 1.49 percent, at 1,436.51. The S&P 500 so far this year is off 2.23 percent. In the last week, the index fell just 0.84 of a percent. 

 The stock of Apple Computer Inc., Nasdaq's most active issue, lost nearly 52 percent of its value, falling $27-3/4 to close at $25-3/4, lopping about $10 billion off the company's market capitalisation.

 Investors grew more concerned that the entire industry is facing slower growth. Their confidence was already shaken following a bombshell warning of weaker-than-expected sales late last week by leading computer chip maker Intel Corp.. 

 Apple, known for its stylish iMac PCs trimmed in translucent colours, became the latest in a series of high-profile companies to warn of less-than-stellar earnings. Earlier this week, Eastman Kodak, the No. 1 U.S. photo film maker, said its financial results would disappoint. 

 Hewlett-Packard Co., one of the 30 stocks in the Dow average, fell $9-7/8 to $97, a drop of 9 percent - chopping about 50 points off the blue-chip index. 

 In the U.S. Treasury market, the benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, yielding 5.81 percent, down from 5.83 percent at Thursday's close. The 30-year bond dipped 1/32, or 31.25 cents for each $1,000 of face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was 5.89 percent, unchanged from Thursday. 

 The two-year Treasury note ended Friday's session unchanged, with its yield at 6.00 percent. In contrast, the five-year Treasury note gained 2/32 to yield 5.86 percent. 

 On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, will meet to decide the future direction of interest rates. Many credit market analysts and economists expect the FOMC will leave rates alone, especially with the presidential election just a month away. 

 In late U.S. currency trading, the euro rose to 88.32 cents from 87.90 cents at Thursday's close. The dollar rose to 108.08 yen, down from its five-week high of 108.50, but above Thursday's close of 107.57 yen. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery gained 50 cents to settle at $30.84 a barrel. Traders linked the gain to short covering before the weekend. 

 In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose 30.1 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 6,294.2, getting a lift from gains by Vodafone and BAT In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average gained 120.30 points, or 0.77 percent, to finish 15,747.26.

 ADR Report - U.S.-listed foreign stocks fall with Nasdaq.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Asian and European high-tech issues led U.S.-traded foreign shares lower on Friday as Wall Street reeled under pressure from Apple Computer Inc.'s profit warning. 

 The Bank of New York's index of leading American Depository Receipts, or ADRs, was down 0.92 percent at 138.52. The index of Asian ADRs fell 1.23 percent at 131.12, and the European ADRs index was off up 1.02 percent at 145.52. 

 Many Japanese ADRs bucked gains seen overnight in the key Tokyo stock market, which had concentrated on the sharp gains in Thursday's session in the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq market and shrugged off Apple's warning. 

 The ADRs of electronic components firm Kyocera Corp. fell $7-1/8 to $150-7/8, while electronics giant Sony Corp. was off $3-7/16 at $101. Telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. eased $1-3/8 at $48-9/16. 

 "In Japan and Hong Kong the markets were strong, but what we see happening is the ADRs discounting that," said a New York-based Asia ADRs trader. 

 "They are falling in sympathy with Apple Computer and Nasdaq," he added. "On Monday, Hong Kong is closed, as is China, and the price of these ADRs obviously reflects expectations that these local markets are going to be fairly easier." 

 On Wall Street, U.S. stocks extended their losses in early-afternoon trade. Apple's warning about weaker sales and earnings, which came after the markets closed on Thursday, prompted a wide sell-off in high-tech shares. The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index was down 69.74 points, or 1.85 percent, at 3,708.58, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.74 points, or 0.98 percent, at 10,718.32. 

 But some Japanese issues posted gains, including Orix Corp. The ADRs of the diversified financial services company rose $1-7/8 at $58-1/2. 

 Most Chinese issues were a little higher but in dull trade, while among the Hong Kong issues a bright spot was Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. It rose $1-1/2 to $30, but traders said there was little news behind the move. 

 European technology issues fell in New York trade, tracking their local shares, which reversed direction and fell in line with the Apple-induced Nasdaq weakness. 

 Among European telecommunications concerns, France's Alcatel fell $3-1/8 at $64-3/8, France Telecom was off $1-1/16 at $106-15/16, Italy's Telecom Italia eased $1-1/16 at $106-3/8, and Germany's Deutsche Telekom fell $1-3/8 at $34-1/16. 

 In the computer sector, France's STMicroelectronics fell nearly 4 percent, off $2-1/16 at $51. Its local share rose on the Paris bourse earlier as technology stocks there caught up with Thursday's rally on Nasdaq before succumbing to selling pressure later. 

 Among other notable declines among the French companies, insurance group AXA lost $2-5/8 at $64-5/8. 

 The index of Latin American ADRs fell 0.35 percent to 101.20, led lower by Mexican issues. Contributing to the pressure was a 1.8 percent decline in the main local Mexican bourse's IPC index after cement giant Cemex announced it would buy a major U.S. cement company. 

 Cemex slid 4.2 percent in Mexico and was off 11/16 at $20-1/4, down 3 percent, on the Big Board. Cemex said it would pay $2.6 billion cash for No. 2 U.S. cement company Southdown Inc. Southdown soared 27 percent, up $15-3/16 at $71-3/16, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Among other bellwethers, Mexican broadcasting giant Grupo Televisa was off $1-3/16 at $58 and telecom giant Telefonos de Mexico slipped $1 to $53-1/2. 

 Brazilian telecom ADRs fell a little, but in the plus column was Tele Celullar Sul, up $1-1/8 at $29-7/8.

 Treasury yields drop in London on stock, oil hopes.

 LONDON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Friday in London on optimism that U.S. stocks would open lower and on expectations that oil prices would remain at present levels or head lower. 

 A heavy line-up of U.S. data, including August personal income and spending and September Chicago PMI will provide the market with some guidance later in the session, but analysts are not expecting a big impact from the numbers. 

 Dealers said the firmer tone to the market could be attributed to falls in Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures, following a profit warning on Thursday by Apple Computer's. This suggests a weak start to U.S. equties meaning some money may seek shelter in U.S. Treasuries. 

 Although oil prices were higher on Friday this does not hide the sharp decline in prices from their recent 10-year peaks. November Brent, which plunged four percent on Thursday, was 58 cents higher at $29.84 per barrel. But the contract has now fallen around 15 percent from its peak two-weeks ago. 

 "If oil can stay at these levels or even head lower that will be very bullish for U.S. Treasuries further down the road," said Gianpaolo Mosconi, bond analyst at Sanwa International. 

 The surge in oil has created some concerns over its effect on inflation. 

 By 1004 GMT the 10-year Treasury note was bid at 99-19 for a yield of 5.805 percent, 1.9 basis points lower. The 30-year Treasury bond was at 105-08, dropping the yield 1.2 basis points to 5.873 percent. 

 The December T-bond future was 6/32 higher at 98-22 and the December T-note future was 7/32 higher at 100-15/64. 

 Analysts said there was no direct impact from Denmark's resounding rejection of the euro as the currency remained stable against the dollar at around $0.88. 

 The August report on personal income will be released at 1230 GMT, and economists polled by Reuters expect incomes to post a 0.3 percent increase on the month, as in July. Personal consumption is expected to post a 0.5 percent increase in August versus a 0.6 percent increase the previous month. 

 The September Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) report on manufacturing activity in the Midwest is released at 1400 GMT and is expected to creep up to 48.5 from 46.5. Any reading below 50 indicates slowing growth in the manufacturing sector. 

 "Personal income and spending figures usually tend to be pretty much ignored and tend to be very often in line with expectations so I'm not expecting too much attention on those ones," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, an economist at CIBC World Markets. 

 "None of the numbers coming out today can dramatically affect the market in my opinion but if anything the most interesting one would be the Chicago PMI," she added. 

 Last month, Treasuries rallied strongly on a much weaker than expected reading in the Chicago PMI as the data is seen as an important precursor to the broader National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) data. 

 The other reports due out on Friday include a final revision to the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, the New York NAPM and the APICS survey. 

 U.S. Treasuries were marginally outperforming German Bunds with the 10-year T-note/Bund spread narrowing one notch to 64 basis points from Thursday's close. The 10-year dollar swap rate was 111 basis points.

 FOREX-Euro leavens rejection with thoughts of G7 aid.

 TOKYO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The euro was enveloped in an edgy silence on Friday as supporters smarting from Denmark's rejection took comfort in the thought that the Group of Seven (G7) indusrial nations was still on its side, probably. 

 In thin late morning trade the euro was holding its breath at $0.8800, down from highs around $0.8865 on Thursday. 

 But that was above New York's $0.8772 trough touched just after the final Danish referendum result showed the "no" camp winning with a surprisingly comfortable margin of 53.1 to 46.9 percent. 

 Euro zone officials did their best to brush off the loss as regrettable but hardly critical to the future of the single currency. Dealers and analysts were less sanguine. 

 "When a whole country rejects the euro like that it can't be good for confidence," said Ken Landon, senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank. 

 It also made it less likely the United Kingdon and Sweden would embrace the euro. 

 "While these rich, developed countries stay out, the poorer countries in eastern europe are clamering to join. And that can't be positive for the longer term," he added. 

 For now, though, the euro's blushes were saved by several factors, not least of which was that, given widespread expectations of a close vote, the market had gone into it square and there were no long positions to sell out of. 

 Traders here said it was also lucky that Japanese investors were disinclined to take fresh positions as official book-closing for the fiscal half-year was only hours away. 

 Japanese economic data were also on the soft side of expectations, with weak wage earners' spending and a record fall in Tokyo core consumer prices reminding the market that consumers had yet to catch up with the recovery in industrial production. That kept the euro propped up at 94.94 yen after falling as far as 94.40 in New York. 

 It also helped the dollar edge up to 107.89 yen from 107.57 late in New York, although dealers reported a wall of Japanese exporter offers above 108.00. 

 And there was some late negative news for the dollar when computer maker Apple became the latest in a string of U.S. corporates to issue a profit warning. 

 That sent Apple shares tumbling 40 percent and knocked one percent off the Nasdaq futures contract, tarnishing what had been an upbeat peformance on Thursday. 

 But the biggest factor in the euro's stability was the threat of intervention. 

 "The market wants to sell but suspects that if it pushes the euro under 87 cents the G7 will almost have to intervene just to maintain their credibility," said a European bank dealer. 

 "It's like having an itch you can't scratch." 

 However, analysts reckoned there were limits to how long the U.S. would support concerted action. 

 "If the U.S. has to repeatedly sell dollars it's going to risk damaging confidence in it's own financial markets," argued Deutsche's Landon. 

 "But if the ECB comes in without the U.S., the market is going to sense a lack of unity and punish the euro for it. It's a position fraught with risks for all sides," he added. 

 Dealers here were also very aware that Japanese investors have suffered huge forex losses on their mountain of euro debt and could be tempted to take advantage of this latest bounce in the euro to hedge or cut back once book-closing is over. 

 This is just what happened when the previous fiscal year ended on Friday, March 31. Massive Japanese selling of euros for yen in offshore hours drove the cross deep under 100.00 yen for the first time and drew aggressive Bank of Japan intervention to restrain the yen on the following Monday. 

 Which left traders wondering if the G7's promise of support for the euro alone would be enough to forestall the hedgers.

 DEBORAH MARCHINI, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Now a look at how UAL (URL: http://www.ual.com) is trading on the Big Board, we bring in Christine Romans, at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Hello, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS. CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there. 

 A big loss for those transports on the Big Board.  You can see the Dow Jones transportation index is sharply lower giving back more than it gained yesterday.  UAL a big culprit there.  It is the parent, as you said, of United Airlines. 

 And, you know, Debbie, we had known that there were troubles here. Everyone knew that it was a difficult third quarter for the company; fuel cost, as well as flight cancellations, lots of different things at play there.  The company, back in July, had warned then the Street was looking for $3.55 a share for the third quarter for UAL.   Then they revised downward the Street`s expectations.  They revised it downward to like 97 cents.  And now they are saying that are going to feel a loss in the third quarter.  So, UAL trading on the downside here. 

 Boeing (URL: http://www.boeing.com/) is another one we are watching. It is a Dow loser as well.   B-A is it`s ticker symbol.  A blow in the super huge jumbo jet market here for Boeing.  Singapore Airlines has ordered 10 with options for another 15 of the new jumbo jet from Airbus. The 500-seat double-decker A3XX`s success is a blow to Boeing, analysts are saying.   So, we are watching Boeing shares move lower to the tune of $2.00. 

 And Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) , G-T-W, we had seen the computer hardware company - we have seen their stock fall today in sympathy with Apple. Also Bear Stearns coming out and downgrading.  Some of these companies, including Gateway, cutting it`s rating to a neutral from a buy. 

 Other ratings changes, Dell (URL: http://www.dell.com/) to a neutral and Compaq (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) to an attractive from a buy. 

 Back to you. 

 MARCHINI: Christine, before we let you go.  Apple is not a Dow stock, but it does seem to be dragging down the Dow.  At last check, IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , and Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) , all lower. 

 ROMANS:  Absolutely, it is definitely a tech weakness here, that is, above all else, weighing on the Dow.   And the transportation index is also very weak here today.  So, two sectors we are watching. 

 MARCHINI: All right, thanks, Christine. 

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  All right, for more on what that Apple announcement is doing to the market, we turn now to Steve Young. 

 Steve, good morning. 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, this stunning news yesterday from the company reversed 11 consecutive quarters, a positive gain, a great turn around story under CEO Steve Jobs.   The company cited three main reasons for the situation it`s now in.  It said that slow September sales are occurring now due to a business slowdown everywhere.  Apple`s core education business is slower than expected and its` well reviewed G4 Cube computers off to a slow start.  The company now projects $110 million in earnings before investments instead of the expected 165 million.  And in what certainly is an understatement, CEO Steve Jobs says, "we`ve clearly hit a speed bump." 

 Well, one of the issues is the G4 computer widely reviewed with praise, but about 300 bucks more than an equivalent computer from the Wintel world of PCs.  Creative Strategies (ph) President Tim Baharen (ph) says that that was a blunder because it is intended to appeal to high-end users.  "The Wall Street Journal" this morning has a story that Apple may be considering entering the retail business to increase its distribution.   Baharen (ph) says he can`t get confirmation from Apple, nor have we been able to.  However, Baharen (ph) does say that Apple has been hiring experienced executives in the retail business.  So, it looks as if Apple may be considering the sort of retail sales that Gateway has been turning to, but the danger there is you may offend your regular dealers. 

 MARCHINI:  I don`t know how many times you`ve had - how  much time you have to survey opinion out there, Steve, but did they look at this as predominantly a pricing blunder or are there any problems with the product? 

 YOUNG: It`s both, the G4 appears to be priced high expect for high-end people, but if you are a high-end person, you want to do a lot of graphics stuff, you want to be able to add cards in to make it more versatile and powerful, the G4, beautiful as it is, doesn`t let you add much stuff. 

 MARCHINI:  Got you, couldn`t have said it better, thank you, Steve. 

 TUCKER:  All right. 

 Well, one savvy investor out there didn`t buy into the Apple success story.  And that savvy investor would be Paul Meeks, portfolio manager of Merrill Lynch`s Global Tech Fund. 

 Paul, you look awfully good this morning, but why so sour on Apple? 

 PAUL MEEKS, MERRILL LYNCH:  I`ve actually always believed that this was a one-product company revolving around the iMac.  And sooner or later, if they don`t diversify properly, that product is going to get stale, that`s looks like it happened.  And then when you see the news reported last night that they`ve seen weakness in every geography and the key educational market, that doesn`t bode well for Apple.  And it may be more than an Apple-specific problem.  We`ve been negative on the PC industry and this could bode ill for the rest of the group. 

 MARCHINI:  We are seeing Dell, Gateway, and Compaq down today, also IBM. 

 Do you ascribe that to the performance of Apple? 

 MEEKS:  Apple and also the pre-release from Intel recently because Intel is essentially a PC company with 90 percent market share in those boxes. 

 I`d be very surprised if we don`t have another pre-announcement from another PC company.  And even if companies like H-P, IBM, Gateway, Dell, make their quarterly earnings, I don`t think they are going to make it by much. 

 TUCKER:  Well, what`s happening to the tech sector, Paul?  What`s going on here? 

 MEEKS:  Actually there is certain parts of the tech sector that I`m very bullish on.  And actually there is a number of tech stocks that are actually doing well today.  Optical components and networking, some of the communications, not PC-oriented, but communications-oriented semiconductor stocks.  And a variety of even net stocks and software companies are doing well today, but it`s everything that touches the PC and some of the more cyclical areas of technology which are going to get damaged and they could continue to get damaged. 

 MARCHINI:  Looking at Apple now, the price has been chopped by better than half this morning.  Still not cheap enough to entice you? 

 MEEKS:  My sense is that their problems are going to linger for a number of quarters.  So, if you are value investor, which I typically don`t chase with technology stocks, or a really long-term focus and not worried about short-term underperformance or outperformance, I think it might be OK, but it`s not really the game that I play. 

 MARCHINI:  All right, Paul Meeks, Merrill Lynch Global Technology Fund. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 MARCHINI:  Joining us is Peter Viles now, with a wrap of a - I guess there`s no other way to put it Peter, a pretty crummy quarter. 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it was kind of, crummy.  The macro picture here, good news/bad news.  The good news is the Fed went to the sidelines and stopped raising interest rates.  The bad news is they went to the sidelines because they felt like they had done their job, which was to slow the economy down.  So, all these profit warnings we have heard lately.  A lot of them have to do with a slowing economy, with the Fed achieving its goal.  If you look at some of the industries - now, these are numbers we did last night, at the close last night. So, you can subtract about a percentage point from them. 

 The Dow, up 3.6 percent for the quarter, not a bad performance there. The S&P pretty much flat, up three-tenths of a percent.  The Nasdaq down 4.7.  A couple of interesting ones at the end here, some of the big macro factors in the market this quarter.  Crude oil, down 6.6 percent for the quarter, the start of the quarter, in the $32 range, finishes the quarter in the $30 range.  But, in the middle, it went to 38, which is almost like another interest rate hike.  It really served to break the global economy.  You also have the euro down 7.9 percent. 

 We`ve heard a lot of complaints about some of these multinationals are not doing as well as they wanted to in Europe.  A couple of winners, a couple of losers.  Mutual fund, financial funds, and healthcare funds - Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) is up 19 percent this quarter. They did a big deal this quarter.  A good quarter for Citigroup. Telecom funds did very poorly, AT&T down nine percent. 

 Some other big losers:  Intel down 33 percent for the quarter. Microsoft -- only big macro news for Microsoft was good.  They won a legal ruling, down 23 percent for the quarter. 

 TUCKER:  But, that didn`t come from this week. 

 VILES:  Sure.  Sure.  But, a bad quarter for Microsoft.  EMC, data storage, up 33 percent. 

 MARCHINI:  Yes,  everybody seems to like that one, all right, great, Peter Viles. 

 So ,what`s next?  If you listen to our next quest, you might find yourself a little confused.  We are joined by someone who thinks things can only get better, Paul Meeks, Portfolio Manager of Merrill Lynch`s Global Technology Fund.  Here he rejoins us now from Princeton, New Jersey. 

 TUCKER:  And our second guest, he`s trouble everywhere and he`s looking to cash in on that.  David Tice runs the Prudent Bear Fund.  He joins us from Dallas.  And, on this note, we should note that David does run a true bear fund.  He`s not hedging it with any long bets.  So, David thinks things could get a little dire.  David, let`s start with you. This is probably a good quarter to have you on.  What about the argument that we`ve seen the market, kind of, flush out the selling and that we can look for some recovery here as we move through October?  Why don`t you believe that? 

 DAVID TICE, PRUDENT BEAR:  Well, we really have not had that much selling, Bill.  The Nasdaq`s down about six percent or so.  However, this market is selling, still at more than 50 to 100 percent more overvalued than any stock market in history.  When you look at technology, we have four sectors, PCs, telecom, infrastructure, telecom handsets and also Internet.   And all those areas are suffering problems right now. 

 MARCHINI:  Paul, if I understood your position, you would agree with David on the personal computer part of the business.  But you disagree with him pretty strongly about telecom wireless. 

 MEEKS:  Not necessarily.  Our portfolio is also void of telecom stocks. In the wireless space, we only own Nokia and it`s not a big position.  I do think the wireless market is going to rebound in 2001, but I agree that the PC market may not rebound in 2001.  So, I think we`re in more agreement than you may think. 

 TUCKER:  Well now Paul, the telecommunication sector`s a real broad diverse sector.  And, as you mentioned at the top of the show, fiber optic side of that business has done pretty well and you`ve held up in all of this.  And you expect better things from that group of stocks, right? 

 MEEKS:  Yes, those stocks are definitely not value plays by any stretch. 

 But for example, today, most of them are doing pretty well in the teeth of this PC announcement.  It is true that, as telecom companies weaken, they may cut their budgets on Legacy equipment for telecom equipment purchases.  But I still think they`re still going to spend on new era optical networks and so, these companies will continue to do well in my opinion. 

 MARCHINI:  David Tice, am I correct?  You`re short the Nasdaq market? 

 TICE:  Yes.  We believe that the Nasdaq market is dramatically overpriced.  This truly is a mania.  We are recommending that people buy puts on the Nasdaq 100 index. 

 TUCKER:  But David, it`s been arguably overvalued for better than three years now and that hasn`t seemed to stand in the face of it going higher and higher.  What`s different this time around? 

 TICE:  Well, that`s what they say about chain letters or pyramid schemes and they keep going up until they quit going up.  However, when they get to too high of a level, they will eventually decline.  And unfortunately, the higher you go, the harder you fall. 

 MARCHINI:  All right,  David Tice, our Prudent Bear and Paul Meeks, of the Merrill Lynch Global Technology Fund, thank you both for being with us this morning on IN THE MONEY. 

 TUCKER:  All right, coming up on IN THE MONEY, we`ve got Gene Marcial, of "Business Week."  He`s going to be getting here with us and we`ll have more market coverage when we return. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Exactly right.  We`ve got a UAL deal to talk about today. They issued a warning. 

 MARCHINI:  That`s right, Jennifer Westhoven, let`s talk about UAL and the entire airline sector in the wake of nasty projections. 

 JENNIFER WESTHOVEN:  You know, I just can`t help but wonder, though. Jill got so many Barbie comments, if the next person is male, if he, you know, becomes a Ken, coming in, in his little toy Corvette or something, ... 

 TUCKER:  I know, it all depends on whether he cost the company that much money.  He might get a lot worse comments than Ken. 

 WESTHOVEN:  You can get a lot of pay there, though, no matter what you do. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, you can. 

 WESTHOVEN:  You Airline stocks.  Very many of them on the downside today.  Of course, the big bombshell is the warning from United Airlines.  We also, though, have a warning from Airborne Freight, ABF. They`re the parent company of Airborne Express.  You see UAL`s off about two and change and ABF has been down two from it`s 4:00 p.m. New York Stock Exchange close, as well.  We`ve also got problems going on in Boeing in terms of the stock.  There`s like, a two point loss there today.  And, of course, we`ve got this news that Airbus wins a very big contract from Singapore Airlines for the big jumbo jet.  So, we`re just seeing a lot of negativity going on there, despite the fact that oil prices have come back a bit. 

 TUCKER:  Well, you know, it`s interesting Jennifer, I`m - I was surprised that Boeing hasn`t lost more business, in particular to European airlines, because it would be so much cheaper for them to order from Airbus and pay in euros than it would be to convert those euros to dollars and buy from Bonn. 

 WESTHOVEN:  You Well, I think, until Airbus got this big development plan going on there, they didn`t have a kind of model for one of these big, long-range, many passenger vehicles that, you know, Boeing really has had a stranglehold on that - on that industry - on that area before. 

 So, ... 

 MARCHINI:  The UAL warning.  How much of it`s specific to the company facing a strike and how much of it generalizes to the whole industry because of the higher fuel costs? 

 WESTHOVEN:  Well, I can`t quantify you exactly because, right now, even when they`re giving out the warning, they`re saying we expect a third quarter share loss, not really getting much more than that, and possibly for the fourth quarter.  So, it`s hard to tell.  I mean, they have certainly had the problems with the pilots union - had two things.  The destruction meant lower revenues.  Nobody wanted to fly there.  Plus other - plus the fuel rates, though.  The fuel rates have really hurt everyone across the board and it`s been a problem for the entire sector. 

 MARCHINI:  So that`s where the airlines will hit, all right, Jennifer Westhoven, thanks. 

 TUCKER:  Thanks Jen. 

 Well, coming in on IN THE MONEY, one of the companies on Gene Marcial`s short list is Hercules, the chemical makers.  We`ll talk about Hercules and other companies when he joins us a little bit later. 

 MARCHINI:  And European regulators have mixed opinions about Time Warner and some of its dealings.  Coming up, we`ll go to London and "Financial Times" for the latest on EMI, AOL and our parent company, Time Warner. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Oh, look at that Deb.  Beautiful, beautiful shot of the lady in the harbor, the Statue of Liberty.  It is gorgeous on this Friday, end of the quarter, end of September and on the eve of a new year on the Jewish calendar. 

 MARCHINI:  That`s right, and welcome back to IN THE MONEY. 

 TUCKER:  Still to come, "Business Week`s" Gene Marcial, will take us inside Wall Street, with a Herculean prediction about a specialty chemical company.  He`ll explain what we mean. 

 MARCHINI:  Yes, if I read him right, he`s found three ways to triple your money. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Look at that, a beautiful, beautiful shot of the Lady in the harbor, the Statue of Liberty.  It is gorgeous on this Friday, end of the quarter, end of September and on the eve of the New Year on the Jewish calendar. 

 MARCHINI:  Welcome back to IN THE MONEY. 

 TUCKER:  Still to come, "Business Week`s" Gene Marcial will take us inside Wall Street with a Herculean prediction about a specialty chemical company.  He`ll explain what we mean. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, I read him right.  He found three ways to triple your money.  I`m interested in hearing about that.  Plus, are online retailers prepared for the onslaught of customers expected to make purchases through the Internet this holiday season?  We`ll talk about a new survey with an interesting analyst.  But first, we`re going to check the markets. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, let`s take a look at these.  We`ve got the Dow showing triple digit losses, but in some degree, we need to set this against huge rallies yesterday.  A little bit of profit taking would have been probably expected in order today anyhow.  But you do have the complication of Apple coming out, warning.  Apple stock getting a major haircut, down over 50 percent in its market cap, and that is spilling over into the Dow.  IBM lower.  Hewlett-Packard sharply lower. Microsoft down and Intel down.  Those stocks weighing the Dow Industrials, putting them down 112.  The Nasdaq composite down 66. 

 MARCHINI: And traders are dealing with more earnings warnings today. UAL`s prediction back in July, which falls short of earnings forecast for the second half of the year appears to have been optimistic.  The parent of United Airlines says it will post a loss in the third quarter and maybe in the fourth quarter too.  UAL blames the shortfall on flight cancellations.  It had the pilot strike.  Also, delays and higher costs for jet fuel as well as wages. 

 And Apple Computer says poor sales will cut its profits for the fiscal fourth quarter by up to 15 cents a share.  The company reports earnings October 18th, but you don`t have to wait for the damage.  It`s been in chopped in value by more than half. 

 TUCKER:  And there you see it, folks.  Looking bad.  For a closer look behind the numbers we have Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange, Charles Molineaux over at the Nasdaq.  Christine, let`s start with you and some of the trader talk that`s going on down on the floor. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there.  I got to tell you, TUCKER, folks are talking about the fact that this time yesterday we were looking at about 108 points on the upside, not 108 points on the downside.  So, they`re talking about how quickly the tide can turn here. 

 This is the last day of the quarter as well, so they are looking for some midday volatility, maybe some volatility late in the day as well. Overall, they expect a pretty tough, pretty volatile day.  They`re telling me, they say, we`re heading into October, which, as we all know, can be a scary season on Wall Street. 

 They`re also talking about the advance-decline lines.  They`re pointing out that today, even though the Dow is lower by the same degree it was higher yesterday, the advance-declines are pretty much even right now. Yesterday, you saw advancers ahead of decliners by a two to one margin. That`s something that the bulls and the technicians say they are very happy to see. 

 Meanwhile, the transports here were reversing exactly what they saw on the upside yesterday.  Fun, fun, fun in the transports, only if you`re a seller, they say.  They`re still worried about those higher energy prices, higher fuel costs, what it`s going to mean.  A couple more transport company warnings today.   The whole airline sector is sagging. 

 Still, a nice little crowd, although not too edgy looking over there by UAL.  For the most part, traders are very happy to wrap up September, but they think that we might be heading into a volatile period in the beginning of October as well. 

 For a look at how things are trading over at the Nasdaq, Charles Molineaux is there.  Charles, what`s going on in your neck of the woods? 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, we are still losing ground here, Christine, although, of course, keeping in mind we saw a 122 point rally yesterday.  We are now down by 64 points at 3,713 on 695 million shares traded already.  Some pretty negative breadth too. Declining issuers outnumber advancers by about a three to two margin. We`ve got computers are off by 2 1/2 percent at this point, industrials down by 1 1/2, telecoms down by 2, and chips stocks are down by 4 percent on the day.  The second most actively traded stock on the Nasdaq is Intel, 25 million shares traded.  Apple has traded 70 million shares, and it has still been cut in half by 50 percent.  This market has remained negative throughout the session.  Started off with a nice, steep sell off, hit our session high of 3,751.  That was actually still down by 27 points.  We have slid down from that point, all the way down to 3,703.  And we are now not too far from that level, sitting here at 3,712. 

 Well, we take a look at some of it also residual effects of Apple. Again, the question is are Apple`s problems specific to that one company.  Investor`s aren`t so sure, but that`s because Dell is now down by 8 percent, Sun Microsystems is down by 3, and we`ve got Adobe down by 1 1/2.  So, we`re looking at a pretty broad sell off going on.  Perhaps a little bit of profit taking after yesterday`s runoff, but certainly some very negative response to Apple`s warning. 

 TUCKER, Deborah. 

 MARCHINI:  Thank you, Charles. 

 TUCKER:  All right, it`s Friday.  Time to take a look at some of the stories that people on Wall Street will be talking about over the weekend.  Gene Marcial of "Business Week" is here with his weekly column. 

 MARCHINI:  But before we get to look at the menu on this week, we`re going to take a look at some of the stocks Gene talked about last Friday.  Goldman Sachs, Schwab and Juniper are all slightly higher for the week.  Covad is still losing ground, down 10 percent for the week. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Gene joins us now with his look inside Wall Street this week. And I`m going to take you to task because you`re talking about Hercules.  And it`s not been a Herculean stock.  This is one that`s been beaten up really badly in the market this year.  So, why should we believe good things are on the horizon? 

 GENE MARCIAL, BUSINESS WEEK:  You`re absolutely right.  It`s down 50 percent for this year.  This specialty chemical maker has been bitten down because of earnings shortfall, the usual shortfall in earnings. However, I have it in good authority that it is a takeover target by a takeover artist, Sam Haven.  I know him and I know he operates and he`ll go after this.  The valuation is up to $28 a share, and he thinks he can do more with it than what the management`s doing now. 

 MARCHINI:  Well, if that`s the case, you`re right, you can more than double your money by making an investment in this stock at $12 a share. 

 MARCIAL:  That`s right.  And this stock is moving today.  It was down 50 but now it`s moving up. 

 MARCHINI:  You found a couple other takeover plays that you like, among them Southwest Gas. 

 MARCIAL:  Exactly.  It`s heating up, as you said, in your billing there. 

 This has been through the takeover mill a couple of times last year. There were two bids for it, and one has disappeared because there were lawsuits.  But again, Mario Gabelli, a big investor in the company, thinks that another bidder is coming up.  And he think it`s ridiculously cheap at the current price of $20.  I think it`s moving up again today. But he ... 

 TUCKER:  It is, GenE.  But I got to ask you, Gabelli`s a sharp guy. Is he just trying to talk himself out of a bad investment here in the hopes that it`ll go up? 

 MARCIAL:  No.  He`s been right in many cases.  But in this particular case, it seems a simple story.  Two companies have bid for it, now they`re fighting, and third one likely to come up because of the assets of the companies.  It`s in three states - California, Arizona and something. 

 TUCKER:  Another state as well. 

 MARCHINI:  All right.  And you found a stock in the storage industry. And by that I don`t mean file cabinets.  I mean tech sector storage that you also think you can double money on. 

 MARCIAL:  Network data storage is very hot and Maxtor ... 

 TUCKER:  Maxtor. 

 MARCIAL:  Maxtor - MXTR.  It`s this small fish in a big pond dominated by IBM, EMC, Network Appliance.  Any one of these, I am told, they`ll go after Maxtor.  Reason is it`s incredibly cheap.  A lot of those companies there have multi billion dollar market cap.  This is $890 million market cap and it has sales of $2.6 billion.  And the - for example, Network Appliance has a market cap of $40 billion and it has less sales than Maxtor.  So, it`s a sitting duck there, I think.  And my sources say that`s why this stock`s moving too. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, it is moving.  It`s up 1 1/2 in the market today, trading up about 10.  It`s Nevada - Arizona, California and Nevada.  I looked that up. 

 MARCIAL:  Nevada, that`s it. 

 TUCKER:  There you go. 

 MARCHINI:  A quick question for you.  If you`re looking at takeover plays here, what does it say about the rest of the market and its perspective from - are these the best prospects now for hot money in tech stocks? 

 MARCIAL:  I think so because they - there are two theories here.  The lower the stock prices go down the more it attracts.  On the other hand, when the stock market is moving higher the currency of the stock is much more powerful than takeovers take place, too.  So, I think this particular case - for example, Intel, Apple - is very good valuation now. 

 MARCHINI:  Gene Marcial of "Business Week".  Great to have you with us. Thank you. 

 MARCIAL:  I enjoy it all the time. 

 TUCKER:  All right, straight ahead, the setbacks continue to mount for the euro as the Danes vote against adopting the struggling currency. 

 MARCHINI:  Peter John of London "Financial Times" checks in with details.  Our European update when IN THE MONEY returns in just a moment. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 MARCHINI:  Denmark`s vote not to join the euro is adding to speculation the European Central Bank will step into the market again to support the currency.  Peter John, markets correspondent for the "Financial Times" joins us with more.  Peter, we saw Denmark defeat the euro.  We did not see the euro go down in value.  Why? 

 PETER JOHN, CORRESPONDENT, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Well, I think everyone on the market expected the Central Banks to intervene. And in a way, this is sort of psychological game being played here that they expect the banks to intervene.  They`re not really going to step in and try and sell it because they don`t think, at the moment, they can fight against them.  So, there`s no direct signs of intervention.  There was a very strong signal a few days ago when they did intervene, that they would come in again.  And at the moment, there`s a bit of a stalemate out there. 

 MARCHINI:  If I`m not mistaken, the quote I just saw showed the British pound up rather substantially.  Is this a bet that Denmark`s decision to vote no means Britain is less likely to join? 

 JOHN:  Well, I think that`s true.  You saying it`s up against the euro? 

 MARCHINI:  The dollar. 

 JOHN:  Right.  Yeah.  I think it is certainly true that this vote by Denmark was a big psychological blow for the euro and it does mean that it`s less likely that Sweden and the U.K. will go in as quickly as many people had hoped.  I think it`s a little bit too early to say never say never, but it certainly delayed everything for a while. 

 MARCHINI:  And we`ve got an AOL-Time Warner story, of course, Time Warner the parent of this network on which we are appearing.  But I gather from the reports that if Time Warner is willing to sacrifice a deal with EMI it may get a blessing from European regulators for AOL. 

 JOHN:  Yes, I think that`s true.  Obviously, we have a sort of very parochial attitude here and we`ve been very - looking very closing at the EMI side of it, and it does look very bad news for EMI.  They really did need that Time Warner deal. 

 MARCHINI:  All right, thanks a lot for being with us this morning, John. 

 Coming up on IN THE MONEY, energy policy takes center stage in the presidential campaign trail. 

 TUCKER:  Prudence Solomon will have the latest news headlines when IN THE MONEY returns. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  All right, welcome back.  Time now for a check on world and national headlines. 

 MARCHINI:  Prudence Solomon joins us.  What`s going on outside this little fishbowl we live in here? 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Much is happening.  First of all, politics, of course.  Good afternoon, everyone. 

 In less than 24 hours presidential politics has gone from the FDAs approval of the so-called abortion drug to the high cost of oil.  Right now, Vice President Al Gore addressing an environmental group in Maryland.  Gore is expected to defend the Clinton Administration`s decision to release oil from the nation`s emergency reserve as well as unveil his proposal to protect the environment.  And we are looking at live pictures now from Chevy Chase, Maryland. 

 Now, Texas Governor George W. Bush says the Clinton-Gore Administration was caught napping when oil prices began to rise and says releasing the oil reserve was not the right solution. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  "The strategic reserve is meant for a foreign war or a major disruption in supply, not for national elections.  It`s a petroleum reserve, not a political reserve." 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 SOLOMON:  (INAUDIBLE) supply with OPEC nations and investing in cleaner air technologies. 

 A Consensus Bureau report finds that more Americans have health insurance for the first time in more than a decade.  The study found that the number of uninsured people fell by 1.7 million last year, one million of those Americans were children.  Earlier, President Clinton announced plans to make sure more kids receive healthcare coverage. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  "We need to keep pushing forward until all our children are covered.  To help accomplish this, the Department of Health and Human Services is awarding $700,000 in grants today to develop new and even more effective ways to identify and to enroll uninsured children.  These grants will be used not only to get children enrolled but to keep them enrolled so they can get the care they need." 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 SOLOMON:  President Clinton says the census figures confirm his administration`s healthcare and economic policies work. 

 At least four people are dead and as many 200 were injured in some of the worst crashes in several years at a holy sight in Jerusalem.  For a second straight day, violence broke out at a Holy Shrine claimed by both Jews and Palestinians.  In the West Bank, an Israeli policeman was killed and another was wounded today when a Palestinian policeman opened fire.  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak demanded that the Palestinians take more effective security measures. 

 A close call at the summer Olympics in Sydney.  Earlier today, the U.S. men`s basketball team narrowly defeated Lithuania.  The victory, 85 to 83, was closer than most expected, but still enough - still good enough, for the Dream Team to reach the final round.  Marion Jones was not so fortunate after winning the Bronze medal in the long jump today.  Jones was aiming for an unprecedented five gold medals. 

 That`s still not bad at all.  I mean, fantastic, in fact.  Two gold medals for Marion Jones and a bronze. 

 MARCHINI:  And considering how much pressure she`s under. 

 SOLOMON:  Absolutely. 

 TUCKER:  Pressure that doesn`t even rightly belong on her shoulders, pressure that really is aimed at her husband meant to, in my opinion, get to here, but ... 

 SOLOMON:  Maybe she`ll get another gold in the relay race. 

 TUCKER:  I`m pulling for her.  Thanks, Prudence. 

 MARCHINI:  Thanks, Prudence. 

 SOLOMON:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Coming up, are online retailers ready for this make or break it holiday season?  Well, we`re going to talk to an expert about the fate of e-commerce at Christmastime. 

 MARCHINI:  And then, there`s been a lot of action on Wall Street`s day as both markets spend the morning in the red.  Coming up, Jennifer Westhoven will join us to talk about the market`s movers, most of them moving down. 

 JENNIFER WESTHOVEN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, one of the things we want to talk about today is Research In Motion.  Despite the fact that everything is down, as you said, this is a stock that`s up about 20 percent on the Nasdaq after a very positive earnings report.  We`ll be back with more on that coming up next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 MARCHINI:  OK.  Well, now that we`ve figured out how to announce, I guess it`s - that`s all that`s there. 

 TUCKER:  That`s important because I usually get them wrong. 

 MARCHINI:  I was going to say, well, I like to get them right.  And sometimes you don`t hear that word "standby" when they tell you to shut up. 

 OK.  In today`s e-world segment, we`re looking at what consumers and dot-coms are considering for this year`s holiday shopping season.  Now, a poll conducted by AT&T and Flus.com has found the year 2000`s going to be a make or break season, they say, for a lot of online retailers. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  Online retailers evaluated themselves in a poll.  The results show that only two out of five e-tailers rate themselves as very successful while about a quarter of them say they are not at all successful.   We invited Debbie Karpowicz, who analyzes the study. She`s the author of "Off the Wall Marketing Ideas".  Tell us more about this online shopping season and how it`s starting to shape up.  Kind of surprising results, Debbie.  When you give employees self-examinations and you get those kinds of things back, that usually will prompt a little bit longer meeting than you had planned on. 

 DEBBIE KARPOWICZ, AUTHOR, OFF THE WALL MARKETING IDEAS:  Yes, it was very interesting.  The e-tailers that AT&T polled last year were very harsh on themselves.  And basically, the e-tailers who were very successful last year plan to make changes and improvements this year even more than the retailers who were unsuccessful last year.  So, my take on it is that those successful e-tailers got a taste of online shopping and having good cyber shopping and they want to make sure that it continues this year. 

 MARCHINI:  Debbie, are you working with AT&T, which conducted the study? 

 KARPOWICZ:  Yes, I am. 

 MARCHINI:   All right.  I was puzzled by a couple of the findings.  I thought they were interesting.  Number one, that finding that the second best online e-tailer was Flus.com, with which AT&T has a partnership, and the finding that most successful online retailers used outside Web hosting, because AT&T is in that business, too. 

 KARPOWICZ:  Yes.  Well, I think that`s very interesting, but I really couldn`t comment on that at the moment. 

 MARCHINI:  That being the case, what should we conclude from this study? 

 KARPOWICZ:  Well, there`s a lot of things to conclude because AT&T polled 150 of the key decision-makers at e-tailing companies and 600 of its WorldNet customers.  And on one hand, they found out that customers their expectations are higher than ever for this year, and on the other hand, they found that e-tailers are really going to have to come up to speed in order to provide good online shopping this year.  Because last year customer service was basically the Grinch that stole Christmas. So, there`s going to have to be a lot of action on the part of e-tailers in order to step up to the plate and offer a really good Web site hosting, sites that aren`t going to crash and to make sure that they`re going to be able to provide their product and provide them on time. 

 TUCKER:  Debbie, bottom line, are they going to be better prepared this year than they were last? 

 KARPOWICZ:  Absolutely.  The 84 percent of all the businesses that AT&T polled said that they`re going to be making a lot improvements. So, I think that cybershoppers are going to be very pleased with what they`re finding. 

 MARCHINI:  All right, Debbie Karpowicz.  Thanks for being with us today. 

 KARPOWICZ:  You`re welcome. 

 MARCHINI:  Time to check now to see what stocks are moving in the markets this morning with our stocks editor - wait a minute, I`m going to try that again - with our stocks editor, Jennifer Westhoven.  I can do that. 

 TUCKER:  You got Debbie Karpowicz`s name right.   You can get Jennifer`s name right? 

 MARCHINI:  But I can`t get Jennifer`s.  Go figure. 

 WESTHOVEN:  That`s a rough one. 

 TUCKER:  I like this one that you`re going to talk about, the Research In Motion gets a lot of questions from a lot of viewers.  They seem to like this sort of mid-cap sized stock here. 

 WESTHOVEN:  This is the last great momentum stock.  I`m just kidding. But it`s a momentum stock.  We haven`t really been seeing any momentum stocks lately where people can come in and it goes up and up and up and up.  And this is a crazy one.  It`s getting a lot of volume.  It`s a Canadian stock.  They have these two-way pagers.  They`re called the BlackBerry.  I`m assured that these are huge, even in Atlanta.  They do two-way paging.  They got things like the PalmPilot where they have your address book and your organizer calendar on there. 

 TUCKER:  I know people who swear by their BlackBerry pagers. 

 WESTHOVEN:  I haven`t seen one.  But ... 

 TUCKER:  I don`t have one and I don`t want one.  I don`t want to have two-way communication  with anybody all the time everywhere.  I just don`t want it. 

 WESTHOVEN:  Well, companies would like you to have that, and that is what`s boosting this stock a lot.  Now, I`d like to say it`s up after its earnings report, but it didn`t happen.  But it had a lighter than expected loss, so they lost two cents a share and Wall Street had expected a loss of three cents a share. 

 TUCKER:  My God, that`s worth $15.25 to the upside. 

 WESTHOVEN:  Yeah.  And its revenues are now $42.5 million for the quarter. 

 TUCKER:  Forty-two point five?  That`s it? 

 WESTHOVEN:  Not really that much. 

 TUCKER:  No, that`s not real impressive. 

 WESTHOVEN:  But take a look at the chart of this stock.  It did - it had a great, huge peak right back there in 1999, you could see, and then kind of came back down.  A lot of the Internet stocks, of course, came down around that time.  But since then, it`s really been working its way back up, which is something that a lot of other stocks can`t say the same about.  Now, after we had the earnings report out, too, of course, they had a talk with analysts going on.  A lot of positive comments her. 

 A lot of people raising their price targets now.  You can see a lot of them are actually just raising their price targets where the stock is now.  So, UBS Warburg went from $77 to $100.  The stock`s at $98 3/4 now.  Merrill Lynch also, I believe, the analyst there is going to be talking to MONEYLINE later this evening about that stock.  He took the price target from $70 to $100.  One person I`ll mention is Mark (ph) Specker (ph).  He`s an analyst at Witt Soundview.  He took his price target.  It had been $90 before today, so that was pretty close to where it got now.  He bopped it up to $120.  So, that`s one of the more optimistic views there. And what they`re talking about is the company`s going to have a deal with AOL coming up.   Of course ... 

 TUCKER:  I know that company. 

 WESTHOVEN:  You got to see the disclaimer? 

 MARCHINI:  He looked at the disclaimer, but it worked for AOL`s boom. 

 WESTHOVEN:  So - and aside from that, he said there`s just a lot of excitement going around that.  Also, whether or not there`ll be tie-ups with Compaq and/or Yahoo!.  That could give this stock a lot of traction.  He`s seeing a lot of players in the corporate area like this as a business tool. 

 MARCHINI:  All right.  So, the dot.com thrilled and not necessarily over.  We like that.  Jennifer Westhoven.  Thanks. 

 TUCKER:  And you know what, I`m so frustrated.  I`m sitting here trying to look at the market cap.  Jen, do you happen to have the market cap around?  You don`t?  That`s all right.  I`m sitting here trying to look it up. 

 MARCHINI:  Probably small enough that we could buy it if we pulled the room because who knew where it was before today. 

 TUCKER:  No.  I bet the market cap on it is more than three times the revenue on it.  That`s what I was trying to ... 

 MARCHINI: Maybe more.  Maybe more. 

 TUCKER:  ... check out. 

 MARCHINI:  We`ll do the math today.  We can update them on it tomorrow. 

 TUCKER:  Well, you know what, we`re ending the quarter on a down note here, Deb. 

 MARCHINI:  Yeah, we sure are.  At least the trading session`s not over with yet.  But look at the Dow, down 121 points.  That`s a gain of better than 1 percent.  And we`ve got the Nasdaq down 2 percent or a little bit better than that, with a loss of 75, nearly 76.  What`s particularly being hit today, although you don`t see it there necessarily, is the Dow transports, down 57 points.  Thank UAL for that one. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, exactly.  But you know, it`s interesting, look at the utilities, up 3 3/4 points.  That is enough to put the utilities at another record high.  A defensive play coming into the market.  People are taking their money out of, obviously, a lot of these stocks and moving them over to the utility sector.  So, we`re up 39 percent on the utilities going into today year to date.  It`s been a safe haven for the money. 

 MARCHINI: Yeah, it sure has, definitely. 

 TUCKER:  Well, I think that does it, doesn`t it? 

 MARCHINI:  Yeah. 

 TUCKER:  That does it for today`s edition of IN THE MONEY.  Stay tuned to CNNfn for more market coverage. 

 MARCHINI:  And don`t forget to join us on Monday, back for a new week a new reporter.  From all of us in New York, have a great day.

 Shares in Apple Computer plunge   up to 49% after  profit warning

 CUPERTINO, Calif. (Bloomberg) -- Apple Computer Inc. shares slid as much as 49 percent after the personal-computer maker said fiscal fourth-quarter profit will fall short of analysts' expectations because of slow sales of new products. 

 Shares fell 26.25 to 27.25 in early trading Friday. The decline shaved more than $8 billion from the company's market value. Shares of rival computer makers also declined, including Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. 

 Apple sales were slow in September, usually a lucrative time for computer makers as some students buy new equipment before returning to school. Sales of the new PowerMac Cube also missed forecasts, Apple said. The shortfall is a setback for Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who has revived the company he helped start in 1976 with innovative products such as the colorful iMac. 

 "It's certainly a disappointment," Larry Seibert, a money manager with Barrett Associates, told Bloomberg Television. "Apple will always be fighting an upstream battle in terms of trying to grab market share." 

 Dell Computer, the world's No. 1 direct seller of computers, slid 1.31 to 32.13. Shares of Compaq Computer, the biggest maker of personal computers, were offered for sale at 29.25 on Instinet, down from its 30.67 close. 

 Gateway Inc. lost 4.90 to 51. International Business Machines Corp. was offered at 115.50 on Instinet, down from its close at 117.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Apple gave its outlook for the period ending tomorrow after the close of U.S. trading Thursday. Prior to Friday's trading, the shares had risen eightfold after touching an 11-year low in December 1997. 

 The company expects profit of 30 cents to 33 cents a share on sales of $1.85 billion to $1.9 billion, spokeswoman Katie Cotton said. In the year-ago period, Apple earned $90 million, 51 cents a share before a stock split, on sales of $1.34 billion. 

 Analysts expected earnings of 45 cents, the average estimate in a poll by First Call/Thomson Financial. Company officials declined to comment further. 

 Shares of companies that supply Apple with components also fell, including NatSteel Electronics Ltd. and Omni Industries Ltd. 

 NatSteel Electronics of Singapore puts together every printed circuit board that holds chips and other memory components for Apple's top selling iMac PC and its other products. NatSteel shares fell 48 cents, or 9.6 percent, to S$4.50. Apple represented about half of NatSteel's S$1.7 billion in sales for the first half ended June. 

 NatSteel Electronics is Asia's No. 2 electronics component maker for companies such as Apple and Hewlett-Packard Co. The company makes about a fifth of Apple's manufacturing supplies, analysts estimate. 

 Shares of Omni Industries, which received between 10 percent and 15 percent of its first half sales from Apple, fell 31 cents, or 10 percent, to S$2.75--their biggest one-day drop in more than five months. Omni Industries' Vice President of Finance Evelyn Tan said the company would meet analysts' expectations for the year. 

 Omni Industries is one of Singapore's biggest electronics manufacturers. The company mainly supplies plastic parts for Apple computers. 

 Thursday, Dell Computer Corp. Chairman Michael Dell said he expects personal computer sales worldwide to rise 17 percent this year. He said component shortages have "significantly improved." Dell is the No. 1 direct seller of personal computers worldwide. Dell said in August that fiscal second-quarter sales rose slower than expected on weak demand.

 Apple Spooks Investors With 4th-Quarter Warning, Weighing on PC Sector

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Apple Computer Corp.'s rare profit warning rocked Wall Street investors, which fled the stock in droves Friday, and depressed the shares of other personal computer makers. 

 Apple (AAPL) shed more than half its value in the day's dealings, trading down $27.75, or 52%, at $25.75 on the floor of the Nasdaq. The company, whose shares were at $53.50 at 4 p.m. Thursday, released its lowered outlook after the bell Thursday, and after-hours traders quickly sent the stock into a tailspin. A slew of analyst downgrades followed. 

 The Cupertino, Calif., company said it expects to report earnings for its fiscal fourth-quarter of 30 cents to 33 cents a share, excluding investment gains, on revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.90 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings of 45 cent a share. 

 Apple cited slower than expected sales in September, particularly from school-related purchases, plus disappointing sales of the PowerMac G4 Cube product, which was introduced in mid-July. While the eight-inch cube computer has garnered raves for its compact design, analysts say the machine's steep base price of $1,799 has put off consumers. 

 The company's admission compounded fears that were heightened when chip giant Intel Corp. (INTC) projected a quarterly sales shortfall last week, blaming economic conditions in Europe. 

 Apple's forecast is one of the few negative surprises since Steve Jobs returned in 1997 to lead a turnaround in the company he co-founded. Though the company issued a profit warning last September, that announcement was the result of a component shortage and not weak demand. 

 Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Fortuna was among the pros issuing notes on Apple Friday. Mr. Fortura cut his investment rating on the stock to "short-term neutral" from "accumulate." 

 "Hard times appear to have hit Apple a little sooner than we had expected," Mr. Fortuna said in a morning research note. "We do not see this as a one-quarter phenomenon for Apple, but rather as the beginning of many tough quarters ahead." 

 Still, Mr. Fortuna said Apple's woes don't bode ill for all computer makers. "In our opinion, investors should not read this Apple blow-up as evidence that PC demand is weak. Apple is, in many ways, a market unto itself. 

 "We believe there is a high likelihood that investors will overreact to this news and take down the PC names in sympathy. We would particularly view this as a buying opportunity for Gateway, and, to a lesser extent, Compaq and Dell," he said. 

 Others disagreed. 

 "We believe that macro-economic evidence and common sense argue for caution until we see evidence indicating the potential for positive surprises or better visibility," wrote Andrew Neff, analyst at Bear Stearns. In addition to cutting Apple, MR. Neff lowered his ratings on Dell Computer Corp. (DELL), Hewlett Packard Co. (HWP), Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and Gateway Inc. (GTW). 

 Investor concerns were especially attuned to Gateway, which like Apple, is largely reliant on consumer PC sales. Gateway shares tumbled $7.00, or 13%, to $47.00 at 4 p.m. EDT Friday in the pit of the New York Stock Exchange.

 NEW YORK -- Another wave of profit warnings, led by Apple Computer, sent stocks lower Friday to close out a rough month and a rocky third quarter. But analysts remain hopeful that the selling trend won't last through the rest of the year. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 105.57, or 2.8%, to 3672.75, finishing the week down 3.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 173.14, or 1.6%, to 10650.92, and dropped 1.8% for the week. 

 Other major indexes also lost ground. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 21.78 to 1436.51, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gave back 4.71 to 663.04, and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks lost 2.44 to 521.37. 

 Apple (APPL) sank $27.75, or 52%, to $25.75 by 4 p.m. EDT to lead the Nasdaq most actives. Late Thursday, the computer maker forecast that its fiscal fourth-quarter results would be far less than expected because of a September sales slowdown. That prompted a host of analysts to lower their stock ratings and earnings estimates on Apple. 

 The warning pressured the technology sector, especially computer makers and semiconductor companies. Among the former, Gateway (GTW) dropped $9.15, or 16%, to $46.75, while Dell Computer (DELL), Compaq Computer (CPQ), Hewlett-Packard (HWP) and International Business Machines (IBM) all declined. The Nasdaq Computer index shed 4.2%. 

 Intel (INTC) dropped $2.81 to $41.63, leading a decline among chip makers, including Micron Technology (MU) and National Semiconductor (NSM). The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index sank 5.5%. 

 But the profit jitters hit other sectors as well. Airborne Freight (ABF) dropped $2.06, or 17%, to $10.19 after it warned of a third-quarter loss, hurt by disappointing growth in its domestic shipments and surging fuel prices. 

 UAL (UAL), the parent company of United Airlines, also warned of a third-quarter loss, citing flight delays and cancellations and higher labor costs. Its stock fell $2 to $42, pulling shares of fellow carriers Delta Air Lines (DAL) and US Airways (U) sharply lower. The losses pulled the Dow Jones Transportation Average down 2%. 

 However, Steven Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co., points out that despite Friday's selling, Big Board stocks are in pretty good shape overall, with the NYSE composite not far from its record close of 677 set Sept. 1. 

 "For the Big Board, the backdrop is positive [and] may even start to improve as we get closer to year-end," Mr. Goldman said, adding that the backdrop would improve further if the Federal Reserve moves to ease interest rates. But "the Nasdaq is a wounded animal that was vastly overpriced," he said. 

 The Fed has kept interest rates steady since an aggressive half-percentage point increase in May, which capped a nearly year-long string of increases in an effort to slow the economy and prevent inflation. Policy makers next meet Tuesday, and for the first time in over a year, the market wasn't obsessing about the central bank's next move as the Fed is widely expected to leave rates alone. 

 The market closed out a dismal September after an unusually strong August. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 12.7%, erasing August's 11.7% gain. For the quarter, it fell 7.4%. The industrial average lost 5% in September but rose 1.9% for the quarter. 

 Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., says the change in the calendar bodes well for stocks. "The good news for bulls is that this is the last trading day of September," Mr. Cripps said. "Once we get into October, that will at least take some pressure off of the market." 

 Utilities stocks moved higher, providing a bright spot in Friday's session. The Dow Jones Utility Average gained 1.85 to end at a record 398.22, besting its previous high close of 397.04 set Sept. 15. Oil stocks and financial issues also rose. 

 In U.S. economic news Friday, incomes rose solidly in August, but spending increased at an even faster rate, pulling the nation's personal savings rate down to a record low. The Commerce Department said spending grew 0.6% in August, while personal income increased 0.4%. All that spending drove down the personal savings rate to minus 0.4% in August, an all-time monthly low since such record-keeping began in 1959. 

 Outside the U.S., European shares closed mostly lower, weighed down by anxiety about the euro after Denmark rejected joining the common currency. In the Asian-Pacific region, markets closed mostly higher, but Taiwan's technology shares were hurt by Apple's profit warning. 

 In major market action: 

 Stocks mostly fell. But on the Big Board, where 1.13 billion shares traded, 1,454 stocks advanced and 1,418 declined. On the Nasdaq market, 1.98 billion shares traded hands. 

 Bonds steadied. The 10-year Treasury note climbed less than 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 holding, pulling the yield down to 5.791%. The 30-year bond was unchanged, yielding 5.880%. 

 The dollar was mixed. It traded at 88.30 cents to the euro and 108.15 yen to the dollar, compared with 87.94 cents to the euro and 107.54 yen to the dollar late Thursday in New York.

 UAL Expects to Post 3rd-Quarter Loss, Blaming Labor Woes and Fuel Costs

 CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Plagued by labor strife that caused flight delays and thousands of cancellations, UAL Corp. warned that it will report a third-quarter loss and probably a fourth-quarter loss. 

 The parent of United Airlines also blamed the higher price of jet fuel. 

 UAL had already issued two less-specific warnings about weaker third-quarter results. But Friday's announcement's still was a big surprise to Wall Street. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had been expecting UAL to earn 97 cents a share for the third quarter and 63 cents a share for the fourth. 

 In 4 p.m. EDT New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, UAL's stock dropped $2, or 4.6%, to $42. 

 In mid-July UAL warned investors down from rosier projections, saying it expected earnings in the range of $2.60 to $3.20 a share. A month later, the company said even those lowered expectations were too rosy. James E. Goodwin, the airline's chairman and chief executive, declined to be more specific at the time, citing uncertainties surrounding labor relations, crew-related issues and weather. 

 After more than 20 months of stormy contract negotiations with its pilots' union, UAL experienced an "abnormally high level" of delays and cancellations throughout the peak travel season, which had a "significant effect on revenues," the company said Friday. 

 The airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights over the summer as pilots refused to work overtime and stuck to rigid work rules. Since the agreement, the airline has reported improved operations. 

 Last month, the airline reached a tentative four-year agreement on a new contract with its pilots. The agreement would give United's pilots the highest wages in the industry. Mail balloting should be completed in mid-October, the union said earlier this month. 

 The cost of the tentative pact, as well as the expected effect of other labor agreements, which the airline is negotiating, will be higher than anticipated, the company said Friday. 

 In addition, the airline, which has agreed to acquire US Airways Group Inc., said the cost of jet fuel is rising rapidly -- more so than the cost of crude oil. 

 "While the quarter's events are negatively impacting our financial performance, we are making every effort to improve our operations and restore our customers' confidence in United," Mr. Goodwin said in a prepared statement Friday. 

 Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Michael Linenberg Friday downgraded UAL, as well as other airlines. "The airline industry is in the midst of one of its strongest-ever revenue environments," Mr. Linenberg wrote in a research note. "Yet overall net income for 2000 is expected to decline at $3.6 billion versus $3.9 billion last year. This is principally due to higher fuel prices, although salaries and wages, plus increased traffic congestion are also contributors." 

 During contract negotiations, some United pilots declined to fly overtime. That forced the airline to trim its schedule by about 3%. Even with the cutback, the airline often was short of cockpit crew and had to cancel hundreds of flights on the day of departure. Passengers defected to other carriers in droves. 

 The proposed contract would raise the hourly pay of a 12-year 737 captain from $156.38 today to $226.60 in May 2004. A 12-year captain flying a 747-400 would see hourly pay rise from $222.27 today to $355.84 by the end of the contract. Because this compensation exceeds pay at other airlines, pilot unions elsewhere are pressing their companies to meet or exceed United's terms. 

 United now has turned its focus to contracts for its nearly 50,000 mechanics, ramp workers and customer-service agents. 

 UAL hedged all of its jet fuel costs for the remainder of the year when the crude oil prices were around $28 to $29 a barrel, according to Brian Harris, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. US Airways, by contrast, has no hedging program in place, while many other carriers are believed to be poorly hedged. 

 UAL's warning may spell trouble for the airline industry's long-term earnings outlook. Although the world's largest airline is expected to return to profit by 2001, the two factors that knocked UAL into the red - higher labor and fuel costs - will likely erode profits of other carriers over time, analysts said. 

 That's because costs at its rivals are expected to go up as they attempt to match the wage increases UAL recently promised to its pilots. What's more, some smaller airlines are believed to be far more vulnerable to soaring fuel prices due to a lack of hedging designed to protect themselves from the increase. 

 Glenn Engel, analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York, said, "United's contract will have a negative impact on the rest of the industry," but noted that much of UNited's problems appear to be a result of customer avoidance due to flight delays and cancellations. 

 A spokesman for the United Friday said the carrier remains committed to buying US Airways. Joe Hopkins said the third-quarter warning won't impact United's $1.6 billion offer for US Airways. A spokesman for US Airways declined to comment on whether United's financial troubles will affect the proposed marriage, which is scheduled to be put to a vote by US Airways shareholders next month. 

 Shares of US Airways hit a 52-week high of $51.50 on May 24, when UAL made its offer of $60 a share. Since then, US Airways stock has traded substantially lower, which analysts said reflects investor uncertainty about the likelihood of the deal going through. US Airways shares traded at $30.44 4 p.m. EDT Friday off 4.5% on the day and about half the value of United's offer. 

 Despite United's weakening financial position, regulatory hurdles remain the single biggest obstacle to a purchase of US Airways. Earlier this month, Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said the committee had "strong reservations" about the deal, citing its potential to leave consumers with fewer travel options, higher fares and reduced levels of service. After the merger, Sen. McCain said, at least 20 hub airports in the U.S. would have a single airline carrying more than 50% of passenger traffic.

ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Credit Suisse Group's (Z.CSG) top executives
denied Friday that the group had issued a profit-warning, saying their
comments had been misinterpreted.



"This is not a profit-warning," said Credit Suisse Group Chief
Executive Lukas Muehlemann. "This is not news, we've already said this
before."



Earlier, in a speech to shareholders, Muehlemann said investments in
new business activities and technologies and the acquisition of
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. (DLJ) "may impact on annual results."



Muehlemann said a news agency "misled the market" by interpreting his
comments as a profit-warning.



Shares of Credit Suisse fell as much as 6.4% to CHF322.50 following
Muehlemann's speech to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting.



Muehlemann said there is "no logical or fundamental reasons" behind
the decline in shares of Credit Suisse on Friday adding that the group
expects "reasonable" results for the third-quarter of this year.



He also repeated that the group expects a "good overall" performance
for the full year.



"We are still the share to buy," he said.



Chief Financial Officer Philip Ryan told echoed those comments and
said the group had already informed the markets that the DLJ acquisition
could impact annual results.



He labeled the misinterpretation of the remarks by a news agency as
"irresponsible journalism."



At 1121 GMT, shares of Credit Suisse were down CHF16.50, or 4.8%, at
CHF328 while the overall Swiss Market Index was down 0.4% at 7905.7 from
7933.9 at Thursday's close.

 Japan 4th Quarter Stock Outlook: Nikkei's Direction A Tough Call 

 By Yumiko Nishitani 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

 TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- The October-December quarter could be a tough call for equity strategists covering the Japanese market, given the conflicting mishmash of favorable corporate earnings prospects - at least for now - and growing concerns about the outlook for the overseas economies that Japanese exporters depend on for business. 

 In the U.S. it's come to be known as the attack of the killer E's: the weak euro, high energy prices, shaky earnings prospects and the presidential election. 

 In Japan, most analysts are relatively sanguine about the direct impact of these factors; to be sure, exporters to Europe will take a hit from the weak euro, while many manufacturers will see profit margins shrink a bit if they're unable to pass on rising energy costs to consumers. 

 But the real fear is that these factors could adversely affect the Asian and U.S. economies - Japan's two biggest export markets. 

 This potential impact from such a development was illustrated in dramatic fashion last week, after Intel Corp. (INTC) issued a profitwarning amid concerns about weakening demand for semiconductors. In the immediate aftermath, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 Selected Issues swooned, falling 492.80 points, or 3%, during Friday's session to close at 15818.25. 

 There's been no recovery since. The benchmark Nikkei index closed Wednesday at 15639.95, its lowest closing level this year. Widening concerns over U.S. corporate earnings - sparked this time by a profitwarning from Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) - were the main catalyst. 

 The recent movements on Japanese stocks markets underscore the fragile momentum of Japan's economic and corporate earnings recovery, as well as the key role that foreign investment plays in determining sentiment here - especially in rocky times. This is particularly true as Japanese companies aim to slim balance sheets by unloading heavy equity holdings, part of which are cross-held shares in business partners. 

 "U.S. investors move in favor of bonds (instead of alternative stock markets) when U.S. stock market conditions deteriorate severely. We are hoping for a scenario featuring a soft-landing in the U.S. economy and stock market, so that U.S. investors will direct investment back into Japanese stocks," said Dick Beason, strategist at UBS Warburg. 

 If clouds clear over the Asian economy and U.S. corporate earnings are solid in October-December, the impact of the steady improvement in Japanese corporate earnings should send the Nikkei to 18000-18500 by the end of the quarter. If not, the benchmark index could head towards 14000, strategists say. 

 Pegging the Nikkei's closing level at the end of December "is like trying to hit a hole-in-one when the green keeps moving around on the golf course," said Hitoshi Ichio, strategist at Commerz Securities. 

 One of the big factors in the coming three months will be domestic earnings. 

 Most Japanese companies are scheduled to report results for the first half ending Friday in November. Any revisions to earnings estimates for the six-month period are expected to be announced in October. 

 Earlier this month, the Financial Research Center of Nomura Securities Co. (J.NOM or 8604) said it expects 346 select major Japanese companies, excluding financial institutions, to report an average 137.0% on-year rise in group net profits in the current fiscal year. Nomura based the projection on a crude oil price at $25.4 per barrel and the U.S. dollar at Y107.0. Thursday, crude oil prices hovered around $29 per barrel and the dollar was quoted around Y107.50. 

 "A key concern is U.S. corporate earnings... (However,) I believe the high crude oil price situation will be resolved sooner or later... I believe the Nikkei will rise to 18500 toward the year-end on the back of firm corporate earnings," said Yuji Nakamura, senior strategist at Shinko Investment Trust Management. 

 Nakamura, as well as Beason and other bullish strategists, expect the info tech sector to be the vanguard of the market rally. That sector lost its luster after the burst last spring of what some called Japan's "Internet bubble," but IT spending remains a major force supporting capital investment here. 

 "Some companies may revise down their projections for the rate of earnings growth ahead of the half-year reporting season... However, earnings at most companies, including select info tech-related makers, will likely remain solid," Nakamura said. 

 The Intel shock highlighted falling demand for semiconductors for use in personal computers. Even so, demand for chips for use in digital products and mobile phones is likely to offset that decline, analysts said. 

 "Demand is expected to expand on the back of the launch in December of satellite-based digital broadcasting services. Those chip makers with relatively large shares of chips for high-speed networks, as well as the Internet, should especially lead the market," said Seiki Orimi, strategist at Tsubasa Securities. 

 UBS' Beason said: "Once (U.S.) Nasdaq stocks show signs of recovery, (shares of) the big five electronics makers will be a good buy." 

 On the other hand, Hajime Kitano, strategist at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Securities, expects pressure from the economic slowdown abroad to put the brakes on Japan's recovery from the fiscal year beginning April 2001. 

 "Companies will report good results for the first half (of current fiscal year). The Japanese economy will also remain positive for a half year or so. But, the global economy will eventually pressure the Japanese economy, as the Japanese economy is not independent of offshore economies," he said. 


In the October-December quarter, Kitano expects the Nikkei to head to
14000, with defensive stocks generally remaining relatively attractive.

 UAL Corp. Sees Reporting 3rd Quarter Loss

 CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- UAL Corp. (UAL), the parent of United Airlines, plagued by continuing delays and cancellations over the summer, and facing higher fuel and labor costs, expects to report a loss in the third quarter. 

 The UAL warning is a far cry from the 97-cent-a-share consensus earnings estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The profit warning Friday was a sharp drop from UAL's August guidance of third quarter earnings "below $2.60 to $3.20 a share." 

 And UAL said a fourth quarter loss is also likely. 

 A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 10 analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 63 cents a share for UAL's fourth quarter, and $6.67 a share for the fiscal year. 

 In last year's third quarter, ended Sept. 30, UAL earned $456 million, or $3.75 a share, on revenue of $4.84 billion. 

 In the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 1999, the company earned $256 million, or $1.91 a share, excluding items, on revenue of $4.48 billion. For 1999, the company earned $1.67 billion, or $10.06 a diluted share, excluding items, on revenue of $18.02 billion. 

 The company pointed to higher costs in its tentative pilot contract and higher fuel costs as a drag on profits. 

 "While we are pleased that we were able to reach a tentative agreement, the financial implications of the agreement, coupled with the higher price of jet fuel, will further impact our results," UAL said. 

 Labor problems have remained a theme for the company in recent months, with contract negotiations and disputes related to overtime ongoing with the flight attendants' union as well. 

 UAL acknowledged an "abnormally high" level of delays and cancellations throughout the peak travel season - problems that analysts have said led to a consumer backlash against the company. 

 UAL said it responded by adjusting schedules to reduce the disruptions to customers and front-line employees, which, combined with the costs of the delays themselves, also hurt profits. 

 Even the company's attempts to hedge against higher crude oil prices fell short in the quarter. Jet fuel prices rose even higher than the cost of crude, UAL said. 

 Following the airline's warning Friday, Merrill Lynch cut UAL's rating from "long-term buy" to "long-term accumulate." 

 UAL offered no specific proposals to counter the negatives it outlined Friday, but said it was "making every effort" to improve operations and restore customer confidence. 

 New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of UAL closed at $44 Thursday, down $1.31, or 2.9%.

 Dow Jones industrial average falls 173.14, closing at 10,650.92

 NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by a slumping technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety about corporate earnings. 

 The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies, including Apple and Intel, warned that their profit reports would fall short of expectations. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92, down 196.45 compared to a week ago. Friday's drop nearly wiped out the Dow's nearly 196-point gain of the day before. 

 Broader indicators also fell after rebounding Thursday. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50 to 3,672.82, down 130.49 for the week. The Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51, down 12.21 for the week. 

 ``It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. ``This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak euro.'' 

 Those issues have kept the market down for most of September. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that warn of disappointing earnings. 

 The market got a brief respite from the anxiety Thursday, but Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid some of those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75, a nearly 52 per cent loss. 

 Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell $9.29 to $46.75. Hewlett Packard was off $9.25 at $96.88. Lucent slipped $1.25 to $30.50. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56, furthering a decline that began last week when it warned of weak earnings. 

 ``We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market because the fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. ``But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated.'' 

 An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2 to $42. But many other old-economy companies appeared less affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement. 

 Procter & Gamble was unchanged at $67, retaining gains made Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart was unchanged at $5.88. 

 Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $8.29 to $65 on rumours it might the latest financial services company to be acquired. The company declined to comment. 

 Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up $1.69 at $41.44. 

 Many energy issues also rose. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to $48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at $82.31. 

 Also Friday, the Commerce Department released a report showing Americans' incomes grew by 0.4 per cent last month in addition to a 0.3 per cent gain in July. But spending rose faster, by a brisk 0.6 per cent in both July and August. 

 Advancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.41 billion shares, compared with the 1.19 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index was off 2.44 at 521.37, up 2.55 from a week ago.

 Canadian dollar hits 66.51 cents US, down two-thirds of U.S. cent in week

 TORONTO (CP) _ Need a fistful of U.S. dollars for a trip across the border this weekend? Each greenback will cost $1.50 Cdn, plus bank handling charges. 

 The Canadian dollar dropped more than two-thirds of a U.S. cent this week, closing Friday at 66.51 cents US, off 0.14 from Thursday's close. 

 That's the lowest in four months as the loonie closed at 66.43 cents US on May 30. In mid-May, it had plummeted 1.1 cents over one five-day period and closed at 66.19 on May 24 _ its lowest point in 10 months. 

 Analysts are pointing to speculators, foreign bondholders and U.S. election fever for the Canadian currency's slide. 

 But, ``truth be told, there's no particular reason for the Canadian dollar to have tumbled this week,'' says Avery Shenfeld, senior economist and currency specialist at CIBC World Markets. 

 ``It's simply a matter of fact that it's been weak for the past month or so.'' 

 The Canadian dollar, still known inaccurately as a commodity-based currency, was joined by the Australian and New Zealand dollars in declining in the last few days as base metal and oil prices weakened. 

 ``A more important question is, why has the Canadian dollar been so weak this year?'' Shenfeld said. ``That goes back largely to the fact we borrowed a lot from the rest of the world five or 10 years ago and, as those bonds mature, the foreign holders are converting the proceeds back into their home currencies _ U.S. dollars, euros or yen. 

 ``With Canadian interest rates below those in the U.S. they're not inclined to buy new Canadian bonds with the money.'' 

 In the first half of the year, Shenfeld said, there was at least a $10 billion reduction in foreign holdings of Canadian bonds. 

 On the stock markets Friday, key technology issues slumped again after a profit warning from Apple Computer. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index slipped 53.96, or 0.52 per cent, to 10,377.92 _ 1,011 points below the all-time high reached Sept 1. That's an 8.9 per cent drop since that big day. 

 Market leader Nortel Networks dropped $3.70 to $90.35 for a loss of $29.90, or 25 per cent, in September. But wireless device maker Research In Motion, boosted by investors' faith in its BlackBerry pager, leaped $24.50 to $149. 

 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92, nearly wiping out a 196-point gain of the day before. The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.5 to 3,672.82 and the Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51. 

 The western-based Canadian Venture Exchange gained 19.87 points to 3,565.25, up 19.87 points but down about 40 on the week. 

 On the loonie's decline, Shenfeld described as ``small potatoes'' the Bank of Canada's decision this week to buy an unstated quantity of euros to help prop up the European currency. But speculators did fuel the fire when the Canadian currency began to struggle. 

 ``I don't think we're going to get appreciably weaker than this, because there is no real motivating factor right now for foreigners to sell Canadian dollars,'' Shenfeld said. ``But it's going to be a while before the Canadian dollar is, by any historical standards, anything but weak.'' 

 A low dollar is a plus for exporters, but a negative for Canadians every time they buy an imported product or shop outside the country. 

 Twelve of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The oil and gas sector was the biggest gainer, up 1.93 per cent. The industrial products group, containing Nortel, was the biggest decliner, falling 2.26 per cent. 

 Advancers outnumbered decliners 583 to 507 with 302 unchanged in trading of 123.7 million shares worth $2.93 billion. The TSE 100 fell 4.32 to 646.74. 

 In New York, stocks fell sharply after Apple's earnings warning revived anxiety about corporate profits. 

 During a volatile month, stocks failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies including Apple and Intel warned that their profit reports would disappoint. 

 ``It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labour Day,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. ``This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak euro.'' 

 The market got a brief respite Thursday, but Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75 US, a nearly 52 per cent loss. 

 Gateway fell $9.04 to $47, Hewlett Packard was off $9.13 at $97, Lucent slipped $1.19 to $30.56 and chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56. 

 An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2.69 to $41.31. But many other old-economy stocks appeared less affected by the Apple announcement. Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $6.79 to $63.50 on rumours it might the latest financial services company to be acquired. 

 Among the most active CDNX companies, Qnetix Inc. rose 13 cents to 28 cents, Unique Broadband 37 cents to $3.43; Aqua-Pure Ventures fell 10 cents to 30 cents, Hilton Petroleum 10 cents to 30 cents.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by a slumping technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety about corporate earnings. 

 The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies, including Apple and Intel, warned that their profit reports would fall short of expectations. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92, down 196.45 compared to a week ago. Friday's drop nearly wiped out the Dow's nearly 196-point gain of the day before. 

 Broader indicators also fell after rebounding Thursday. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50 to 3,672.82, off 130.94 for the week. The Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51, down 12.21 for the week. 

 "It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day," said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. "This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak euro." 

 Those issues have kept the market down for most of September. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that warn of disappointing earnings. 

 The market got a brief respite from the anxiety Thursday, but Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid some of those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75, a nearly 52 percent loss. 

 Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell $9.29 to $46.75. Hewlett Packard was off $9.25 at $96.88. Lucent slipped $1.25 to $30.50. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56, furthering a decline that began last week when it warned of weak earnings. 

 "We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market because the fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. "But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated." 

 An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2 to $42. But many other old-economy companies appeared less affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement. 

 Procter & Gamble was unchanged at $67, retaining gains made Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart was unchanged at $5.88. 

 Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $8.29 to $65 on rumors it might the latest financial services company to be acquired. The company declined to comment. 

 Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up $1.69 at $41.44. 

 Many energy issues also rose. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to $48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at $82.31. 

 Also Friday, the Commerce Department released a report showing Americans' incomes grew by 0.4 percent last month in addition to a 0.3 percent gain in July. But spending rose faster, by a brisk 0.6 percent in both July and August. 

 Advancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.41 billion shares, compared with the 1.39 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index was off 2.44 at 521.37, up 2.55 from a week ago. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.77 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.51 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.48 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 0.70 percent.

 Dow Ends Off 173; Nasdaq Off 106 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell sharply today, led by a slumping technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety about corporate profits. The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies including Apple and Intel warned that their profit reports would fall short of expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92. The drop nearly wiped out the Dow's nearly 196-point gain of the day before. Broader indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 105.50 to 3,672.82. 

 Apple Shares Plunge Nearly 52 Pct. 

 SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Shares of Apple Computer today plunged $27.75 to $25.75, a nearly 52 percent loss, after its warning that earnings for the fourth quarter will fall substantially below expectations. Apple blamed slower-than-expected sales in September. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company said it expects to report revenues between $1.85 and $1.90 billion, and earnings between 30 and 33 cents per share, excluding investment gains. Analysts had predicted earnings of 45 cents a share on revenues of about $2.05 billion. 

 UAL Corp. Expects 3Q and 4Q Losses 

 CHICAGO (AP) - In a warning that sent airline stocks wobbling, UAL Corp. said today it expects to lose money in both the third and fourth quarters in the wake summer cancellations and delays. UAL stock fell $2 to $42. The corporate parent United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, blamed a loss of passengers due to months of labor- and weather-related turmoil, along with fallout from last month's costly contract with pilots and the soaring price of jet fuel. Investors punished not just UAL but other airline companies - all hit by fuel increases as well as tougher labor demands since the United pilots' settlement. 

 Personal Income Rises 

 WASHINGTON (AP) - Personal incomes in the United States rose by 0.4 percent last month, a bit more than analysts had expected, while spending rose even more - by 0.6 percent, also more than analysts had anticipated. The spending left the personal savings rate at a record monthly low since recording of such statistics began in 1959, the Commerce Department said. The rate was a negative 0.4 percent. 

 Rockwell Realigns Unit, Cuts Jobs 

 MILWAUKEE (AP) - Rockwell International Corp. is cutting 350 jobs as part of a restructuring of its electronic commerce unit. Rockwell Electronic Commerce, which is based in Wood Dale, Ill., develops technology that helps companies manage interaction with customers by telephone, fax, e-mail or the Internet. Donald J. McGrath, a company spokesman, said the unit now employs between 950 and 1,000 workers. The jobs affected will be at operations in Europe and the Asian Pacific, as well as at field offices in the United States, he said. 

 Mattel Agrees To Sell Learning Co. 

 LOS ANGELES (AP) - Mattel Inc. will shed its money-losing Learning Co. unit in a virtual giveaway that ends a disastrous foray into software publishing that toppled its former top executive and cost the world's largest toy maker hundreds of millions of dollars. Mattel, which paid $3.5 billion in stock for Learning Co. last year, will sell the unit to an affiliate of closely held Gores Technology Group in Los Angeles for rights to a share of future profits. That means no cash up front and no guarantee of money in the future, analysts said. 

 Bausch & Lomb To Cut Jobs 

 ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Bausch & Lomb Inc., which warned in August it will fall short of profit and sales projections in the third and fourth quarters, is planning a restructuring that will result in an unspecified number of layoffs. The world's largest eye-care company, which employs 12,000 people, said details of the job cuts would be disclosed along with third-quarter results on Oct. 12. Bausch & Lomb's stock price has skidded since Aug. 24 when it said its revenues for the rest of the year, excluding the acquisition in July of French pharmaceutical company Groupe Chauvin, were expected to be essentially flat or even slightly lower than in 1999. 

 Cemex Acquires Southdown for $2.6B 

 HOUSTON (AP) - Mexico's Cemex, one of the world's biggest cement companies, is acquiring cement manufacturer Southdown for about $2.6 billion. The deal announced today has been approved by the boards of both Mexico's Cemex and Southdown. Cemex is also assuming $185 million in debt. Cemex is engaged in the production, distribution, marketing and sale of cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates and clinker through operating subsidiaries on four continents. Southdown has a network of 12 cement-manufacturing plants and 45 cement distribution terminals serving U.S. states. 

 Chrysler: Target Won't Be Met 

 DETROIT (AP) - After warning its third-quarter profits would fall short of Wall Street expectations, DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler said it will not meet a $2 billion cost-cutting target this year. The automaker said 2000 profit-sharing payments for 92,000 U.S. workers will not come close to last year's record payouts that averaged $8,100. The news came a day after the German-American company warned its Chrysler unit would report a loss of about $531 million for the current quarter, in contrast to a profit of $880 million last year. 

 Euro Trouble May Split Europe 

 BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Denmark's rejection of the single European currency is more than a desire to hang on to the 125-year old krone, it's the gut fear of being swallowed up by the continent's powerhouses. More significantly, it could be the beginning of what some call a "two-speed Europe." European Union officials insisted the 53 percent to 47 percent vote in yesterday's referendum against joining the European Monetary Union wouldn't hurt the euro on foreign exchange markets - and it didn't in today's trading. But the real question wasn't money, it was the entire direction and speed of European integration. 

 Uninsured Americans on the Decline

 WASHINGTON (AP) - The number of people without health insurance decreased last year for the first time since the Census Bureau began compiling the data in 1987. Health care activists credited the strong economy. About 42.5 million people, or 15.5 percent of the population, lacked insurance for all of 1999, compared with 44.2 million, or 16.3 percent, in 1998, according to data released today. The number of uninsured children fell by 1.5 percentage points to 10 million or 13.9 percent, according to the Census Bureau's annual report on health insurance coverage in America.

 Stocks end week, month lower

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell sharply Friday, primarily on losses in the technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety about corporate profits. 

 The slump brought to an end one of the most volatile - and negative - months for the markets so far this year. Stocks struggled to stay in positive territory throughout September but most couldn't do it, as investors moved in and out of the market in search of profits. 

 Three of the key gauges used to measure the markets ended the month well below their August levels. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14, or 1.6 percent, at 10,650.92, cutting significantly into its nearly 196 point gain the day before. 

 Broader indicators were also lower after rebounding Thursday. The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50, or 2.8 percent, to 3,672.82, and the Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78, or 1.5 percent, to 1,436.51. 

 "It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day," said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. "This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak euro." 

 Those issues have kept the market down for most of September. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that warn of below-expectations earnings, creating volatility throughout the markets, but especially in the technology sector. 

 The market got a rare respite from the anxiety Thursday, turning upward on technology and blue chips issues for some of the biggest advances since early summer. But Apple's warning, which was issued after the markets closed, undid those gains. 

 The three major stock indices spent the day in negative territory, although the extent of the loss on the Dow varied. At one point during the afternoon, the Dow was off fewer than 50 points, but a fresh burst of selling in the tech sector carried it back down. 

 Apple ended the day down dlrs 27.75 at dlrs 25.75, a nearly 52 percent loss. 

 Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell dlrs 9.04 to dlrs 47. Hewlett Packard was off dlrs 9.13 at dlrs 97. Lucent slipped dlrs 1.19 to dlrs 30.56. And chipmaker Intel fell dlrs 2.88 to dlrs 41.56, furthering a decline that began last week when it warned of weak earnings. 

 "We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market because the fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. "But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated." 

 A negative earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down dlrs 2.69 to dlrs 41.31. But many old-economy companies appeared less affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement. 

 Procter and Gamble was unchanged at dlrs 67, retaining gains made Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart moved up 6 cents to dlrs 5.94. 

 Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose dlrs 6.79 to dlrs 63.50 on rumors it might the latest financial services company to be acquired. The company declined to comment. 

 Chemical maker DuPont, which was dumped by many investors earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up dlrs 1.69 at dlrs 41.44. 

 Many energy issues were also in positive territory, although the amount of their gains shrank as the day wore on. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to dlrs 48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at dlrs 82.31. 

 On Wall Street, avancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.13 billion shares, compared with the 1.19 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was off 2.44 at 521.37.

 Stocks end day, week down

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by a slumping technology sector, after an earnings warning by Apple Computer revived anxiety about corporate earnings. 

 The decline marked an end to a volatile month. Stocks tried but failed to stay in positive territory as a series of companies, including Apple and Intel, warned that their profit reports would fall short of expectations. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 173.14 at 10,650.92, down 196.45 compared to a week ago. Friday's drop nearly wiped out the Dow's nearly 196-point gain of the day before. 

 Broader indicators also fell after rebounding Thursday. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell 105.50 to 3,672.82, off 130.49 for the week. The Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 21.78 to 1,436.51, down 12.21 for the week. 

 "It's just a continuation of what we've seen since Labor Day," said John Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. "This is a combination of the concerns about third-quarter earnings reports, the implications of rising oil prices for the economy and corporate profit and the implications of the weak euro." 

 Those issues have kept the market down for most of September. Investors have been unloading stocks of companies that warn of disappointing earnings. 

 The market got a brief respite from the anxiety Thursday, but Apple's warning, issued after the market closed, undid some of those gains. Apple ended the day down $27.75 at $25.75, a nearly 52 percent loss. 

 Other technology stocks also fell. Gateway fell $9.29 to $46.75. Hewlett Packard was off $9.25 at $96.88. Lucent slipped $1.25 to $30.50. And chipmaker Intel fell $2.88 to $41.56, furthering a decline that began last week when it warned of weak earnings. 

 "We're not in a free-falling, down, bear market because the fundamentals for the U.S. economy remain superb," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at S.G. Cowen Securities. "But this is a very expensive market. We've had Intel and Apple warn and, if you owned those stocks, you got decimated." 

 An earnings warning from United Airlines sent it down $2 to $42. But many other old-economy companies appeared less affected by the turbulence created by the Apple announcement. 

 Procter & Gamble was unchanged at $67, retaining gains made Thursday on optimism about its corporate profits. Retailer Kmart was unchanged at $5.88. 

 Brokerage firm Bear Stearns rose $8.29 to $65 on rumors it might the latest financial services company to be acquired. The company declined to comment. 

 Chemical maker DuPont, dumped by many investors earlier this month after issuing its own profit warning, closed up $1.69 at $41.44. 

 Many energy issues also rose. Halliburton advanced 29 cents to $48.94. Schlumberger was up 89 cents at $82.31. 

 Also Friday, the Commerce Department released a report showing Americans' incomes grew by 0.4 percent last month in addition to a 0.3 percent gain in July. But spending rose faster, by a brisk 0.6 percent in both July and August. 

 Advancing issues were about even with decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.13 billion shares, compared with the 1.19 billion in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index was off 2.44 at 521.37, up 2.55 from a week ago. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.77 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.51 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.48 percent, and France's CAC-40 dropped 0.70 percent.

 DaimlerChrysler Warns on U.S. Unit --- Incentive Spending Cited as Factor in Third-Quarter Operating Loss 

 By Jeffrey Ball and Scott Miller 
Staff Reporters
799 words
28 September 2000

 DaimlerChrysler AG confirmed that its U.S. unit, once the envy of the U.S. auto industry for its profitability, will post a $528 million (597.7 million euros) third-quarter operating loss even as the U.S. auto market continues to boom. 

 The German-American auto maker said outsized spending on consumer incentives and new-product launches at the former Chrysler Corp. will drag down the entire company's results for the year. Operating profit for DaimlerChrysler this year, excluding one-time items, will be about $6.16 billion, the company said, well below last year's adjusted level of $10.4 billion. 

 To be sure, part of the drop in the dollar value of the operating profit reflects a weakening euro. And the company noted that its net income for 2000 will be "significantly higher than last year." But that rise in net income is largely because of one-time effects, such as proceeds from the shedding of some of the company's nonautomotive units. Given that DaimlerChrysler's other businesses, particularly its Mercedes-Benz unit, are performing well, the big question for the company will be how to improve the business at the former Chrysler as it heads into 2001. 

 The profit warning wasn't the only blow suffered by DaimlerChrysler's U.S. unit Wednesday. Thomas Gale, the veteran Chrysler design chief who oversaw the styling of such hits as the Dodge Ram pickup truck and the new PT Cruiser, confirmed he will retire at year's end. Mr. Gale's exit means the DaimlerChrysler management board will shrink to 12 members, just three of them Americans. 

 Mr. Gale said his retirement "in no way reflects the difficulties that may lie ahead" for the former Chrysler. He said he intends to stay on as a consultant to DaimlerChrysler "for another year or two" and won't work for any other auto maker during that time. 

 Although Mr. Gale's departure had been expected, it marks the latest in a line of exits by key U.S. executives since Germany's Daimler-Benz AG bought Chrysler in 1998. The departures, combined with the U.S. unit's steadily deteriorating financial results, have intensified investor concern that the former Chrysler may be losing the touch -- and the disciplined focus on profitability -- that made it so attractive to Daimler-Benz in the first place. 

 Wednesday's profit warning is the second this year from DaimlerChrysler. When it released its second-quarter results in July, the company predicted a weak second half and said operating profit this year would fall short of last year. At that time, the company announced it would slash $5.7 billion in spending world-wide over three years. But it confirmed Wednesday that its U.S. unit has redoubled its efforts to cut costs. Spending on future cars and trucks has been "recalibrated," competitive bidding among its suppliers has "substantially increased," and production of its hot-selling PT Cruiser may be increased, the company said. 

 The operating loss at the former Chrysler has been rumored for the past two weeks, sending the company's stock last Thursday to a new 52-week low of $44.125. Wednesday, after the company issued the profitwarning following a meeting of its management board, DaimlerChrysler shares rose 2.1%, or 94 cents, to $45.94 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

 Stephen Reitman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, speculated the reason for the stock's uptick Wednesday was that investors who had taken short positions on DaimlerChrysler, betting the stock would drop, were buying shares. Still, Mr. Reitman cautioned that the outlook for the company appears bleak. 

 The big reason for the depressed results at DaimlerChrysler is massive discounting by its Chrysler side, particularly on the remaining 2000-model-year versions of the company's highest-volume product, its minivan. One measure of the degree of the problem: While General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. each reduced their average per-vehicle incentive spending in August from the year-earlier period, DaimlerChrysler's U.S. unit increased that spending by 42%, according to analysts' reports based on research by Autodata Corp., an industry research firm. 

 That discounting could continue to hurt the company's results, Mr. Reitman cautioned, because it may have spurred consumers to move forward their minivan purchases, damping sales of the company's redesigned minivan, entering showrooms this fall. "The danger now is that this could shorten the time before Chrysler has to put incentives on the new minivan," Mr. Reitman said. "That is the conundrum. And there has to be a question about 2001, then."

 UPDATE 1-Crown Cork issues third earnings warning of year.

 PHILADELPHIA, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Crown Cork & Seal Inc., a leading supplier of packaging products, issued its third profit warning of the year on Thursday, saying 2000 earnings would be only about a third of what investors were expecting in January. 

 Calling 2000 one of its most difficult years in recent history, the can and plastic bottle manufacturer projected a profit of 35-40 cents per diluted share for the third quarter and an undisclosed loss for the fourth, blaming fierce price competition and rising costs for materials and crude oil. 

 The latest consensus among Wall Street analysts had called for profits of 67 cents per share in the third quarter and 21 cents in the fourth, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Crown Cork & Seal said the changes would put operating earnings at 80-90 cents per diluted share for the entire year. 

 Difficult market conditions, including the dollar's strength overseas, have forced the Philadelphia-based company into a series of earnings warnings that had already lowered Street consensus 2000 forecasts from $2.41 per share in January to $2.15 in April with the first warning and then to $1.55 in June with the second. 

 Crown Cork & Seal executives said the company could no longer absorb rising costs for raw materials, energy, freight, labour, packaging and financing and vowed to claw back margins through selected price increases in the first quarter of 2001. 

 "We're going to look at each product segment in our major markets, North America and western Europe, and will evaluate our positions in each of our marketplaces. And we're going to take the appropriate (pricing) action," President John Conway told analysts and reporters in a conference call. 

 But executives also acknowledged that implementing price increases may not be easy in the first quarter, seasonally one of its quietest. "It's going to be a little bit of a challenge," said Chief Financial Officer Alan Rutherford. 

 Crown Cork & Seal stock slipped 7/16 to a new 52-week low of $10-3/16 per share on the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement. But shares later erased their losses to trade unchanged at $10-5/8 per share, while analysts tried to evaluate the company's latest prospects. 

 "I'm surprised by the difference between what company guidance was toward the end of June and what was announced today," said Merrill Lynch analyst Andy O'Conor, who cut his 2000 and 2001 earnings estimates by a nickel a share just last week to reflect rising oil prices and further dollar strength against the euro. 

 "The company had been maintaining a kind of radio silence for a month or so, and obviously today's announcement is why they were doing that." 

 Crown Cork & Seal, which saw revenues fall below $8 billion last year, said it has been unable to overcome softness in its North American beverage and food can businesses during the summer, while European food can operations have experienced lower pricing and volumes. 

 Unit volumes in metal closures, PET-containers, and health and beauty care packaging were all projecting growth over 1999, but growth was still lower than expected due to price competition. Margins in those areas also had been hurt by higher resin costs, the company said.

 UPDATE 2-Delphi and Valeo deny they in talks.

 PARIS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Auto parts giants Delphi Automotive and Valeo denied on Thursday they were in discussions to form a trans-Atlantic car equipment powerhouse. 

 The chairmen of both companies told Reuters they had no knowledge of any talks between their firms, pouring cold water on speculation which had given a sharp boost to Valeo's ailing shares on Thursday. 

 "I am not aware of any discussions with Valeo at this time," Delphi chief J.T. Battenberg said. 

 "I have no knowledge whatsoever of any talks with Delphi," Valeo head Andre Navarri said. "These are rumours and we remain focused on profitable growth." 

 An online report by sharecast.com on Thursday, which cited banking sources, said the two car equipment giants were in advanced talks on a 10 billion pound ($14.66 billion) merger. 

 According to the report, the two sides were said to be close to reaching agreement on an all paper merger, but were awaiting approval from the French government. 

 It said a deal would involve a share swap in which Delphi would offer about 5.5 of its own shares for each Valeo share - a 15 percent premium over Valeo's current market price of 47 euros. 

 Valeo shares, which slumped to near-four year lows this week following a profit warning, ended up 4.7 percent at 49.50 euros on the merger speculation. 

 The company is viewed as vulnerable to a bid from an overseas rival following a slide in its share price that has wiped over a billion euros off its market value in less than two weeks. The weakness of the euro against the dollar has made Valeo an even more attractive target for U.S. rivals. 

 OBSTACLES TO A BID 

 Delphi chief Battenberg has said the company is looking to buy firms in Europe and on Thursday he told Reuters he could not exclude a merger between two of the world's top five auto equipment makers some time in the future. 

 But a number of obstacles stand in the way of an acquisition by one of the sector's larger firms, including potential resistance from auto manufacturers and shareholders. 

 Difficult market conditions, which have led to a series of profit warnings in the industry over the past few weeks, could also hamper such a move. 

 Nevertheless, analysts told Reuters last week that pressures on the entire sector to cut costs had created a powerful argument for consolidation and that companies such as Delphi, Visteon Corp and Japanese giant Denso could all be seen as potential bidders for Valeo. 

 One year ago speculation of a Delphi bid for Valeo mounted after Battenberg said the company was looking for a multi-billion dollar purchase that would lessen its dependence on former parent General Motors Corp. 

 Visteon, the world's number two supplier, has similarly set out to reduce its reliance on former parent Ford Motor Co, which spun the group off in June. At mid-year, Ford accounted for 86 percent of Visteon's sales. 

 Denso, the fourth largest car parts supplier in the world, also has its eyes on Europe and the cash with which to make an acquisition, although close ties with Japanese carmaker Toyota, which owns a 27 percent stake in Denso, and world number three supplier Robert Bosch GmbH, which has five percent of the Japanese group, could be impediments to a bid for Valeo. 

 The biggest hurdle to an acquisition of Valeo would likely come from the auto manufacturers, which analysts agree would have to give tacit approval to such a tie. 

 Not only could they balk at the creation of a mega-supplier that would rival many of them in size, but they would be loath to see their reliance on a single supplier increase.

 BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Fortis Bank said on Thursday it had reduced its third-quarter earnings estimate for Belgian voice recognition company Lernout & Hauspie to a net loss of $0.08 a share from a prior forecast of net profit of $0.12 a share. 

 In a research note, Fortis also said it had cut its full year 2000 estimate to $0.32 a share from $0.62 and cut its 2001 forecast to $0.83 a share from $1.18. It has also has put its investment rating under review. 

 Fortis' changes follow a profit warning issued by the company overnight on Tuesday in the United States when it said it saw a third quarter net loss before goodwill and amortisation and forecast third-quarter revenues between $165 million and $185 million. 

 Fortis, which in July had already trimmed its third quarter profit and revenue forecasts for L&H, said it cut its forecast third-quarter revenues to $179 million from $223 million. 

 Fortis also was critical of a news conference held by L&H on Wednesday. 

 "We expected more information regarding the start-ups who are developing different languages," Fortis said. 

 "At this moment, it is more important to give information to decrease the uncertainties rather than holding back information that culd be used by competitors," it said. 

 L&H shares closed down $4-= at $9-) overnight on Nasdaq, after earlier touching a three-year low of $9-7/16.

 BRUSSELS, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Shares in Lernout & Hauspie fell 15 percent on Easdaq on Thursday to an almost three-year low after the Belgian speech technology firm's stock slumped 31 percent overnight on its main Nasdaq listing, traders said. 

 By 0730 GMT, the stock was down 15 percent on the Brussels-based pan-European Easdaq exchange at a mid-price of $9.95 - levels not seen since December 1997. The stock has lost 85.9 percent since its March high of $70.50. 

 The stock lost 30 percent during Wednesday trade on the technology-rich Nasdaq exchange to end at $9-3/4, a three year low. 

 The tumble came after the company issued a warning that it would book a loss in the third quarter. This followed hot on the heels of news that the comapny faced a U.S. regulatory probe into it's past financial statements following newspaper articles suggested discrepancies in its sales figures. Ahead of Brussels trade on Thursday, Fortis Bank reduced its third-quarter earnings estimate of L&H to a loss from a profit and said it had cut its full year 2000 and 2001 estimates.

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  For our look at what else is moving on the Big Board let`s bring in Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 And Christine, I - you know, looking at the stocks I couldn`t help but notice that Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) is showing some life this morning. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, you know, financials and the drugs doing very, very well here. Bristol-Myers Squibb (URL: http://www.bms.com/) also doing well, an analysts meeting ongoing in New York today.  And you`re seeing these drug stocks doing pretty well. Financials also holding the Dow. In fact, you know, you just sort of walk away from the market for a second and come back, it`s up triple digits.  So 108 on the upside.  This is a rally that so many people have been hoping to get yesterday and were disappointed.  Now they`re saying they`re getting that bounce back from oversold conditions.  And as I said, help from the financials and the drugs.  Let`s rake a look at some of the movers here in the early going. 

 NorTel (URL: http://www.nortelnetworks.com/) is on the most actives list.  N-T is its ticker symbol.  It`s up more than two here, 61 15/16 is the level there. 

 There was actually a Sanford Bernstein downgrade to market perform from outperform due to concerns about NorTel`s ability to maintain its very fast pace of top line growth in the face of decelerating 2001 carrier demand. 

 But others are coming out and defending the stock, including Merrill Lynch, saying that they remain positive on NorTel.  And they view any kind of a pullback as a buying opportunity.  In fact, you can see the stock is up 2 5/16 from its levels, our real ticker shows from levels in after hours. Now Dole (URL: http://www.dole.com/) , D-O-L, is the ticker symbol, a profit warning there. In fact, the company saying it`s going to post a loss in the third quarter of anywhere from two cents to eight cents a share.  And a couple of common culprits there, Bill.  They`re talking about the euro and they`re talking about energy prices.  And that`s the theme, of course, we`ve been seeing playing through all of this pre-announcement season.  So D-O-L is one of those that we`re watching here.  It`s down five-eighths at 14 3/16.  And DaimlerChrysler (URL: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com) , D-C-X, we had heard about worries of an operating loss.  And the company actually warning of a Q3 shortfall there. Morgan Stanley`s Stephen Gursky (ph) said that pending more analysis, he could cut his earnings per share estimates by 15 percent.  His earnings forecast, he said, are already lower than those of the Street, which he said could reduce the consensus estimate by at least 30 percent. Instead, he believes Ford (URL: http://www.ford.com/) is best positioned among big three automakers for outperformance in this sector.  So that`s one we`re watching, D-C-X, DaimlerChrysler. 

 Back to you. 

 TUCKER:  All right, terrific, Christine, thank you, Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 SASHA SALAMA, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Amazon.com (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) has issued an apology for charging different prices for the same item.  The company will refund money to almost 7,000 customers who paid more for DVDs than the lowest price offered on its Web site.  Amazon says it was a mistake, but denies reports that it had tied discounts to customers` demographic information.  The so-called price test was first disclosed to Amazon shoppers two weeks ago in an on-line chat room.  And you see the stock is actually up more than a dollar on this news.  One stock that`s down, the biggest on the Nasdaq, Cisco (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) , after a downgrade.  And it`s also making a purchase. 

 Charles Molineaux joins us now from the Nasdaq with all the details on what`s happening there. 

 Hi, Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, hi, actually, we had a really wild - we can`t quite call it a 180 for the Nasdaq, but perhaps a 90-degree turn.  It was going nowhere, now it`s going somewhere, up by 31 points at 3,687.  Look at what this market did.  We were pretty much bouncing around and then going sideways.  And suddenly, within the past half hour, we saw an abrupt leap upward to a new session high of 3,691, go figure.  We`ve got Macromedia (URL: http://www.macromedia.com/) now up by $3, almost $4.  A five percent gain here after some nice feedback from the analysts.  Both PaineWebber and Salomon Smith Barney have started covering the company, highlighting strong growth and the growing demand for software needed for Internet design. Paine gives Macromedia an attractive rating and a price target of $94 a share, saying its main products Flash and Dreamweaver should drive performance for the rest of 2001 fiscal year.  Salomon says the company is the sweet spot of the Internet tools and Web development software area, and is starting with a buy rating. Xilinx (URL: http://www.xilinx.com/) is up by $3.38, or 4.2 percent, at $83 a share.  Chase Hambrecht & Quist is raising its rating on Xilinx from buy to strong buy.  Analysts say they are expecting its current quarter will exceed the expectations.  Paradyne (URL: http://www.paradyne.com/) , however, is crashing and burning, one of the worst performers today, down by almost $4, or 38 percent.  It provides high-speed connections for data networks.  And the company says it expects to just break even in third quarter or report a loss of as much as two cents a share.  The consensus had been for a profit 12 cents.  The company says it`s seeing a decline in shipments to its network service provider customer, and it`s taking a charge of $30 to $35 million as well.  And that one`s down.  But look at the Nasdaq, still up, now by 29 points at 3,685 - Bill, Sasha. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Charles, thank you. 

 Our next guest says the market is weighed down by concerns over the five Es, those are earnings, the euro, energy, elections, and expectations. And he doesn`t see the five Es disappearing anytime soon. 

 SALAMA:  Joining us from his offices in New York, Robert  Stovall of Prudential Securities. 

 Welcome, nice to see you. 

 ROBERT STOVALL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES:  Thank you, Sasha, thank you, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  You bet, Bob. 

 SALAMA:  September is certainly living up to its reputation here, right? 

 STOVALL:  That`s right. 

 SALAMA:  And you`re not seeing any clearing any time soon, why not? 

 STOVALL:  I see the fog lifting gradually, Sasha.  September has been a brutal month and October frequently has been a month where there`s a lot of action.  But I think the selling has been so extreme lately that we could get a pretty good fourth quarter out of this.  But I mean the five Es are still going to be buzzing around the marketplace.  But looking at last year, with a Nasdaq outperforming the S&P 500 and the Dow, we had an over 40 percent gain in the Nasdaq in the fourth quarter of last year and a big fourth quarter of 1998.  So, the quarter looks good, the next few days, maybe not. 

 TUCKER:  Let`s talk about the elections, Bob.  Not a lot of people had been willing to talk about them as a factor in the markets.  But we`re getting down to reality here.  How much of a factor are they in terms of an investment strategy? 

 STOVALL:  I think they have to be considered very seriously.  We`re having strength in the oversold drug group right now.  The drug stocks, I think, would be weak again should Mr. Gore prevail at the polls.  If Bush does, there`d be less stress on controls and regulations.  And I think things would ease up for the drugs.  And also I think it would help the besieged companies like Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) if there was a Bush victory.  On the other side of the picture there, the bond market wouldn`t like it if one party controlled both the legislative branches and the White House, that might hurt the bond market, no matter which side won, if they controlled all three.  So the elections are a major factor, in my opinion. 

 SALAMA:  Bob, for longer term investors interested in growth and fairly aggressive returns here, would you recommend technology? or stay away? 

 STOVALL:  I think you have to look at technology, Sasha, because that is where the earnings growth will be on a long-term basis.  For next two or three quarters, there will be more percentage growth numbers in the energy sector because that commodity operation is benefiting from these really high prices, but looking farther ahead I think that technology is where to be.  And as a result, it is the technology Titans that have a strong future, such as IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , and Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , and several others versus those that might be teetering around a bit because they`re overevaluated at the moment.  Some people are questioning Cisco, the number one company in that whole sector.  And others think Corning (URL: http://www.corning.com/) is up too high.  I`m not sure of that. But I believe that technology has to be in everybody`s portfolio picture. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Bob, thanks a lot for taking the time. 

 STOVALL:  My pleasure. 

 TUCKER:  Bob Stovall. 

 STOVALL:  Thanks, Bill, thanks, Sasha.

 TUCKER:  Exodus (URL: http://www.exodus.net) Communications is sticking to its game book, chapter and verse. The number-one web hosting company continues its acquisition spree with its  biggest purchase to date,  paying $6.5 billion in stock  for Global Crossing`s web  hosting arm. The two companies scuttled a  similar deal just two months  ago after Exodus backed away from what it considered to be at  the time to be too rich a  price tag. Exodus Communications is our  "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) 

 TUCKER:  Exodus has been leading companies out of  the labyrinth  of web hosting and network management since 1984. Its latest deal  to acquire Global Crossing`s web hosting unit is seen as a bid to remain the dominant player in its industry.  The stakes are huge.  Forrester Research expects server and Internet hosting services to grow a combined $18 billion by 2002. Among its 3300 customer Exodus counts  the likes of Yahoo!, General Electric and google.com. And to service its rapidly growing client base Exodus will add 14 Internet data centers this year to the 22 that it already operates worldwide. Investor have liked  the company rewarding Exodus with a $22 billion  market cap. That is huge for a company with sales last year of only $252 million. But that muscle has come in handy as Exodus continues to use its stock as currency in a string of acquisition design to grow  the business rapidly. Although its shares got crushed along with the rest of the tech sector earlier this year, Exodus stock has sprung back 83 percent after hitting a low of 26 in May. 

 (END VIDEOCLIP) 

 TUCKER:  And Exodus shares this morning are down 2 5/16 at 50 15/16. For more on Exodus, we  are joined by Fred Moran,  head of Internet media and communications for  Jefferies & Company. He joins me from Boston, Massachusetts. Welcome to "In The Money". 

 FRED MORAN, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Thank you. 

 TUCKER: My understanding is that you just got off a conference call that Exodus held. What did they  tell you? 

 MORAN: They talked  a lot about  the potential scale benefits that a merger of this size  brings. It clearly enhances their leadership position. They can sell Exodus enhanced services into the global center customer base and therefore enhance  the overall revenue opportunity while uncovering some real operating cost saving in synergies. 

 TUCKER:  Was the WorldCom deal for Digex is what really  forced this deal because as we  talked about two months they walked away and  said no, this is too much money? 

 MORAN: That`s right. Exodus` stock was quite a bit lower when they were initially taking a look at global center. They were also supposedly biding on Digex. Of course, WorldCom ended up controlling Digex with  their buy out of Intermedia Partners. So now with Exodus stock performing better and its currency being more valuable, they pay  the same absolute dollar amount but do it with  a lot less shares. 

 TUCKER: Do you rate the stock a buy? 

 MORAN: We rate Exodus a buy. We`ve had it as a long standing buy. We have a $100 price target. We think this deal enhances valuation just on a straight mathematically bases, not to mention all the potential  new business opportunities and synergies that can be uncovered in the next year. 

 TUCKER: All right, Fred. Thank you, Fred Moran with Jefferies and Company out of Boston. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 SALAMA:  ... back today, up over 1 percent.  Hewlett Packard, J.P. Morgan and P&G some of the gainers there.  The Nasdaq, for its part, bouncing off the lows today as well, up nearly 1 percent on the Nasdaq. 

 TUCKER:  In the mood, in fact, is rather upbeat.  Advancers well in control of today`s session, beating decliners by a handy margin.  Let`s check back in with Christine Romans who`s got the scoop on what the traders are talking about on the floor this morning.  Good morning again, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Bill.  Right now is that time of the day when they start to talk about lunch.  But in general, they`re talking about this triple digit rally in the Dow Jones industrial average and the fact that it`s being fueled by the drugs and the financials and that it comes on the last trading day before the end of the quarter. 

 That`s right, tomorrow`s the last trading day of the month and of the quarter.  And so, some folks are talking about the fact that we could see some volatility end of the week because the quarter end is looming, and that means portfolio reshuffling, as folks get rid of some of their losers, land a few more of their winners and altogether try to dress up their portfolios a bit.  Also, they`re saying the market feels a little bit oversold, deserves a two or three day bounce.  They thought they were going to get that yesterday and they didn`t.  They say a lot of this is pent up from yesterday`s disappointed bulls who had hoped for more than a two or three point gain on the Dow. And they`re saying there`s still that background noise buzzing around about oil markets and the euro on a stepping back to - stepping back today oil prices.  But they say that inflation relief is something that`s helping out here - the old economy, raw material cost fear.  A little bit of relief there.  And they`re also talking about the euro as well, wondering if the Danes are going to approve that measure to adopt the euro. 

 And, Bill, I got to tell you, there`s a little phrase that`s going around. Yale (ph) Hersch (ph) has this thing put together called the Stock Trader`s Almanac.  We`re heading into the last couple of trading days of September. October is notoriously known as a test-trading month. This is what it says, according to Yale Hersch, in his Stock Trader`s Almanac, "October, October, don`t show your face - 29,87,97, what a disgrace."  So, that`s -this is the end of September, the last couple of days, then we head into October, then we`ll see what happens as we head into the election year. 

 TUCKER:  Well, it`s interesting, Art Cashin, number one, we should make the note, is the best unknown poet in the business.  He`s certainly enjoyed every morning down on the floor.  The other point, though, that we should make here about October is it`s interesting, the beginning of October is always notoriously bad.  The end is somewhat better, though, because the month also has a reputation as being the bear killer on the street. 

 ROMANS:  Yeah.  Yale Hersch also says that.  He`s the guy who put together the Stock Trader`s Almanac.  He also says October can be the bear killer. There`s a really bad six months in the year.  Generally, it`s killed by that last push down in October, then people start to get a little bit more optimistic and start to buy.  There`s also this thing called tax loss season that they`re expecting to come into play here anytime now as well, Bill.  That`s when people start to sell their losers to get the benefit on their taxes by the end of the year.  And then there are also those people who lurk around trying to find those beaten down undervalued stocks and buy them up, thinking there`s going to be a rally into the new year and into February.  So, there are two sort of things this seasonality is starting to come into play as we head into the last quarter of this year. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Christine, thanks.  Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange.  And you know, Sasha, it`s always strange when you get to this point in the year that you`ve got people already talking about taxes because it`s not until April that you pay them. 

 SALAMA:  Right.  But there are bound to be more than a few tax losses out there. 

 TUCKER:  Oh, I think this year the losses will be easy to recognize. You may as well take them now and use them to offset your gains. 

 SALAMA:  Exactly. 

 SALAMA:  If you have any. 

 SALAMA:  Exactly.  And speaking of which, we`re going to speaking to Sally Hess of Franklin Templeton Investments about mutual funds and where you can find some gains out there. 

 TUCKER:  Excellent.  That`s when IN THE MONEY returns. 

 COMMERCIAL: 

 SALAMA:  Today`s mutual fundamentals segment, looking at a fund that invests mostly in companies with a market cap of over $1 billion.  It`s the Franklin Blue Chip Fund and it`s interested in companies that dominate their respective industries.  Pfizer, Merrill Lynch, Conoco, AOL and Cisco just some of the fund`s top holdings, as well as the managers favorite picks.  Sally Hess is the portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Investments.  She joins us now from San Francisco with more on her fund`s philosophy.  Welcome.  Thanks for joining us. 

 SALLY HESS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FRANKLIN TEMPLETON:  Good morning. It`s a pleasure to be here. 

 SALAMA:  So, tell us how you`ve been faring in what has been a really rough market this year.  How`s your fund doing? 

 HESS:  The fund has been doing very well.  We are outperforming the S&P 500 substantially.  Now, the fund is - has about 50 percent growth stocks, 50 percent value stocks, very similar to the S&P 500.  So, it`s very diversified.  We`re looking for the leaders in those different industries and the leaders that`ll be around for the next five and 10 years.  And so, whenever you have a time where you have market trepidation like this, those are the types of companies that tend to keep their premiums and do very well.  Over the past couple of weeks during this volatility, the Blue Chip Fund has done exceptionally well. 

 TUCKER:  It has.  And I`m curious why or how your investment philosophy differs from a lot of others because there are a lot mutual funds out there to choose from.  And someone who`s looking to put money with your fund, what would you tell them differentiates you from the others? 

 HESS:  One, I think, is the broad diversification and the fact that we`ve been able to outperform the S&P substantially.  The fairly consistently in the top 20 percentile in our lipper (ph) category, yet have one of the lowest risk profiles in that category at the same time. And that`s purely because we have such broad diversification.  Franklin uses a bottom up research driven approach.  Therefore, no matter what the market environment is you`re comfortable with your holdings.  And therefore, when you have market volatility like this, you can take advantage of that market volatility and put the money to work in the best names. 

 SALAMA:  Sally, you don`t have a whole lot of money to put to work. I`ve got to tell you, we were just looking at your cash portion, which is about 3 1/2 percent cash.  Aren`t you at all worried with this market volatility that you`re not in enough cash? 

 HESS:  No, not at all.  As a matter of fact, part of the philosophy of this fund is to stay fully invested, and that`s five percent or less in cash. 

 This fund is a large cap core product, so it is not timing the market, but I mentioned to you the broad diversification of the fund.  So when you have a time like this where you`re seeing mostly the technology industry that`s becoming under pressure, then you have under other industries doing extremely well, like energy, consumer staples.  And those sorts of positions have been doing very well in the fund.  So, although we`ve had some rockiness in the market over the past three weeks, the fund has done extremely well. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Sally, thank you.  We`ve been speaking with Sally Hash. She`s a portfolio manager of the Franklin Blue Chip Fund, joining us from San Francisco. 

 Coming up on IN THE MONEY, WorldCom says it didn`t get a fair shake in Europe.  We`ll have more on that story from London. 

 SALAMA:  And the OPEC Summit in Venezuela.  Ministers there say they`re back on track and they have a unified oil policy.  We`ll go live to Caracas. 

 COMMERCIAL: 

 TUCKER:  All right, time now to head over to the headquarters of the "Financial Times".  The newspaper`s market editor, Christopher Swan joins us with the latest on the European vote in Denmark.  Chris. 

 CHRISTOPHER SWAN, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Hi.  Well, it`s looking increasingly like the Danes are going to give a hands down to the euro. Most of the exit polls are giving a four percent lead to the no vote and that so far this has had remarkably little impact on the European currency itself.  Not entirely expected since most are assuming that if the euro does go down, then the central banks will come in and prop it up again. 

 TUCKER:  Is it expect that the no vote will have a big impact, Chris, not necessarily in Denmark but, perhaps, for votes that are lined up to happen in a couple of years? 

 SWAN:  Well, it is expect that it`ll very much reduce political pressure in Sweden and in the U.K., the EU members who`s standing aside from European military union, reduce pressure on them to sign up eventually.  And it`s certainly true that the euro skeptics in the U.K. are likely to use it as ammunition to present the euro as a failed currency and to further increase euro skepticism in the U.K. as a whole.  And I think in that case, the markets are likely to focus on the next wave of euro zone entrance who are likely to come not from the wealthy north of Europe but from the slightly poor eastern part of Europe, and that`s going to further dilute the deutsch mark. 

 TUCKER:  Chris, I also understand that we`re getting word that regulators -European regulators might be ready to move in and approve the pending merger between AOL and Time Warner.  What can you tell us about that? 

 SWAN:  Well, it`s a slightly mix bag for them in that EU regulators seem predisposed to approve the merger between Time Warner and AOL, much the bigger deal, but seem to be proposing to block the smaller deal between Time Warner and EMI Music.  The argument for this is that they`re worried that they would have a dominance of music publishing.  And also, in the future the delivery of online music, so that appears to be their concern. But it does look like the bigger of the two deals is going to go ahead. 

 TUCKER:  So, Time Warner wasn`t able to erase the concerns on EMI. There`s another big deal I have to ask you about, though, Chris, before you get away, and that is the WorldCom petition that has been filed to annul interesting use of language, to annul the decision blocking the merger with Sprint.  Apparently, this was filed not to reactivate that deal but for other reasons. 

 SWAN:  Yeah.  Well, yes, it`s certainly not going to reactivate the deal because the decision could take about two years, and that makes it pretty commercially unviable.  A more likely scenario is that they`re trying to overturn a legal judgment, which could potentially block them from making other deals.  It`s quite a litigious company and it`s known jokingly by some in Brussels as a law firm with an antennae attached to it. 

 TUCKER:  Christopher, thank you very much.  We have been speaking with Christopher Swan of the "Financial Times". 

 SALAMA:  Well, he`s known in real estate circles for his winner take all attitude.  Sam Zell has seen a lot of ups and downs in the industry. And while he expects downturns in the markets, he doesn`t think the same holds true for the once vulnerable real estate sector.  He`s the chairman of Equity Group Investments and he joins us now from Chicago. Sam Zell, thanks for joining us today. 

 SAM ZELL, CHAIRMAN, EQUITY GROUP INVESTMENTS:  Good morning. 

 SALAMA:  Good morning.  The stock markets have fared less than favorably this year.  How`s the real estate market doing? 

 ZELL:  Well, the real estate market, as expressed on the New York Stock Exchange, is probably up on average 20 percent with the liquid superior performers up almost 40 percent.  The market itself, in terms of the brick-and-mortar, is probably at the best point it`s ever been. Rents are at high levels, occupancies are very high, and cash flows are bigger than they`ve ever been. 

 TUCKER:  All of which would probably add up to make REITs look like a very appealing investment, particularly for investors who get kind of seasick every time they check stock prices. 

 ZELL:  Well, certainly the REIT stocks have been less volatile than the rest of the market this year, to say the least. 

 SALAMA:  Tell, for viewers who are not familiar with the real estate investment trust market, give us a quick primmer on what it`s all about. 

 ZELL:  Well, basically real estate investment trusts are entities that were created that allow for the pass through without corporate tax of profits as long as 95 percent is distributed.  Since 1993, a major portion of the commercial real estate market has gone from private to public in the form of these real estate investment trusts.  I think in 1993 the total equity market was $6 billion and today it`s about  $180 billion. 

 SALAMA:  Wow. 

 TUCKER:  That`s pretty - Sam, you`re now talking about finding undiscovered real estate opportunities in areas where others have not yet tread before. Can you tell us a little bit about those opportunities? 

 ZELL:  Well, the equitization of the real estate industry has created opportunities for the real estate industry to compete with scale that it`s never had before, companies like Simon Properties with 150 million square feet of retail space or equity office with 100 million square feet of office space.  Those are both scale that has never existed before.  And effectively, the whole focus of the industry has changed from development to operations and understanding how to use those networks.  When you think about the fact that I don`t know how many people that on an average week -bet you a couple hundred million people wander in and out of those malls. How do you reach them?  How do you sell them other things?  How do you use those malls to make these people aware of other opportunities and, at the same time, generate revenue for the owner of the mall?  The same thing is happening in office, high speed Internet access.  Various other kinds of services that office tenant previously might have received from outside vendors are now going to be provided to them by their landlords. 

 SALAMA:  Before we let you go, I have to ask you about a bullet point that was just put up for our viewers that you drove your Harley across Scandinavia last year.  What was that like? 

 ZELL:  Well, first of all, I don`t drive Harley`s, I drive Ducati`s. 

 SALAMA:  OK. 

 ZELL:   And there`s a massive difference between the two.  That my favorite pastime is riding my motorcycle, and we`ve ridden it all over the world. 

 We`ve done all of Scandinavia, all of Argentina, Chile, New Zealand, Nepal, France, Germany, Poland, et cetera. 

 SALAMA:  So, your Ducati is like a moving piece of real estate for you? 

 ZELL:  Yeah.  It`s commonly referred to in the industry as a crotch rocket. 

 TUCKER:  Sam, on that I`m going to leave it because I don`t want to touch the line that`s about to come out of my mouth.  Sam Zell is the - thank you very much. 

 SALAMA:  And we will be right back on IN THE MONEY right after ... 

 TUCKER:  No, no we`re not going to go away. 

 SALAMA:  Excuse me, we`re not going away. 

 TUCKER:  In fact, we`re going to go to Caracas.  We`re going to go down to Caracas, Venezuela where we have Brett Sadler standing by.  He has been attending the Summit meeting of OPEC investors down there. And, Brett, I understand that they have decided now they have a unified policy.  What can you tell us? 

 BRETT SADLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, certainly, that`s what OPEC is saying.  Actually, the heads of state and President Prenzasole (ph) behind closed doors right now.  In fact, the leaders of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, you remember Gulf War pros some 10 years ago in close proximity for the first time in 10 years.  But on the issue of unity, yes, they say they are standing firm against the pressure from industrialized nations to keep oil prices in a range between $22 and $28 a barrel.  If it drops below $22, OPEC has made it quite clear they`ll cut production.  So, yes, some very robust rhetoric coming out of this summit.  Only the second time such a summit at this level has taken place in the last 40 years, 25 years since they`ve last got together in Algeria.  So, indeed, unity, a rebirth of OPEC, according to Summit host, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. 

 TUCKER:  Brett, I`m wondering, we heard some rhetoric from various OPEC members going into this Summit meeting, basically saying to Europe and the United States, "Look, this is your problem.  Why don`t you cut your taxes if you`re concerned about prices."  A little bit combative going into the Summit meeting.  I`m wondering if we`ve heard a continuation of that from, perhaps, a softening of that rhetoric a little bit. 

 SADLER:  No, absolutely continued, robust statements, not only just about taxation.  And certainly, there`s a degree of satisfaction here among these OPEC leaders that protest against high fuel prices have been raging across Europe to Australia.  And they take great satisfaction out of the fact that those protests have been delivered to the front door of those industrialized nations. 

 SALAMA:  OK. 

 SADLER:  But, indeed, also criticism here - outright criticism of the United States for releasing those strategic reserves, which come on stream next month.  OPEC saying their 800,000 extra barrels also come on stream in October and there is no oil shortage and, they say, prices should slowly go down.  But they blame the taxation, bottleneck refineries for product high prices.  Not their fault, says OPEC.  Look at your own taxes in the western world.  That`s what they`re saying here. 

 SALAMA:  Brett Sadler, thanks so much for joining us from Caracas. 

 TUCKER:  All right, still ahead on IN THE MONEY, arrests in connection with Tuesday`s Greek ferry disaster. 

 SALAMA:  And the FDA approves that RUSALAMA:486 pill.  We`ll bring you the latest on those stories right after this break. 

 COMMERCIAL: 

 TUCKER:  All right, welcome back.  It`s time for a quick check on world and national headlines. 

 SALAMA:  And a tense situation in Jerusalem over a holy shrine. Prudence Solomon joins us now with details.  Hi. 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Sasha.  Hello, Bill. Hello, everyone. 

 The Food & Drug Administration has just approved the use of the so-called abortion pill.  Anti-abortion activists have been fighting to keep the drug out of the U.S. since it debuted in France in 1988.  The drug could be available in the U.S. in about a month. 

 In London, the parents of conjoined twins announced that they will not fight a court order by Britain`s highest court to have the girls surgically separated.  The decision means that one of the twins will die.  The doctors treating the twins won a huge victory last Friday when the court ruled that the twins should be separated in order for one of them to survive.  The parents were against the ruling for religious reasons. 

 In the Mideast, dozens of people were hurt when Israeli police clashed with Palestinian demonstrators at a prominent holy sight in Jerusalem. Palestinians began throwing stones as Israeli opposition leader, Ariel Sharon, left the holy shrine.  Israeli police responded with rubber bullets.  Sharon claims the visit was a display of peace, but Palestinian leaders don`t see it that way. 

 SPEAKER:  "It is a political visit, it`s a very violent visit and an act of aggression as we see it, but it also a direct challenge to the Palestinians, to the Arab world and to the Muslim world.  I think that Sharon, once again, is a doll in a china shop, I think is capable of doing tremendous and serious damage, and he should be stopped." 

 SOLOMON:  A religious ... 

 SPEAKER:  "The message here is a message of peace.  I believe that we can live together with the Palestinians.  I came here to the holiest place of the Jewish people in order to see what happens here and really to help the feelings that - how really to move forward." 

 SOLOMON:  The religious shrine is at the heart of the stalled Mideast peace talks. 

 The captain and four crewmembers on the Greek ferry that sank off the Island of Paros on Tuesday have been charged with manslaughter.  The passenger ferry ran aground when it struck a well-marked reef two miles from shore.  More than 65 people were killed in what`s being called Greece`s worst ferry accident since 1965.  At least one survivor of the incident has claimed that some crewmembers were watching a soccer match on television at the time of the accident. 

 Now, on the campaign trail today, Vice President Al Gore has been talking about the healthy economy.  A short while ago, he told a crowd at the Brookings Institution in Washington that his rival, George W. Bush, would squander the budget surplus. 

 AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT:  "The other side`s plan gives more in tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent, $665 billion of the surplus, than all the new money that they would invest in education, healthcare, prescription drugs and national defense combined." 

 SOLOMON:  Texas Governor George W. Bush heads to Michigan and Wisconsin today.  Bush is expected to focus on high oil prices. Yesterday, he wrapped up his swing through several western states. 

 And, of course, Bill and Sasha, the first big debate October 3rd next Tuesday between these two candidates. 

 TUCKER:  It should be - yeah, it should be very interesting.  A good headliner coming out of that.  Thanks, Pru. 

 SALAMA:  Thank you, Prudence. 

 SOLOMON:  Back to you. 

 SALAMA:  A major setback for Sony, not to mention thousands of video game addicts.  The company will ship only half a million of its highly anticipated PlayStation2`s instead of the one million it promised for the game`s console`s U.S. launch next month.  Sony plans on making up the shortfall with weekly shipments of 100,000 of the games through the holiday season.  That news already affecting the consumer price. PlayStation2 consoles have already hit well over $600 on eBay.  That`s a markup of $300 from the projected retail price. 

 TUCKER:  And the good news there, Sasha, is that there are at least 10 on eBay still available. 

 Well, U.S. treasury secretary is one of the most profitable men on the global economy, but even Lawrence Summers needs advice sometimes.  The secretary`s signature appears on all paper currency.  And Summer`s told an audience at Harvard yesterday that his mother insisted his signature appear as Lawrence, not Larry.  He just says that the young actor`s dream of seeing the name in lights, young economists do dream of seeing of seeing their name on a dollar bill, and there it was right there in the lower right hand corner.  And why not?  That would be a very cool thing.  And I don`t think that they would let me sign mine Billy Tucker.  It would probably come out as William, as a matter of fact. 

 SALAMA:  Right.  And it just go to show even the treasury secretary`s mom keeps him in line. 

 TUCKER:  He may be powerful, but his mom is more powerful.  You know, Sasha, we`ve got a nice rally under way in the markets.  We`re closing out this show with the Dow showing triple digit gains of 165 points. The Nasdaq looking stronger as well, up some 65 points, I believe. 

 SALAMA:  That`s right.  And market breadth positive for both the markets. 

 That`ll do it for this coverage on IN THE MONEY right here on CNNfn. Thanks for joining us today. 

 TUCKER:  And thanks for seeing us.  The market coverage continues straight ahead.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 SALAMA:  And I`m Sasha.

 Procter & Gamble Reduces Long-Term Target For Revenue Growth

Dow Jones Business News

 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

 CINCINNATI -(Dow Jones)- Procter & Gamble Co., which is in the midst of restructuring to battle slow growth and rising competition, expects to meet analysts' earnings estimates for its fiscal first and and second quarters but reduced its long-term revenue growth target. 

 The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial calls for the consumer-products giant to earn 88 cents a share in the company's fiscal first quarter ending this month and 93 cents a share in the fiscal second quarter ending in December. 

 The company's stock rose on relief the company didn't issue another profit warning. P&G (PG) shares were up $5.25, or 8.5%, to $67.00 at 4 p.m. EDT Thursday in the pit of the New York Stock Exchange. 

 A.G. Lafley, the company's recently named chief executive, said P&G last year "had a bad year" and is "still struggling in some core businesses;" but, he believes the company's strengths in innovation and branding should allow growth to be restored, albeit at a more modest pace. 

 For the long term, Cincinnati-based P&G reduced its revenue growth goal to 4% to 6%, excluding the impact of currency exchange, down from a previous growth target of 6% to 8%. 

 Mr. Lafley, who took over in June as president and chief executive, defended the new target as reflecting competitive pricing. Over the long haul, "setting a steady pace, based on realistic goals" is in the best interest of shareholders, he said. 

 Restoring growth is "more a matter of getting the company back in balance" rather than a need for radical change, Mr. Lafley said Thursday, reiterating a statement he has made previously. That includes making fewer acquisitions, consolidating, and channeling marketing dollars and product improvements to "big brands" such as Tide laundry detergent, Crest toothpaste and Pantene shampoo, he said. Its Iams pet food is also seen as an engine for revenue growth. 

 That investors are relieved is understandable. Procter & Gamble has issued several profit warnings in the last year that not only hurt its stock but also damaged the broader market as well as other consumer-products stocks. But that P&G expects only flat earnings in the first quarter and has reduced its long-term growth targets must be somewhat disappointing. 

 That's why Mr. Lafley and Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley came to New York to talk directly with analysts and institutional investors. Opening the meeting, Mr. Daley said, "Our objective today is to give you more confidence." 

 Over the course of two hours the executives detailed where P&G went wrong, what challenges the company currently faces, and what they see as the best business strategy to ensure double-digit earnings growth. 

 The company derives about one-half of its sales and more than half of its total profits from just 10 brands. In the last year, P&G, it's argued, took its eye off the ball as it aggressively sought and made acquisitions outside its core business areas. "In hindsight, we were trying to run a marathon at sprint speed," Mr. Lafley said during the meeting. "We were not choiceful enough on investment opportunities," 

 Now P&G aims to be more choosy. It plans, for example, to cut off 10% of research projects that don't show a lot of promise and raise the bar for those that do.

Abreast of the Market
 Priceline.com, Yahoo!, eBay Drop As Techs Fall on Growth Concern

 NEW YORK -- Worries persisted that growth prospects in high technology won't prove strong enough going forward to support the sector's valuations, resulting in another session of declines for the group.   

 Priceline.com, the Norwalk, Conn., operator of the electronic-commerce system that offers consumers discounts on groceries, airline tickets and other goods, warned that its revenue in the third quarter won't be as strong as it previously anticipated. Priceline.com fell $7.89 to $10.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, dropping to a 52-week low.   

 The attendant spillover proved painful for other names that offer consumers goods and services via the Internet. Yahoo! sank 12.06 to 90.38, while Amazon.com lost 1.88 to 37.88, and eBay shed 7.19 to 63.50, all on Nasdaq.   

 The warnings that revenues won't live up to forecasts have been a persistent and nettlesome problem for technology companies as the third quarter draws to a close.   

 "We're in an environment where margins are under increasing pressure, so it's important that companies -- especially the large-cap companies -- are able to demonstrate top-line growth," said Jon Brorson, director of equities at Northern Funds.   

 The Nasdaq Composite finished the session with a decline of 32.80, or 0.89%, ending at 3656.30; it marked the fifth straight session in which the index has posted a loss.   

 With losses persisting, and confidence in high tech eroding, it didn't take much to spark a sell-off. Shares of several optical companies, one of technology's most durable sectors this year, lost ground on speculation that a securities firm planned to share some hawkish views of the sector during a conference call that, at least according to the rumors, is scheduled for today.   

 Corning fell 17 to 305, while JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq) declined 5.31 to 97.75, and Ciena (Nasdaq) lost 4.00 to 123.13.   

 Telecommunications-equipment makers continued their retreat, as well, with Nortel Networks losing 5.13 to 59, while Lucent Technologies shed 1.75, and fell to 28.75, reaching another 52-week low.   

 Meanwhile, several of the high-technology names that, until recently, would have been regarded as core holdings for most growth investors tumbled to 52-week lows. Microsoft (Nasdaq) lost 2.06, ending at 60.63, trading below 60 intraday for the first time since May. Dell Computer (Nasdaq) lost 1.19 to 32.44.   

 The earnings jitters also contaminated stocks in sectors outside high technology. Eastman Kodak lost 2.25 to 42.25, after shedding 24% Tuesday following a profit warning.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the session almost unchanged, off 2.96, or 0.03%, at 10628.36.   

 Other technology issues, such as International Business Machines, which fell 1.63 to 117.75, also lost ground. Industrial names that some investors fear might be at risk for earnings weakness, such as Caterpillar, which eased 2.19 to 32.81, reaching a 52-week low, also weighed on the average.   

 Palm (Nasdaq) fell 6.63 to 48.88. The New York developer of hand-held computers gave back more ground than it gained Tuesday, when the stock rose 6% on an upbeat reaction to the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings.   

 APW moved ahead 6.63 to 47, reaching a 52-week high. Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on the stock of the Atlanta provider of contract-electronics manufacturing services, which reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday. The firm said the results proved stronger than expected.   

 VeriSign (Nasdaq) added 7.88 to 194.44. In a research note, Credit Suisse First Boston called the Mountain View, Calif., concern, which provides Internet-transaction security services and registers domain names, one of the Internet infrastructure stocks that should be a core holding for technology investors.   

 PSINet (Nasdaq) fell 1.03 to 8.97, dropping to a 52-week low. Analysts said investors had grown concerned that the Herndon, Va., developer of Internet-access services might not secure the $600 million in financing that it previously said it required..   

 Edison International lost 3.19 to 19.88. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown lowered its rating on the Rosemead, Calif., electric utility, amid continued concern about the level of debt the company's Southern California Edison unit has incurred.

 Companies: DaimlerChrysler In U.S. Accelerates Cost Cutting --- Move Comes Amid Concerns It Will Post Loss in Quarter

 The U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG is accelerating cost-cutting efforts amid investor worries that it's about to report its first quarterly loss since the early 1990s. 

 DaimlerChrysler's management board is expected to discuss the financial situation at a regularly scheduled meeting today in Paris, where auto industry leaders are gathering this week for the Paris auto show. Investors have sold down the auto maker's shares in recent days on speculation that the company might be forced to issue what it terms a "guidance to financial markets" -- a profit warning -- about its performance for the rest of the year, but company officials in DaimlerChrysler's Stuttgart, Germany, headquarters declined to comment on any possible such statement. 

 Top executives of the company's U.S. arm have been cloistered in meetings reviewing ways to pare spending on the subsidiary's future cars and trucks, people familiar with the talks say. Although DaimlerChrysler Chairman Juergen Schrempp announced earlier this summer that the company would slash costs globally by $5.70 billion (6.53 billion euros) over three years, the current round of talks indicates "a renewed sense" that, on the company's U.S. side, "this cost-cutting effort wasn't gaining enough traction," according to a person familiar with the discussions. "And we need to act more aggressively than we were before." 

 In their quest to cut costs, executives in the Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters of DaimlerChrysler's U.S. unit are looking far beyond travel and administrative budgets. In a series of so-called platform reviews, they are examining how they can build future vehicles less expensively. The risk: If they cut too far in their bid to trim short-term costs, they could hurt their future models, which could crimp profits for years. "You don't have the best product in the world by stripping it down," another person familiar with the talks said. 

 The intensified focus on cost cutting comes amid mounting investor concern that, despite the strong U.S. auto market, the former Chrysler Corp. will report a big third-quarter loss next month because it had to spend lavishly on incentives to lure consumers to buy the company's cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles. A Deutsche Bank analyst predicted earlier this month that discounts and costly product launches will result in a third-quarter operating loss of about $320 million at DaimlerChrysler's U.S. arm. 

 DaimlerChrysler executives conceded when they announced their second-quarter financial results this summer that the third quarter would be disappointing and that the full-year numbers wouldn't match last year's. A loss of any amount, however, would mark a massive defeat for the U.S. side of the company. Before it was bought by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, Chrysler was renowned for its ability during the mid-1990s to outearn its domestic rivals in profit per vehicle. 

 Worry about DaimlerChrysler's third-quarter results has sent the company's shares tumbling to new lows in recent days. In midafternoon trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock was down one cent at $44.55. The stock's continuing drop since January 1999, when it reached a high of about $108, has erased more than $60 billion in value. That loss amounts to more than twice the value of Chrysler before the acquisition by Daimler-Benz was announced in May 1998. 

 Daimler executives have said they anticipated cyclical ups and downs at Chrysler, particularly as the company's core minivan products headed toward replacement this year. "You had to expect something like this" given the timing of the former Chrysler's product cycle, said Dieter Zetsche, the DaimlerChrysler management-board member who oversees the company's commercial-truck business. 

 But what DaimlerChrysler managers are now calling the Chrysler Group has evidently hit some unanticipated potholes, too. U.S. executives initially cut incentive spending in May, only to watch with dismay as rivals General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. refused to follow, forcing the former Chrysler to increase incentives as the summer progressed. "We knew we were going where brave men feared to tread," a company executive in the U.S. said. "The competition didn't do that. Now we're back in the game."

 Dow Falls 177; Nasdaq Off 52

 NEW YORK, Sept. 26 -- Stocks fell sharply today after an earnings warning from Eastman Kodak triggered yet another round of selling by investors already nervous about third-quarter results. 

 The decline, the latest of many this month, quickly spread to blue-chip and technology stocks, reflecting persistent concerns that higher oil prices, the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth are hurting the bottom lines of many companies. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 176.83, to 10,631.32, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 52.12, to 3689.10. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index fell 11.82, to 1427.21. 

 Kodak, part of the Dow average, warned of disappointing profits, primarily because of rising material costs and weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency. The manufacturer of photographic products fell $14.81, to $44.19, a nearly 25 percent decline, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 With the third-quarter earnings reporting season coming up, investors have been unloading stocks whose companies warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its announcement today increased Wall Street's uneasiness about earnings. 

 "These earnings preannouncements are continuing to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel, DuPont or whoever," said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant at Dain Rauscher, who blamed Kodak for much of today's drop in the Dow. 

 "Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work right away until we get through this." 

 Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to "neutral" from "attractive" by a PaineWebber analyst. 

 Printer manufacturer Lexmark International tumbled $14.50, to $37.50, a nearly 28 percent drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock. 

 Concerns about the price of oil also pushed some old-economy retailers lower. The price of a barrel of crude is down nearly $7 from last week, but worries about its effect on corporate profits continue. 

 Discount retailer Dollar General fell $2.94, to $17, after a Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded the stock. And Wal-Mart was down $2.56 at $47.06. 

 Energy issues were higher on the expectation that oil-related companies would benefit from higher prices. Halliburton rose 90 cents, to $47.63; Exxon Mobil rose 77 cents, to $86.63; and Enron rose $1.06, to $85.50. 

 "The market is still nervous about oil," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "Even if you do get more oil to the market, it's not going to translate into lower prices at the pump right away. And higher oil prices take money out of consumers' pockets." 

 Technology stocks were more mixed. Microsoft rose $1.44, to $62.69, after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court. 

 Hand-held computer maker Palm rose $3.25, to $55.50, after it said quarterly profits would be above expectations. 

 But chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it issued a profit warning, down $2.06 at $43.31. 

 Telecom issues had a rough day, with Nortel Networks sliding $2.81, to $64, and Ericsson down 56 cents at $16.06. Motorola fell $1.44, to $29.88. 

 The market's tumble came the same day as an economic report showing that consumer confidence in the health of the economy remains steady but is at significantly lower levels than in the spring. 

 The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index now stands at 141.9, up slightly from the revised 140.8 reported in August but down considerably from the record 144.7 registered in January and May.

 U.S. stocks seen rebounding after sell-off.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Stocks were expected to have a bright start on Wednesday, recovering from a rash of profit warnings. 

 "We should start to rally back," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Weatherly Securities. "There is a belief that the market has discounted the worst case scenario when it comes to third-quarter earnings." 

 Stocks fell on Tuesday after photo film maker Eastman Kodak cut its profit outlook for the third quarter. Kodak's warning added to fears that soaring oil prices and the weakness of the euro currency will pressure U.S. corporate profits. 

 But Wall Street expect a bounce in the markets early in the session as investors returnd to buy cheapened stocks. More than an hour ahead of the open, the Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for December were up 7.00 points at 1,450.10, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures were up 46.50 points at 3,664.50. 

 "The futures look a little higher, but the question is: 'Can we go the distance?'" said Larry Wachtel, of Prudential Securities. "Lately the mood is so subdued and cautious that there is a tendency to sell into strength. All you can do is predict an oversold bounce and hope for the best." 

 In economic news the focus will be on August durable goods orders, released at 8:30 EST (1230 GMT). After two months of massive swings a moderate increase is expected. Economists forecast by Reuters predicted, on average, that durable goods sales rose 2.7 percent in August after sliding 12.4 percent in July. 

 Market watchers said August durable goods sales could give clues on the strength of U.S. consumer demand, but the volatile indicator was not likely to significantly impact trading. 

 Among issues to watch on Wednesday, the European Commission said that it had cleared plans by Dow component Boeing Co. to buy the satellite and components businesses of Hughes Electronics Corp. 

 On Tuesday, shares of Boeing closed at $66-1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, and shares of Hughes closed at $36-1/2 on the Exchange. 

 Japanese cellular-phone leader NTT DoCoMo and America Online Inc announced on Wednesday before the New York market open a deal to develop and market mobile Internet services, giving both companies' international efforts a boost. 

 Shares of AOL closed at $55.60 on the Exchange. 

 U.S. fiber-optics company Corning Inc. said early on Wednesday that it would buy Italian cable firm Pirelli's 90 percent stake in its optical components and devices business for as much as $3.6 billion, expanding Corning's reach into Europe. 

 Stock of Corning closed at $322-7/8 on the Exchange. 

 Belgium's Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV , the speech recognition software maker, said on Tuesday after the market closed its third quarter earnings and revenues would fall short of analysts' expectations. 

 Shares closed at $14 in Tuesday's Nasdaq trading. 

 Medical device maker Becton Dickinson and Co. warned on Tuesday after the market closed it will scrap programmes that boost sales to distributors, a move it said would drop fourth-quarter profits below expectations. 

 Shares finished at $24-5/16 in Tuesday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Computer networking equipment maker 3Com Corp. on Tuesday after the close reported a fiscal first-quarter operating loss that was far narrower than analyst expectations. 

 Before its earnings report on Tuesday, shares ended at $13-15/16 on the Nasdaq. 

 On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 176.83 points, or 1.64 percent, to end at 10,631.32, with Eastman Kodak accounting for almost half the drop. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 11.82 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,427.21. 

 Meanwhile, the tech-packed Nasdaq Composite Index fell 52.12 points, or 1.39 percent, to 3,689.10.

 UPDATE 2-Becton Dickinson issues 4th-quarter  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Becton Dickinson and Co. on Tuesday warned that fourth-quarter profits will miss forecasts because it is eliminating most of its discount promotions to distributors, part of a global restructuring that will cut 4 percent of its workforce. 

 The U.S. medical device maker said in an announcement after the market close that it expects to earn 39 cents a share, excluding the restructuring charges, gains, and taxes. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting the company to earn 46 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Under the restructuring, the company will cut 1,000 of 24,000 jobs worldwide in fiscal 2001, mostly administrative and service positions. That reduction, plus costs related to litigation, are expected to result in a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. 

 The Franklin Lakes, N.J. firm said by ceasing, for the most part, its practice of offering promotions, or "incentive programmes," to distributors it will curb spending and ease supply chain disruptions. Such programmes involve offering big discounts to encourage distributors to place larger orders of products. 

 While helping sales, those big orders can hurt a company by spiking up demand suddenly, resulting in unpredictable supply flow and increased labour costs as employees deal with the onslaught of orders. 

 The company disappointed investors in late July by reporting third-quarter operational results that failed to meet expectations. While earnings rose to $114.4 million, or 43 cents a share, for the period ended June 30, those results matched Wall Street estimates only with the help of a gain from an asset sale. 

 In a conference call after Tuesday's announcement, company management defended its actions. 

 "The biggest mistake we could have made is to wait and do this over time. You have to pull the band-aid off really quickly so it doesn't hurt as much and you are done with it," and President and Chief Executive Officer Edward Ludwig. 

 Management also called "reasonable" forecasts of sales growth of 7 percent in 2001 and earnings per share growth of 10 percent to $1.64. 

 Shares finished down about 11/16 at 24-5/16 in Tuesday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday as trading with little conviction eventually succumbed to September's prevailing theme of doubts about the ability of Corporate America to grow earnings at a rate that will satisfy investors. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a nominal loss of 2.96 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,628.36, according to the latest figures. 

 Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index - weighed by declines in computer hardware and Internet names - dropped 32.80 points, or 0.89 percent, to close at 3,656.30. 

 The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index fell just 0.64 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to 1,426.57. 

 "It's a real directionless market. People are worried about more earnings surprises ... Yesterday we had Kodak," said Edgar Peters, chief investment strategist at Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management. 

 "People are selling into the strength whenever it shows up," he said, echoing other analysts' views that investors fear that the high oil prices and the weak euro will pressure corporate profits for many multinationals. 

 Tuesday's stock market was pounded after Kodak warned quarterly results would fall short of previous expectations. 

 Kodak, a global marketing giant and one of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial average, lost 25 percent of its market value on the profit warning - news that spread far and wide in its impact on stock markets around the world. The selling continued Wednesday for the photography giant, the No. 1 U.S. maker of photo film. Kodak stock closed with a loss of $1-13/16 at $42-9/16. 

 Earlier in the trading day, Kodak dropped to $39-3/4, a level unseen since May 1993. 

 Internet stocks were viewed in a bad light when Priceline.com Inc. said third-quarter revenues would come in below Wall Street expectations. 

 Priceline share were hammered, ending with a $7-57/64 decline, or 42.33 percent, at $10-3/4. Yahoo! Inc. dropped in sympathy, ending the regular trading day at $90-3/8, off $12-1/16, or nearly 12 percent.

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Technology stocks scrambled higher in early morning trading on Wednesday, while blue chips fluttered around break-even amid a second straight day of weakness in the shares of film giant Eastman Kodak Co. 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC) surged 40.18 points, or 1.09 percent, at 3,729.28. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) edged up 4.44 points, or 0.04 percent, at 10,635.76. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) rose 4.7 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,431.91. 

 "Lately the mood is so subdued and cautious that there is a tendency to sell into strength," said Larry Wachtel of Prudential Securities. "All you can do is predict an oversold bounce and hope for the best." 

 Stocks were pummeled on Tuesday by a gloomy profit outlook from Kodak. The company's warning added to fears that soaring oil prices and the weakness of the euro currency will pressure U.S. corporate profits. 

 Kodak lost another $3-3/8 at $41 in heavy trading. The stock has tumbled roughly 30 percent since Tuesday's earning warning. 

 Meanwhile, 3Com Corp. late Tuesday posted a quarterly operating loss that was far narrower than analysts' expectations. 3Com ranked near the top of the Nasdaq's most actively traded list and gained more than 20 percent, up $3-1/16 to $17. 

 Big-name technology companies followed suit. The Nasdaq 100 index .NDX) bounced 0.76 percent higher. Networking equipment giant Cisco Systems Inc. gained $1-9/16 to $56-3/4. Sun Microsystems Inc., the biggest maker of computers that serve up Web pages, added $2-3/8 to $119-7/8. Wireless telephone technology company Qualcomm Inc. gained $1-5/8 at $75. 

 Dow components Hewlett Packard Co. rose $2-3/8 to $100-5/8, International Business Machines Corp. edged 1/16 higher to $119-3/8 and Intel Corp. rose $1-1/2 to $44-13/16. 

 Dow component Microsoft Corp. surrendered some of Tuesday's gains, sliding $1-1/16 to $61-5/8. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Microsoft, agreeing with the software giant that its appeal of antitrust violations should first be heard by a lower appellate court. 

 Priceline.com Inc. hit a sour note with investors after the Internet company, which sells everything from airline tickets to cars, said quarterly revenues would fall short of Wall Street forecasts. The stock plunged more than 40 percent to $11, a loss of $7-41/64.

Options Report
 Traders Grow Nervous as Kodak's Warning Highlights the Approaching Earnings Season

 NEW YORK -- Earnings worries hung over the options market yesterday. 

 The trigger was a profit warning from Eastman Kodak Co., which told investors that September sales have been weaker-than-expected and that third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations. 

 Kodak shares sank 25% on the news. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Kodak was at $44.13, down $14.88. Options traders appeared to grow more skittish, as the option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index, or VIX, rose 0.68 to 25.08. 

 The Kodak news highlights what is likely to remain at the forefront of investor concerns, the coming third-quarter earnings season. Investors also will have to contend with the uncertainty caused by the November presidential elections. "It's a double whammy," said Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at CIBC World Markets. 

 Among the options contracts that attracted attention yesterday were Micron Technology Inc.'s October 70 calls. With open interest at 16,085 contracts, more than 10,000 of these calls traded at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. A call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy stock for a fixed price by a set time, while a put option confers a similar right to sell stock. 

 Mr. Schwartz said the activity may have been from an options player buying back call options previously written and sold against a long position in Micron stock. Judging from historical options-trading data, Mr. Schwartz said, the investor may have sold the calls Aug. 8, when Micron shares were trading at $76.88. 

 But the stock has fallen since then. In 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday, Micron was at $49.63, up $2.56, or 5%. By buying the options back, Mr. Schwartz said, the investor was able to offset part of the decline, as the call's price has fallen too.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks churned Wednesday, weakened by anxiety that third-quarter earnings will fall short of market expectations. But bargain-hunting among some technology stocks helped to support the Nasdaq Composite Index. 

 Bonds declined. The 10-year Treasury note fell more than 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 holding, pushing the yield up to 5.83%. The 30-year bond was down nearly 3/4, yielding 5.90%. 

 The dollar was mixed. It traded at 88.12 cents to the euro and 107.45 yen to the dollar, compared with 88.28 cents to the euro and 107.59 yen to the dollar late Tuesday in New York. 

 At noon EDT, the Nasdaq composite was up 20.30 at 3709.40 -- pulling back after an early surge of more than 60 points -- following Tuesday's 52.12-point loss. But the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14 points at 10617, after losing 176.83 in the previous session. 

 Investors were rattled after Priceline.com, the name-your-price online auctioneer, warned that third-quarter revenue will fall short of analysts' estimates because of weak sales of airline tickets. Its shares plunged $8.81, or 44%, to $10.44 in response. 

 The warning shook the Internet sector, sending shares of Amazon.com, eBay, Yahoo! and America Online broadly lower. 

 Kodak, whose profit warning sent the market tumbling Tuesday, fell another $3.88 to $40.63, extending Tuesday's 25% decline. Fellow Dow industrial components Boeing and Honeywell also fell. 

 But an earnings surprise from computer-networking company 3Com pushed its shares up $3.06, or 22%, to $17. 3Com posted a narrower-than-expected loss for its fiscal first quarter late Tuesday. 

 The news enticed investors to return to some technology stocks, such Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems, while Intel led the chip sector higher.

 DaimlerChrysler warned that its Chrysler operations will post a third-quarter operating loss and said the parent company's profit for the full year will be "clearly harmed" by its North American operations. 

 DaimlerChrysler said Chrysler will show an operating loss of around 600 million euros ($529.7 million). Full-year operating profit for the parent company, excluding one-time items, will drop 30% to seven billion euros from 10 billion euros last year, DaimlerChrysler said. Including one-time items, however, the German-American auto maker said its profit and earnings per share will be "significantly higher" than the previous year. 

 DaimlerChrysler blamed the earnings woes at its Chrysler operations on higher interest rates, rising oil prices and development costs for new models. Analysts, however, have noted that the U.S. unit had to spend lavishly on incentives to lure consumers to buy its cars, minivans and sport-utility vehicles.

 News Corp. and AT&T's Liberty Media Group said they have negotiated a series of deals that will make Liberty's John Malone one of News Corp.'s largest shareholders and give News Corp. control of Gemstar-TV Guide International. 

 The deal gives News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch a larger chunk of Gemstar stock, which he will contribute to Sky Global Networks, the new company being formed by News Corp. to hold all its satellite assets. The contribution of Gemstar shares would increase the valuation of Sky Global, which also would give it more financial strength in its contemplated bid for satellite broadcaster DirectTV, now owned by General Motors' Hughes Electronics unit.

STUTTGART, Germany (Dow Jones)--DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX) posted a
profit warning for its 2000 earnings, saying profits would be "clearly
harmed" by its North American operations.



The German-U.S. car giant said its Chrysler operations will post an
operating loss of around EUR600 million in the third quarter, damped by
higher interest rates, rising oil prices and development costs for new
models.
- - 27/09/00 13-11G



In a statement Wednesday, DaimlerChrysler said its full-year group
operating profit will slip to EUR7 billion from EUR10 billion last year,
both adjusted for one-off items.



Including one-off effects, net profit and earnings per share will be
"significantly higher" than a year ago, DaimlerChrysler said.



It's Chrysler operations are expected to swing back to profit in the
fourth quarter.



For the full year, the Chrysler division will post a profit of over
EUR2 billion, DaimlerChrysler said.
- - 27/09/00 13-26G



Despite the profit warning, DaimlerChrysler shares were up over 5.4%
at EUR54.22 around 1335 GMT. Analysts said the rise was due to the fact
that shares were already trading at their low for the year, and the news
about its full-year profits provided clarity to the markets.



"It can't get any worse, so this could be a floor," a trader at BfG
Bank in Frankfurt said.



DaimlerChrysler has been plagued by difficulties at its North American
operations for months.



"The market situation in North America will have a significant impact
on the company's results, as already indicated in the half-year report,"
DaimlerChrysler said.



Looking ahead, Chrysler expects the launch of new models to help cut
sales and marketing costs, DaimlerChrysler said. Sales volume from newly
launched cars in 2000 and models planned for the next years are seen
improving earnings and competitiveness, it added.



At the same time, Mercedes-Benz passenger cars are expected to post
record figures for sales, revenue and earnings in 2000, the statement
said. The company's commercial vehicles division will also post higher
earnings in 2000, "despite the difficult market situation in North
America," DaimlerChrysler said.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Worries persisted that growth prospects in high technology won't prove strong enough going forward to support the sector's valuations, resulting in another session of declines for the group. 

 Some companies flat-out acknowledged the disappointments. Priceline.com, the Norwalk, Conn., operator of the electronic commerce system that offers consumers discounts on groceries, airline tickets and other goods, warned that its revenue in the third quarter won't be as strong as it previously anticipated. Priceline.com finished $7.89 lower at $10.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, dropping to a 52-week low. 

 The attendant spillover proved painful for other names that offer consumers goods and services via the Internet. Shares of Yahoo! sank 12.06 to 90.38, while Amazon.com lost 1.88 to 37.88, and eBay shed 7.19 to 63.50, all on Nasdaq. 

 The warnings that revenues won't live up to forecasts has been a persistent and nettlesome problem for technology companies as the third quarter draws to a close, market watchers said. 

 "We're in an environment where margins are under increasing pressure, so it's important that companies - especially the large-cap companies - are able to demonstrate topline growth," Jon Brorson, direction of equities at Northern Funds. Unfortunately, Brorson added, companies are finding that revenue growth difficult to come by. 

 The Nasdaq Composite finished the session with a decline of 32.78, or 0.89%, ending at 3656.32; it marked the fifth straight session in which the index has posted a loss. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10628.36, down 2.96. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,506 issues advancing, 1,343 declining and 471 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,161,651,650 shares, compared with 1,096,912,830 Tuesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 656.05, up 1.22. The average price per share rose 7 cents. 

 With losses persisting, and confidence in high-tech eroding, it didn't take much to spark a sell-off. Shares of several optical companies, one of technology's most durable sectors this year, lost ground on speculation that a securities firm planned to share some hawkish views of the sector during a conference call that, at least according to the rumors, is slated for Thursday. 

 Shares of Corning fell 15.56 to 307.31 on the NYSE, while JDS Uniphase declined 5.31 to 97.75 on Nasdaq, and Ciena lost 4 to 123.13, also on Nasdaq. 

 Telecommunications equipment makers continued their retreat, as well, with Nortel Networks losing 4.56 to 59.44, while Lucent Technologies shed 1.63, and fell to 28.75, reaching another 52-week low. 

 Meanwhile, several of the high-technology names that, until recently, would have been regarded as core holdings for most growth investors tumbled to 52-week lows. Shares of Microsoft lost 2.06, ending at 60.63, trading below 60 intraday for the first time since May. Dell Computer lost 1.19 to 32.44 on Nasdaq. 

 The earnings jitters also contaminated stocks in sectors outside high technology. Shares of Eastman Kodak lost 1.81 to 42.56, after shedding 24% Tuesday after a profit warning. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the session almost unchanged, off 2.96, or 0.03%, at 10628.36. Technology issues, such as Microsoft and International Business Machines, which fell 1.31 to 118, lost ground. Industrial names that some investors fear might be at risk for earnings weakness, such as Caterpillar, which eased 2.19 to 32.81, reaching a 52-week low, also weighed on the average. 

 VerticalNet climbed 2.38 to 32.63 on Nasdaq, after Lehman Brothers stepped up to defend the stock of the Horsham, Pa., operator of electronic commerce exchanges, which has fallen sharply in recent trading. The firm said concerns about the revenue prospects of the company's semiconductor-sales exchange have been overblown, and called the price, after a recent sell-off, a significant buying opportunity. 

 Palm fell 6.63 to 48.88 on Nasdaq. The New York developer of handheld computers gave back more ground than it gained Tuesday, when the stock rose 6% on an upbeat reaction to the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings. 

 APW moved ahead 6.63 to 47, reaching a 52-week high. Credit Suisse First Boston raised its rating on the stock of the Atlanta provider of contract electronics manufacturing services, which reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results late Tuesday. The firm said the results proved stronger than expected. 

 VeriSign added 7.88 to 194.44 on Nasdaq. In a research note, Credit Suisse First Boston called the Mountain View, Calif., concern, which provides Internet transaction security services and registers domain names, one of the Internet infrastructure stocks that should be a core holding for technology investors. 

 PSINet fell 1.03 to 8.97 on Nasdaq, dropping to a 52-week low. Analysts said investors had grown concerned that the Herndon, Va., developer of Internet access services might not secure the $600 million in financing that it previously said it required. 

 Silicon Storage Technology moved forward 1.73 to 27.75 on Nasdaq. The Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of computer memory products issued an upbeat profit forecast, saying it expected to beat Wall Street's earnings targets. 

 3Com added 3.06 to 17 on Nasdaq. The Santa Clara, Calif., telecommunications network products maker reported fiscal first-quarter results late Tuesday that showed a narrower loss than analysts had anticipated. 

 Oil stocks rose again, with Chevron gaining 2.13 to 85.44, while Exxon Mobil added 2.50 to 89.25, and Amerada Hess increased 1.69 to 66.75. Oil ministers meeting at a summit in Caracas reiterated promises to get oil prices to move back below $28 a barrel. 

 Becton Dickinson managed to post a gain, rising 2.06 to 26.38. The Franklin Lakes, N.J., maker of medical supplies and diagnostic products announced plans for a restructuring that earned plaudits on Wall Street. Bear Stearns and Morgan Stanley raised ratings on the stock. 

 Laboratory Corp. of America moved ahead 11.69 to 122. Credit Suisse First Boston reiterated its strong buy recommendation on shares of the Burlington, N.C., diagnostic laboratory concern, saying that recent worries about a slowdown in the sector don't accurately reflect current conditions. 

 Shares of rival Quest Diagnostics, based in Teterboro, N.J., also moved higher in the session, gaining 7.75 to 118.88. 

 Boeing pulled back, easing 1.56 to 64.56, after the Seattle aircraft maker pushed out to an all-time high Tuesday of 66.93. Lehman Brothers, in a research note, said good news from the company has carried the stock above expectations. 

 News Corp.'s American depositary receipts added 2.63 to 56.38, after the global media giant struck an agreement with AT&T's Liberty Media Group that will make Liberty's John Malone one of News' largest shareholders, and give News control of Gemstar-TV Guide, a provider of programming guides and publisher of TV Guide magazine. 

 Liberty added 88 cents to 19, while AT&T eased 31 cents to 27.50, and Gemstar climbed 4.38 to 72.94 on Nasdaq. 

 Edison International lost 3.19 to 19.88. Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown lowered its rating on the Rosemead, Calif., electric utility, amid continued concern about the level of debt the company's Southern California Edison unit has incurred.

 Extent of DaimlerChrysler Shortfall Surprises

 DETROIT -(Dow Jones)- It appears the heat has been turned up another notch for auto giant DaimlerChrysler AG (DCX). 

 After coming under fire for a sagging stock price and an exodus of high ranking executives, DaimlerChrysler announced yet another blow Wednesday when it said its Chrysler arm would post an operating loss of $528 million in the third quarter. 

 DaimlerChrysler already gave a rather bleak outlook for the second half when it said in July that new vehicle launches were likely to take a bite out of operating profits in the third quarter. Still, analysts were shocked at the extent of the loss. 

 "This was bigger than I expected," said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities. "I thought they would lose EUR200 million to EUR300 million ($176 million to $244 million) instead of EUR600 million ($528 million)." 

 A Deutsche Bank analyst also predicted earlier this month that discounts and costly new-product launches would result in an operating loss of about $320 million at DaimlerChrysler's U.S. arm. 

 A loss is rather significant for the Chrysler unit given that in the mid-1990s, before its 1998 marriage with Daimler-Benz AG, Chrysler was known for its ability to outearn its competitors in profits per vehicle. In fact, the former Chrysler hasn't reported a quarterly loss since 1991, when it posted an $82 million shortfall in the third quarter, which came during a recession. Given the robust state of today's economy, it's much harder to justify an operating loss. 

 Chrysler blames the shortfall on expensive product launches, such as the remodeled Chrysler minivan, and rebates to clear out older-model vehicles. 

 The company has said it will launch no less than three new models in the next five months, including the Voyager minivan. 

 To compound the situation, the company has also been saddled with higher oil prices and rising interest rates, problems many automotive-related companies have faced. In addition, analysts say there's increasing competition in the North American market, as imports gain market share. 

 Still, other domestic auto makers aren't expected to announce such surprises. Ford Motor Co. (F) spokeswoman Karen Hampton said the company is comfortable with earnings estimates despite the Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. tire recall. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expect Ford to earn 50 cents per share in the third quarter. 

 General Motors Corp. (GM) officials wouldn't comment about meeting First Call numbers, but said the company was not expecting to issue a profit warning. 

 Healy predicts GM's earnings will be $1.59 in the third quarter compared with $1.33 in the same period last year. That's mostly attributed to the company's stock repurchase plan, he said. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial expect GM to earn $1.59 in the third quarter. 

 So What's the Likelihood of a DaimlerChrysler Comeback? 

 Analysts don't dispute DaimlerChrysler's claim that third quarter earnings were hurt by product launches and rebates. In fact, those factors, much more than oil and interest rates, were responsible for the shortfall. 

 But they do argue that DaimlerChrysler's profit woes won't end in the third quarter and that it may take several quarters before the company sees a year-over-year improvement in earnings. 

 DaimlerChrysler expects its Chrysler arm to make money in the fourth quarter and it expects vehicle sales to be on target for the year. A Chrysler spokesman said he expects the company to sell 2.64 million vehicles this year. 

 DaimlerChrysler also says it has mapped out a set of initiatives to boost earnings. This includes looking to suppliers to take waste out of the supply chain and cutting costs across the board. 

 The company outlined in July a three-year plan to cut administrative costs by 25%, which includes non-labor related and labor related decreases. 

 But analysts still expect fourth quarter earnings to be well below last year. 

 Healy predicts the company will make $1.14 in the fourth quarter compared with $1.60 in the fourth quarter of 1999. 

 "I still see them having rebates in the fourth quarter because the old models are not fully cleared out," Healy said. 

 And that's not to mention the expected decline in vehicle sales for the North American market and the increasing competition from the imports. 

 "Everyone's going to be hurt by rising competition, which drives incentives up and puts pressure on margins," said Efraim Levy, an auto analyst with S&P Equity Group. 

 Some analysts expect annual unit sales to drop to around 15.5 million in 2002 from the current 17 million for the entire market. 

 On the bright side, DaimlerChrysler's stock may rally in light of the latest disappointment. Concerns about a profit warnings have driven shares down in recent weeks and analysts say the news may drive the stock up. 

 "I don't see a whole lot of downside because people now know the extent of the loss," Levy said.

 STOCKS FALL SHARPLY ON KODAK EARNINGS WARNING

 NEW YORK - Stocks fell sharply Tuesday after an earnings warnings from Eastman Kodak triggered yet another round of selling by investors already nervous about third-quarter results. 

 The decline, the latest of many this month, quickly spread to blue chip and technology stocks, reflecting persistent concerns that higher oil prices, the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth are hurting the bottom lines of many companies. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 176.83 to 10,631.32. 

 Broader indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite was down 52.12 at 3,689.10 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index slipped 11.82 to 1,427.21. 

 Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, primarily because of rising material costs and weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency. The photographic products manufacturer fell $14.81 to $44.19, a nearly 25 percent decline, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 With the third-quarter earnings reporting season coming up, investors have been unloading stocks whose companies warn of lower- than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about earnings. 

 "These earnings preannouncements are continuing to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel, DuPont or whoever," said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant at Dain Rauscher, who blamed Kodak for much of Tuesday's drop in the Dow. 

 "Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work right away until we get through this." 

 Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to "neutral" from "attractive" by a PaineWebber analyst. 

 Printer manufacturer Lexmark International tumbled $14.50 to $37.50, a nearly 28 percent drop, after the company warned of lower- than-expected third-quarter earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock. 

 Concerns about the price of oil also pushed some old-economy retailers lower. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.50, down nearly $7 from last week, but worries about its effect on corporate profits continue. 

 Discount retailer Dollar General fell $2.94 to $17 after a Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded the stock. And Wal-Mart was down $2.56 at $47.06. Energy issues were higher on the expectation that oil- related companies would benefit from higher prices. Halliburton was up 90 cents at $47.63; Exxon Mobil gained 77 cents to $86.63; and Enron rose $1.06 to $85.50. 

 "The market is still nervous about oil," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "Even if you do get more oil to the market, it's not going to translate into lower prices at the pump right away. And higher oil prices take money out of consumer's pockets." 

 Technology stocks were more mixed. Microsoft rose $1.44 to $62.69 after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm rose $3.25 to $55.50 after it said quarterly profits would be above expectations. 

 But chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it issued a profit warning, down $2.06 at $43.31. 

 Telecom issues had a rough day, with Nortel Networks sliding $2.81 to $64 and Ericsson down 56 cents at $16.06. Motorola fell $1.44 to $29.88.

Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange.

Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to "neutral" from "attractive" by a PaineWebber analyst.

Printer manufacturer Lexmark International tumbled $14.50 to $37.50, a nearly 28 percent drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings, and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock.

Concerns about the price of oil also pushed some old-economy retailers lower. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.50, down nearly $7 from last week, and worries about its effect on corporate profits continue.

Discount retailer Dollar General fell $2.94 to $17 after a Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded the stock. And Wal-Mart was down $2.56 at $47.06.

Energy issues were higher on the expectation that oil-related companies would benefit from higher prices. Halliburton was up 90 cents at $47.63; Exxon Mobil gained 77 cents to $86.63; and Enron rose $1.06 to $85.50.

"The market is still nervous about oil," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "Even if you do get more oil to the market, it's not going to translate into lower prices at the pump right away. And higher oil prices take money out of consumer's pockets."

Technology stocks were more mixed. Microsoft rose $1.44 to $62.69 after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court.

Handheld computer maker Palm rose $3.25 to $55.50 after it said quarterly profits would be above expectations.

But chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it issued a profit warning, down $2.06 at $43.31.

Telecom issues had a rough day, with Nortel Networks sliding $2.81 to $64 and Ericsson down 56 cents at $16.06. Motorola fell $1.44 to $29.88.

The market's tumble came the same day as an economic report which showed consumer confidence in the health of the economy remains steady, but is at significantly lower levels than last spring.

The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.9, up slightly from the revised 140.8 reported in August but down considerably from the record 144.7 registered in January and May.

Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE. Consolidated volume came to 131.68 billion shares, well ahead of the 1.18 billion in the previous session.

The Russell 2000 index fell 5.49 to 509.89.

The price of a 30-year treasury bond was up 21/32 point, or $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. The yield was down to 5.85 percent late Tuesday from 5.89 percent Monday.

In Mexico, the bolsa was down 74.43, or 1.14 percent, to 6,459.15. Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.40 percent. Germany's DAX index was down 0.35 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.70 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 0.67 percent.

In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 107.64 yen, down from 107.76 yen. It was quoted at 9.407 pesos, up from 9.405 pesos. The peso's value was 10.6304 cents, down from 10.6326 cents. The euro was quoted at 88.27 cents, up from 87.30 cents.

 NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks fell sharply after an earning warnings from Eastman Kodak spooked investors who were already nervous about third-quarter results.   

 The sell-off -- the latest of many this month -- quickly spread to blue-chip shares and technology stocks, reflecting persistent concerns that higher oil prices, the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth are hurting the bottom lines of many companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 175.82 points to 10632.33.   

 Kodak warned investors of disappointing profits, saying its business has been hurt by rising material costs, weakness in the euro, and other factors. The photographic products manufacturer fell to $44.38 (50.85 euros), a decline of 25% or $14.63, on the New York Stock Exchange.   

 The Dow Jones Industrials are "down because we got a warnings announcement from Eastman Kodak. In fact, that may be responsible for the whole move in the Dow," said Bill Barker, an investment-srategy consultant at Dain Rauscher. "These earnings preannouncements are continuing to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel, DuPont or whoever," he said.   

 "Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work right away until we get through this," he said.   

 With the third-quarter earnings reporting season coming up, the market has been unloading stocks whose companies even warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its announcement increased Wall Street's uneasiness about earnings.   

 Kodak also fell because its rating was cut to "neutral" from "attractive" by a PaineWebber analyst.   

 Printer manufacturer Lexmark International tumbled 28%, or $14.56, to $37.44 after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock.   

 Concerns about the price of oil also pushed some Old Economy retailers lower. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.53, down nearly $7 from last week, but worries about its effect on corporate profits continue.   

 Discount retailer Dollar General fell $2.94 to $17 after a Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded the stock. Wal-Mart fell $2.64 at $47.   

 Energy issues were higher. Halliburton gained $1.02 at $47.75, while Exxon Mobil climbed $1.46 to $87.31 and Enron rose $1.38 to $85.81.   

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 51.34 points, or 1.4%, to 3689.88. Microsoft rose $1.44 to $62.69 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court.

 Guess'  Profit Warning  Unravels Its Stock, Snags Other Clothing Firms Apparel: Company says third quarter will be unexpectedly lackluster, heightening fears that consumer spending is slowing.

 Investors wiped out half of Guess Inc.'s stock market value in a single session Tuesday after the maker of trendy clothes and accessories warned of unexpectedly low third-quarter earnings and said its fourth-quarter results might trail forecasts as well. 

 Shares of other specialty apparel makers and retailers were hammered, as Guess' disclosure heightened fears that consumers' spending on apparel--especially fashionable, trendy clothes--is slowing. 

 The sell-off occurred after Guess' announcement late Monday, in which Guess blamed fierce competition and "the generally difficult retail environment" for its shortfall. The worst casualties were the Marciano brothers--Maurice, Paul and Armand--who control and run Los Angeles-based Guess. 

 Collectively, they controlled 35.5 million, or 82%, of Guess' common shares outstanding as of the company's most recent proxy statement, and Tuesday's rout erased $353 million from their combined holdings. Their stake is now valued at about $351 million. 

 The brothers' overwhelming control of the stock means there are relatively few shares trading publicly, which tends to exacerbate a price swing either way. The stock plunged $9.94 a share to close at $9.88 in heavy composite trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Guess peaked March 31 at $32 a share. 

 Indeed, the shares--which rallied strongly in 1999 and early this year on the strength of Guess' improved results--already had come under pressure this summer because of investors' growing concern that there might be a drop in consumers' purchases of jeans and other apparel sold by the likes of Guess. 

 That's apparently what happened, because Guess said it had excess inventory that it struggled to reduce by selling through discount chains at marked-down prices. Its ability to sell the merchandise "at cost or better was impacted by wide and, in my memory, unprecedented quantities of apparel from competing brands," Maurice Marciano, co-chief executive, said in a statement. 

 Guess, which had 1999 sales of $600 million, managed to "improve" its bulging stockpiles but "did so at lower-than-expected" prices, which eroded its profit, he said. 

 Hence, for the quarter ending Sunday, Guess said it now expects to report earnings of 35 cents to 38 cents per diluted share, compared with its analysts' consensus estimate of 44 cents a share and Guess' 33-cent showing in the year-earlier quarter. 

 The company also expects that its "same-store" sales--a key retailing measure that compares sales of stores open at least a year--would drop slightly from a year ago, the first decline in 27 months, Paul Marciano, the other co-chief executive, said in the announcement. 

 Guess added that "based on current trends," it believes that the analysts' consensus forecast that Guess would earn 44 cents a share in its fourth quarter "is at risk." 

 "They were overly aggressive in planning their sales and inventory levels for the spring, summer and fall seasons," said analyst John Rouleau of Gruntal & Co. in Chicago. "They've got too much stuff." 

 It's not alone, analysts said. Guess is one in a series of specialty apparel retailers that issued warnings and had earnings disappointments over the last year, said analyst Todd Slater of Lazard Freres & Co. in New York. 

 That's why investors battered the stocks of other specialty clothing makers and retailers Tuesday. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. plunged $3.75 a share to $22.19; Ann Taylor Stores Corp. skidded $3.50 to $39.31; Limited Inc. lost $1 to $22.25; Gap Inc. fell $1.25 to $20.75; and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. tumbled $1.19 to $18 a share. 

 Analyst Joe Teklits of Ferris Baker Watts, who downgraded Guess' stock to "outperform" from "strong buy" Tuesday, said about 6 cents of Guess' third-quarter profit shortfall would come from selling products below cost to discount stores. 

 "The bulk of the shortfall will be a one-time issue," Teklits said. Next year, Guess will keep less clothing in stock and risk slower sales if inventory can't meet demand, he said. 

 The company also blamed the profit shortfall on lower sales of basic merchandise, such as jeans, denim jackets and simple cotton tops, which Rouleau said made up more than half of the company's sales. 

 Consumers "will go to Guess to buy that special item that they can't find anywhere else," Rouleau said. "In terms of the basic jean jacket, or a basic cotton shirt, they could be buying those items elsewhere" at a much lower price, he added.

 TEL AVIV 

 Stocks fell yesterday, led by Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and other companies that also trade in the US, on concern equity markets there will drop due to fears about lower-than-expected company profits. 

 The TA-25 Index of the largest companies slid 0.8 percent to 554.51 after jumping 1.4% yesterday. Twenty stocks fell, four rose and one was unchanged. 

 About 30% of the market value of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is tied to Israeli companies that trade in the US December futures on the Nasdaq 100 fell today after Lexmark International Inc. and Eastman Kodak Co. warned second-half profit will miss analyst estimates. 

 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries lost 2.1% to NIS 286.9 . Shares of Israel's largest drug company had risen 15% during the previous five trading sessions. A study in The New England Journal of Medicine said Biogen Inc.'s Avonex, the multiple sclerosis treatment that competes with Teva's Copaxone, may delay the disease or prevent it from developing in high-risk patients with early signs of the disease. 

 Other companies trading in both Tel Aviv and the US that fell included Nice Systems Ltd. , a maker of digital recording systems, dropped 1.4% to NIS 287.40; Formula Systems Ltd., with holdings in software companies, fell 0.9% to NIS 173.40. 

 Bank Hapoalim Ltd. slid 0.2%t to NIS 12.25, and Bank Leumi Ltd. dropped 1 percent to NIS 9.02. Israel's two largest banks fell on concern Israeli funds and insurance companies would increase their holdings abroad as capital market regulations loosen, analysts said. 

 Competition with Citibank, a unit of Citigroup Inc., which plans to open retail branches in Israel by July, is also weighing on banks, they said. 

 Bezeq Ltd. gained 0.3% to NIS 23.98. Israel's state- controlled phone company rose after reports Telefonica SA, Spain's biggest phone company, offered to by Motorola Inc.'s 50% stake in Pele-Phone Communications Ltd., Israel's No. 2 cellular phone services provider. Bezeq, which holds the other 50% of Pele-Phone, is likely to benefit from the transaction, which could make it easier to spin off Pele- Phone, analysts said. 

 EUROPE 

 UK stocks fell, led by Granada Media Plc after Merrill Lynch & Co. cuts its profit forecast and ICM Computer Group Plc, which said earnings won't meet forecasts. 

 Scotia Holdings Plc slumped after the US Food and Drug Administration rejected an application for its lead product. 

 The benchmark FT-SE 100 Index fell 22.7 points, or 0.4 percent, to 6234.4. Three stocks declined for every one that advanced in the FT- SE All-Share Index, which slid 11.94 points, or 0.45%, to 3008.15. 

 WALLSTREET 

 Stocks fell yesterday, led by Eastman Kodak Co., which warned its third-quarter earnings would fall short of prior estimates, raising concerns that yet more equity bellwethers may guide estimates downward. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 176.83 points, or 1.64 percent, to 10,631.32, with Eastman Kodak contributing 87 points to the decline, according to the latest data. 

 With investors already cautious after a profit warning from the world's biggest chipmaker Intel Corp. last week, among others, the announcement by Kodak, the No. 1 US film maker that profits could be 10% below expectations, shook investors. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 11.82, or 0.82%, to 1,427.21, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 52.11, or 1.39%, to 3,689.11. It was the lowest close for the three market indexes since early August. 

 ASIA 

 Japanese stocks fell, paced by semiconductor-related companies such as NEC Corp. as lower-than- expected earnings forecasts by US peers raised concern Japanese companies may also suffer from slowing sales abroad. 

 The Nikkei 225 stock average slid 64.28, or 0.4 percent, to 15,928.62. The broad Topix index lost 0.3% to 1473.52. 

 CURRENCIES 

 The euro rose for a third day in four against the dollar on speculation the European Central Bank will buy euros again to support the currency's value. 

 Europe's regional currency gained more than 4 percent against the dollar and yen Friday, when central banks of the Group of Seven industrialized nations used their currency reserves to buy euros. 

 Still, it has slipped about 2 US cents from Friday's high. 

 "The market is still on pins and needles, wary of follow-up central-bank intervention," said Alex Beuzelin, an analyst at Ruesch International in Washington. That's keeping up demand for the currency, even though "in terms of economic fundamentals nothing has changed" for the euro, he said, referring to stronger economic growth and higher interest rates in the US The euro rose to 88.07 US cents from 87.45 late yesterday in New York. It rose against the Japanese yen to 94.61 yen from 94.34. The dollar weakened to 107.47 yen from 107.78. 

 Central banks of Europe, the US, Japan, Britain and Canada bought euros on Friday to stem the currency's decline after it charted record lows last week. The ECB declined to comment on whether it was buying euros again today. 

 "They want the market to get back into the perception that it's back on a strengthening trend," said Michael Markham, who oversees about $7 billion at Invesco Asset Management in London. 

 Still, "in the short term, I don't want to buy the euro. 

 ENERGY 

 Crude oil rose, ending a three-session decline, on speculation that refiners may be unable to process increased supplies of oil into heating fuel before the start of the Northern Hemisphere winter. 

 Refineries in the US and Europe, already working at near full capacity, haven't been able restore heating fuel supply to year-ago levels. US inventories of heating oil are 35 percent lower than a year ago, with the start of the heating season just a month away. 

 "The refineries will process as much as they can," said Chris Schachte, an energy analyst at GSC Energy Corp. in Atlanta. 

 In London, Brent crude oil for November settlement rose as much as much as 51 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $30.75 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. 

 Oil prices plunged more than 3 percent yesterday, following an announcement late Friday by the US government that it will offer 30 million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring down prices.

 DaimlerChrysler faces possible  profit warning  U.S. unit accelerates cost-cutting efforts as investors worry over third-quarter loss

 The U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG is accelerating cost-cutting efforts amid investor worries that it is about to report its first quarterly operating loss since 1991. 

 DaimlerChrysler's management board is expected to discuss the financial situation at a regularly scheduled meeting today in Paris, where auto industry leaders are gathering this week for the auto show. 

 Investors have sold down the auto maker's shares in recent days on speculation that the company might be forced to issue what it terms a "guidance to financial markets" -- a profit warning -- about its performance for the rest of the year, but company officials in DaimlerChrysler's Stuttgart, Germany, headquarters refused to comment on any possible such statement. 

 Yesterday the company's stock rose 44 cents (U.S.) to $45 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, but remains near its 52-week low of $44.13. 

 The stock's drop since January 1999, when it reached a high of about $108, has erased more than $60-billion in value. 

 Top executives of the company's U.S. arm have been in meetings reviewing ways to pare spending on the subsidiary's future cars and trucks without hurting sales, people familiar with the talks say. 

 Although the company announced earlier this summer that it would slash costs globally by $5.7-billion over three years, the current round of talks indicates "a renewed sense" that, on the company's U.S. side, "this cost-cutting effort wasn't gaining enough traction," according to a person familiar with the discussions. "And we need to act more aggressively than we were before." 

 All this comes amid mounting investor concern that the former Chrysler Corp. will report a third-quarter loss next month because it had to spend lavishly on incentives to lure consumers to buy its cars, minivans and sport-utility vehicles. 

 A Deutsche Bank analyst predicted earlier this month that discounts and costly new product launches will result in a third-quarter operating loss of about $320-million at DaimlerChrysler's U.S. arm. 

 A loss at the U.S. unit would be striking, given that before it was bought by Germany's Daimler-Benz AG in 1998 Chrysler was renowned for its ability during the mid-1990s to outearn its domestic rivals in profit per vehicle. Indeed, the former Chrysler hasn't reported a quarterly operating loss since 1991, when it posted an $82-million shortfall in the third quarter. 

 That loss, moreover, came amid a recession. Today an operating loss by a U.S. auto maker would be far tougher to explain as the economy continues to grow. 

 Daimler executives have said they anticipated cyclical ups and downs at Chrysler, particularly as the company's core minivan products headed toward replacement this year. 

 But what DaimlerChrysler managers are now calling the Chrysler Group has evidently hit some unanticipated potholes, too. U.S. executives initially cut incentive spending in May, only to watch with dismay as rivals General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. refused to follow.

 LAUREN THIERRY, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS: I`m getting e-mails here for Donald Selkin from Antonio in Brooklyn. Short and long, Brocade Communications (URL: http://www.brocade.com/) . 

 DONALD SELKIN, JOSEPH GUNNAR: This is one of the great quality, the ones I call new quality high fliers that I mentioned before. The old leaders. The WorldComs and the Intels and the Microsofts and the Dells are falling by the wayside, but I guess this is the evolutionary process. It is a great group of new quality high fliers and Brocade is certainly up there. This is a stock that they do digital switching. They have the Silknet product which is very, very advanced. The revenues are growing like crazy. Just looking at a chart of the revenues. 20 million. 40 million and the profits are growing also. 6 cents, 11 cents. So you`re growing 50, 60, 70 percent profits. You`re talking about a $225 stock. So therefore don`t overweight it. In other words, don`t buy it on margin because you don`t want to be in a situation where you bit off more than you can chew. Take it easy. I`d buy more on pull backs. I like the stock very much. Short and long. 

 THIERRY: You like Brocade. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 THIERRY: We`ll continue talking stocks with Donald Selkin and the first caller is Sam. He is in Illinois. Go ahead. 

 CALLER:   Hi, thanks for taking my call. I`m interested in Goodyear Tire (URL: http://www.goodyear.com/) . Ii bought it shortly after the announcement of the firestone recall. Figuring the market share`s got to go somewhere. What`s your short-term outlook on Goodyear? 

 SELKIN: Not so good. The stock pays a dividend yield now around, what? 5 1/2, 6percent, that`s not enough to say. I would imagine if you bought it in the level of the high teens the down side was limited. With the Ford situation and the whole tire mess that`s been going on with the Congressional investigations, et cetera. You just look at the chart. It doesn`t offer much hope. It`s a stock, again, it`s an old time industrial stock whose time, I believe, has passed. As a result the dividend is not going to say you here. If you can extricate yourself for a small profit. There`s much more exciting things to get involved just United States but the stock is in the high tens it doesn`t mean that it`s cheap. I`d rather spend $200 like brocade that has a future ahead of it. Goodyear seem to have a future behind it. I would work my way out of it and be gone with it. There`s better things you can invest in in this market. 

 THIERRY: Let`s go to Ryan in New York. Go ahead. Hey, Ryan. 

 CALLER:  How are you doing? I have a question quick question. I`m holding Bed Bath & Beyond (URL: http://www.bedbath.com/) , Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) and Home Depot (URL: http://www.homedepot.com/) . How do you see them for long-term holdings? 

 SELKIN: Cisco is interesting here. The stock is acting well. I would say from this level, I imagine any bad news or some bad news is in the markets. You mentioned Home Depot. It`s a stock that, you know, has not had a good year. I would hold it from this level because its down side is probably limited. As was mentioned in this report. Recently they said they can make an acquisition, that`s probably holding it down. And Bed Bath & Beyond, I like very much. They had very good earnings the other day, a stock that seem so that`s one I would hold on to, but you can -- this portfolio is all right. Cisco is obviously a big disappointment. I`ve always been a big fan of the stock. Let`s wait until the next earnings report because at this price, one would think that they did reaffirm the quarter and we should do better than we`ve been doing lately on Cisco, so I would not sell it here. 

 THIERRY: This is a classic case. The stock is guilty until proven innocent. 

 SELKIN: Exactly. That`s what`s been happening with that and some of the semiconductor stocks. 

 THIERRY: Speaking of things of that nature here. We have two e-mails about Texas Instruments (URL: http://www.ti.com/) here and both of them sort of asking the Same questions here. This one, first is Gloria, she`s from Jakarta, Indonesia. The problem with TI is it is down because of Intel`s warning or is there some other underlying reason? So Gloria wants to know should she buy on the dip here and Maury wants to know what`s behind this. 

 SELKIN: This is another stock that`s guilty until proven innocent. They have reaffirmed their quarter that when in fact when they reported their second quarter earnings they said the third quarter prospects look good. They recently reaffirmed that. Yet the stock keeps lurching lower here, down to almost $50. $51. I`m a big believer in this company. I think it`s a little guilt -- now it`s below. Guilt by association here. I hate to say this that the market. There`s an old truism that the technical action of the market often proceeds the fundamentals. In other words, the stock kind of goes down and then all of a sudden the bad news comes out. Such as what we had with Eastman Kodak. Eastman Kodak was at a multiyear low and the bad news hits the fan, so to speak and Texas instruments. It`s beginning to worry me because one would think  that the stock should be doing better than this and it keeps dropping aside from the fact that the market has defended it. I would not sell it here, to me it looks too low. I would wait for signs of stable situation. I wait for an up day and possibly add on. I would not sell it here, but it is disturbing the fact that this stock, I can`t believe it is guilt by association because of Intel. The stock acts poorly. It`s below 50 now, but I would wait for stabilization and then add on to my position. 

 THIERRY: Would you be a buyer at that level? 

 SELKIN: Yes, I would. If you`re not in it, I`d plunge it not a full position, in other words because you`re buying into a down trend so that doesn`t mean you`ll catch the absolute bottom. So let`s say I`d buy the 30 percent, 40 percent of my position. Hold it for a couple of weeks and see how it goes. If it stabilized, maybe add on more. 

 THIERRY: Donald Selkin, stay with us. Look at that, the Nasdaq`s in the plus column. Just barely. More with Donald and Amanda Lang. She`s coming back. This time she`ll look at the timing of the earnings warnings. That`s after this quick break. Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 THIERRY: Welcome back. We`ve got two more stocks adding the pre- announcement parade route here. One of them is Guess ? (URL: http://www.guess.com/) ,  the other one is Lexmark International (URL: http://www.lexmark.com/) . Amanda Lang has been working on those stocks too, today. 

 AMANDA LANG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  As you say, adding their names to the long list of companies warning. Lexmark said after the bell yesterday that its third quarter profit would be 45 to 50 cents. Analysts looking for 60. It`s blaming inkjet cartridge sales in Europe. This is Lexmark`s specific although it took HP (URL: http//www.hp.com/) down with it. Lexmark is down 25 percent today. Off its highs as well. Guess also warning. It said its third quarter profit would be 35 to 38 cents. It is blaming a big inventory buildup. It had to slash prices to move that inventory out. And it had expected to have higher revenue. But it`s paying for it today. The stock is down 50percent. All of this, we saw with Intel last week, in fact, raises the issue for companies and for investors, of course, as to when a company should tell us about its problems. How soon should they wait until the quarter end because for many of these companies the end of the quarter is very important. Right down to the last day because many of them are dealing with human beings who are selling their products and they work on commission and for whatever reason, people who work on commission tend to make the bulk of their sales at the very end of their own quarter. And this is a problem for companies. They don`t always know what they`re dealing with. 

 THIERRY: They don`t, but Amanda, let`s not cut them too much slack here. Guess, a lot of analysts were calling guests way back in May saying you have massive inventory here. Guess who`s saying no problem. But there were some warning signs here. Look at Eastman Kodak. Tell me about the timing of Eastman Kodak. 

 LANG: They had been hoping that September sales had been hoping for weaker, just to get, Donald, a portfolio manager`s view of this because how much credibility do companies lose when it comes out of the blue? I mean, the problem that`s happening in the companies now is analysts are saying we lack visible; that means we don`t trust when the company`s telling us which makes it hard to buy the stock. 

 SELKIN: That`s the problem. A lot of companies tend to lose their credibility. This is the second warning that Lexmark has given this year. When this happens it really tends to sour money managers on the stock and again, they really have to take a while to rebuild their credibility and I think that`s what`s going to happen with Lexmark. It was surprising, but if you look at the way the stock has been behaving lately, it`s been dropping a little bit and it`s my theory about the technical action sometimes proceeding some of the fundamental bomb shells. So it will take a while to rebuild the credibility indefinitely. 

 THIERRY: Let`s talk about how and when the company decides to make the pre-announcement here. You might think they don`t have to but they could be looking down the lock arm of a shareholder lawsuit. 

 SELKIN: That`s the problem. They can face liabilities from shareholders if they don`t fess up. It`s surprising, you would think with all of the advances in accounting in the computerization of accounting, why does Intel take so long to say, oh, yes, the European sales are not going to be as strong. I know as the currency translation, obviously, you would think these are things that are monitored day to day and hour to hour. That`s why Intel is in despite the fact that people waiting for a rebound, it`s still not down even after the big decline on Friday, you were talking about two more did is down and it lost  a lot of credibility with that. It varies from case it case, but this is people looking at it with the skeptical eye. Couldn`t they see this. Why all of a sudden sales aren`t going to be so great. 

 LANG: This raises a very important issue about the fair disclosure rule. To make sure companies don`t give important information to analysts or their best investors first, but when they can do that, it allows the analyst to get the word out quietly and slowly and spin it with the company. So it`s a period of a week or two as analysts said look, we`re lowering our guidance. It makes sure you won`t see a 50 percent drop in the stock. Obviously, that`s in direct contradictions. The front investor. It doesn`t lead to the panic selling, but you get the impression. When you read these reports here, you get the good news, bad news. It`s not only bad news. The company has been scrounging around looking for some hint of good news that they can say in the Same breadth. We`re not going to make our number. However, 2001, Q1 is look being different. Maybe they`re waiting for just the right time to get the right spin. Possibly, sometimes like when Nokia made the pre- announcement for the third quarter. It`s a product transition and the fourth quarter won`t be much better. Has kind of been trying to work its way back. Because to me it looks like it`s gaining credibility. Nokia is a good example of what you were saying of what companies don`t do. Nokia (URL: http://www.nokia.com/) waited for the right time by saying they wanted to clear out the old models to make way for the new models in the fourth quarter, but it varies. There are many ways to handle it. 

 THIERRY: killing me softly. Amanda Lang thanks for work the phones on that. We are back "Talking Stocks" with Donald Selkin here. Can we get an e-mail? We`re going to go to a break first. When we come back more e-mails. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 THIERRY: We are back talking stocks with Donald Selkin. We have an e-mail from Bob in New York. 

 SELKIN: This is a member of a group that has performed poorly, obviously, these online retailers, I know no one would think logically if a holiday sales would start increasing, the stock seems to be building a base about .1 percent of what you paid for it. I would say that if it breaks out over of, it could rally several points but it would be a long time to let the stock if it ever gets back to your price. I don`t know, you should start thinking when you speak to the accountant about taking a tax loss on the stock. Because after a little bounce of a few dollar, if that`s all I see for that stock. There`s too much competition. You look at a stock like Priceline (URL: http://www.priceline.com/) , they`re not in the same business, but it`s symptomatic of the online retailers that hit $19 at an all-time low. I`d be careful of this. If you can use the tax loss, I`d take it. We all hate to admit we`re wrong. Sometimes you have to bite the bullet. If you keep your money in a stock like this, it could drag on for months and months and do nothing and then you stop, so I would say if you get a little bounce, I`d sell into it fast and get out. 

 THIERRY: Swallow your pride on that one. We`ve got an e-mail here -- I`m sorry, no. We have a call from Hawaii. Robert, go ahead. 

 CALLER:  Hello, Mr. Selkin. I appreciation your insight into the company`s stock. I`ve heard you talk about the company before, but I`m interested in your current short and long-term outlook for InfoSpace (URL: http://www.infospace.com/) and the future of wireless web. 

 SELKIN: Infospace is a stock I`ve spoken about it before the it`s come down over a hundred points. The CEO`s the biggest cheerleader for the stock. I don`t know if I`d agree in that position considering the fact that he sold at millions a shares at the price it is now. If he lower RD, the rhetoric we`d be better off. The stock seems to be basing here. High 20s, low 30s. Longer term I like it because we`ll get revenues from the people access the web on the cell phone. This could be a big thing. Analysts have strong ratings on the stock. I would give it the benefit of the doubt at this level. I`d hold on t the long-term. I think better things are ahead, but it might take a while. Again, there`s controversy about some of the statements of it that are made especially by the company itself, but again, I would say that longer term, it`s a good story. I would hold it at this level and maybe even add on to where it dips down. That`s probably swapping the bottom. 

 THIERRY: We have two e-mail, both of them about Lucent Technologies (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) , Donald. We have the moderate e-mail that says I hear there`s a rumor on Wall Street about Lucent. What is it? Bob in Connecticut wants to know I should also tell you that Susan in Arizona says I bought Lucent at 42. Why do I feel like such a chump? 

 SELKIN: You feel like a chump temporarily. Obviously you probably didn`t buy it too long ago. Lucent has to rank as the biggest disappointment. The stock has dropped straight down 50 points. Obviously this whole telecommunications group is not doing well. Again, there are rumors that all kind of things are floating around the wireless yesterday. They`re about to make a negative pre-announcement. They made one earlier in the year. The stock to me, if you want to try to get into it and buy it, you`d wait for the market to tell you it`s turning. People thought it was cheap at 40. People thought it was cheap at 50. Wait not a few days of bottoming action. Wait for up case. Wherever that low happens to be and add in more. Again, not the most exciting group to be in this year. Cur see many of the stocks in the AT&T. With Nokia which is going to be all right. This say group under pressure so if you want to ad on more, you`re not in at a terrible price. Wait until the market tells you that all the bad news is out and then add on. Longer term we could be all right, but again, let`s just hope they don`t drop another shoe here because they already did make one profit warning. Th chart looks ugly. 

 THIERRY: It does, indeed. Bob in Connecticut wanted to know about a rumor. Did you trade on a rumor that you heard on Wall Street. 

 SELKIN: Do I trade on rumors? Most of the time we don`t. 

 THIERRY: Well, Bob was saying there seems to be one around, but nothing that you`re aware of. Let`s take a quick break right now. Just hold that thought. We`re going to come back and talk more stocks right here on CNNfn. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 THIERRY: All right. You`ve just taken a look at Donald`s three stock picks. Amcrx,  Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) and Juniper Networks (URL: http://www.juniper.net/) . How do you feel about them and would you keep buying them now? 

 SELKIN: The lady that called before, I`d put this in her portfolio. The storage business is very, very big. Sun Microsystems said they`re not going to be affected by the problems that Intel and the stock again holding up very, very well. Juniper is come that routing business, the same as Cisco`s in. Maybe the reason Cisco`s stock has been sluggish is perhaps juniper is taking a bigger share of the market. So those three, real, solid blue chip companies with very good growth prospects. 

 THIERRY: I`ve heard you talk before about Siebel Systems (URL: http://www.siebel.com/) . Would you be a buyer of it now? 

 SELKIN: It`s in the e-business applications, strong revenue growth. Strong profit growth. The stock acts well. 

 THIERRY: Donald Selkin , chief investment strategist, always a pleasure. Thanks.

 WRAPUP-U.S. stocks fall with Kodak - euro up, oil down.

 NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Investors got the picture quickly on Tuesday after blue-chip Eastman Kodak warned about third-quarter profits, and it was anything but pretty, driving U.S. stock prices down while bonds and the euro rose. 

 Bonds benefited from falling stocks as edgy investors reallocated their assets. The euro got a lift from the ever-present threat of more intervention by major central banks to buy Europe's single currency and prop it up some more. 

 Crude oil prices slipped, continuing their decline since President Bill Clinton's announcement on Friday that the United States would tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for 30 million barrels of oil over the next 30 days. 

 After Kodak - one of the 30 companies whose stock makes up the Dow Jones industrial average - said its third-quarter earnings would fall short of its forecasts, Wall Street worried that other stalwart companies might follow suit. 

 "This drop is a continuation of what we have been having, which are fears over earnings," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Holdings. "Everyday we get another name - and Eastman Kodak is a high-profile name." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 176.83 points, or 1.64 percent, to end at 10,631.32, with Eastman Kodak accounting for almost half the drop. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 11.82 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,427.21. 

 Kodak, the No. 1 U.S. photo film maker, said its third-quarter profits and revenues would fall short of forecasts. It blamed rising materials costs and a strong U.S. dollar, which makes it harder for U.S. companies to compete with foreign rivals whose costs are paid in weaker currencies. 

 Its stock dropped $14-5/8 to a nearly six-year low of $44-3/8, slicing off roughly $4.6 billion in market capitalisation. 

 Meanwhile, the tech-packed Nasdaq Composite Index fell 52.12 points, or 1.39 percent, to 3,689.10, based on the latest figures available. Early in the session, the Nasdaq surged more than 1 percent early in the session. 

 Weakness in leading tech companies like Intel Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. outweighed strength in Microsoft Corp., which received a favourable ruling from the Supreme Court. 

 "If there were people sitting on the fence trying to decide if they were going to retain their long position or sell, Kodak could have compelled some to jump off the fence onto the sell side," said Paul Cherney, an analyst at S&P Marketscope. 

 Kodak's warnings multiplied fears that soaring oil prices and the weakness of the euro, the European single currency, will threaten to take a bite out of U.S. corporate profits. Other companies warning of softer profits ahead included clothing retailer Guess? Inc. and computer printer maker Lexmark International Inc. 

 Kodak joins fast-food chain McDonald's Corp. and Gillette Co., which have warned in recent weeks that the flailing euro will dampen profits. The quarterly "confessional period" is winding down because the quarter is almost over, but the market remains on guard. 

 Microsoft was one of the Dow's few bright spots, gaining $1-7/16 to $62-11/16, and giving the technology sector a fleeting boost. The U.S. Supreme Court sided with Microsoft, agreeing with the software giant that its appeal of antitrust violations should first be heard by a lower appellate court. 

 But other technology heavyweights slumped, still suffering as investors struggle to determine the repercussions of last week's warning by Intel, the world's No. 1 chip maker, on weak revenue growth. 

 Intel lost another $2-1/16 to close at $43-5/16 - down about 30 percent since its warned on tepid revenue growth last Thursday. 

 In late U.S. currency trading, the euro settled at 88.27 cents, up from 87.42 cents at Monday's close. The threat of renewed central bank intervention kept the euro buoyant, traders noted. Against the Japanese yen the dollar slipped to 107.61 yen from 107.74 yen on Monday. 

 In the U.S. Treasury market, the benchmark 10-year note was up 6/32, yielding 5.81 percent, at the 3 p.m. New York settlement. At Monday's close, the yield was 5.83 percent. The 30-year bond gained 20/32, or $6.25 for each $1,000 of face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.88 percent from 5.89 percent on Monday. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery dipped 7 cents to settle at $31.50 a barrel. After the close of regular trading, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. crude stockpiles fell 2.2 million barrels in the latest week. The API report was viewed as bullish by energy analysts and traders. 

 In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 index succumbed to Kodak's profit warning across the Atlantic and fell 43.9 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 6,213.2, erasing much of Monday's half-hearted recovery from the four-month lows hit last week. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 average continued to reflect the damage from Intel's revenue warning last week. The Nikkei ended down 64.28 points, or 0.40 percent, at 15,928.62.

 Lexmark shares slide on 2H  profit warning , downgrades.

 NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Shares of printer maker Lexmark International Inc. tumbled 26 percent on Tuesday after a slew of analysts downgraded the stock and lowered their earnings outlook for the company, which yesterday warned of a shortfall in third-and fourth-quarter profits. 

 Shares of Lexmark fell $13-11/16 after a delayed opening, pushing the stock to $38-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, a new 52-week low for the company. 

 The Lexington, Ky.-based Lexmark on Monday said its profits in the second half of 2000 would be lower than expected, dampened by sluggish inkjet cartridge sales and a prevailing weakness in European currencies. 

 A handful of industry analysts slashed their ratings and earnings outlook for Lexmark as a result, and although most said they did not expect Lexmark's woes to affect rival Hewlett-Packard Co., it also saw shares slip ever-so slightly as investors worried over the effects the struggling Euro would have on the laser printer market. 

 Shares of Hewlett-Packard were down 7/16 trading at $100-7/8 on the Big Board. 

 The warning, Lexmark's second since July, saw the company's third-quarter earnings per share in the range of 45 cents to 50 cents a share and fourth-quarter earnings in the range of 55 cents to 65 cents a share, the company said Monday. 

 Wall Street analysts on average had been expecting Lexmark to report a profit of 60 cents a share and 80 cents a share for the third and fourth quarters, respectively, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Lehman Brothers analyst George Elling cut his 2000 earnings outlook for Lexmark to $2.27 a share from $2.60, and also trimmed his 2001 outlook to $2.65 from $3 a share. 

 Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff also cut his rating on Lexmark to neutral from attractive, while Credit Suisse analyst Gibboney Huske also lowered Lexmark's outlook for the third quarter to 45 cents a share from 60 cents a share. 

 "While (Lexmark) positioned the shortfall as short in nature, owing to an inventory adjustment in inkjet cartridges which should go away late this year, we are concerned by the lack of visibility, the frequency of earnings shortfalls ... and slower-than-expected growth in this company," Neff said in a research note. 

 Neff said the downgrade was "largely self-inflicted ... and should not have an impact" on fellow printer maker Hewlett-Packard. 

 "Lexmark's margins are under much more pressure than earlier anticipated," PaineWebber's Ben Reitzes said in a research note. Reitzes downgraded Lexmark to neutral to buy and lowered his price target to $46 from $75 a share. 

 Reitzes also lowered his 2000 earnings outlook to $2.30 from $2.55, factoring in his third-quarter earnings estimate of 48 cents a share, lowered from 60 cents, and fourth-quarter estimate of 60 cents, down from 78 cents a share. 

 "Despite claims of share gains in both inkjets and lasers, (Lexmark) has managed to report disappointing results this year," he said. "As a result, if share gains cease or more likely slow, the dominoes should continue to fall." 

 Lexmark said while revenue from inkjet cartridge sales this quarter could be at least $25 million less than the company's previous expectations, sales might still increase by 9 percent year-over-year, as expected. Fourth-quarter revenue growth is expected at 10 to 15 percent from the same quarter last year.

 NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Tuesday, led by Eastman Kodak Co., which warned its third-quarter earnings would fall short of prior estimates, raising concerns that yet more equity bellwethers may guide estimates downward. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 176.83 points, or 1.64 percent, to 10,631.32, with Eastman Kodak contributing 87 points to the decline, according to the latest data. 

 With investors already cautious after a profit warning from the world's biggest chipmaker Intel Corp. last week, among others, the announcement by Kodak, the No. 1 U.S. film maker that profits could be 10 percent below expectations, shook investors. 

 "There's concern about some earnings announcements, Kodak in particular," said George Rodriguez, senior vice president at Guzman & Co. "The underlying sentiment is extremely cautious." 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 11.82, or 0.82 percent, to 1,427.21, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 52.11, or 1.39 percent, to 3,689.11. 

 It was the lowest close for the three market indexes since early August. 

 Declining issues beat out advances on the New York Stock Exchange by four to three, while Nasdaq market breadth was also negative by a ratio of 13 to seven. 

 Kodak slid $14 7/8, or 25.2 percent, to $44 1/8. The company, locked in a fight with Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. for market share, blamed weaker-than-expected sales in September for the disappointing outlook. 

 The slide in Kodak also hurt Polaroid Corp. which slid 7/8 to $13 13/16 after trading at a 52-week low of $13 5/8. 

 Intel Corp. continued its erosion that began late Thursday, falling $2-1/16 to $43 5/16. 

 "Who's the next to pre-announce?" asked Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd., echoing the market's cautious sentiment. 

 Microsoft Corp. helped offset some of the weakness in the Nasdaq composite and the Dow. The world's biggest software maker rose $1-7/16 to 62-11/16 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the company's appeal of federal antitrust violations should be heard by a lower appellate court. 

 "As long as the judicial process is continuing, hope remains for an agreement that is beneficial to Microsoft," said James Wineland, a fund manager with Waddell & Reed Financial in Overland Park, Kansas. "Now it's just wait and see.

 U.S. stocks trip lower at midday.

 NEW YORK, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Blue-chip stocks clung near session lows in midday trading on Tuesday, after Eastman Kodak Co.'s warning of unexpectedly soft third-quarter profits exacerbated Wall Street's worries about slowing profit growth. 

 "There's concern about some earnings announcements, Kodak in particular," said George Rodriguez, senior vice president at Guzman & Co. "The underlying sentiment is extremely cautious." 

 Technology stocks also headed lower despite getting a short-lived bounce from a U.S. Supreme Court decision that Microsoft Corp.'s appeal of antitrust violations should first be heard by a lower appellate court. 

 Eastman Kodak, a Dow component, tumbled $12-1/2 to $46-1/2, lopping some 74 points from the Dow Jones industrial average, which was down 130.59 points, or 1.21 percent, at 10,677.56. 

 Weakness in blue chip technology stocks, like Hewlett-Packard, which fell $2-3/16 to $99-1/8, as well as retailers and financial services stocks helped drag the Dow deeper into negative territory. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 5.24 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,433.79. 

 The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell 9.89 points, or 0.26 percent, to 3,731.33 after zig-zagging more than 1 percent higher early in the session. 

 Microsoft was one of the Dow's few bright spots, gaining $2-1/4 to to $63-1/2, and giving the technology sector a fleeting boost. 

 "They're going to be able to delay any kind of ruling, any forced breakup of the company, so it buys them time, and it puts them into a venue, the appeals court, where they have managed to be successful in warding off verdicts before," said Charles White, president of Avatar Associates. 

 Kodak set the market's tone after saying its third-quarter profits would be more than 10 percent below the company's previous forecast, blaming the shortfall on rising materials costs and a strong U.S. dollar. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston cut its investment rating on Kodak. 

 Kodak's cautionary comments came amid a slew of announcements from companies warning that their profits will disappoint investors, including computer printer maker Lexmark International Inc.. 

 Lexmark said its third-and fourth-quarter profits would be lower than expected because of slow inkjet cartridge sales and weak European currencies. 

 Bear Stearns lowered its investment rating on the company's stock. Lexmark was down $14-3/16 at $38-3/8. 

 The warnings kept traders on their toes about the twin concerns of soaring oil prices and the weakness of the euro, the European single currency, both of which threaten to take a bite out of U.S. corporate profits. 

 A slide in the shares of many retailers weighed on the market. The sector was hit by concerns about prospects for sluggish sales in the quarters ahead. 

 Shares of companies like Home Depot, down $1-5/8 to $52-7/8, and Wal-Mart Stores off $1-10/16 at $47-13/16, weighed on the Dow. 

 Clothing retailer Guess? Inc. slumped $10-2/16 to $9-11/16, plummeting some 50 percent after saying late Monday it expects third-quarter earnings to be below expectations and warned of a cautious outlook over the next two quarters. 

 The Standard & Poor's retail index fell 2.6 percent. 

 Among other companies to announce forecasts for lower earnings were Borden Chemicals and Plastics LP and Chattem Inc., a maker of branded personal-care products and over-the-counter drugs. 

 Borden fell $1-5/8 to $1-1/2, while Chattem slipped 3/8 to $10-1/2. 

 In economic news, The Conference Board reported its U.S. consumer confidence index rose to a higher-than-expected 141.9 in September from a revised 140.8 reading in August. Economists in a Reuters survey had forecast a reading of 141.4.

 International Flavors to Acquire Bush Boake Allen

 International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., which has been grappling with flat sales, sagging profits and a depressed stock price, said it would acquire rival Bush Boake Allen Inc. for about $965.2 million, and announced a number of efforts to boost profitability, including a steep dividend cut. 

 The New York-based maker of food flavorings and perfume scents also pared back its earnings estimates for the third quarter and year, and announced a $100 million stock buyback. 

 Richard Goldstein, who took over as chairman and chief executive officer in June, said the moves would serve as catalysts for needed change at IFF, which has been hurt by a slump in the high-end fragrance market. He said Bush Boake would give IFF a number of elements it doesn't have, including a strong strategic position in India. "It's an opportunity to reinvent ourselves," Mr. Goldstein said. 

 IFF is paying $48.50 a share for Bush Boake's 19.9 million common shares outstanding. International Paper Co., which owns about 68% of Bush Boake, has agreed to tender its shares. 

 IFF said it will realize cost savings of about $35 million from the acquisition in 2001, but the purchase isn't expected to be accretive to per-share earnings until 2002. After the acquisition, the company will have revenue of nearly $2 billion and world-wide market share of about 19%. The combined company will have about 6,600 employees; Mr. Goldstein said there would be layoffs, but didn't say how many. 

 Some analysts were skeptical as to whether the acquisition would bolster International Flavors. "I'm not sure that this [purchase] really helps," said Alice Beebe Longley of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They don't seem to have managed their own business very well." In New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m., International Flavors shares fell about 12%, or $2.81, to $20.75. Bush Boake shares rose about 9%, or $4.06, to $47.63. 

 The company expects per-share earnings to come to about 33 cents a share, compared with 48 cents a share a year earlier and a First Call/Thomson Financial analyst consensus estimate of 48 cents a share for the 2000 quarter. For the year, the company said its per-share profit would amount to about $1.55 excluding charges. That compares with 1999 earnings of $1.79 a share and a First Call 2000 estimate of $1.80 a share. The dividend is being cut 61% to 15 cents a share from 38 cents a share. It's the second recent profit warning from IFF.

 Profit Warning  from Kodak Sinks Blue-Chip Stocks; Nasdaq Slides

 NEW YORK -- A profit warning from Eastman Kodak dragged blue-chip stocks lower Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index erased early gains and joined the downdraft as earnings jitters lingered. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 176.83, or 1.6%, to 10631.32, after slipping 39.22 Monday. The Nasdaq composite skidded 52.12, or 1.4%, to 3689.10 after dropping 62.54 in the previous session. 

 Other major indexes fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.82 to 1427.21, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index declined 4.65 to 654.83 and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks gave back 5.48, or 1.1%, to 509.90. 

 Dow industrial component Eastman Kodak (EK) tumbled $14.88, or 25%, to $44.13 by 4 p.m. EDT after the camera and film company said weak September sales growth will contribute to less-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. Kodak's decline accounted for 88 points of the drop in the industrial average. 

 In addition, shares of printer maker Lexmark International (LXK) plunged $15.31, or 29%, to $37.25 as it scaled back its earnings forecasts for the third and fourth quarters, citing disappointing sales. Analysts at Bear Stearns and PaineWebber responded by reducing their ratings on the stock to "neutral." 

 But Joseph DeMarco, managing director of HSBC Asset Management Americas, said despite the recent litany of earnings warnings, the market should stabilize when the earnings reports actually start coming in. 

 "Seasonally, we're in a poor period for the market so people are looking forward to seeing the earnings period over," Mr. DeMarco said. Looking ahead, he said the latter part of the year historically is better for stocks. 

 Many companies have cited the weak euro and rising oil prices in warnings about earnings for the quarter that ends Saturday. But the euro has recovered about three cents to the dollar since the Federal Reserve and other central banks intervened last week to support the sagging currency. And oil prices have dropped about $6 a barrel from recent 10-year highs after the Clinton administration Friday said it would tap the government's emergency oil supplies. 

 Greg Nie, chief technical analyst at First Union Securities, said the market should stabilize after the so-called confessional season, just before the end of the quarter when companies issue earnings warnings. "Preview season this go-round has had a harder effect on the market than earlier this year," he said, but "it's not necessarily going to be a rough October." 

 The industrial average also was pulled lower by losses in retailers Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), as the S&P retail index dropped 3.2%. Brokers and financial stocks lost ground as well, with J.P. Morgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings (LEH) all losing ground. 

 The biotechnology sector also declined, with the Nasdaq biotech index off nearly 2%. 

 The Nasdaq composite had been up nearly 55 points in morning trading, but an afternoon slide in technology stocks pulled the index into the red. Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and JDS Uniphase (JDSU) helped pull the index lower. 

 Some tech stocks managed to buck the weak trend. Palm (PALM) gained $3.25 to $55.50 after posting better-than-expected earnings late Monday, adding that it's having difficulty keeping up with demand for its popular hand-held computer devices. 

 Microsoft (MSFT) added $1.44 to $62.69, after the Supreme Court declined to hear its appeal of the government's bid to break up the software company, instead ordering that the landmark case first be weighed by the U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C. The move is seen by some as giving Microsoft a better chance at overturning the verdict. 

 And an initial offering from CoSine Communications (COSN) made a stunning debut, nearly tripling from its $23 offer price to $63.06. CoSine makes a platform that makes it easier for communications networks to upgrade and expand applications. 

 In economic news, consumer confidence in the U.S. rebounded slightly in September as the strong job market continued to offset the effects of higher oil and gasoline prices. The Conference Board said the consumer confidence index rose 1.1 points to 141.9, but still remained considerably lower than the record 144.7 registered in January and May. 

 Outside the U.S., European shares finished lower, with losses in tech issues weighing down markets. In the Asian-Pacific region, markets closed mostly higher, although stocks fell in Tokyo and Hong Kong. 

 In major market action: 

 Stocks fell. On the Big Board, where 1.10 billion shares traded, 1,610 stocks declined and 1,246 advanced. On the Nasdaq market, 1.79 billion shares traded hands. 

 Bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note gained more than 1/4 point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 holding, pushing the yield down to 5.795%. The 30-year bond added more than 5/8 to yield 5.850%. 

 The dollar weakened. It traded at 88.30 cents to the euro and 107.53 yen to the dollar, compared with 87.44 cents to the euro and 107.72 yen to the dollar late Monday in New York.

 Terex Issues  Profit Warning , Plans Mining Group Revamping to  Cut  Costs

 WESTPORT, Conn. -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Terex Corp., a manufacturer of mining and earth-moving equipment, slipped after the company said it will post less-than-expected earnings from operations for the third quarter and year. 

 The company cited a host of reasons, including the weak euro and a decline in construction truck orders because of higher interest rates. The company, which gets 30% of its sales from Europe, also cited a truckers strike in France and the U.K., less-than-anticipated orders for surface-mining equipment and weaker-than-expected market conditions in the North American construction and mining industies. North American sales account for half of Terex's business. 

 Terex (TEX) expects third-quarter earnings from operations of 60 cents a 70 cents a share, down from 75 cents a share in the year-earlier period. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 83 cents a share. 

 For all of 2000, Terex expects to earn $2.90 to $3.10 a share. The First Call estimate was for earnings of $3.25 a share. Last year, Terex earned $4.16 a share on sales of $1.86 billion. 

 At 4 p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange, Terex shares were down $1.50, or 10%, at $13.50. 

 The company said it is addressing the weakness in the mining group by further integratingboth its surface-mining truck and hydraulic-shovel businesses. In a conference call, Chairman and Chief Executive Ronald Defeo added Terex will announce mining group changes to improve customer focus that will result in substantial cost reduction and performance improvement. 

 The changes may result in a one-time charge, but Mr. Defeo said the charge should be offset by one-time gains. He didn't specify the likely size of the one-time items. 

 In an interview, Terex vice president Jack Lascar said the company doesn't expect either the one-time charge or offsetting gains, which should be less than $5 million each, to be material to the third quarter's results. 

 Terex officials tried to balance the disappointing earnings outlook with some positive views on its business. Mr. Defeo said he continues to believe that all the companies' franchises are strong and that Terex "will continue to develop new products and better ways to grow the company." 

 He went on to say Terex will unveil some new products, including a scraper, early next month at a show in Las Vegas. The lifting group, which he said is "quite stable and solid," will also introduce several new product upgrades.

 Nasdaq, Small-Cap Stocks Slide On Earnings Concerns

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks slid lower, along with the rest of the stock market, as investors continue to be reluctant about buying stocks. 

 The latest declines have extended the weakness that has prevailed almost without interruption throughout September, erasing the gains that were amassed in August, when the Nasdaq and small-cap markets pushed higher on an almost-daily basis. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index ended Tuesday's session at its lowest level since Aug. 2, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index ended the day at its lowest closing point since Aug. 10. 

 Investors continue to worried about the extent to which the slowdown in the economy will hurt third-quarter earnings. Those fears are being exacerbated by high energy costs and the weakness of the euro. 

 Technology stocks weakened, leading the Nasdaq and small-cap markets lower. 

 The Nasdaq computer index, which is made up of small and large technology stocks, fell 1.3%, and the index of the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks, which is dominated by technology issues, lost 1.1%. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index was down 1.1%, and the American Stock Exchange Internet index slid 0.9%. 

 But the weakness of the Nasdaq and small-cap markets was not confined to the technology sector. 

 Overall, seven of the eight Nasdaq industry indexes posted declines, with six falling 1% or more. The Nasdaq bank index rose 0.3%. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 51.34, or 1.37%, to 3689.88, and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks, at 509.90, dropped 5.48, or 1.06%. 

 The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 4.65, or 0.71%, at 654.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 10632.33, tumbled 175.82, or 1.63%. 

 On the Nasdaq, declining issues led advancers, 2,551 to 1,380, on national market volume of 1.772 billion shares and overall volume of 1.811 billion, compared with 1.729 billion and 1.765 billion, respectively, Monday. 

 When stocks rally or fall sharply, their move is often tied to a single event that can trigger a wave of buying or selling. 

 That wasn't the case Tuesday. 

 Rather, the weakness of the Nasdaq and small-cap markets was widely attributed to investor malaise, a willingness on their part to stay on the sidelines until the tide turns. 

 "Sentiment is sour," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. "For now, cash is king." 

 September's stock-market catch-phrase is "the three Es," which are the three factors that have sparked widespread investor concern; Earnings, Energy, and the Euro. 

 Moreover, there doesn't appear to be a silver lining to the dark cloud that's hovering over the stock market, or if there is, nobody's paying any attention to it. 

 "There's no catalyst to get the market going," Ackerman said. 

 The best cure for the market's case of the blues, he said, will be to get through the earnings-preannouncement season without any major companies, especially technology concerns, warning about profit shortfalls. 

 Ackerman thinks there's a good chance that will happen, although he cautions that it's not a sure thing. 

 "I think the worst of preannouncement season is over," Ackerman said. "But that doesn't mean there can't be a big torpedo out there." 

 He also cautions that companies that do issue profit warnings will probably pay a severe price. 

 "Individual disappointments are likely to be devastating," Ackerman said. 

 But he added that the approach of actual earnings reports could provide the light at the end of the tunnel. 

 Strong third-quarter earnings, he said, are needed "to bring stabilization back to the market." 

 NYSE-traded Guess? lost more than half its market value, plunging $10.19, or 51.4%, to 9.63. The Los Angeles apparel company said that its third-quarter earnings won't meet analysts' projections because of a "generally difficult retail environment." The company also said that its fourth-quarter earnings projection is at "risk." Guess said that its September same-store sales will be down slightly from the year-earlier period. 

 NYSE-traded Borden Chemicals & Plastics plummeted 1.56, or 50%, to 1.56 after the Columbus, Ohio, chemical company said that it expects to post a third quarter loss from continuing operations of 22 cents to 27 cents a unit, compared with analysts' projections of a 10-cent profit. The company attributed the shortfall to a decline in demand for PVC resins, and a corresponding drop in prices, and said that it expects the volume and pricing pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. 

 NYSE-traded Sitel, a Baltimore telemarketing company, tumbled 1.63, or 35.6%, to 2.94. The company said that its third- and fourth-quarter earnings will fall short of analysts' expectations, due to lower-than-projected revenue in Europe, particularly in the U.K and Spain. 

 Strategic Diagnostics fell 1.19, or 35.2%, to 2.19 after the Newark, Del., diagnostic tests company said that its third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations, and that its revenue for the period will be flat with the second-quarter level. 

 Impath, a New York operator of a cancer information database, slid 5.81, or 9.5%, to 55.19. ING Barings lowered its rating on Impath to hold from buy, and Wainwright cut its rating to accumulate from strong buy. 

 Rainforest Cafe, a Minneapolis restaurant chain, surged $1, or 49.2%, to $3.03. The company agreed to be acquired by Landry's Seafood Restaurants, which owns 4.5% of Rainforest Cafe, for $3.25 a share in cash. Rainforest's board unanimously approved the merger, but its largest shareholder, Wisconsin's Investment Board, called the agreement "an outrage," and said that it would oppose the deal. In April the investment board led a successful challenge to a Landry's-Rainforest deal at $5.23 a share, terming that price grossly inadequate. The two companies abandoned the deal when it became apparent they lacked the necessary shareholder votes. The Wisconsin Investment Board has since increased its stake in Rainforest to about 13.7% from about 11% in April. 

 NYSE-traded Urban Shopping Centers soared 12.94, or 37.4%, to 47.38 after the Chicago real-estate investment trust agreed to be acquired by Rodamco North America NV for for $1.6 billion plus the assumption of $1.8 billion in debt, or $48 a share. 

 Connetics gained 1.69, or 10.5%, to 17.69. Lehman Brothers raised its 12-month price target on the Palo Alto, Calif., biopharmaceutical company to $48 from $31. Lehman expects the company's revenue will rise to $290.3 million in 2003 from a projected $33.4 million in 2001. 

 Vion Pharmaceuticals rose 1, or 8.1%, to 13.31. The New Haven, Conn., biopharmaceutical company said that the cancer treatment it is developing may also be able to be used as a device to locate and image solid tumors.

 N.Y. Stocks Fall Again, Victim Of The Killer E's

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Call them "the killer E's." Eastman Kodak warned it won't live up to expectations with its third-quarter earnings, and dragged market averages sharply lower in Tuesday's trading. 

 Shares of the photography-products giant skidded 14.63 points to close at 44.38, down 24.8% on the session. The loss was worse than Intel's 22% decline on Friday, though shy of the 30.2% decline Procter & Gamble suffered March 7 of this year. 

 Like a host of blue-chip names have done already, Kodak confessed that its third-quarter results would come in well below analysts' targets, acknowledging, in essence, that it couldn't execute its plan to growth sales enough to offset the fallout from the weak euro and the high cost of raw materials owing to the pickup in energy prices. 

 Already this quarter, industrial giants like DuPont, Gillette and Goodyear Tire & Rubber made similar announcements, and yet, even with expectations diminished by the welter of warnings, each new disappointment gets treated by Wall Street like some epiphany. 

 "We're at the mercy of the four E's," Scott Curtis, senior trader at Kaufman Brothers, said, referring specifically to the euro, energy, earnings and the election. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a decline of 175.82, or 1.63%, to finish at 10632.33 with Eastman Kodak's loss accounting for 86.59 points of that decline. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10631.32, down 176.83. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,246 issues advancing, 1,610 declining and 503 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,096,912,830 shares, compared with 977,524,640 Monday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 654.83, down 4.65. The average price per share fell 28 cents. 

 Wall Street reacted with pessimism toward this latest disappointment from Eastman Kodak. Both Credit Suisse First Boston and PaineWebber cut their ratings on the stock, but the kudos here accrued to Lehman Brothers. On Monday, Lehman issued a research note, saying it expected a low quality of earnings out of Kodak for the current quarter. Still, in the face of that criticism, the stock edged up 1 point Monday, finishing at 59; on Tuesday, shares had slumped to a 52-week low at 43.75, as more than 16.2 million shares of stock changed hands, compared with average daily volume of 1.4 million shares. 

 The earnings disappointments also persisted in the high-technology sector, where pessimism has grown in the wake of Thursday's announcement from Intel that it wouldn't live up to revenue projections in the quarter, owing to weak sales in Europe. 

 Shares of Lexmark dropped 15.31, a loss of 29.1%, to finish at 37.25, and sinking to a 52-week low, after the Lexington, Ky., maker of computer printers and equipment reduced its earnings expectations for the third and fourth quarter. The company missed its profit targets in the second quarter of this year, as well. 

 Rival Hewlett-Packard fell in sympathy, dropping 3.06 to 98.25. 

 Meanwhile, shares of several telecommunications equipment makers also weakened in the session. The group has been subject to widespread speculation that the third-quarter profit performance by some members would miss expectations, owing to the fitful performance of some upstart telecom services companies that buy the group's gear. 

 Shares of Lucent Technologies sank to yet another 52-week low Tuesday, closing 38 cents weaker at 30.38, while Nortel Networks fell 2.81 to 64, and Cisco Systems lost 2 to 55.19 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index posted a loss of 52.12, or 1.39%, to end at 3689.10. 

 Shares of Micron Electronics lost 1.50 to 10.88 on Nasdaq, even though the Nampa, Idaho, PC maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday that handily topped what Wall Street had been anticipating. Analysts said investors reacted with disappointment because the company's growth came from its dynamic random access memory business, not its core PC and Web-hosting operations. 

 Palm proved to be one of the rare earnings success stories. Shares of the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of handheld-computer maker gained 3.25 to 55.50 on Nasdaq. After the close of the trading session Monday, the company reported fiscal first-quarter results that showed better-than-expected earnings and revenue. 

 Shares of rival HandSpring fell 94 cents to 67.25 on Nasdaq. 

 Tibco Software added 1.38 to 85 on Nasdaq, ahead of the release of earnings by the Palo Alto, Calif., Internet software developer. In a research note Tuesday, Bear Stearns said it expected to see the company surpass revenue and earnings targets. In fact, after the close of the session, Tibco posted results that topped Wall Street's forecasts. 

 VerticalNet declined 4.88 to 30.25 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston, in a research note, said the stock has weakened recently due to concerns that the Horsham, Pa., operator of business-to-business Web site's semiconductor exchange could be exposed to the volatility in the chip sector. However, the firm said that it remained confident the company would live up to profit targets. 

 FuelCell Energy shot ahead 15.94 to 99.31 on Nasdaq. Lehman Brothers started coverage of the Danbury, Conn., developer of power generation technologies, saying the comapny could be a leader in the market. 

 W.W. Grainger slipped 63 cents to 25.50, with shares dropping to another 52-week low. Lehman Brothers lowered its earnings targets on the stock of the Chicago distributor of maintenance supplies and industrial equipment, blaming, in part, wider-than-expected losses from its digital operations. 

 Microsoft shares reacted favorably to a decision by the Supreme Court in which the high court declined to hear an expedited appeal of the landmark antitrust case brought against the software giant by the federal government. The stock rose 1.44 to 62.69 on Nasdaq. 

 Caterpillar lost 50 cents to 35, and the stock dropped near the 52-week low of 33.50 reached March 7. Shares of rival construction- and farm-equipment maker Deere eased 13 cents to 31.88, near its 52-week low of 30.31, also set March 7. The sector weakened after earnings warnings from heavy-machinery makers Terex, which lost 1.50 to to 13.50, and Cummins Engine, which inched up 6 cents to 31.44. 

 With all the earnings worries, utility stocks gained favor as a defensive investment strategy. The Dow Jones Utility Average finished the session 10.70 points stronger, up 2.83%, to end at 388.31. 

 Dollar General lost 2.94 to 17. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the Goodlettsville, Tenn., retailer, and lowered its earnings forecast, citing what it described as a lower-than-expected September sales trend. 

 Retail stocks, for the most part, suffered losses in the session. A profit warning from Guess?, a small-capitalization apparel maker, hurt the confidence in the group. Shares of apparel retailers declined, including AnnTaylor Stores, which lost 3.50 to 39.31, Abercrombie & Fitch, which fell 3.75 to 22.19, and Gap, which shed 1.38 to 85, and slid to a 52-week low. 

 Guess? slid 10.19, or 51%, to end at 9.63, sinking to a 52-week low. 

 Myriad Genetics gained 3.88 to 71.88 on Nasdaq. The Salt Lake City drug maker said that, using its technology, it has discovered a drug target for treating the hepatitis B virus.

 Nasdaq, Small-Cap Stocks Slide On Earnings Concerns

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Nasdaq and small-capitalization stocks slid lower, along with the rest of the stock market, as investors continue to be reluctant about buying stocks. 

 The latest declines have extended the weakness that has prevailed almost without interruption throughout September, erasing the gains that were amassed in August, when the Nasdaq and small-cap markets pushed higher on an almost-daily basis. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index ended Tuesday's session at its lowest level since Aug. 2, while the Russell 2000 small-cap index ended the day at its lowest closing point since Aug. 10. 

 Investors continue to worried about the extent to which the slowdown in the economy will hurt third-quarter earnings. Those fears are being exacerbated by high energy costs and the weakness of the euro. 

 Technology stocks weakened, leading the Nasdaq and small-cap markets lower. 

 The Nasdaq computer index, which is made up of small and large technology stocks, fell 1.3%, and the index of the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks, which is dominated by technology issues, lost 1.1%. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index was down 1.1%, and the American Stock Exchange Internet index slid 0.9%. 

 But the weakness of the Nasdaq and small-cap markets was not confined to the technology sector. 

 Overall, seven of the eight Nasdaq industry indexes posted declines, with six falling 1% or more. The Nasdaq bank index rose 0.3%. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 51.34, or 1.37%, to 3689.88, and the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks, at 509.90, dropped 5.48, or 1.06%. 

 The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index was down 4.65, or 0.71%, at 654.83, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 10632.33, tumbled 175.82, or 1.63%. 

 On the Nasdaq, declining issues led advancers, 2,551 to 1,380, on national market volume of 1.772 billion shares and overall volume of 1.811 billion, compared with 1.729 billion and 1.765 billion, respectively, Monday. 

 When stocks rally or fall sharply, their move is often tied to a single event that can trigger a wave of buying or selling. 

 That wasn't the case Tuesday. 

 Rather, the weakness of the Nasdaq and small-cap markets was widely attributed to investor malaise, a willingness on their part to stay on the sidelines until the tide turns. 

 "Sentiment is sour," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. "For now, cash is king." 

 September's stock-market catch-phrase is "the three Es," which are the three factors that have sparked widespread investor concern; Earnings, Energy, and the Euro. 

 Moreover, there doesn't appear to be a silver lining to the dark cloud that's hovering over the stock market, or if there is, nobody's paying any attention to it. 

 "There's no catalyst to get the market going," Ackerman said. 

 The best cure for the market's case of the blues, he said, will be to get through the earnings-preannouncement season without any major companies, especially technology concerns, warning about profit shortfalls. 

 Ackerman thinks there's a good chance that will happen, although he cautions that it's not a sure thing. 

 "I think the worst of preannouncement season is over," Ackerman said. "But that doesn't mean there can't be a big torpedo out there." 

 He also cautions that companies that do issue profit warnings will probably pay a severe price. 

 "Individual disappointments are likely to be devastating," Ackerman said. 

 But he added that the approach of actual earnings reports could provide the light at the end of the tunnel. 

 Strong third-quarter earnings, he said, are needed "to bring stabilization back to the market." 

 NYSE-traded Guess? lost more than half its market value, plunging $10.19, or 51.4%, to 9.63. The Los Angeles apparel company said that its third-quarter earnings won't meet analysts' projections because of a "generally difficult retail environment." The company also said that its fourth-quarter earnings projection is at "risk." Guess said that its September same-store sales will be down slightly from the year-earlier period. 

 NYSE-traded Borden Chemicals & Plastics plummeted 1.56, or 50%, to 1.56 after the Columbus, Ohio, chemical company said that it expects to post a third quarter loss from continuing operations of 22 cents to 27 cents a unit, compared with analysts' projections of a 10-cent profit. The company attributed the shortfall to a decline in demand for PVC resins, and a corresponding drop in prices, and said that it expects the volume and pricing pressure to continue into the fourth quarter. 

 NYSE-traded Sitel, a Baltimore telemarketing company, tumbled 1.63, or 35.6%, to 2.94. The company said that its third- and fourth-quarter earnings will fall short of analysts' expectations, due to lower-than-projected revenue in Europe, particularly in the U.K and Spain. 

 Strategic Diagnostics fell 1.19, or 35.2%, to 2.19 after the Newark, Del., diagnostic tests company said that its third-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations, and that its revenue for the period will be flat with the second-quarter level. 

 Impath, a New York operator of a cancer information database, slid 5.81, or 9.5%, to 55.19. ING Barings lowered its rating on Impath to hold from buy, and Wainwright cut its rating to accumulate from strong buy. 

 Rainforest Cafe, a Minneapolis restaurant chain, surged $1, or 49.2%, to $3.03. The company agreed to be acquired by Landry's Seafood Restaurants, which owns 4.5% of Rainforest Cafe, for $3.25 a share in cash. Rainforest's board unanimously approved the merger, but its largest shareholder, Wisconsin's Investment Board, called the agreement "an outrage," and said that it would oppose the deal. In April the investment board led a successful challenge to a Landry's-Rainforest deal at $5.23 a share, terming that price grossly inadequate. The two companies abandoned the deal when it became apparent they lacked the necessary shareholder votes. The Wisconsin Investment Board has since increased its stake in Rainforest to about 13.7% from about 11% in April. 

 NYSE-traded Urban Shopping Centers soared 12.94, or 37.4%, to 47.38 after the Chicago real-estate investment trust agreed to be acquired by Rodamco North America NV for for $1.6 billion plus the assumption of $1.8 billion in debt, or $48 a share. 

 Connetics gained 1.69, or 10.5%, to 17.69. Lehman Brothers raised its 12-month price target on the Palo Alto, Calif., biopharmaceutical company to $48 from $31. Lehman expects the company's revenue will rise to $290.3 million in 2003 from a projected $33.4 million in 2001. 

 Vion Pharmaceuticals rose 1, or 8.1%, to 13.31. The New Haven, Conn., biopharmaceutical company said that the cancer treatment it is developing may also be able to be used as a device to locate and image solid tumors.

 Dow Jones industrial average falls 176.83, closing at 10,631.32

 NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell sharply Tuesday after an earnings warning from Eastman Kodak triggered yet another round of selling by investors already nervous about third-quarter results. 

 The decline, the latest of many this month, quickly spread to blue chip and technology stocks, reflecting persistent concerns that higher oil prices, the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth are hurting the bottom lines of many companies. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 176.83 to 10,631.32. 

 Broader indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite was down 52.12 at 3,689.10 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index slipped 11.82 to 1,427.21. 

 Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, primarily because of rising material costs and weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency. The photographic products manufacturer fell $14.69 to $44.31, a nearly 25 per cent decline, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 With the third-quarter earnings reporting season coming up, investors have been unloading stocks whose companies warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about earnings. 

 ``These earnings preannouncements are continuing to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel, DuPont or whoever,'' said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant at Dain Rauscher, who blamed Kodak for much of Tuesday's drop in the Dow. 

 ``Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work right away until we get through this.'' 

 Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to ``neutral'' from ``attractive'' by a PaineWebber analyst. 

 Printer manufacturer Lexmark International tumbled $14.50 to $37.50, a nearly 28 per cent drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock. 

 Concerns about the price of oil also pushed some old-economy retailers lower. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.50, down nearly $7 from last week, but worries about its effect on corporate profits continue. 

 Discount retailer Dollar General fell $2.94 to $17 after a Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded the stock. And Wal-Mart was down $2.56 at $47.06. 

 Energy issues were higher on the expectation that oil-related companies would benefit from higher prices. Halliburton was up 90 cents at $47.63; Exxon Mobil gained 77 cents to $86.63; and Enron rose $1.06 to $85.50. 

 ``The market is still nervous about oil,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. ``Even if you do get more oil to the market, it's not going to translate into lower prices at the pump right away. And higher oil prices take money out of consumer's pockets.'' 

 Technology stocks were more mixed. Microsoft rose $1.44 to $62.69 after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm rose $3.25 to $55.50 after it said quarterly profits would be above expectations. 

 But chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it issued a profit warning, down $2.06 at $43.31. 

 Telecom issues had a rough day, with Nortel Networks sliding $2.81 to $64 and Ericsson down 56 cents at $16.06. Motorola fell $1.56 to $29.88. 

 The market's tumble came the same day as an economic report which showed consumer confidence in the health of the economy remains steady, but is at significantly lower levels than last spring. 

 The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.9, up slightly from the revised 140.8 reported in August but down considerably from the record 144.7 registered in January and May. 

 Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE, where volume came to 1.3 billion shares, well ahead of the 782.73 million in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index fell 5.49 to 509.89.

 Clothing retailer Guess Inc. said it expects third-quarter earnings to fall below expectations, and it warned of a cautious outlook as a sluggish retail environment continues to wreak havoc on apparel companies. Los Angles-based Guess, which specializes in fashion apparel for teens and young adults, said it expects to report third-quarter earnings of 35 cents to 38 cents a share versus financial analysts' consensus estimate of 44 cents. Co-Chief Executive Paul Marciano said Guess stores have seen strong sales of fashion clothing, but sales of the company's "basics" apparel have been slow. Its shares, which have recovered somewhat from levels below $15 a share this summer, closed up 44 cents at $19.81 on the NYSE. The earnings warning came after the market had closed.

 Techs Fall After Intraday Rally, On Fears of Shortfalls in Profit

 NEW YORK -- High-technology stocks failed to put the latest round of earnings worries behind them, as early gains evaporated amid speculation about profit shortfalls for bellwether companies.   

 Cisco Systems lost $3.13 to $57.19 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Approximately 59 million shares of the networking-equipment concern changed hands in the session, 43% higher than for a typical trading day. Traders reported that rumors about an earnings warning hurt the performance of the stock but noted that the company made no announcement or remark about its profit prospects for the period.   

 Market watchers said the warning late last week from Intel that the company would put up weaker revenue for the third quarter than previously expected has left investors sensitive to the earnings outlook, especially for high-technology companies.   

 "At this stage, even tech leaders are guilty until proven innocent," Thomas Galvin, chief market strategist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, said.   

 Intel (Nasdaq) lost 2.56 to 45.38, despite a relatively upbeat start to the session; the stock, which fell 22% Friday in reaction to its warning, moved up more than 2 points intraday, but reversed course by the close.   

 Other high-technology names also got caught in the sell-off. Lucent Technologies declined 1.14 to 30.73, sinking to another 52-week low. Micron Technology gave up 4.19 to 47.06.   

 The Nasdaq Composite Index erased some early gains during the session, and finished near its lows of the day, off 62.54 points, or 1.64%, at 3741.22.   

 Texaco slipped during the trading session, but pared its loss to 88 cents at 50.04, while Kerr-McGee finished down just 31 cents at 62.13. Amerada Hess lost 1.38 to 64.25, sharper than other names in the sector, after Bear Stearns lowered its rating on the stock.   

 Oil-service stocks completed an equally circular session, moving lower, but finishing near their starting point. BJ Services lost more than 4 points intraday, but it ended down just 19 cents to 57.06, while Halliburton gave up just 31 cents on the close, ending at 46.73.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session off 39.22, or 0.36%, at 10808.15, after unraveling a modest early-trading improvement.   

 Behaving defensively, investors nibbled again at some utility stocks. Enron added 1.56 to 84.44, while Southern gained 44 cents to 31.13.   

 Investors bought some financial-service stocks, believing that, based on the quarterly profit statements from names in the group that already reported, the earnings results aren't especially at risk; Citigroup gained 1.31 to 54.25, while Lehman Brothers added 3.69 to 144.94.   

 Lexmark International lost 2.63 to 52. After the end of regular trading, the Lexington, Ky., maker of computer printers and equipment said that its third-quarter results would fall short of the company's previous estimate.   

 Research In Motion (Nasdaq) gained 9 to 86.19. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray raised its price target on the Canadian wireless-products maker.   

 Inrange Technologies climbed 13.56 to 59.81 in the manufacturer of telecommunications-switching equipment's second trading session. The stock was priced Friday at $16 a share, then rose to 46.25 at the end of regular trading that day. SPX, the Muskegon, Mich., manufacturer that spun Inrange off, and still owns 89.5% of the unit, added 9.13 to 144. In a research note, Lehman Brothers said SPX remains, in its words, seriously undervalued.   

 CacheFlow (Nasdaq) advanced 13.84 to 151.03. Credit Suisse First Boston raised its price target on the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of networking technology, citing what the analyst described as increasingly optimistic market expectations.   

 Palm (Nasdaq) rose 44 cents to 52.25 in advance of the New York maker of handheld computer's quarterly results, due out after yesterday's regular trading.   

 Mercury Interactive (Nasdaq) gained 4.56 to 153.50. Merrill Lynch said the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of network-testing software remained one of its top picks in the sector.   

 Sprint PCS rose 3.50 to 31.50. Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the Kansas City wireless-communications service concern, saying the recent sell-off in the stock overstated the fundamental challenges the company faces.   

 Triton Energy fell 4.63 to 36.06. The Dallas oil-exploration and -production concern said it expected its third-quarter earnings would come in in the upper end of the range of forecasts -- the consensus calls for 55 cents a share for the period -- but added that production from its fields in Colombia are expected to decline about 15% in 2001 compared with this year.   

 Emerson Electric climbed 1.75 to 62.75. Salomon Smith Barney raised its rating on the St. Louis manufacturing concern, saying a pullback in price since the stock reached a 52-week high of 70.38 Aug. 14 has created an attractive entry point for investors.

 Energy issues were higher on the expectation that oil-related companies would benefit from higher prices. Halliburton was up 90 cents at $47.63; Exxon Mobil gained 77 cents to $86.63; and Enron rose $1.06 to $85.50. 

 "The market is still nervous about oil," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis. "Even if you do get more oil to the market, it's not going to translate into lower prices at the pump right away. And higher oil prices take money out of consumer's pockets." 

 Technology stocks were more mixed. Microsoft rose $1.44 to $62.69 after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm rose $3.25 to $55.50 after it said quarterly profits would be above expectations. 

 But chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it issued a profit warning, down $2.06 at $43.31. 

 Telecom issues had a rough day, with Nortel Networks sliding $2.81 to $64 and Ericsson down 56 cents at $16.06. Motorola fell $1.44 to $29.88. 

 The market's tumble came the same day as an economic report which showed consumer confidence in the health of the economy remains steady, but is at significantly lower levels than last spring. 

 The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.9, up slightly from the revised 140.8 reported in August but down considerably from the record 144.7 registered in January and May. 

 Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the NYSE. Consolidated volume came to 131.68 billion shares, well ahead of the 1.18 billon in the previous session. 

 The Russell 2000 index fell 5.49 to 509.89. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.40 percent. Germany's DAX index was down 0.35 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.70 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 0.67 percent.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell sharply Tuesday after an earnings warnings from Eastman Kodak triggered yet another round of selling by investors already nervous about third-quarter results. 

 The decline, the latest of many this month, quickly spread to blue chip and technology stocks, reflecting persistent concerns that higher oil prices, the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth are hurting the bottom lines of many companies. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 176.83 to 10,631.32. 

 Broader indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite was down 52.12 at 3,689.10 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index slipped 11.82 to 1,427.21. 

 Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, primarily because of rising material costs and weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency. The photographic products manufacturer fell $14.69 to $44.31, a nearly 25 percent decline, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 With the third-quarter earnings reporting season coming up, investors have been unloading stocks whose companies warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about earnings. 

 "These earnings preannouncements are continuing to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel, DuPont or whoever," said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant at Dain Rauscher, who blamed Kodak for much of Tuesday's drop in the Dow. 

 "Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work right away until we get through this." 

 Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to "neutral" from "attractive" by a PaineWebber analyst. 

 Printer manufacturer Lexmark International tumbled $14.50 to $37.50, a nearly 28 percent drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock. 

 Concerns about the price of oil also pushed some old-economy retailers lower. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.50, down nearly $7 from last week, but worries about its effect on corporate profits continue. 

 Discount retailer Dollar General fell $2.94 to $17 after a Goldman Sachs analyst downgraded the stock. And Wal-Mart was down $2.56 at $47.06.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Blue chips led Wall Street lower Tuesday after an earnings warning from Eastman Kodak intensified the market's worries about third-quarter results. 

 Investor enthusiasm for individual stocks including Microsoft and Palm wasn't enough to offset an overall selloff that began late last week. 

 In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 168.69 at 10,639.46. 

 Broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite was down 46.48 at 3,694.74 and the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index fell 11.00 to 1,428.03. 

 Dow component Kodak warned of disappointing profits, saying its business has been hurt by rising material costs and other factors. The photographic products manufacturer fell $14.63 to $44.38, a 25 percent decline, on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "The Dow is down because we got a warnings announcement from Eastman Kodak. In fact, that may be responsible for the whole move in the Dow," said Bill Barker, an investment strategy consultant at Dain Rauscher. "These earnings preannouncements are continuing to keep the market off balance, whether they're Kodak, Intel, DuPont or whoever. 

 "Investors are very nervous and reluctant to put money to work right away until we get through this." 

 With third-quarter earnings reporting season less than two weeks away, the market has been unloading stocks whose companies even warn of lower-than-expected profits. While Kodak has struggled in recent years amid intense competition in the film industry, its announcement Tuesday increased Wall Street's uneasiness about earnings. 

 Kodak also fell as its rating was cut to "neutral" from "attractive" by a Paine Webber analyst. 

 Lexmark International tumbled $14.56 to $37.44, a 28 percent drop, after the company warned of lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings and analysts at Paine Webber and Bear Stearns downgraded the stock. 

 The Nasdaq struggled to stay in positive territory, helped somewhat by limited bargain hunting. 

 Chipmaker Intel fell for the third straight session since it issued a profit warning, down $2.38 at $43. But widely traded Sun Microsystems was up 56 to $118.56. And Microsoft rose 75 cents to $62 after the Supreme Court ruled that the software giant's appeal of its antitrust case should be heard in a lower court. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm rose $3.75 to $56 after it said quarterly profits would be above expectations. 

 Oil service providers were also higher. Halliburton was up $1.02 at $47.75; Exxon Mobil climbed $1.46 to $87.31; and Enron jumped $1.38 to $85.81. The price of a barrel of sweet crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $31.53, a 4 cents less than Monday, after moving slightly higher earlier Tuesday. 

 The market's overall tumble came the same day as an economic report which showed consumer confidence in the economy remains steady, but is at significantly lower levels than at the beginning of the year. 

 The Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index now stands at 141.9, up slightly from the revised 140.8 reported in August but down considerably from the record 144.7 registered in January and May.

 GLOBAL MARKETS WRAPUP 3-Techs lead bourse rise, oil tumbles.

 LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - A bounce-back in technology shares pulled stock markets pulled higher on Monday, after the world's top economies last week moved to prop up the euro and oil prices tumbled on a U.S. move to tap strategic oil reserves. 

 But dealers said investors remained cautious after chip maker Intel Corp.'s sales warning last week, and any sign of weakness in technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) shares would trigger another bout of profit-taking. 

 The stable euro cheered European bourses but forex dealers were sceptical, unconvinced the single currency had found a floor and remained alert for a repeat of last Friday's joint euro-buying intervention by the Group of Seven central banks. 

 The United States' plan to release 30 million barrels of oil from its reserve, dragged oil prices lower and, while relief supported stock markets, worries persisted that oil could still return to recent highs and trigger an economic slowdown. 

 In Asia, Tokyo dealers doubted the G7's oil and euro moves were sufficient to turn the tide and the Nikkei average shed a large chunk of its early gains to finish 1.1 percent higher at 15,992.90 points. 

 "A lot of people don't really want to invest at the moment, they're not sure about the outlook in America and they will be watching for further signs of euro intervention," said a dealer. 

 A weekend statement by the G7 pointed to further central bank support for the euro and said G7 bankers would "cooperate in exchange markets as appropriate". 

 TMTs REBOUND, BUT WITH INTEL HANGOVER 

 Money moved out of energy stocks, bourse darlings during the six-week rally in oil prices, and into TMT's with key stocks like Cable & Wireless surging more than seven percent and Marconi Plc leaping almost 11 percent. 

 Royal Dutch Shell fell 2.7 percent and BP Amoco was 0.7 percent lower. 

 By 1148 GMT, the benchmark German DAX 30 index moved one percent higher to 6,809 points with Frankfurt's tech-rich Neuer Markt index .NMDKX50 rising 3.9 percent to 5,422 points. 

 London's FTSE 100 was 1.6 percent stronger at 6,303 points, with Vodafone Plc alone boosting the index 25 points with a four percent advance. 

 Still, strategists cautioned that the recovery could be short-lived with investors still jittery about the outlook for corporate earnings after Intel's revenue warning last week. 

 "I don't think this is going to last. The bounce in TMT is just catch-up after the late turnaround in the States on Friday and I think people will wait to see whether the euro has turned the corner," said David Thwaites, European strategist at BNP-Paribas. 

 STABLE EURO, EYES OUT FOR MORE INTERVENTION 

 By 1051 GMT, the euro was stable around $0.8765, underpinned above technical support at $0.8750/60 amid wariness of further central bank intervention. 

 "I think investors have to want to buy the currency, and to buy it just because you think the central bank is around the corner is never enough to provide a durable recovery," said Steve Barrow, currency strategist at Bear Stearns in London. 

 The single European currency showed little reaction to stronger-than-expected German consumer price data which showed a preliminary September rise of 0.4 percent month-on-month and a 2.4 percent rise year-on-year. 

 OIL TUMBLES 

 Oil prices tipped lower after the United States decided to tap national reserves in a bid to avert a winter fuel crisis and analysts predicted that relief could ease prices down to $25 a barrel before year-end. 

 London Brent futures dipped briefly below $30 but then recovered to stand 80 cents lower at $30.41 a barrel by about 1150 GMT. That came on top of a $1.48 decline on Friday in anticipation of the release which will add a million barrels a day to U.S. supplies for a month. 

 U.S. light crude in electronic trade fell $1.20 to $31.48. 

 Energy Secretary Bill Richardson late on Friday announced the release of 30 million barrels of crude from the 571 million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve - the first use of the SPR since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 

 Dealers said the size of the release came as a surprise and the price decline could accelerate in coming weeks. 

 "No one expected it to be of this magnitude," said Lawrence Eagles of brokers GNI. "It could well serve to push prices down to more moderate levels." 

 "It will bring the price epicentre down. It will not bring a radically different situation but will fill in the gap in terms of market sentiment and remove panic," said David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns in London. He predicted $25 a barrel in the fourth quarter.

PARIS -- Rhodia SA lowered its forecast for its full-year 2000 profit,
citing a further rise in raw-materials and energy prices.


 The French specialty-chemicals company said it now expects a "slight decline" in net profit compared with the 1999 result, and an "erosion" in the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- or Ebitda -- to sales. 

 Rhodia shares slipped .20 of a European cent, or 1.5%, to 13.50 euros ($11.86), though the stock recovered from a loss of about 5% earlier in the session. 

 The company still sees a year-on-year increase in its Ebitda for 2000. 

 Rhodia said in July that it expected a 15% increase in its operating margin and double-digit growth in net profit in 2000. 

 Rhodia said Monday that it expects the integration of Wilson & Albright and ChiRex Inc. to offset part of the negative impact of rising raw-materials prices, and one-time costs. 

 In July, Rhodia agreed to buy U.S.-based ChiRex for $510 million, and said the acquisition will fuel growth for the next five years. 

 The offer of $31.25 per share is 11 times ChiRex's estimated 2001 earnings and 29 times projected 2000 profit. Rhodia said it measured the price against ChiRex's estimated 2001 earnings because the current period is an "atypical" year for the company. 

 Rhodia decided to issue a profit warning in the light of the July and August results of the group, a spokesman said, declining to give further details. 

 The group's third-quarter results will be published Oct. 26.

 Rage Software's Return To Profitability Seen In Two Yrs

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Rage Software PLC (U.RSF), the U.K. games software company, said Monday its prospects are being boosted by an upturn in the sector, but market watchers remain cautious. 

 Despite an acquisition spree, opportunities with mobile phone technology, and a contract with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), analysts reckon that the decision to start publishing games has added risk, and a return to profitability may still be some way off. 

 Beeson Gregory analyst Julian Morse thinks Rage won't be profitable for two years. "There's a lot of risk involved in the fact that they are publishing games themselves. The games have to sell well or the they won't get the return on their investment," he said, referring to an April policy shift when Rage announced it would start publishing, as well as developing, games. 

 But he added: "Rage has enough money to survive to carry on as a publisher in its own right. It looks as if the cash position has remained strongish." 

 The sector is also seen as improving after a downturn in recent months: "Games is a sector which is moving with PlayStation 2," said Morse, pointing to Sony Corp's (J.SNY) latest release, expected in November. 

 The company unveiled a full-year loss of GBP2.64 million, which had been broadly expected following a profit warning in August, when a development agreement with a publisher fell through. In 1999 Rage posted a full-year profit of GBP3.1 million. 

 "We were still doing one or two developments for publishers, but in August one of them decided on a change of direction," Chairman John Roberts told Dow Jones Newswires. 

 "So instead of selling the game to them, we will now publish it ourselves," he added, saying that this will mean the game's contribution to profitability will be delayed by 15 months. 

 Rage's position has also been strengthened by a developer-publisher contract with Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Xbox gaming platform, which was unveiled last week. 

 But the effort needed on the dual task of developing and publishing games also means that the next six to nine months will see only three or four game releases, Roberts said. 

 Despite the policy overhaul, Rage has been on the acquisition trail in the past 12 months, lifting the number of teams from eight to 23. 

 But the focus now will be on managing the expanded group, although Roberts didn't rule out any acquisitions, adding, "it won't be a big jump." 

 Rage is also looking at developing games for other platforms, such as mobile phones and digital TV, having formed alliances with Orange and Digital Bridges. 

 Roberts said the current technology for WAP phones is still simple, but he is confident of its huge development potential. 

 "We are still at the early stages, but we see that as a stepping stone towards producing more sophisticated games in the future." 

 At 1109 GMT shares were up 0.25 pence, or 1%, at 23.75 pence.

 PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French specialty chemicals group Rhodia SA (RHA) Monday said it has reduced its full-year 2000 profit forecast, due to a further rise in raw material and energy prices which follows a 30% jump in oil prices in the past two months. 

 In a statement, Rhodia said it now expects a "slight decline" in net profit compared with the 1999 result, and an "erosion" in the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization - EBITDA - to sales. 

 However, the group still sees a year-on-year increase in its EBITDA for 2000. 

 Rhodia said in July that it expected a 15% in its operating margin and double-digit growth in net profit in 2000. 

 Rhodia Monday said it expects the integration of Wilson & Albright and ChiRex Inc. (CHRX) to offset part of the negative impact of rising raw material prices, and one-time costs.

 Rhodia also said it aims to increase selling prices and sales volumes, as well as cut costs to resist against the squeeze on its margins. 

 In 1999, Rhodia had a net profit of EUR227 million, and its EBITDA-to-sales ratio was 15.1%. The group's EBITDA was EUR832 million.

 Europe Stock Focus: Analysts Split On H&M Prospects

 STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB (S.HEM) may be set to boost profitability but international and domestic analysts are split on the future of its share price. 

 Target prices for H&M range from SEK130 to SEK220, with international institutions at the lower end while Swedish participants are more bullish. Local analysts note that historically H&M's shares have tended to rise sharply whenever the company has had to turn round poor results. 

 "I see a marked improvement for the fourth quarter. The last couple of quarters are only a blip on the screen," said Anna-Karin Olsson, analyst with Handelsbanken in Stockholm. 

 She has raised her recommendation to buy from reduce and upped her target price to SEK220 from SEK180, but in common with other H&M watchers, Olsson has reduced her estimate for full-year profit after third-quarter numbers came in below expectations. 

 Third-quarter profit of SEK800 million posted early last week was some SEK200 million below forecasts, and the second quarter SEK155 million off. A March profit warning coincided with Chief Executive Fabian Maansson leaving the company. 

 Despite H&M's own upbeat outlook, many foreign institutions - which may get less of an inside track than their Swedish counterparts - remain cautious. 

 Deutsche Bank considers H&M to have a poor short-term outlook and is retaining its share price target of SEK130 and reiterating its "underperform" recommendation. 

 "More importantly in the long term, we still believe that switching to more competitive markets should lead to lower top line growth and operating margins," Deutsche Bank added. 

 Dresdner Kleinwort Benson retained its sell recommendation after the earnings report while Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its target to SEK160 from SEK175. Merrill Lynch has a reduce recommendation. 

 Some analysts noted that H&M, which is usually reticent on financial information and forecasts, said the fourth quarter is off to a good start with cost-cutting measures starting to pay off. 

 H&M stock closed Friday at SEK194, up SEK10, or 5.4% on the day and 16% since the third-quarter report. 

 This year, with profit warnings and lower-than-expected figures the stock has seen a low of SEK160 and high of SEK345. 

 "It (H&M) seems it has reached the bottom and that this could be the start of something better," said Rolf Karp, who analyzes H&M for Oehman Fondkommission in Stockholm. H&M has turned this kind of negative performance around before so "why wouldn't it succeed now," he said. 

 The company has seen three major downturns in its earnings since 1985, all of them coinciding with an economic upswing. One reason might be that customers are less price-conscious in good times but generally favor lower-cost labels like H&M when spending is tighter, observers said. 

 So any damping of economic conditions could actually benefit the company, said Karp. 

 While information from H&M has always been scarce, Swedish market watchers remain more positive and reckon their longer-term coverage of the stock may be a factor. Still, banks and investment houses routinely complain how hard it is to get in touch with H&M management. 

 Analysts though have welcomed H&M's plans to hold a conference in conjunction with its full-year earnings, even if they don't expect complete disclosure. Until now, investors have only had the earnings statement to work from. 

 "Having entered new markets like the U.S., with new investors, this increases pressure on the stock. This is probably the reason for the management's initiative for a conference," an analyst said.

 N.Y. Stocks End Weaker,Still Reeling Under Earnings Fear

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- High-technology stocks failed to put the latest round of earnings worries behind them, as early gains fell victim to speculation about profit shortfalls for bellwether companies, and indexes ended lower. 

 Shares of Cisco Systems lost $3.13 to $57.19 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, with volume totals accelerating as the session wore on. Approximately 59 million shares of the networking equipment giant changed hands in the session, 43% higher than for a typical trading day. Traders reported that speculation about an earnings warning hurt the performance of the stock, though noting the company itself made no announcement or remark about its profit prospects for the period. 

 Market watchers said the warning late last week from Intel that the company would put up weaker revenue for the third quarter than previously expected has left investors acutely sensitive to the earnings outlook, especially for high-technology companies. 

 "At this stage, even tech leaders are guilty until proven innocent," Thomas Galvin, chief market strategist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, said Monday. 

 Shares of Intel lost 2.56 to 45.38 on Nasdaq, despite a relatively upbeat start to the session; the stock, which fell 22% Friday in reaction to its warning, moved up more than 2 points intraday, but reversed course by the close. 

 Other high-technology names also got caught in the selloff. Shares of Lucent Technologies declined 1.06 to 30.75, sinking to another 52-week low. Micron Technology gave up 4.56 to 47.06. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index erased some early gains during the session, and finished near its lows of the day, off 62.54 points, or 1.64%, at 3741.22. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10808.15, down 39.22. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,270 issues advancing, 1,586 declining and 476 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 977,524,640 shares, compared with 1,165,850,700 Friday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 659.48, up 0.14. The average price per share rose 1 cent. 

 In some respects, Monday's trading session shaped up as the opposite of Friday's action, when Wall Street started under the cloud of Intel's revenue warning, but brightened as the session wore on. 

 Monday's session offered some hint of stabilization, at least as concerned two of the biggest fundamentals problems - the European currency and energy prices - in the market. Oil and oil-service stocks, which moved lower Friday after the U.S. government said it would release some of the inventory of petroleum products from the strategic petroleum reserve, declined intraday, but most bounced back before the close. 

 Shares of Texaco slipped during the trading session, but pared its loss to 88 cents at 50.06, while Kerr-McGee finished down just 31 cents at 62.31. Amerada Hess lost 1.69 to 63.94, sharper than other names in the sector, after Bear Stearns lowered its rating on the stock. 

 Oil-service stocks completed an equally circular session, moving lower, but finishing near their starting point. BJ Services lost more than 4 points intraday, but it ended down just 19 cents to 57.06, while Halliburton gave up just 31 cents on the close, ending at 46.75. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session off 39.22, or 0.36%, at 10808.15, after unraveling a modest early-trading improvement. 

 Behaving defensively, investors nibbled again at some utility stocks, allowing the Dow Jones Utility Average to rise 2.45 points, or 0.65%, to close at 377.61. Shares of Enron added 1.56 to 84.44, while Southern gained 44 cents to 31.13. 

 Investors also resorted to some financial-service stocks, believing that, based on the quarterly profit statements from names in the group that already reported, the earnings results aren't especially at risk. Shares of Citigroup, for example, gained 1.38 to 54.13, while Lehman Brothers added 3.69 to 144.94. 

 Lexmark International lost 2.06 to 52.56. After the close of the trading session, the Lexington, Ky., maker of computer printers and equipment said that its third-quarter results will fall short of what the company previously estimated. 

 Research In Motion gained 9 to 86.19 on Nasdaq. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray raised its price target on shares of the Canadian wireless products maker. 

 Inrange Technologies climbed 13.56 to 59.81 on Nasdaq in the manufacturer of telecommunications switching equipment's second session of trading. The stock was priced Friday at $16 a share, then rose to 46.25 at the close of that session. SPX, the Muskegon, Mich., manufacturer that spun Inrange off, and still owns 89.5% of the unit, added 9.13 to 144. In a research note Monday, Lehman Brothers said the stock of SPW remains, in its words, seriously undervalued. 

 CacheFlow advanced 13.84 to 151.03 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston raised its price target on shares of the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of networking technology, citing what the analyst described as increasingly optimistic market expectations. 

 Palm rose 44 cents to 52.25 on Nasdaq, ahead of the New York maker of handheld computer's quarterly results, due out after the close of Monday's trading. 

 Mercury Interactive gained 4.56 to 153.50 on Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch said the Sunnyvale, Calif., developer of network-testing software concern remained one of its top picks in the sector. 

 Sprint PCS rose 3.50 to 31.50. Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the Kansas City wireless communications service concern, saying the recent selloff in the stock overstated the fundamental challenges the company faces. 

 Triton Energy fell 4.63 to 36.06. The Dallas oil exploration and production concern said it expected its third-quarter earnings would come in in the upper end of the range of forecasts - the consensus calls for 55 cents a share for the period - but added that production from its fields in Colombia are expected to decline about 15% in 2001 compared with this year. 

 Emerson Electric climbed 1.75 to 62.75. Salomon Smith Barney raised its rating on the St. Louis manufacturing concern, saying a pullback in price since the stock reached a 52-week high of 70.38 Aug. 14 has created an attractive entry point for investors. 

 Pacificare Health fell 3.13 to 40.06. Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the Santa Ana, Calif., managed-care concern. 

 Eastman Kodak added 75 cents to 59. Lehman Brothers raised its earnings for the Rochester, N.Y., photo products concern, saying it expected the company to reach Wall Street's targets. However, in a pessimistic aside, Lehman said that it expected the company to draw on some non-core income streams to reach the targets, and said it didn't think the quality of the profits would be as strong as the firm previously expected. 

 Home Depot lost 1.19 to 54.50. Chase H&Q reduced its price target on the Atlanta home-improvement products retailer, saying that declining prices for lumber products could put pressure on the stock.

 Intel warning may be specific in nature, not industry-wide.

 AS investors digested last Thursday's surprise profit warning by chipmaker Intel Corp, one thing has become clearer: Intel's problems may not spell doom for the chip industry at large. 

 Although tech-related stocks were beaten down after trading hours last Thursday and early on Friday, most of them recovered on Friday afternoon, lifting the Nasdaq from a 214-point drop earlier in the day to a manageable 25 points. 

 In particular, networking and Internet infrastructure companies shrugged off the news. Chipmaker Broadcom, which supplies chips to the red-hot broadband networking equipment industry, even rose US$9.25 to close at US$248.75. Cisco Systems slid a marginal 82 US cents to close at US$60.32, Juniper Networks rose US$14.53 to US$225.63, while Nokia Corp's American Depository Receipts rose US$3.12 to US$43. 

 Analysts seem to have concluded that while Intel and other makers of chips to the PC industry may face some roadblocks in the next few weeks, another fast-growing segment of the chip industry - for communications-related chips - is still growing unabated. 

 In fact, as Internet applications demand more and more bandwidth rather than processing power, Intel may soon lose its position as a bellwether for the semiconductor industry. 

 "The evidence suggests it's really an Intel situation, so it shouldn't drag down the whole sector," said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Growth Fund, in a report on TheStreet.com. 

 Intel, which makes microprocessors which power computers, last Thursday warned that its sales for the September quarter would be between 3 and 5 per cent higher quarter-to-quarter, instead of 8 and 10 per cent as analysts had predicted. It blamed the shortfall on weaker demand in Europe, but denied that other geographical areas were affected. "The revenue estimates that we have coming in for all the other geographies are all on target with what we had forecast previously," said Intel spokesman Tom Beermann. 

 The warning came two weeks after a surprise downgrade by chip analyst Ashok Kumar from US Bancorp Piper Jaffray. In his Sept 5 report, Mr Kumar had said PC sales in the third quarter would come in at half of Wall Street's expectations. "There could be further erosion to those numbers, if the business does not pick up materially in the next three weeks," said Mr Kumar. 

 He also predicted that most of the major PC makers would miss their Q3 expectations, saying: "The PC market has essentially peaked." The weakness, said Mr Kumar, cuts across all regions. 

 Since Intel's warning, semiconductor analysts have cut their forecasts for the chipmaker, but they are mixed in their assessment of the seriousness of the problem for Intel and the chip industry. 

 The major issue, agreed analysts, is that the PC industry is becoming mature. While unit growth rates for the industry are expected to remain in double digits in the next few years, further upside is limited. 

 "Intel's a big fat company that can't just keep growing at 30 per cent," said Patrick Dorsey at Morningstar Inc in a report on TheStreet.com. "For Intel, it means that despite...their expansion beyond PCs, they're still a PC company, and the PC market is maturing. Intel is a mature, large company, and the market is just adjusting to that fact." 

 Analysts had also hoped PC demand would be buoyed by Microsoft's new operating systems for corporate and consumer PCs. But an expected spike in demand for new corporate systems did not materialise, while the new consumer system, Windows ME, does not require more processing power than its predecessor, Windows 98. 

 There is also another indication of a maturing PC market. According to ICIS-LOR, prices for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips have been weak. The 30-day rolling average prices of 128-megabit DRAMs in the US at Sept 1 fell to US$15.80 from US$15.82 a week before. 

 The weakening euro and sharply higher fuel prices have likely dampened consumer demand in Europe, but over-ordering of chips earlier in the year, when supplies were very short, also probably played a part. 

 "This gives some credence to the notion that European customers were ordering more microprocessors than they needed earlier in the year, because they figured they'd get less than they asked for," said Mr Ward. 

 Other problems for Intel include a recent recall of some of its Pentium III chips, and potential transition problems associated with its launch of the Pentium 4 chip in the autumn and its next-generation Itanium server chip earlier next year. 

 While the expected fall upswing in PC demand has not happened (summer is traditionally a slow period in the US and Europe), Intel is still looking forward to the Christmas gift season for a lift. In its warning, the chipmaker maintained it was on track to meet its full-year numbers, which means it expects a strong fourth quarter for now. 

 Research firm IDC expects worldwide PC shipments to rise 18.5 per cent year-on-year in Q3, and 20 per cent in Q4. Gartner Group Dataquest is expecting 15 per cent growth in the second half, against 12 per cent in the first half. 

 But while the short-term future of PC and PC chip sales is of concern, another area of the chip sector is raging ahead. The fastest-growing chip market segment is for communications devices. This segment is expected to grow from 15 per cent of total chip sales in 1995 to 22 per cent in 2004. 

 Said Michael Sandifer, a portfolio manager at Amerindo Investment Advisors: "Relative to Intel, those folks providing specialised chips optimised for the Net are doing really well. That's people like Broadcom." 

 Said Don Luskin, portfolio manager of the Openfund and the Metamarkets IPO and New Era fund: "The big tech names of 20 years ago are virtually unknown today, and in 20 years Microsoft and Intel will probably be unknown too. The centre of the sphere has moved from the PC to the network." 

 In the meantime, all is not lost for the tech sector. "It will have an impact on psychology, but the fact that we're not off more than we are, that's encouraging," said Mr Sandifer of the late recovery on Wall Street. "The fundamentals for the major players in the Net space are dramatically good. The B2B sector is doing phenomenally well."

 How do you pilot a rocket ship to a soft landing?   

 That's the question Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers now confront in managing the U.S. economy.   

 To date, policy makers have been remarkably successful in engineering a modest economic slowdown, thus lowering the odds of inflation. But as last week's turmoil in the stock, oil and currency markets shows, holding the slowing ship on course won't be easy, especially since investors keep expecting their fast ride to continue. They haven't taken well to disappointment.   

 It's a bewildering moment in the life of the nation's longest boom ever. No longer is the economy expanding at the torrid 6% pace of the past year. Instead, it seems to be growing at a more-than-respectable 3% to 4%. Consumers still are buying new cars and homes, just not as rapidly as before.   

 American companies still are thriving, too. But with wages and oil prices rising, their power to boost their own prices limited and their European earnings under pressure from the weak euro, many are finding themselves unable to boost profits as sharply as in recent years.   

 Intel Corp., for example, said last week that its third-quarter revenue would be up 3% to 5% from the second quarter, down from its previous forecast of 9% to 10% growth. DuPont Co. said earlier this month that its 2000 earnings wouldn't hit its bullish target of 17% to 20% growth, but would instead rise at a still-healthy 10% to 14%. In short order, investors delivered a drubbing that cost Intel a quarter of its market value. And DuPont's stock has fallen 16% since the company scaled back its projection.   

 That's in large part a reflection of just how inflated expectations had become. Intel, which in the early 1990s traded at a price of only 11 or 14 times earnings, rode the technology boom to trade at 45 times earnings before its revenue warning walloped the stock on Friday. Companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc. are trading at more than 100 times earnings. Implicit in those stock prices is the expectation that their profit growth will continue at its breathless pace, or even accelerate.   

 Now those assumptions may be crumbling. The current quarter "is a bit of a watershed," says Doug Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P Morgan. By his reckoning, it will be "the first quarter since the fall of 1998 that earnings will actually come in below expectations." Overall, analysts are lowering their forecasts for profit growth next year to 10.6%, down from an average growth forecast of 12.7% in June and from 18% for this year, according to IBES International.   

 Declining expectations are already having some impact. This year is shaping up to be the market's worst since 1990, with the S&P 500 stock index basically flat through Friday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite index both off by about 6%.   

 Then there's the dollar. It has been so strong lately, especially against the euro, that Mr. Summers on Friday joined his European and Japanese counterparts in intervening in currency markets to try to take some steam out of its ascent. He acted only after repeatedly refusing European pleas to do so and stressed that he continues to support a strong dollar.   

 In part, that's because U.S. officials haven't forgotten the first half of the 1980s, when the nation's trade deficit was widening steadily and the dollar was soaring, much as it is today, only to crash precipitously, helping to trigger the stock-market collapse of October 1987.   

 For now, the dollar remains solid because foreign investors still are eager to bet on a superior performance by the U.S. economy. But if their perceptions changed, says Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, "the dollar would drop like a rock."   

 The recent jump in oil prices has further blurred the picture. With oil an ever-shrinking part of the U.S. economy, the risk of rising prices is less than it was two decades ago, but it still adds to the volatile environment. Among other things, it complicates Mr. Greenspan's task, since the potential inflationary impact makes it harder for him to cut interest rates if economic growth slows too rapidly. And oil prices do pose a huge risk to America's trading partners, threatening to damp demand for U.S. exports at the same time U.S. consumers may be cutting back.   

 "Oil prices are perhaps the largest cloud in a relatively blue sky of the global economy," Mr. Summers said over the weekend at a meeting of world financial leaders in Prague. "Seeing oil prices fall would certainly maximize the prospects for continued global growth," he added.   

 On Friday, just hours after the euro rescue operation, the Clinton administration announced its decision to release 30 million barrels of oil from the government's emergency reserve in an effort to head off price spikes.   

 Last week's turmoil ended in relative calm. The Dow Jones industrials rose 81 points Friday, while oil prices fell more than a dollar, and the euro rose. But the preceding few days were a clear reminder that the effort to get the economy's growth "just right" won't be easy.   

 "Now is the time to stress what could go wrong," economist George Perry said at the Prague meetings over the weekend. "It's time to stop admiring Goldilocks and begin worrying if there's a big bear out there."   

 Whether the U.S. economy can surmount these obstacles will depend largely on just how new its vaunted New Economy proves to be. Rapidly rising productivity  -- measured in output per man-hour -- has been the main engine of the current prosperity, reflecting the benefits of new technology. If productivity continues its ascent, the economy may be able to stay on course, satisfying both the inflation-fighting demands of the Federal Reserve and the high expectations of investors. How much room exists for productivity to rise "is the most important question that we are confronted with," Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week.   

 The Fed chairman said he was an optimist: "Clearly we have a good way to go" in reaping the gains from the computer and telecommunications revolution, he added in his testimony.   

 But the economy's performance may also depend on the public's continued confidence in the men at the helm: Messrs. Greenspan and Summers.   

 The veteran Mr. Greenspan continues to be the darling of Wall Street, having so far this year raised interest rates just enough to calm inflation jitters, but not so much as to stir fears of recession.   

 The Treasury secretary also has won plaudits for his first year in office but been largely untested since he replaced the widely respected Robert Rubin last year. And Mr. Summers had a rocky week last week. The former Harvard economics professor had strongly advised President Clinton against tapping the oil reserve, in part because of the potential for market distortions. His advice was rejected, and he was forced to issue a crow-eating statement on Thursday suggesting that in such "a rapidly evolving situation" some use of the reserve "could be appropriate."   

 Witnessing the Treasury secretary's change of tune, Rudiger Dornbusch, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, also in Prague, observed: "Rapidly evolving circumstances . . . are [the] famous last words of someone who has lost his virginity."   

 But Mr. Summers had a better day on Friday in his effort to intervene in foreign-exchange markets. Shortly after the move, the euro rose from a record low of 84.4 cents Wednesday to above 90 cents shortly after the intervention, for the first time since early this month, before stabilizing at 87.8 cents. But the euro's modest gain didn't appear to shake the dollar's underlying might.   

 Indeed, Mr. Summers was upbeat on Friday about policy makers' ability to help the economy weather the current storms. "One of the virtues of our economic strategy in recent years" -- larger budget surpluses, stronger banks and the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility -- "has been an increase in the economy's resilience," he said. But that resiliency now faces its greatest test since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.   

 Through the late 1990s, the U.S. economy grew rapidly without fostering worries of straining capacity. In fact, when the Asia crisis spread, the Fed cut interest rates to keep the good times rolling. Last year, however, policy makers grew concerned that the economy's fast growth clip would trigger inflation, which could undermine the nation's long-term well being.   

 So Mr. Greenspan started pushing up short-term interest rates last year, trying to slow the economy down a bit, without bringing the expansion to a halt. But it's hard to fine-tune a major economy with such precision. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mr. Greenspan's misjudgment helped bring about a recession.   

 These days there are signs that the Fed's rate increases have had an impact, though it's still uncertain whether that impact has been too much, too little, or just right. The consensus of forecasters surveyed by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter is that inflation-adjusted gross domestic product growth will slip from the second quarter's 5.3% annual pace to a 2.9% rate in the third quarter, then rebound to 3.6% in the fourth quarter.   

 Consumers, whose wealth has grown less markedly this year because of the stagnant stock market, seem to have curbed their shopping binge a bit. "Higher oil prices could help restrain spending even further," says Chris Varvares of Macroeconomic Advisors in St. Louis, "as people delay or cancel planned purchases of things like clothing because they're paying more at the pump."   

 Interest-sensitive sectors, such as housing and autos, in particular, already are experiencing a slowdown in demand. The National Association of Home Builders predicts that new-home demand will fall to 820,000 units next year from a whopping 907,000 last year. "That would seem to be a big drop, but would still be the highest number of any year between 1982 and 1997," says Michael Carliner, an economist for the trade group.   

 General Motors Corp., meanwhile, has trimmed fourth-quarter production plans by 4%, halving production of its Cadillac Eldorado and laying off 200 workers in Lansing, Mich. Ford Motor Co. has slowed output of F-Series pickup trucks in Louisville, Ky. DaimlerChrysler AG is reducing manufacturing plans for its Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles.   

 Mickey Truck Bodies, a High Point, N.C., maker of aluminum van bodies and trailers, is feeling the slowdown more acutely. For the past four years, the company has enjoyed annual sales growth of 20% to 30%. But higher interest rates and energy costs have recently reduced customer demand by 20% from year-earlier levels. "I've been in this business a long time, and I've never seen such a ramp-up and then have it tumble so quickly," says Dean Sink, the company's president.   

 While many companies' revenues are stagnating or even declining, their costs are starting to rise. Union Pacific Railroad Inc., Omaha, Neb., has been hit by the double-whammy of rising fuel and labor costs. A 55% spike in diesel prices in the first half of the year, followed by a jump of about 30% this past summer  -- is pushing its operating costs up by 10%. The railroad also expects health-care premiums for its workers to rise 14% to 20% this year.   

 At the same time, workers are beginning to have more power to push up wages. Embattled tire maker Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. was forced to give its union members raises of as much as 10% a year as the price for avoiding a strike. Pilots at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines negotiated instant 20%-plus raises, with four years of 4% increases to follow. The Labor Department's employment cost index, which reflects benefits and wages, rose 4.4% in the year ended June 30, the most recent for which figures are available. That's the biggest annual jump in nine years.   

 When demand throughout the economy was soaring earlier this year, a few companies were able to pass those costs on. Now, however, the Fed concludes in its most recent survey of regional economic conditions, released last week, that "despite rising costs for inputs, competitive pressures prevented manufacturers in most districts from raising prices."   

 Slowing consumer demand in the U.S. and abroad, rising costs and minimal pricing power:  As it has been in the past, that could be the formula for a severe profit crunch. Yet many analysts and investors believe that a continuous cycle of high-tech-led productivity increases has made the U.S. economy less vulnerable to such a threat.   

 Over the past year, the big economic surprise has been that productivity gains have accelerated. This has allowed many companies to absorb rising fuel and labor costs without hurting earnings. Economy-wide, labor costs per unit of output fell by 0.4% in the second quarter -- the first year-to-year decline in 16 years -- even as compensation cost per worker accelerated.   

 Part of the reason why can be seen at Darden Inc.'s Olive Garden restaurants, where high-tech cash registers help managers figure out how many workers are really needed at different times of the day. The machines also send diners' orders directly to the cooks, cutting down on the trips servers need to make to the kitchen. As a result, the company's labor costs as a percentage of revenue have fallen by as much as 0.8% per quarter -- even as health-care costs per worker have risen 10% this year, up from 6% last year, and wages have risen 5%. Earnings per share for the latest quarter jumped 31%, nearly twice the growth analysts had expected.   

 These sorts of efficiency gains enable the economy to keep growing, without the threat of inflation. As a result, "The U.S. is not landing," says Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor, "It is just flying lower."   

 Lured by the prospect of increased productivity, companies have continued to invest in high-tech equipment, and such investments have helped support the broader economy's growth, even as other sectors have softened. Ed Yardeni, chief economist for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, says that industrial production for non-high-tech goods has been flat this year, while "high-tech production is off the charts -- for telecommunications products, computers and semiconductors it's up 53% year over year." The "slowing Old Economy could actually increase competitive pressures to spend more on New Economy goods because companies are desperate to increase productivity, cutting costs and offsetting falling demand," he says.   

 Still, Intel's disappointing disclosure last week was just one of a handful of recent signs that demand for the building blocks of the Internet economy may not be as unlimited as current stock prices assume. Stocks of telecom-equipment makers, such as Lucent Technologies Inc., have gotten clobbered recently amid concerns that growth in demand for their products is slowing. Qwest Communications International Inc., for example, expects to boost spending on telecommunications infrastructure equipment next year by just $500 million, well short of this year's $2 billion increase. Sprint Corp. delivered its own scare to the market last week with a warning that slower-than-expected cell phone subscriptions growth would nick earnings.   

 Even where demand remains strong, it may not be quite strong enough to justify the huge expansion in capacity driven by investor enthusiasm. "The great desire to buy tech stocks at any price has led to overcapacity and too many competitors in these businesses," says Fred Hickey, editor of the High Tech Strategist newsletter. "There are too many people in wireless, too many bidding for the wireless spectrum, too many peo ple building out fiber-optic networks."   

 MIT's Mr. Dornbusch expects only a "gradual sell-off" of stocks and the dollar as reality sets in, with a limited impact on the economy. But he acknowledges it could get worse. "If people cannot accept an earnings fall, then growth falls, the dollar falls, everything falls," he says. "It could be ugly."

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR: Tonight on MONEYLINE, one big letdown for those betting on a Pentium-powered rebound. Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) slumps even further, and this time the Nasdaq shows no resilience. 

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR: One bright spot in an otherwise gloomy Monday: oil prices in retreat. But is it just a momentary pause? We`ll ask a highly regarded authority on oil, Daniel Yergin. 

 VARNEY: And it`s the antitrust scandal that rocked the art world. Now Sotheby`s (URL: http://www.sothebys.com/) and Christie`s will pay more than a half billion dollars in a civil settlement. Could criminal charges come next? 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from Los Angeles, Willow Bay, and from New York, Stuart Varney. 

 BAY: Good evening and welcome to MONEYLINE. I`m Willow Bay. 

 VARNEY: And I`m Stuart Varney. 

 BAY: Our top story tonight: Techs under pressure again. Investors had high expectations for trading today after Friday`s remarkable market turnaround. And for much of the day, it seemed like tech stocks were going to ride out the session in the black. But strong gains began to erode by midafternoon, and Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , Friday`s biggest loser, tumbled even further. Among the other tech giants hit today: Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) , Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) , Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) and Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) . 

 And the old-fashioned blue chip names seemed to get a little bounce today from a big drop in oil prices. 

 The Nasdaq had been up 64 points, or more than 1 1/2 percent, at its high today, but then headed into negative territory in the last two hours of trading, ending down 62 1/2 to 3,741. The Dow closed down more than 39 to 10,808. But the index would have ended up were it not for sizable losses in the four blue-chip tech stocks. The S&P 500 closed  down more than nine to 1,439. 

 Let`s go right to John Metaxas at the Nasdaq marketsite with a look at why that index couldn`t sustain the rally and what stocks were hurt the most -- John. 

 JOHN METAXAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, it was the performance of Intel that helped pull the Nasdaq down from its attempt to rally early on. In fact, Intel did rally. It was above $50 a share in the early going before pulling back. As it did pull back, the semiconductor sector turned from positive to negative and then the Nasdaq followed suit, Intel finishing 2 9/16 at 45 3/8. 

 In fact, if you look at a 52-week chart of Intel, from its all-time high set just about a month ago at around $75, the stock is now down some 40 percent in about one month`s time. 

 It wasn`t just Intel. It was most of the Nasdaq big caps that were hit hard today. Microsoft down 3 percent, or $2 a share, at 61 1/4. Not only is this a new 52-week low: You have to go back all the way to December 8, 1998 to find Microsoft trading at the $61 level. 

 Cisco Systems also hit hard today. It was down 5 percent on the day, more than $3, at 57 3/16, back below its $60 trading range and its $60 recent support level. 

 But it wasn`t just the big-caps stocks. Some of the small caps were hit hard as well. Cell Pathways (URL: http://www.cellpathways.com/) was the biggest decliner on the Nasdaq today, down 69 percent, or more than $20 a share, falling from the $30 level. The Food and Drug Administration rejecting their drug application for Aptosyn. That`s a cancer treatment. The company now says it will seek approval for other uses for that drug. 

 There was one big winner on the Nasdaq: CIENA  (URL: http://www.ciena.com/) announcing a big contract with Korea Telecom (URL: http://www.kt.co.kr/) to put their fiber-optic equipment in seven cities, including Seoul. The stock was up 5 percent, though it did pull back $8 from its highs of the session, and helped turn the telecom sector from positive to negative as it pulled back. 

 We still have four more sessions in September, still time for this market to remain nervous about earnings warnings until the earnings start coming out in full force in October. 

 Willow, back to you. 

 BAY: John, four more sessions indeed. John Metaxas at the Nasdaq marketsite, thanks -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Today was a far less volatile session for Wall Street compared to Friday`s nail-biter that is. But the markets still suffered through some twists and turns, and ultimately the day ended with a disappointment pretty much across the board. 

 Terry Keenan joins us now from the New York Stock Exchange with the big movers on the big board -- Terry. 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, a lot of consternation here today that the market remains so skittish, even in the face of that big drop in oil prices. Talk here also focused on technology and the fact that all four of the Dow tech components did finish the session lower with that selling accelerating as the day wore on. 

 In addition to Microsoft, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, IBM also posting losing session, as you can see there on screen. ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) , another tough day for that stock, worst performer for the month of September. GM (URL: http://www.gm.com/) also losing some steam. That stock still feeling the wait of Carl Icahn`s decision to pull out of his GM investment. 

 Now bucking the downtrend, really the only bright spot here in New York Stock Exchange were the financial stocks. They turned in pretty good performances today. American Express (URL: http://www.americanexpress.com/) and Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) finishing higher among the Dow 30. 

 Overall, the market breadth tells the story: more stocks finishing lower here than higher, while volume contracted from the levels that we saw late last week. 

 Taking a look now at some of the dollar volume leaders, Lucent Technologies (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) slipping to yet another new low. A lot of skepticism swirling around the streets this afternoon about just how quickly management is moving to fix Lucent`s problems. Nortel Networks (URL: http://www.nortelnetworks.com/) posting a fractional loss, as did Exxon (URL: http://www.exxon.mobil.com/) today. Many of the oils ignoring the big drop in the price of crude as did the rest of the market. 

 Texas Instruments (URL: http://www.ti.com/) in that weak semiconductor group giving back nearly five. The semiconductor index -- the Philadelphia Semiconductor (ph) Index that is -- down more than 4 percent today. 

 GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) , to the upside. Trades like a financial often. Today it did, up three-quarters. 

 And taking a look at some of the story stocks we`re following, PCS (URL: http://www.sprintpcs.com/) having a nice run up, 10 percent. It warned last week, but today Lehman upgraded that stock saying it could double over the next year. 

 Motorola (URL: http://www.mot.com/) caught in the chip downdraft despite the fact that it signed a deal with Palm (URL: http://www.palm.com/) , this to develop a smart phone. Sotheby`s up more than three on word that it finally has settled that price-fixing charge, while Lexmark (URL: http://www.lexmark.com/) down more than two in regular trading here at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 After the bell, the company said that profits in its second half would fall  below estimates due in part to unfavorable exchange rates. 

 Now look for that stock to take some wind out of the Dow tomorrow. Lexmark`s top competitor is Hewlett-Packard, and it, too, is feeling the 

 heat in after-hour`s action. It is trading down nearly four -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Hewlett-Packard down nearly four in after hours, Terry? 

 KEENAN: Yes. Volume, though, is light. 

 VARNEY: OK, Terry Keenan at the big board. Thanks, Terry, 

 Old-line industrial stocks failed to get much of a -- to score much of a rally after a welcome pullback in oil prices. The markets today had their first chance to respond to the dramatic and controversial move 

 Friday by the White House to tap into petroleum reserves, out to rein in oil prices. Light sweet crude did fall $1.08 today, moving down to 31.60 a barrel. It`s the third session in a row that oil prices have fallen $1 or more. But will that pullback continue? 

 Greg Clarkin has been working on the answer to that question all day, and he joins us now with what he`s found out about it -- Greg. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, even most critics of this decision to pump new oil into the system agree it is a welcome relief, at least in the short term. Now, as for the longer term, most say that this will do little to keep oil prices low throughout the winter. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 (voice-over): Oil prices fell to six-week lows in New York trading  as the White House`s move to tap strategic reserves chipped away at stubbornly high prices. But analysts say the additional 30 million barrels pumped into the system offers only short-term relief. 

 FADEL GHEIT, FAHNESTOCK & CO.: It will give the politician what they, what they believe the public wants to hear, and that is lower oil prices. But it`s a Band-Aid. It`s a good solution in the near term, but it  really doesn`t get us anywhere in the long term. 

 CLARKIN: Oil prices rose sharply this summer and backers say it was necessary to offer even short-term relief as winter approaches. At a meeting of world finance ministers in Prague, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers defended the release of the oil. 

 LAWRENCE SUMMERS, TREASURY SECRETARY: The sense here, I think, was that this was a prudent -- prudent step that others welcomed and that others were looking into whether they could do similar things within their countries. 

 CLARKIN: That possibility and the new oil helped keep prices low. But traders say there are still big problems at the refinery level. 

 DAVID GREENBERG, PRESIDENT, STERLING COMMODITIES: At this time the refineries are causing most of the problem right now. They are running at 97 percent, and you can`t ask them to really push much more than that without having some problems. If a refinery should go down in the next few weeks, you can expect these -- the prices to go up very, very quickly. 

 CLARKIN: Brokerage houses told clients to buy oil stocks on weakness, saying the new oil does little to change the tight supply and demand problem. And investors listened. Shares of Exxon-Mobil and other oil companies bounced back. They finished today with losses, but well off their session lows. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And next up, new numbers on oil inventories are due out tomorrow, and then attention will turn to Venezuela, where OPEC meets this Thursday through Saturday -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Greg Clarkin, thanks very much. 

 Now later on MONEYLINE, one of the foremost authorities on the inner workings of the oil business, Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research and the Pulitzer prize-winning author of "The Prize" -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, optimism over oil prices today was clearly tempered by further weakening of the euro, a trend that is threatening corporate American profits and sales. Today was clearly a disappointment for world bankers who stepped in to buy euros on Friday. The euro was trading at 87.5 cents, down a bit from where it stood late Friday, following that dramatic intervention in world currency markets. 

 A broader fear hovering over the markets in recent weeks: that the U.S. economy is slowing. But you won`t find signs of weakness in the latest report on housing. Sales of existing homes rocketed in August at an annual rate of more than 9 percent. That follows a drop of more than 9 percent in July. The surge in August is the biggest in more than a year, the result of declining mortgage rates. 

 Bonds had been weaker for much of the day, but the long bond at least turned modestly higher after Wall Street took a turn for the worse. While the 10-year note was unchanged, the 30-year bond was up three ticks, the yield there coming in at 5.89 percent. 

 BAY: Coming up next on MONEYLINE, the very latest on that profitwarning from Lexmark and its impact on HP. 

 We`ll also look at the power of Palm, late-breaking profit news from the people behind the Palm Pilot and the after-hours reaction. 

 Later, Intel`s future on Wall Street after losing more than $100 billion in value in two sessions. What are the chances for a full recovery? We`ll go "Behind the Numbers." 

 Plus, two companies steeped in history, and scandal: inside the Sotheby`s-Christie`s antitrust settlement. 

 ANNOUNCER: From CNN`s Los Angeles and New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Checking Tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers," Home Depot (URL: http://www.homedepot.com/) lost nearly a point and a quarter. Chase Hambrecht & Quist cut the home- improvement retailer`s price target today, citing concerns of a slowdown in consumer spending and decline in lumber prices. 

 Research In Motion (URL: http://www.rim.net/) gained nine points. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey repeated its strong buy rating today and set a $90 price target. The firm said that the maker of pagers is on track to report a strong second quarter. 

 Handspring (URL: http://www.handspring.com/) jumped nearly 5 1/2 on word that its new mobile device will be available in November. The gadget is a snap-on device which will transform a hand-held computer into a mobile phone. 

 BAY: A profit warning from Lexmark International pulls down other printer makers in after-hours trading, while Palm beats the Street with its latest results. 

 Amanda Lang has been following all the late action from the CNNfn newsroom, and she joins us now with the very latest -- Amanda. 

 AMANDA LANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, Lexmark International said after the bell that it will see softer revenues in the second half of this year. That means it may miss its third and fourth quarter earnings. First its third quarter, expectations were 56 cents, they`re saying 45-50 cents per share may be more in line. 

 Now in very light trading, the stock is down almost 9 1/2 at $43, and it is pulling down Hewlett-Packard after hours. It is the No. 1 computer printer maker. Analysts call the move in HP an overreaction. Again, very light volume on Instinet trading, but the stock is down almost four, slightly heavier reaction on other ETNs, or after-hours trading networks. 

 And Palm posted earnings that beat the Street almost double, in fact, four cents, not two. And it surprised on the revenue line, as well, but the stock is falling after hours. It`s down 1 3/4 to 50 1/2. It has been creeping back from its lows after the bell. 

 And Cabletron (URL: http://www.cabletron.com/) similarly posted a profit of one cent  when the Street was looking for a loss of one cent. That stock down to 2 1/2 to 33 1/2, although the volume there extremely light. 

 Back to you, Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Amanda. Amanda Lang with all the after-hours news -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right, Willow, in tonight`s "Tech Watch," a new look for one Web site had investors in a buying mood. Today, NBC Internet (URL: http://www.nbci.com/) launched a new portal that will embrace its ties to the NBC network. NBCI.com will now bring together content from other NBC properties, like the CNBC and MSNBC cable networks. 

 The Web site also hopes to benefit from in-show promotions and a major ad campaign on NBC during the Olympic games. Goldman Sachs says the launch should spark renewed interest in the site and its stock price. Shares of NBCi up neatly 1 1/2 points to 7 5/8 today, though it is still off more than 90 percent from its 52-week high of 106 1/8 -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, still to come, they are celebrating in the streets, but no clear winner yet in the Yugoslav elections. The latest on this story and more in the "MONEYLINE News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: And now for the day`s top news stories, waiting for results in Yugoslavia, Wolf Blitzer joins us from Washington with the "MONEYLINE News Digest" -- Wolf. 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow. 

 No official results are in yet from yesterday`s Yugoslav election, but opposition supporters are claiming victory for their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica. President Slobodan Milosevic is also claiming victory as the votes are tallied. But Milosevic supporters indicate there may be a need for a run-off vote on October 8th if neither side wins 50 percent. The U.S. and more than a dozen other countries warned Milosevic to accept the election results and not make false claims of victory. 

 In the U.S. presidential campaign, poll results show Texas Governor George W. Bush holding on to recent gains that have him running him neck and neck with Democrat Al Gore. A CNN/"USA Today" Gallup poll that has been tracking the two candidates for several weeks now puts Bush`s support at 47 percent, compared to Gore`s 44 percent. That`s a dead heat, given the margin of error. Until the last few days, Gore was holding a slim lead. 

 On the campaign trail today, Gore unveiled his plans for Medicare. He told a group of elderly he would propose doubling the penalties against HMOs that drop out of Medicare. 

 And at the Olympics, U.S. track and field star Marion Jones had more to worry about that winning gold medals. Officials confirmed that her husband, world champion shot putter C.J. Hunter, had tested positive for steroids earlier this year. He vowed to vigorously defend himself from the charges. Hunter isn`t competing in Sydney, but he is coaching and supporting his wife, who has already won one gold medal and hopes to win four more. 

 These are some of the top stories. Join us on the "THE WORLD TODAY," that`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific, for more --Willow. 

 BAY: Wolf, I`m wondering, you`ve been talking to lots of folks in the Bush campaign. How do they account for this shift in the polls? 

 BLITZER: They think that Bush is doing a much better job speaking about issues, issues that are resonating. And they`re also privately noting that they think he was very successful last week when we he went on Oprah Winfrey`s show, Regis Philbin`s show. And they`re predicting that there`ll be a lot more of that kind of opportunity to show George W. Bush the way they say he really is, a kind of likable politician. 

 BAY: All right, Wolf, thanks. We`ll see you at 8:00 -- Wolf Blitzer. 

 VARNEY: As we mentioned, oil prices did indeed slip again today, reacting to the White House`s decision to release 30 million barrels from the Strategic Reserve. For more on where prices may be headed, we`re now joined by Daniel Yergin. He is the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Dan, welcome back. 

 DANIEL YERGIN, CHAIRMAN, CAMBRIDGE ENERGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES: Thank you. 

 VARNEY: Oil prices down just as the White House releases some from the petroleum reserve. Will those oil prices stay down where they are now? 

 YERGIN: We think that, looking at fourth quarter, at oil prices, probably in the range of $30 to $32 a barrel. Certainly this release takes some of the nervousness and anxiety out of the market, but there are other factors there that will still be supporting oil prices, particularly if we go into a cold winter. 

 VARNEY: A cold winter could change that forecast. It could raise  your target above 35, 38? 

 YERGIN: Yes, exactly. I mean, it partly depends on the weather, and then there`s this question about how much oil is on the high seas. If we start to see large volumes coming in, that will add to the downward pressure and could carry us below this. So this is a time of uncertainty. 

 VARNEY: We`ve heard reports that there is a wall of oil in supertankers heading toward us, which will alleviate to some degree the supply problem. Is that true? 

 YERGIN: We`ve been waiting for that for a couple of weeks, and it keeps being pushed out. But given the increase of production by the OPEC countries and the fact that tanker rates are high and you can`t charter a tanker, Stuart, it suggests that in fact that oil is going to be coming into the market some time in the next few weeks. 

 VARNEY: There isn`t that capacity to just pump extra oil just like that. You can`t just turn around and get 5 million extra barrels a day on the market. 

 YERGIN: That`s the biggest risk. This weekend we redid our numbers and looked at them again, at the spare capacity number, which you`re talking about. It`s now down to almost just a little over 2 million barrels a day, which is lower than it`s been at any time except the Gulf crisis, since the eve of 1973 oil crisis. It`s less than the current exports from Iraq. 

 So the fundamentals of the market are still tight, and that -- when you have a market that tight, it is vulnerable to disruptions from anything to Saddam Hussein to a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico. 

 VARNEY: Now, about what refining capacity? Once this so-called "wall of oil" gets here, do we have surplus capacity to refine it into home heating oil and... 

 YERGIN: Well, you still -- you can`t put the crude oil into your home furnace. Our refineries are running like at 97 percent capacity. So, that system is very tight, too. That is part of this tightness in the whole logistical system. 

 VARNEY: Is America in a position to rather quickly boost domestic oil supply? Can it do that? 

 YERGIN: It can do it, not quickly. What we have to first start to see is a real step-up of production. The first challenge is to hold our production where it`s been so it doesn`t decline. Certainly, deep-water Gulf of Mexico is a place where we could have more supply, but there`s (UNINTELLIGIBLE) of lead times there. It doesn`t happen overnight. 

 VARNEY: In the New York area at the moment, where we sit, the average price for home heating oil has recently touched about $1.60 a gallon. In the event of a cold snap in the relatively near future, could that price go to more than $2? That`s a loaded political question. 

 YERGIN: Sure, we could see it happen, and of course, the money now being made available for low income -- it does seem, however, that what`s happening is that people are seeing all these news reports and are buying early. So maybe we`re getting a lot of the winter buying early, and we can -- as people fill up their inventories. 

 VARNEY: So at this -- at this current time, as you look at the fundamentals in the marketplace, it is unlikely that we`ll get below $30 a barrel as we  enter this winter period? 

 YERGIN: Unless -- unless two things: one, a mild winter; and two, that wall of oil gets here soon. If that happens, then we could see it pushed down more, but we`re still looking at an average price of around $30 in the fourth quarter at this point. 

 VARNEY: Daniel Yergin, always a pleasure. And thanks very much for coming back... 

 YERGIN: Thank you. 

 VARNEY: Thanks, Dan. 

 Let`s go to you, Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, still ahead, the ugly underside of the auction business, as Sotheby`s and Christie`s agree to a massive fine for fixing prices. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: And here`s what we have for you coming up in our next half hour: full details on another down day for the markets. Highlighting the list of losers, Intel failing to bounce back after last week`s big-time sell-off. 

 BAY: Plus, it`s been a tough year to make money in the markets, but we will hear from William Nygren, one of our stock-picking stars, who`s turned in a double-digit return. And we`ll head back to the New York Stock Exchange to go behind the numbers. Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s headlines, tech stocks slide for the third straight day, as earnings fears undercut some major new-economy names. 

 Also heading lower: oil prices, dropping below $32 a barrel, on White House plans to tap the strategic reserve. 

 Plus, two landmark institutions pay a steep price for fixing auctions. Sotheby`s and Christie`s agree to a massive penalty on charges of cheating their customers. 

 BAY: But first, tonight`s top story: Once again, investors begin the new week seeing red. Stocks dragged lower as concerns about slowing profits overshadowed any relief from falling oil prices. Further weakness in Intel shares, after its revenue warning last week, also weighed on tech stocks today, dragging the Philly Semiconductor Index down nearly 5 percent. 

 That, in turn, hurt the overall Nasdaq. Despite a strong start, the composite index fell for the third straight session, down 62 1/2 points to close at 3741. The Dow industrials also lost ground, despite a higher opening, down more than 39 points, to close at 10808. And the S&P 500 index ended the day at 1439, down more than nine points. 

 Checking some of the day`s biggest movers: Dow component, IBM, fell more than 2 1/4. Intel`s weakness spread to other chip stocks, like Texas Instruments, down nearly 4 3/4. 

 Altera (URL: http://www.altera.com/) lost more than six. 

 Other big losers today: QUALCOMM (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) fell three. Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) sank almost six. 

 Oil prices also retreated, down $1.08 to $31.60 a barrel: investors reacting to a White House decision on Friday to release 30 million barrels from the strategic reserve. 

 VARNEY: As Willow mentioned, Wall Street did show some signs of promise today. This morning, stocks began the session higher, as investors hoped this would be the first time since August that both the Dow and the Nasdaq began the week on an upswing. But that`s not how the day ended. 

 Peter Viles joins us now with more on today`s action -- Peter. 

 PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, in some ways, this morning`s bounce in the stock market was a rally made in Washington. And it was just no match for the anxiety that Intel injected into this market  last week. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 (voice-over): Cheered by the Clinton administration decision to intervene in two troubling markets, oil and currency, stock staged a modest early rally. But it quickly fizzled as the Intel sell-off continued, spotlighting concerns about corporate profits. 

 TED WEISBERG, SEAPORT SECURITIES: Well, it was, I think, a rather sloppy day today. After Friday`s excitement, I -- perhaps everybody just kind of sat back and was catching their breath. But there`s a lot of unknowns out there. And, as we know, the market can`t stand unknowns. And I think people are just a little confused and not quite sure what to do here. 

 VILES: Intel shares slipped again in very heavy volume and have now lost 26 percent in two trading days. Technology linchpin Cisco was another heavy loser, as were Microsoft, which closed at its lowest level since December `98, and Dell Computer (URL: http://www.dell.com/) . The Dow is now down 5.9 percent this year. And the and Nasdaq lost 8 percent. 

 There is some optimism in the market at these levels, though. PaineWebber strategist Ed Kershner wrote he believes concerns over the -- quote --"four e`s," -- energy, the euro, earnings, and the election -- are "overblown," that the profit picture still looks very healthy and that stocks are -- quote -- "getting cheap." 

 While there is nervousness over third-quarter earnings, some see a market bounce if those earnings do not disappoint. 

 FRANCIS GANNON, SUNAMERICA ASSET MGT.: Once we get through the end of this week, and we actually start hearing from these companies and hearing them report good numbers -- because I still third-quarter numbers will be excellent when the day is over -- I think this market is going to move higher between now and the end of the year. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: But even PaineWebber, which says third-quarter profits do look very healthy, does see a slowdown coming in earnings growth: from percentage gains in the mid-teens last year and this year to gains next year in the high single-digits -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Still high single digits next year, but down from where we are now. 

 VILES: Sure, nothing like we`ve had the last two years. 

 VARNEY: Well said. Peter Viles, thanks very much -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, Intel`s certainly not alone with its sharp pullback this month. In fact, many of last year`s high-flyers are coming up short this year. 

 From the New York Stock Exchange, Terry Keenan joins us now with more on what`s happening to these one-time market leaders -- Terry. 

 KEENAN: Willow, short, though, maybe is what you want to do. 

 Investors here today did express a lot of concern that the Nasdaq -- and Intel in particular -- didn`t rally today after last week`s purging sell-off. But market technicians say it may be a very long time before Intel stock finds its footing. More ominous: Some caution that this latest stock debacle does not bode well for the rest of the market. 

 Here`s why: After a blockbuster 1999, the year 2000 has been characterized by a relentless parade of individual stock implosions: big-name stocks that have blown up mostly on profit or revenue warning. The casualty list reads like what at this time last year would have been a model growth portfolio: Lucent down 59 percent; Microsoft down 47.5 percent; AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) down  43 percent; Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) of 42 percent; and McDonald`s (URL: http://www.mcdonalds.com/) down 28 percent. 

 Worse yet: In each of these cases, the stocks have shown little signs of recovery after their initial sell-off. Until last week, Intel escaped the carnage. And this summer, it was trading up more than 70 percent on the year. But in the wake of the recent selling, the stock is now down 40 percent from the high set in late August. 

 John Roque, the technician at Arnold & S. Bleichroeder, says, like  an injured athlete, it usually takes stocks like this a long time to recover. And he thinks Intel is dead money for a while. Worse still, there are signs that the few leaders this market has left are beginning to falter. 

 In the first half of the year, only 13 of the 20 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 managed to stay in the plus column. So far in the third quarter, five of those leaders have stumbled as well. In addition to Intel, Cisco is down 10 percent since June 30; Pfizer (URL: http://www.pfizer.com/) off more than 7 percent; Nortel Networks (URL: http://www.nortelnetworks.com/) down more than 3 percent; and Merck (URL: http://www.merck.com/) down 4.5 percent. 

 Bears, like Richard Russell of the "Dow Theory" forecasts" called this attrition a slow but steady chipping away at the bull market leaders, and a classic sign that we are in, or headed for a bear market. Now, Roque`s outlook is not that ominous, but he says investors are clearly circling the wagon, relying on an ever-shrinking group of market leaders. 

 Now, still left standing with big gains on the year: Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) , Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) and EMC (URL: http://www.emc.com/) . So keep an eye on the performance of those stocks in the next couple of weeks to see if this market can get back on 

 its feet -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Terry. Terry Keenan with a look "Behind the Numbers." 

 Another market loser today: the euro. The single European currency edged lower against the dollar, as the impact of Friday`s Central Bank intervention faded. But the euro`s move was muted by fears that the major industrial powers might again jump into the market to bolster the beleaguered currency. 

 The euro closed at about 87.5 cents by the end of New York trading, down 

 slightly from Friday, but above its record lows. 

 VARNEY: Still to come: A profit warning drags down some big- name printer-makers in after-hours trading. We`ll have the very latest when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: An after-the-bell profit warning from Lexmark International is hurting more than just its own investors tonight. 

 Amanda Lang joins us now with the very latest action -- Amanda. 

 LANG: Willow, Lexmark International said that weak inkjet cartridge sales and the continued weak euro will affect its coming quarters, third and fourth -- that stock trading down after hours and dragging down Hewlett-Packard with it, the number-one computer printer-maker. 

 Lexmark now down 8 9/16 on REDIbook trading. Earlier, it had been down further on Instinet. Similarly, Hewlett-Packard is now down 1 1/4 at 100 1/16. It had been down as much as 3 15/16 on Instinet trading -- all of this in relatively light after-hours volume. 

 Over on the other side of the ledger, Palm reported earnings today that beat expectations: came in at 4 cents a share, not the 2 cents the street was looking for. But its stock has suffered after hours. It is, however, now coming back. It`s now off 1 1/4 at 51 on volume of 132,000 on REDIbook trading, and it is well above its earlier lows. It was down 1 3/4 at 50 1/2. 

 Back to you, Willow. 

 BAY: Amanda Lang with the after-hours action, thanks -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Thanks, Wills. 

 A case that rocked the art world may have reached a resolution, as the two top companies of the auction business signed off on a monumental settlement. Sotheby`s and Christie`s agreed to pay $512 million to settle civil charges that they had cheated art buyers and sellers and colluded on their fee structure. 

 Susan Lisovicz has been following the story and she joins us now  with a report -- Susan. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Stuart. 

 Well, settling the class-action suit not only helps Sotheby`s and Christie`s put this unseemly episode behind them, but it sends a signal to the Justice Department that the two auction houses want to quickly settle the government`s criminal charges as well. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sold. 

 LISOVICZ (voice-over): Whether it`s the great or merely the grand, only two auction houses count in the art world: Sotheby`s and Christie`s, which account for an estimated 95 percent of the art auction market. 

 The Justice Department says that for years the two fixed fees on what they charged buyers and sellers, and the criminal case is still pending. But over the weekend, Sotheby`s and Christie`s agreed to pay more than $250 million each to settle a separate class-action suit on the same charges. 

 Many art experts said they were stunned by the huge settlement, but some analysts say it could have been worse had the case gone to court. 

 JAMES MEYER, JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT: It`s to sign a settlement for perhaps  a third of what they could have possibly been to get rid of an uncertainty is a plus. 

 LISOVICZ: Sotheby`s former chairman Alfred Taubman will pay more than half Sotheby`s settlement. But the $100 million Sotheby`s will pay represents more than two years of profit. And while Christie`s is privately owned, the scandal has resonated with Sotheby`s shareholders. Its stock has plunged 50 percent from its high in April of last year, this at a time when Sotheby`s expenses are increasing as it launches on to the Web. 

 AMY PAGE, ART EXPERT: People are wondering about Sotheby`s financial viability, not just because of these fines or the question of whether these people -- what if these might go to jail, but the fact that they just recently spent $44 million on an Internet venture I`m not sure how successful it really is. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISOVICZ: Sotheby`s vulnerability has fueled talk in the art world that the auction house itself may be on the blocks, and that one of the most  likely suitors would be Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH (URL: http://www.lvmh.com/) , whose recent acquisitions include Philip`s auction house, which remains a distant third to Sotheby`s and Christie`s, and that Sotheby`s interest in settling all its litigation is one of the conditions before any such deal can proceed -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Who is in the better position of these two companies as these criminal charges go forward? Is it Sotheby`s or is it Christie`s? 

 LISOVICZ: Well, they both paid a lot of money to settle, so they made it very clear that they want it to go away. But certainly the prevailing wisdom has been Christie`s is in the better position because it provided the government with some very damning information, but it gave it some game amnesty as it proceeded forward with the case. 

 VARNEY: And Christie`s is a privately held company? 

 LISOVICZ: Privately held. 

 VARNEY: Susan Lisovicz, thanks very much. 

 Well let`s just check in with the settlement and how it gave a boost to Sotheby`s stock. It is publicly traded. The bid -- the symbol, by the way, is BID, B-I-D. Sotheby`s gained 3 1/8 today -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, coming up next on MONEYLINE, we continue with our stock- picking stars. Today, we`ll talk with fund manager William Nygren about how he is beating the S&P 500. That`s next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Last week we brought you some of the top stock-picking stars in the technology sector. Today, we move to a mutual fund that`s zeroed in on consumer cyclicals. The Oakmark Select fund has more than 35 percent of its investments in the sector, and this concentrated fund holds just about 20 stocks in its entire portfolio. 

 Some of its top holdings include Washington Mutual (URL: http://www.wamu.com/) , up 46 percent year-to-date; Toys "R" Us (URL: http://www.toysrus.com/) up 18 percent; while Reynolds & Reynolds (URL: http://www.reyrey.com) is down nearly 20 percent. 

 As far as the overall fund, well, it continues to beat the averages, up 14 percent this year, while the S&P 500 index has fallen 2 percent. 

 Joining us with more from Chicago, William Nygren, fund manager of the Oakmark Select fund. 

 Bill, welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 WILLIAM NYGREN, OAKMARK SELECT FUND: Thank you. 

 BAY: You are a bottom-up stock picker, a value investors. You look at three things when you consider a stock. What are they? 

 NYGREN: First, we like to find a company that`s selling at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. To us, that`s the price that an all-cash buyer would pay if they were buying the entire company. We like to buy at less than 60 percent, and we sell at more than 90 percent. 

 The second thing is we like the per-share business values that are growing  as time passes. 

 And the third thing we look for, and I think this is an important one, is we want managements to be economically aligned with their shareholders. 

 BAY: Which means? 

 NYGREN: Which means that when they want to find out what`s happened to their net worth, they look at the stock price. 

 BAY: OK, let`s take a look at some of your top holdings, starting with Washington Mutual, as we just noted up about 46 percent year to date. What kind of earnings growth are you looking for with that company, what kind of growth overall? 

 NYGREN: Washington Mutual`s a stock. It`s done well this year, but at the current price it`s about nine times earnings. Their population centers are mostly on the West Coast and Sun Belt states, so their customer growth id a little bit above average. I think on a top-line basis they should grow a little better than the S&L industry, but importantly they generate a lot of free cash flow, and they`ve been utilizing that to shrink their equity base. So I would say on a top-line basis, Washington Mutual ought to have close to double-digit growth, but on a bottom-line basis, closer to 15 percent growth rate. And that`s despite paying a good dividend that they`ve been raising every quarter for the last five years. 

 BAY: Now given the consolidation in the financial industry lately, is this rife for a takeover? 

 NYGREN: Well, we never invest by trying to buy takeover candidates, but I think with Washington Mutual, because of their strong West Coast franchise, if the stock market doesn`t recognize the value that`s being created  here, it would become an attractive candidate for some of the East Coast institutions that would like to have a nationwide presence. 

 BAY: Real quickly, Toys`R`Us, seems to be some improvement there, new CEO in John Eyler. Clearly you have confidence in him. Why? He has a tough road ahead of him. 

 NYGREN: Well, Toys`R`Us is a company that`s been a difficult one for consumers to like, because most of us have had difficult shopping experiences there, sales help that hasn`t been adequate, stock outs. But John Eyler turned around FAO Schwarz. The seven years he spent there as CEO, he turned that company into one of the best consumer shopping experiences that`s out there today. I think he`ll do the same thing at Toys`R`Us. 

 BAY: All right, well we will keep an eye on Toys`R`Us. 

 Bill Nygren, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE. 

 NYGREN: Thank you. 

 BAY: Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Other big movers today, Cell Pathways plunged more than 20 1/2 points. That is a 69 percent drop. It`s a pharmaceutical company, and it said today that its lead cancer drug did not receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

 CIENA gained nearly seven points, moving to 127 1/2. That`s a new high. That on news that the Korea Telecom will use the fiber optic-equipment maker`s systems for Internet and data-network traffic. 

 Sprint PCS jumped 3 1/2, the third most active stock on the Big Board today. Lehman Brothers upgraded the wireless operator to a buy rating and said its shares could double over the next year. Lehman also said investors overreacted last week to the company`s warning of slowing subscriber growth. 

 Titan Pharmaceuticals (URL: http://www.titanpharm.com/) jumped nearly 10 points, that`s more than 21 percent. It`s a pharmaceutical company. They said today that clinical trials of its new schizophrenia drug produced positive results. 

 BAY: Next up on MONEYLINE, a nightmare for California consumers, a windfall for certain California businesses: the flip side of the electric utility crisis, a special look from Los Angeles. 

 Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: On the corporate front tonight, a deal in the insurance business. White Mountains Insurance (URL: http://www.fundamerican.com/) Insurance Group is buying the U.S. property-casualty business of Britain`s CGNU. The price tag: just over $2 billion, plus 470 million in debt assumption. 

 CGNU says it will hold on to its U.S. life insurance operations. 

 Vivendi (URL: http://www.vivendi.com/) and Seagram (URL: http://www.seagram.com/) are offering concessions to the European Commission in an effort to win clearance for their planned merger. The two companies agreed to merge in June. The deal will create a media giant called Vivendi Universal. The EU`s regulatory arm is set to rule on the merger within the next three weeks. Watson Pharmaceuticals (URL: http://www.watsonpharm.com/) -- that`s a maker of generic drugs -- said the FDA has approved its application to produce and market a generic equivalent to Ziac. That`s a hypertension drug. The drug will be manufactured by Aventis. 

 Now, take a look at all those stocks. White Mountains Insurance jumped 37 1/2 points. That`s a rally. Seagram gained fractionally. Vivendi, which only recently started trading on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped a quarter point. Watson Pharmaceuticals rose nearly a point -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, in recent months we have been covering the serious energy crisis that has hit California in the wake of electricity deregulation. Just last week, a heat wave pushed the state`s electrical grid to the brink of blackout. 

 But as with any crisis, some enterprising businesses can find opportunity. 

 Casey Wian looks at companies enjoying newfound profits in what was once a low-return business. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Capstone Turbine (URL: http://www.capstoneturbine.com/) makes small, relatively inexpensive power-generating machines known as microturbines, which can run on either natural gas or liquid fuel. Capstone sells to business looking for alternatives to the increasingly unreliable and expensive traditional power grid. 

 JEFFREY WATTS, CFO, CAPSTONE TURBINE: It eliminates the need for the wires that to go the central power to the customer by putting the generation actually on sight, and often times it`s the wire that poses the problem. WIAN: While most of the United States has plenty of power plants, many transmission and distribution systems, or power grids, are inadequate. Demand for electricity is booming along with the economy. So record demand combined with inefficient delivery is creating higher prices and power outages. 

 A growing number of business and residential are looking for cheaper, more reliable power sources, and that`s boosting the fortunes of companies such as Capstone. 

 Last year, it sold 211 microturbines. In one day last week, it announced orders for 350, or about the same number it sold during the entire first six months of 2000. 

 Capstone went public at 16 in June and rose above 40 its first day of trading. It neared 100 earlier this month before pulling back. 

 Wall Street is also taking notice of solar power. Delaware-based AstroPower (URL: http://www.astropower.com/) produces solar systems. The huge backlog of orders has helped its  stock more than double in two months. 

 In Southern California, these are boom times for small operators as well. 

 THOM BOWERS, PRESIDENT, DELIVERED SOLUTIONS.COM: The phone-call traffic, inquiry traffic for people looking at an alternative to seeing their power bill double has been huge. We see at least 30 percent growth over last year. 

 WIAN: Wind power is also taking off. California`s electric crisis has doubled sales for some wind turbine companies. 

 ANDY KRUSE, VICE PRESIDENT, SOUTHWEST WINDPOWER: In Southern California, you`ll find a person that has a $200 a month electric bill or something, and they can put one of our wind turbines in their backyard and reduce their electric bell by 40 to 60 percent. 

 WIAN (on camera): Because deregulation has reduced the financial incentive to invest in new transmission infrastructure, the nation`s power crunch is unlikely to ease any time soon. So demand for alternative energy sources is expected to continue to surge.

 Alcoa Reduces Estimates Amid Higher Inventories --- Benefits of Acquisitions Are Behind Schedule

 Is aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. losing its shine? 

 After five years of largely escaping the travails of the volatile aluminum industry, Pittsburgh-based Alcoa had some bad news for Wall Street this week. The company announced it would fall at least eight cents a share short of analysts' earnings expectations for the third quarter. What's more, Alcoa said its two big recent acquisitions, of Cordant Technologies Inc. and Reynolds Metals Co., won't begin contributing to its bottom line until early next year, a full quarter behind schedule. 

 Still, analysts say they are uncertain whether Alcoa's reduced profit outlook is a one-time occurrence or an indication of systemic weakness. The company didn't respond to a request for comment. 

 Alcoa's stock has fallen more than $4 a share this week in the wake of the profit warning. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, the stock was down 88 cents to $24.31, a new low for the year and a long way from the 52-week high of $43.63 set back in January. 

 Most U.S. aluminum makers have been taking it on the chin lately, despite a recent recovery in the price of the metal. Aluminum currently sells for about 71 cents a pound, up from a recent low of 65 cents in May but still below the 78 cents a pound it commanded at the start of the year. 

 The main problem, industry officials and analysts say, is that aluminum inventories in the U.S. have jumped 29% above last year's level, and orders are down 15%. The reason: Two key aluminum consumers, the building and construction industry and the truck-trailer and rail-car industry, are in the midst of a slowdown. 

 Other aluminum makers are smarting, too. Last month, Commonwealth Industries Inc. warned that weak demand in several key markets would result in a 20% drop in third-quarter shipments and a $2.5 million pretax charge. The Kentucky company also cut its work force by 15%. Kaiser Aluminum Corp., Alcan Aluminium Ltd. and other aluminum makers have laid off workers and shuttered some smelters because of skyrocketing energy costs. 

 But Alcoa, until now, has been largely immune to the industry's problems, and has reported eight consecutive quarters of earnings improvements. A relentless cost-cutting plan, a steady appetite for acquisitions and an increasingly diversified product mix have helped to shield it from seasonal slowdowns and occasional drops in aluminum prices in recent years. 

 Alcoa is still expected to post big profits when it announces its third-quarter results Oct. 5. The company has projected earnings in the range of 40 cents to 43 cents a share. That's equal to net income of between $350 million and $380 million, about a 35% increase over the year-earlier quarter. Earnings for the first nine months of the year are estimated to be 50% above the comparable year-earlier period. In this year's second quarter, Alcoa had its best quarter ever, with record-setting earnings of $377 million, or 95 cents a diluted share.

 Intel  profit warning  shakes up Wall Street

 NEW YORK -- Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of another profit warning by a bellwether company -- this time Intel Corp. 

 Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session. 

 Broader stock indicators also closed lower but well above the day's lows. 

 The NASDAQ composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology focused index fall 214 points at one point. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72. 

 "We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a little bleak this morning," said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 

 News that the seven largest industrial nations had stepped in to help buoy the ailing euro currency, as well as strong speculation throughout the day that the Clinton administration planned to dip into the nation's oil reserves to ease rising energy prices -- a speculation eventually borne out -- helped offset the near panic caused by Intel's warning. 

 Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three issues in recent weeks -- earnings, the decline in value of the euro, and rising energy prices. The "Big Three," he called them. 

 All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each condition affects the other. 

 In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the pinch in their European operations. 

 Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter revenues to fall below expectations. The company specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker results. 

 The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most widely held stocks. 

 Shares of Intel traded hands at breakneck speed on the NASDAQ Stock Market. Volume reached 304 million, shattering the all-time daily NASDAQ volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is 38 million shares. 

 "We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too high," said Gallagher. 

 Intel's shares closed down $13.55, or 22 percent, to $47.94. 

 Technology investors began fleeing the market in after-hours trading Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at Friday's opening. 

 Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also felt investors' wrath. Dell Computer dropped $2 to $35.94 and Applied Materials fell $3.50 to $70. 

 With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their expectations. 

 Strength in a handful of blue-chip sectors, including utilities and drugs, helped staunch the selling momentum that threatened to overwhelm the markets early in the session. 

 The utilities sector, which has served as a haven for frightened investors all year, was led by Duke Energy, up $1.25 at $75.88. Pharmacia Corp., up $3 to $59, helped lift the drug sector. 

 Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.17 billion shares, well ahead of Thursday's pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index rose 4.47 to 518.82. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.02 percent. Germany's DAX index was up 0.86 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.06 percent.

 The markets rose on the intervention to support the euro yesterday, as the low level of the currency was threatening to cut corporate results. However, investors' enthusiasm was dampened by Intel issuing a profit warning. However, London closed up 6.7 points; Frankfurt was up 0.49% after falling 3% in early trade; Paris rose by 0.06%; and Madrid was up 1.79% after buying pressure on Telefonica. In New York, by mid afternoon the Dow was down 0.98% and the Nasdaq was down 3.04% as telecoms and technology companies came under pressure.

 RESEARCH ALERT-Smeets cuts Lernout to "reduce".

 BRUSSELS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Belgian brokerage firm Smeets Securities said on Friday it had cut its rating for speech technology developer Lernout & Hauspie to "reduce" from "hold" amid worsening investor sentiment towards the stock. 

 "At the current share price and because of the negative sentiment, it will be very difficult for (Lernout) to increase its capital with at least $250 million (as they planned a few weeks ago)," read a research note by analyst Bert Maes. 

 "Also the investigation of the SEC and the results of the KPMG audit will weigh on the share price in the coming weeks," it said. 

 "The shares look rather cheap but we have doubts about the expected profitability for the coming years (the change in strategy might lead to profit and sales warning in the coming months)," he added. Lernout's stock was up $0.45 at a mid-price of $16.2 on the pan-European Easdaq market in Brussels a day after losing about a third of its value on news that U.S. regulators had opened a probe into the company's financial statements. 

 At the open of the U.S. market, Lernout was up $1.25 to $16.38. 

 Earlier on Friday, Lehman Brothers said it had cut Lernout to "underperform" from "neutral" and warned investors of the risk of a further drop of up to 30 percent in the share price. Lernout said it would conduct business as usual as the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) conducted its investigation. 

 Lernout has commissioned auditor KPMG to make a mid-year audit of its books following a newspaper report alleging discrepancies in its sales information. 

 On August 25, it said it had sought U.S. regulatory approval for the sale of up to $250 million in stock debt repayments and working capital.

 LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Sterling wiped out early gains to four-month peaks against the euro on Friday after central banks conducted joint intervention to halt the single currency's decline. 

 This was the first time since 1995 that the U.S., European and Japanese central banks had been spotted intervening in concert on the foreign exchanges and took currency markets by surprise. 

 The market had not expected central banks to intervene ahead of a weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. 

 "The central banks have definitely drawn a line in the sand for the euro now and one of the strong benefactors will be euro/sterling," said Bobby Jasper, senior currency trader at Fuji Bank in London. 

 "There is a lot of short covering because of the lows we got to yesterday and today, and that will continue for the rest of the day." 

 He said fears of further intervention, possibly later on Friday, would keep the market on its toes and the risk was for further gains in euro/sterling. 

 Euro/sterling had risen as high as 60.74 pence per euro by 1256 GMT according to Reuters data, up more than two percent from four-month lows it had set earlier in European trading. 

 Meanwhile, the pound benefited from the sapping of dollar strength. The U.S. currency had been dented earlier in the day after U.S. computer-chip maker Intel Corp issued a profit warning late in New York trading on Thursday. 

 It rose to one-month peaks of $1.4794 according to Reuters data, up more than three percent on the day. 

 Analysts said independent factors had been bolstering sterling even before central bank intervention. 

 The pound had benefitted from talk of merger and acquisition activity and renewed speculation of higher British interest rates, they said. 

 The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee's September meeting, released on Wednesday, showed the decision to keep interests on hold was a close call. 

 M&A flows this week have centred on talk that German power giant RWE AG was close to buying Britain's Thames Water Plc in a 4.1 billion pound cash deal.

 FOREX-Euro hits one-week highs vs dollar, yen, eyes G7.

 LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The euro rose to one-week highs against the dollar and the yen on Friday as investors positioned themselves for euro-supportive moves from a Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers this weekend. 

 A lively two-day rally in the pound against the dollar, helped by talk of sterling-positive merger and acquisition flows and a near-term British rate rise, also fed into euro gains, traders said. 

 "The euro is up because of caution and short-covering going into the G7 meeting," said Geraldine Concagh, economist at AIB Group Treasury in Dublin. 

 "But we are unlikely to get anything more than words of comfort from the G7, so there is a very strong risk we could be retreating again next week." 

 The euro was trading a little below its one-week highs, at $0.8617/22 EUR=) and 92.29/34 yen EURJPY=R at 0935 GMT, according to Reuters data, nearly two cents and more than two yen above record lows hit on Wednesday. 

 An overnight profit warning by U.S. chip maker Intel and a three percent fall in Tokyo's leading Nikkei index .N225) on Friday threw the single currency an additional lifeline, traders said. 

 Nasdaq 100 futures NDZ0) traded on Globex were quoted down 92 points at 0935 GMT, implying a poor open to the Nasdaq index in New York. 

 FINE WORDS SEEN FROM G7 

 Analysts said a euro-supportive statement was seen as the most likely outcome from this weekend's G7 meeting in Prague. 

 German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said on Friday that he and Italian Prime Minister Guiliano Amato were interested in a strong euro and that the European Union economy was in good condition, but his words failed to provide any added boost for the single currency. 

 More supportive for the euro was the European Central Bank's monthly report, released late on Thursday, in which the central bank said the weakness of the currency posed a risk to price stability. 

 Inflation data released Thursday and Friday by the German states of Saxony, Hesse and Bavaria also raised the likelihood of a euro-zone rate hike, analysts said. 

 Consumer prices in Saxony rose by 2.2 percent year-on-year, while the year-on-year gains in Hesse and Bavaria were 2.4 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. 

 Meanwhile, the European Central Bank said on Friday the continued strong growth of imports, primarly fuelled by rising oil prices and the depreciation of the euro, continued to be the driving force behing the euro-zone's narrowing trade surplus, to 35.5 billion euros, and widening current account deficit, to 14.0 billion euros, in the January-July period. 

 But most observers doubted there would be any long-lasting lift to the currency unless G7 resorted to co-ordinated intervention. 

 Doubts about the U.S. Federal Reserve taking part in any G7 rescue plan were reinforced overnight when U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Stuart Eizenstat repeated that the administration's strong dollar policy remained unchanged. 

 "This was not the fundamental turnaround people were looking for," said Ryan Shea, economist at Bank One in London. 

 "Some people have been a little bit cautious ahead of G7 and took out any short position they had. But if the G7 does not result in anything along the lines of co-ordinated intervention, selling should continue next week." 

 Analysts said one option was that the ECB would anticipate a bearish reaction to the G7 by intervening with the Bank of Japan on Monday morning or after the Danish euro referendum on September 28 in case of a "No" vote. 

 The latest influential Green's poll on Friday showed Danish euro opponents leading supporters by 51-44 percent. 

 Sterling rose to two-week highs against the dollar above $1.45 GBP=) and four-month highs against the euro beyond 59.50 pence EURGBP=) amid M&A-related flows this week centring on talk German power giant RWE AG was close to buying Britain's Thames Water Plc in a 4.1 billion pound deal. 

 Sterling was also benefiting from this week's encouraging monthly trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry, minutes showing a tight 5:4 vote to keep rates unchanged at the Bank of England's September monetary meeting, and the ruling euro-friendly Labour party's slide in opinion polls, analysts said. 

 The dollar, meanwhile, benefited from the euro's gains against the yen, rising above 107 yen JPY=) to its highest in two days. 

 The market was keeping an eye on oil prices after U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said on Thursday that President Bill Clinton was nearing a decision on releasing oil from strategic stocks. 

 Crude oil, which is priced in dollars, eased back from 10-year highs hit earlier in the week in anticipation of an increase in output and analysts said it could have an effect on foreign exchanges if the fall was to continue.

 Chartered leads Singapore techs tumble.

 SINGAPORE, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Singapore technology stocks fell sharply on Friday, led by Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, after U.S. computer-chip powerhouse Intel Corp.'s warning on revenues shook an already jittery market. 

 At 0416 GMT, index-heavyweight Chartered, which topped the actives, was down 10 percent or S$1.40 cents at S$11.60, accounting for an 18-point decline in the benchmark Straits Times index . 

 The electronics index slid some five points or about 3.4 percent to 153.98, while the STI was dowm 2.78 percent or 55.21 points at 1,933.60. 

 Other tech losers included Creative Technology , down S$1.30 to S$36.40 and Venture Manufacturing , dowm 60 cents to S$16.70. 

 Analysts contacted by Reuters said they were not surprised at Intel's negative impact on local technology stocks. 

 "Intel is the world's biggest semiconductor chipmaker in terms of market capitalisation. When it has dropped so much, it would definitely drag down the rest of the stocks," said Warren Lau, semiconductor analyst at HSBC Securities. 

 Intel shares slumped nearly 21 percent at one point in afterhours trading after its profit warning. 

 Theodore Teo, technology analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said local technology stocks would be affected by spillover sentiment from the United States. 

 But analysts said the local electronics sector would recover and that fundamentals remained strong, especially for Chartered. 

 "Even though we think that the stock could be volatile in the short term, we still have a buy recommendation on it based on its strong earnings momentum," said Lau. 

 Lau recently upgraded Chartered's full-year net profit forecast to US$230 million, with a compounded annual growth rate of 37 percent for the next three years. 

 Analysts also viewed the current downslide as a good opportunity for investors to pick up technology stocks. 

 "Obviously the short-term effect of any Intel warning is going to be negative on the stocks, but we believe that over the long term, these stocks would recoup losses that they have made so far," said Tayyib Ali Shah, electronics analyst at Indosuez W.I Carr. 

 Shah, who also had a buy for Chartered, saw fair value for the stock at S$18.10. 

 Independent research firm NetResearch-asia.com also said it remained positive over the medium term and viewed any correction as a good opportunity to pick up stocks they liked. 

 "Profit forecasts should be reasonable as well, so we do not expect any sharp negative surprises from local companies at this time," it said in a report.

 UPDATE 1-Toronto stocks end down, but recover from tech scare.

     TORONTO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Toronto stocks plunged more 

 than 200 points in early trading on Friday but took back most 

 of those losses by the close, proving resilient in the face of 

 a profit warning from Intel Corp. that many feared 

 would spell bleak days for world markets. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 composite index 

 ended 34.97 points, or 0.33 percent, lower at 10,566.00, its 

 third consecutive day of decline, after falling 239.77 points 

 within seconds of the opening on news of expected tepid revenue 

 and earnings growth at Intel, the world's No. 1 chip maker. 

 "It's not just a recovery. It's an aggressive accumulation 

 that to me is indicative of an underlying primary bull market. 

 I mean, I am surprised by the degree of enthusiasm that is 

 evident in tech stocks," said Gerald Vincent, vice president of 

 Davis-Rea Ltd. Investment Council in Toronto. 

 "You need a bull market to drive a bellwether crater like 

 Intel," he added. "What we have seen (in the TSE, Nasdaq and 

 other world markets) is remarkably limited collateral damage." 

 Nortel Networks Corp. , which represents a third of 

 the TSE 300, was down nearly C$5.00 immediately after the 

 opening but rebounded strongly to close up C$1.45 at C$98.90. 

 The blue chip S&P/TSE 60 index finished 1.63 

 points, or 0.26 percent, lower at 634.2 points. The tech-laced 

 Nasdaq index closed 0.66 percent, or 25.14 points, lower at 

 3803.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.76 percent, 

 or 81.85 points, higher at 10.847.37. 

 "It's been an incredible day," said a Toronto trader. "I 

 mean not only tech stocks recovered but the recovery was 

 broad." 

 Overall, nine of the 14 subindexes of the TSE 300 were in 

 negative territory at closing time, with decliners beating 

 advancers 647 to 385. When the exchange opened, 12 subindexes 

 were down. 

 The industrial products sector, which represents nearly 

 half of the index and which was down 1.46 percent during the 

 day, closed 0.31 percent higher. In that sector, fiber optic 

 equipment maker JDS Uniphase closed C$4.60 higher at C$158.28. 

 The gold and precious minerals sector entered its second 

 day of recovery on Friday, after falling since September 11 as 

 the euro strengthened against the dollar, driving up gold 

 prices. 

 COMEX gold ended up at $275.10 in New York, but well off 

 Friday's morning high of $279.20, shadowing the euro after the 

 world's big economies tried shoring up the ailing currency with 

 coordinated market intervention.

 LONDON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Sterling rallied to one-month peaks against the dollar and fell from earlier four-month highs on Friday as central banks undertook concerted euro-buying intervention to shore up the single currency. 

 This was the first time since 1995 that the U.S., European and Japanese central banks had been spotted intervening in concert on the foreign exchanges and took the currency markets by surprise. 

 Central banks had not been expected to intervene ahead of a weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. 

 "Cable (sterling/dollar) was looking well bid in the first instance and now with this intervention going on it is just piggy-backing off that as well," said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economic adviser at Bank of America in London. 

 "It (the intervention) has caught a lot of people by surprise and to that extent it is a major shock to the system and has had that much more of a market impact." 

 The euro's intervention-led recovery sent euro/sterling scampering up more than two percent from four-months lows it had set earlier in European trading at 59.34 pence per euro according to Reuters data. 

 The pound rallied more than three percent on the day, to one-month highs of $1.4794 according to Reuters data, before ceding more than one percent to the dollar. 

 The rise extended gains sterling had seen on Thursday and took it more than eight cents away from 14-year lows against the dollar set last week. 

 Since the intervention, dealers said there had been some profit-taking, however fears of further central bank activity would keep the market on its toes and sterling risked extending its losses against the euro. 

 "Until (the central banks) come in again, the euro is going to continue to slip off," said a trader at a British bank in London. 

 "But they should come in again. What they did earlier would be a waste of money if they are not going to it carry through." 

 UK RATE SPECULATION, M&A FLOWS GIVE CABLE A LEG UP 

 Prior to the intervention, sterling was bolstered by talk of merger and acquisition flows and amid renewed speculation of higher British interest rates. This helped sterling to trade independently from the euro, which it has been tracking more closely in recent months. 

 M&A flows this week have centred on talk that German power giant RWE AG was close to buying Britain's Thames Water Plc in a 4.1 billion pound cash deal. 

 A general decline in the dollar which was shaken by a profit warning from U.S. computer-chip maker Intel Corp late in New York trading on Thursday also bolstered the pound. 

 "The market got itself good and honestly short of sterling against the dollar in the last few weeks and unjustifiably so, given where relative interest rates were heading and the relative performance of the UK economy," said Kit Juckes, head of bond and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Financial Markets. 

 Prospects of a further hike in British interest rates were raised after the minutes of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee's September meeting were released earlier this week. 

 The minutes showed that members had voted 5:4 in favour of keeping interest rates on hold at 6.0 percent. 

 "The warning was there in the minutes of the MPC meeting that if sterling continued to fall and jeopardised the inflation outlook the MPC may have to look at things again," said Mark Henry, currency strategist at GNI in London. 

 December and March short sterling interest rate futures were on Friday pricing in slightly higher British interest rates. 

 The BOE's sterling trade-weighted index, which measures the pound against a basket of currencies of its main trading partners and is closely watched by the MPC, also rose. 

 The TWI was last at 107.0 , within six percent of 14-year peaks it had set in May and up around three points from two-month troughs set last week. 

 Dealers in Tokyo said sterling's initial recovery on Friday was also helped by talk that either a British or U.S. hedge fund was having to buy back sterling as a result of loss-making positions. 

 However dealers in Europe were sceptical that the rumours had much foundation. 

 "The markets are at a vulnerable stage because the stock markets are under real pressure now (after Intel)," said Bobby Jasper, senior currency trader at Fuji Bank in London. 

 "It is at times like this that everyone looks at hedge funds and rumours start and get exaggerated. There is probably no foundation to them."

 NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Investors flocked to consumer product stocks, including Gillette Co. and Colgate-Palmolive Co. and other safe-haven shares after a profit warning from Intel Corp. raised concerns that other technology companies may announce earnings shortfalls. 

 A strengthening euro added to the attractiveness of companies such as Procter & Gamble that post significant sales from outside the United States, investors said. 

 "Investors are flying out of the very technology stocks they loved last week in the knee-jerk reaction Wall Street is notorious for," said Cummins Catherwood, a portfolio manager with Philadelphia-based Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood. 

 "They're now going into the areas they ignored last week." 

 Colgate-Palmolive Co. maker of Colgate toothpaste, gained $1-9/16, or 3.7 percent, to $45-7/16 in afternoon trading. Cincinatti-based Procter & Gamble maker of Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste, rose $1-5/16, or 2 percent, to $63-15/16. 

 Boston-based Gillette Co. rose $1-1/16, or 3.7 percent, to 30. Gillette shares tumbled to their lowest level in four years earlier this week after the world's largest maker of razors and blades said the impact of the weak euro and lagging sales of Duracell batteries were cutting into its profit for the third quarter. 

 The flight to defensive stocks came after Intel said after the close Thursday that its revenues would miss forecasts, exacerbating concerns technology stocks would find it difficult to match the earnings growth of recent years. 

 The Morgan Stanley Consumer Products Index rose 1.7 percent, compared with the 3.2 percent decline in the Nasdaq Composite Index in afternoon trading. 

 Gains in the euro, which has lost 28 percent of its value against the dollar since its Jan. 1999 launch, were sparked when the major industrial powers jointly intervened to support the single European currency a day ahead of the meeting of the Group of Seven nations. 

 The effort, spearheaded by the European central bank, sent the euro as high as 90 cents before it fell back to 88.5 cents - above the previous day's close of 86 cents. 

 A stronger euro increases the profits of a U.S.-based company when those earnings are translated into the local currency. 

 "A company like Procter & Gamble does look interesting to us today," said Howard Kornblue, a money manager with ING Pilgim Inc. in Scottsdale, Arizona. 

 "The situation with the euro will not be as negative as people thought and the contribution to earnings from Europe will be more than expected." 

 Many consumer stocks have been punished this year. 

 Even with today's gains Colgate-Palmolive is down 30 percent year-to-date, while Procter & Gamble has posted a drop of 42 percent. Gillette is one of the few to report a gain this year, up 28 percent. 

 Drug and health care companies also gained as investors fled technology stocks. New Jersey-based drug company Merck & Co. rose 2, or 2.9 percent, to 72 1/4, and Johnson & Johnson maker of Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose $1-3/16, or 1.3 percent, to $95-3/8.

 Alcoa's  Profit Warning  Leaves Wall Street Puzzled --- Analysts Wonder If It's an Isolated Occurrence or a Sign of Deeper Problems

 Is aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. losing its shine? 

 After five years of largely escaping the travails of the volatile aluminum industry, Pittsburgh-based Alcoa had some bad news for Wall Street this week. The company announced it would fall at least eight cents a share short of analysts' earnings expectations for the third quarter. What's more, Alcoa said its two big recent acquisitions, of Cordant Technologies Inc. and Reynolds Metals Co., won't begin contributing to its bottom line until early next year, a full quarter behind schedule. 

 Still, analysts say they are uncertain whether Alcoa's reduced profit outlook is a one-time occurrence or an indication of systemic weakness. The company didn't respond to a request for comment. 

 Alcoa's stock has fallen more than $4 a share this week in the wake of the profit warning. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the stock was down $1.06 to $24.13, a new low for the year and a long way from the 52-week high of $43.63 set back in January. 

 Most U.S. aluminum makers have been taking it on the chin lately, despite a recent recovery in the price of the metal. Aluminum currently sells for about 71 cents a pound, up from a recent low of 65 cents in May but still below the 78 cents a pound it commanded at the start of the year. The main problem, industry officials and analysts say, is that aluminum inventories in the U.S. have jumped 29% above last year's level, and orders are down 15%. The reason: Two key aluminum consumers, the building and construction industry and the truck-trailer and rail-car industry, are in the midst of a slowdown. 

 Other aluminum makers are smarting, too. Last month, Commonwealth Industries Inc. warned that weak demand in several key markets would result in a 20% drop in third-quarter shipments and a $2.5 million pretax charge. The Louisville, Ky., company also cut its work force by 15%. Kaiser Aluminum Corp., Alcan Aluminium Ltd. and other aluminum makers have laid off workers and shuttered some smelters because of skyrocketing energy costs. 

 But Alcoa, until now, has been largely immune to the industry's problems, and has reported eight consecutive quarters of earnings improvements. A relentless cost-cutting plan, a steady appetite for acquisitions and an increasingly diversified product mix have helped to shield it from seasonal slowdowns and occasional drops in aluminum prices in recent years. 

 Alcoa is still expected to post big profits when it announces its third-quarter results  Oct. 5. The company has projected earnings in the range of 40 cents to 43 cents a share. That's equal to net income of between $350 million and $380 million, about a 35% increase over the year-earlier quarter. Earnings for the first nine months of the year are estimated to be 50% above the comparable year-earlier period. In this year's second quarter, Alcoa had its best quarter ever, with record-setting earnings of $377 million, or 95 cents a diluted share. 

 The downturn by the U.S. aluminum industry has come as a surprise. It was thought that a seemingly mild hiccup earlier this year that sent prices and optimism south would reverse itself, and the industry would pick up in the second half. That didn't happen, leaving fat inventories and sluggish sales of new aluminum and alumina, the key ingredient from which aluminum is made. Reynolds Metals, which was the third-largest aluminum maker before Alcoa bought it this spring, has been hard hit. Alcoa had initially expected Reynolds to have a neutral effect on its third-quarter earnings and then turn positive in the fourth quarter. Instead, because of the industry's problems, the Reynolds acquisition has proved a drain on Alcoa's third-quarter profit. 

 Analysts also say that Alcoa's results won't be fully reflective of the company's profits. To satisfy antitrust concerns, Alcoa was forced to sell Reynolds's interest in smelters in Australia, Germany and the U.S. for a total of about $4.5 billion. But accounting rules dictate that Alcoa can't book the earnings of these assets until the sale of the smelters is finalized. 

 Analysts also say that new Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules have reduced communication between Alcoa and the professional investment community. Consequently, analysts who had been privy in the past to detailed financial information about Alcoa have had to settle for fewer details, which could have thrown off their quarterly profit forecasts. "I put most of the blame on Wall Street," said Credit Suisse First Boston aluminum analyst Thomas Van Leeuwen. "I thought analysts' expectations were a little too exuberant," he said. 

 Alcoa's stock began drifting downward in January, in line with aluminum prices. The stock fell again in May, when the company announced the purchase of Cordant Technologies, a supplier of gas turbines, aluminum castings and jet propulsion systems. Alcoa has been criticized for its purchase of Cordant because it takes the aluminum giant further away from its core operations. Also, Cordant, which is based in Odgen, Utah, was unfamiliar to many on Wall Street and analysts were reluctant to bet on the success of a company they knew little about. 

 This summer, Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Alain P. Belda bemoaned investors' reaction to the Cordant acquisition, saying he hadn't done a good enough job explaining the anticipated synergies. Now that Cordant is behind schedule in contributing to Alcoa's earnings, Mr. Belda may have even more explaining to do.

 General Motors Still Expects to Meet Analysts' Expectations for Third Period

 DETROIT -- At a time when auto suppliers and rival car makers are issuing earnings warnings or conceding that profits are under pressure, General Motors Corp.'s third quarter is going according to script, according to G. Richard Wagoner Jr., president and chief executive officer. 

 "I have nothing different to say about earnings than I have been saying in past months," Mr. Wagoner said in an interview. "I have no profit warning to issue." 

 The No. 1 auto maker has been saying it expects third-quarter results to be in line with Wall Street analysts' expectations. According to First Call/Thomson Financial, the mean of 18 analysts' estimates for GM's third quarter is net income of $1.59 a share, up from the year-earlier $1.33. 

 By contrast, about a dozen auto-related companies have begun signaling lower third-quarter results, reflecting the weak euro and production cuts at Ford Motor Co. related to the Firestone tire crisis, according to Morgan Stanley's Stephen Girsky. 

 Ford's earnings are expected to decline to around 50 cents a share from the year-earlier 70 cents, based on First Call/Thomson Financial's consensus of estimates. Last week, Henry Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, said the No. 2 auto maker still expected to hit the third-quarter target but cautioned that disruptions caused by fuel protests in Europe and the Firestone tire crisis in the U.S. could hurt profit. 

 And although DaimlerChrysler AG isn't commenting, Wall Street analysts are worrying that its third-quarter results will be worse than the company had signaled in July, when it warned results would be lackluster. Some analysts are lowering their estimates based on published reports that the concern's Chrysler unit in the U.S. will report a substantial operating loss. 

 For its part, GM says it hasn't been affected by problems with Firestone tires, which are related to tires produced specifically for Ford vehicles, and its operations in Europe have been doing better than Ford's. Meanwhile, amid increasing pressure to discount its vehicles, GM in recent weeks has imposed a series of cost controls aimed at reducing discretionary spending, limiting employee travel, overtime and the use of consultants.

 Singapore Technology Stocks Tumble On Intel Warning

 SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Semiconductor, electronics and other technology stocks tumbled in Singapore in reaction to Friday's warning by Intel Corp. (INTC) that revenue may be lower than expected. 

 Analysts warned that heavy selling of technology-related shares, which play a major role in Singapore's overall market, could continue next week on fears that lower demand for microprocessor chips such as those made by Intel could spill over into other segments of the computer industry. 

 The sale of technology stocks in Singapore was part of a selling wave across Asia, which is heavily dependent on exports of electronics products to the U.S. and Europe. 

 The Singapore Equities Electronics Index fell 4.02% to 153.09 points, dragging the Straits Times Index to a new three-and-a-half month low Friday. The STI closed 2.81% down at 1932.99 points. 

 Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (CHRT), the third-largest semiconductor foundry in the world, was among the biggest losers. It lost S$1.50, or 12%, to close at S$11.50. 

 Chartered Semiconductor, which is also listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, is Singapore's fourth-largest company by market capitalization. 

 Venture Manufacturing Ltd. (P.VMF) closed 60 Singapore cents lower, or 3.5%, at S$16.70 and NatSteel Electronics Ltd. (P.NSE), a contract manufacturer catering mostly to the personal computer market, closed 30 Singapore cents lower, or 5.9%, at S$4.80. 

 Intel said after the close of trading in the U.S. Thursday that it expected revenue growth in the third quarter to come to between 3% and 5% over the second quarter. In turn, Intel said, third quarter gross margins will be around 62%, off its earlier estimates of between 63%-64%. It attributed the cut in margins to slower demand growth in Europe. 

 Some 40% of semiconductors are used in PCs. And since Intel commands more than 70% of the microprocessor chip market, a slowdown in demand for Intel's products is quickly taken to mean a general slowdown in industry growth. 

 But analysts caution that Intel's woes may not be industry-wide but may be limited to the company itself. 

 Intel may have issued a warning yesterday because competing chip maker Applied Micro Devices Inc. is eating into Intel's market share, said Abraham Leu, semiconductor analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. 

 Edwin Tay, an analyst at BT Brokerage, said the warning isn't an indication of a slowdown in global PC demand this year. 

 "Intel is probably just cutting back over-optimistic growth forecasts for the industry," he said. 

 However, technology stocks that already faced a bearish market were quick to react. Market sentiment has been weak on concerns over high oil prices and the traditional summer season lull which lasts through October, Tay said. 

 But other analysts said demand indications from a large company like Intel are important since contract manufacturers often build inventories based on projections of their large customers. 

 They said shares of semiconductors and contract manufacturers will continue to be pressured in the near term. 

 Prudential's Leu said industry experts and analysts are now looking at October demand, to see whether fourth quarter demand kicks in. 

 A Singapore-based Intel spokesman said despite the company's profitwarning for the third quarter, its gross margin forecast for the full year is unchanged around 63%. 

 Analysts say this could indicate that a slowdown in third quarter chip demand is temporary and will be reversed in the fourth quarter. 

 The PC market grew a disheartening 3% in the third quarter, Leu said. He added that the second half is the high demand season for PCs, due to Christmas buying. 

 He pointed out however, that the first half enjoyed robust growth this year. "(Some) 50% of the full year forecasted growth took place in the first half", he said, adding that the PC market was expected to grow between 15%-17% this year. Demand last year was around 110 million units.

 ANOTHER wave of selling hit telecom shares in London and overseas, as a profit warning from US giant Sprint added to growing fears about soaring telecom debts. BT slumped another 43p to 748p, down 50pc in a year. Vodafone tumbled 71/2p to 2391/2p, down 40pc since March. Colt fell 87p to 1953p, Energis 30p to 495p. 

 European telecom borrowings have soared 43pc in two years to #116bn, as companies spent heavily expanding fixed and mobile operations. BT accounts for the lion's share in Britain, owing nearly #30bn. 

 Analysts reject comparisons with Third World debts, pointing out the telecom companies have strong cash flows, growing revenues - and reasonably honest managers. 

 But borrowing costs have risen sharply and major telcos are struggling to adjust to their newly unloved market status. 

 The City wants BT to float off businesses and cut back on European expansion plans, but a lukewarm presentation earlier this week downplayed hopes over BT Wireless. One worried analyst said: 'I think they don't want to float it at all'. 

 However, BT and AT&T seem likely to merge their business services operations into a new company. 

 With major companies offering higher yields, marginal players may struggle to raise new money and may be forced to merge. 

 Hanging over the entire sector are the expected floats this autumn of mobile groups Orange, T-Mobile and Telefonica Mobiles.

 NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of another profit warning by a bellwether company _ this time chipmaker Intel Corp. 

 Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session. 

 Broader stock indicators also closed lower, but well above their lows for the day. 

 The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology focused index fall 214 points at one point. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72. 

 ``We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a little bleak this morning,'' said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 

 News that the seven largest industrial nations had stepped in to help buoy the ailing euro currency, as well as strong speculation throughout the day that the Clinton administration planned to dip into the nation's oil reserves to ease rising energy prices _ a speculation eventually borne out _ helped offset the near panic caused by Intel's profitwarning. 

 Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three issues in recent weeks _ earnings, the decline in value of the euro, and rising energy prices. The ``Big Three,'' he called them. 

 All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each condition affects the other. 

 In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the pinch in their European operations. 

 Intel, the world's largest chipmaker announced after the close of Thursday's trading session that it expects third-quarter revenues to fall below expectations. The company specifically blamed a falloff in demand in Europe for the weaker results. 

 The news prompted analysts at half a dozen investment banks to lower their ratings on Intel's stock Friday, further fueling the atmosphere of panic among investors in one of Wall Street's most widely held stocks. 

 Shares of Intel traded hands at breakneck speed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Volume reached 304 million, shattering the all-time daily Nasdaq volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle Corp. in December 1997. Intel's average daily volume is 38 million shares. 

 ``We got this shocker from Intel, which is probably the leading tech game in town, and that really frightened people into thinking that perhaps some of the valuations in the tech area might be too high,'' said Gallagher. 

 Intel's shares closed down $13.55, or 22 percent, to $47.94. 

 Technology investors began fleeing the market in after-hours trading Thursday evening, and that exodus expanded in scope at Friday's opening. 

 Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also felt investors' wrath. Dell Computer dropped $2 to $35.94 and Applied Materials fell $3.50 to $70. 

 With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their expectations. 

 Strength in a handful of blue-chip sectors, including utilities and drugs, helped staunch the selling momentum that threatened to overwhelm the markets early in the session. 

 The utilities sector, which has served as a haven for frightened investors all year, was led by Duke Energy, up $1.25 at $75.88. Pharmacia Corp., up $3 to $59, helped lift the drug sector. 

 Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.4 billion shares, well ahead of Thursday's pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index rose 4.47 to 518.82.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks were mostly lower Friday, as another profitwarning by a bellwether company - this time chipmaker Intel Corp. - prompted investors to flee the markets.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks plunged across the board Friday, as another profit warning by a bellwether company - this time chipmaker Intel Corp. - prompted investors to flee the markets. 

 In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 110.53 to 10,654.99. 

 Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology focused Nasdaq composite index was down 110.03 at 3,718.84, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 20.49 at 1,428.56. 

 Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three issues in recent weeks - earnings, the decline in value of the euro, and rising energy prices. The "Big Three," he called them. 

 All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example. 

 In this case, with Europe's single currency hovering around all-time lows, large, multinational corporations are feeling the pinch in their European operations.

 Shares of Intel were trading hands at a breakneck speed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Volume reached 197 million shares before noon, breaking in just half a session the alltime daily volume record of 172 million shares set by Oracle Corp. in December 1997.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks staged a notable recovery Friday after being dragged down most of the day in the wake of another profit warning by a bellwether company - this time chipmaker Intel Corp. 

 Bargain hunters moved in about midday, helping the Dow Jones industrial average close up 81.85 at 10,847.37, after the blue-chip index had dropped more than 140 points early in the session. 

 Broader stock indicators also closed lower, but well above their lows for the day. 

 The Nasdaq composite index finished down 25.11 at 3,803.76, regaining nearly all of the losses that saw the technology focused index fall 214 points in midmorning. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.33 at 1,448.72. 

 "We got a reprieve from the hangman today. Things looked a little bleak this morning," said Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 

 News that the seven largest industrial nations had stepped in to help buoy the ailing euro currency, as well as strong speculation throughout the day that the Clinton administration planned to dip into the nation's oil reserves to ease rising energy prices - a speculation eventually borne out - helped offset the near panic caused by Intel's profitwarning. 

 Thomas Gallagher, head of U.S. equity trading at CIBC World Markets, said investors have been concerned primarily with three issues in recent weeks - earnings, the decline in value of the euro, and rising energy prices. The "Big Three," he called them. 

 All three are intertwined in the global marketplace, Gallagher noted, citing the Intel warning as a textbook example of how each condition affects the other.

 Intel led the way, but other widely held technology stocks also felt investors' wrath. Dell Computer dropped $2 to $35.94 and Applied Materials fell $3.50 to $70. 

 With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their expectations. 

 Strength in a handful of blue-chip sectors, including utilities and drugs, helped staunch the selling momentum that threatened to overwhelm the markets early in the session. 

 The utilities sector, which has served as a haven for frightened investors all year, was led by Duke Energy, up $1.25 at $75.88. Pharmacia Corp., up $3 to $59, helped lift the drug sector. 

 Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume to 1.4 billion shares, well ahead of Thursday's pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index rose 4.47 to 518.82. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.02 percent. Germany's DAX index was up 0.86 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.06 percent.

 Europe earnings hit as oil dents euro buffer. 

 By Louise Ireland

 LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Soaring crude oil prices are beginning to dent European corporate earnings forecasts, biting into the buffer provided by a weaker euro, equity strategists said on Thursday. 

 Oil spiked to a 10-year peak at $34.98 for Brent crude on Monday while the euro dropped to record lows of 84.50 cents on Wednesday. European firms are heavily exposed to a double-whammy on dollar-priced oil with euro weakness exacerbating the cost. 

 That is starting to feed into analysts' expectations. 

 "There's been a drop in earnings forecasts for the first time this year and, although that's within the margin of error, the key point is that we've stopped seeing the upgrades," said ABN Amro European equity strategist George Hodgson. 

 ABN figures showed a 0.6 percent downturn in earnings forecasts ex-oil and ex-financials this month, he said, compared with this year's pattern so far of a steady rise in forecasts with a peak for earnings in August at about 16 percent. 

 Hodgson noted growing evidence that a squeeze on U.S. manufacturing margins, largely due to dollar strength, cut into the profit outlooks of European firms with high U.S. manufacturing exposure. 

 French auto parts supplier Valeo said on Monday it would fall short of its 2000 profit target due to high raw materials prices, problems in the North American market and weaker demand for its replacement parts. 

 Industrial automation company Rockwell warned on earnings later the same day, and on Thursday British Plaster Board issued a profit warning, blaming the strength of U.S. competition and the pound. 

 IBES CONCURS 

 Earnings estimates company IBES told Reuters that profit forecast downgrades for European companies worsened over the last month with 10 sectors out of 18 being revised down, compared with seven out of 18 last month. 

 IBES said that as a rule analysts begin the year pessimistic and grow more optimistic as the year wears on, tending to revise forecasts upwards. 

 But this year has proved the exception. And even among the oil companies, which have been star performers as crude prices rocket ahead, the trend is not highly positive, IBES said. 

 This month 14 oil company forecasts were revised upwards and nine down compared with last month when 12 were revised up and three down. Earnings growth for the energy sector rose 2.1 percent on the month to 66 percent, according to IBES. 

 DISSENT 

 However, some strategists say the exchange rate buffer has life in it yet, and others say the angst over oil and the euro has been overdone. 

 Merrill Lynch European equity strategist Plum Shipton said that earnings still had potential for upgrades. 

 "Most analysts still have the euro at parity with the dollar, rather than lower, and that gives further upside to earnings," she said, noting that earnings had risen by two percent over the last quarter, with oils the biggest gainers and telecoms the worst losers. 

 "The effect of oil prices tends to be industry specific in the short term and analysts are not yet making the assumption that oil will feed into higher inflation and higher interest rates, nor are they being told by the companies to do so," she said, noting that the market was also slow to factor in the offsetting effect of a weaker euro. 

 Separately, but condoning the same argument, one of Wall Street's most widely-watched strategists Goldman Sachs' Abby Joseph Cohen said on Thursday that equities market concerns about higher oil prices, a weak euro and corporate profits are "overdone" and will be "short-lived". 

 "Investors have been recently unnerved by an assortment of developments and concerns," Cohen said in a note to clients. 

 "We conclude that the reaction to these has been somewhat overdone and that the intermediate-and long-term view remains quite bright." 

 That said, European markets languished near 10-week lows late on Thursday, pounded by anxiety over a weak euro and fears that higher energy costs will dent consumer spending, push up inflation and hurt corporate profitability. 

 Even market optimists see that although a higher oil price does not necessarily mean higher inflation, the squeeze on manufacturing profit margins is on.

 Euro telco funding, Sprint fears spark sell frenzy.

 LONDON, September 21 (Reuters) - A wave of selling hit European telecoms on Thursday, after news of U.S. carrier Sprint's profit warning and an impending share placement by Britain's Energis heightened fears for corporate earnings. 

 In a highly nervous trading environment, leading telecoms stocks were further hurt by an unfounded rumour that UBS Warburg had cut its sector rating. 

 "It's a very nervous market and we are seeing a lot of fear after the initial greed which sent these stocks higher earlier in the year," said a senior equity sales trader. 

 At 1055 GMT the DJ Stoxx telecom sector was down 3.19 percent at 577.94 points, its lowest level since November. 

 British Telecom sank 6.57 percent and Vodafone lost 2.63 percent, while Deutsche Telekom fell 3.3 percent and France Telecom shed 4.98 percent, the latter also hit by modest price targets from Lehman Brothers and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. 

 Energis sank 5.6 percent following Wednesday's news it planned to raise 400 million pounds via a share placement, which traders said had hit sector sentiment hard. 

 "Energis was considered to be one of the stronger financial companies, and this has unleashed a fear that everyone else will have to do the same thing. There are real concerns about the amount of capital these firms are going to have to raise to fund investment in third generation licences," the trader said. 

 "The Sprint profit warning has had a big impact on Vodafone while Deutsche Telekom is hit because it is buying Voicestream , which has a similar business," he added. 

 Sprint said its third-quarter earnings could be hit by more competition and a government proposal to cut minimum charges on long-distance calls.

 PARIS, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Shares in France Telecom fell 4.81 percent in Thursday trading as two brokerages assigned modest targets to the share price and as a profit warning from U.S. firm Sprint Corp. knocked confidence in the sector. 

 At 1020 GMT, France Telecom was trading at 114.7 euros. The CAC-40 index was down 1.82 percent at the time. 

 Lehman Brothers cut its price target to 140 euros from 165 euros, keeping its rating at "outperform". Investors were also spooked by a modest 136 euro price target from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney on Thursday, when it started coverage of France Telecom with a "neutral" rating. 

 "I think we have probably had a bottom here but I wouldn't put a bet on it," a trader said, adding that concerns over the telecom sector, rising oil prices and deflated euro could drag telecom shares still lower. 

 Telecom shares were also jittery after U.S. carrier Sprint on Wednesday warned of lower third-quarter profits amid stiff competition in the long distance telephone market and fewer-than-expected subscribers in its wireless telephone unit. 

 Shares in the wireless unit Sprint PCS Group fell 18.8 percent on Wednesday, its lowest level in over a year.

 Sprint Corp. on Wednesday warned that its third-quarter profit would be less than Wall Street expected, and the market responded by pushing shares of both Sprint and Sprint PCS to 12-month lows. 

 Sprint PCS dropped almost 19 percent, closing at $33 a share, down $7.81. 

 Sprint Corp. stock, whose ticker symbol is FON, went as low as $26.13 but closed at $26.81, down $1.50. Sprint hit its lowest price since February 1998. Shares last November were selling as high as $75.94. 

 Officials of the Westwood-based company said early Wednesday that they expected earnings of 45 to 47 cents a share, below analysts' expectations for Sprint's long-distance and local telephone operations and data business. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call//Thompson Financial had expected Sprint to earn 49 cents a share. 

 Shares in PCS, Sprint's tracking stock, took the bigger hit. 

 Sprint said it expected to add 800,000 customers to its PCS unit in the third quarter. Analysts had expected the company to add 900,000. 

 Actually, Sprint added 1.1 million but netted only 800,000 after losing about 300,000 customers to churn and the disconnection of those with outstanding bills. 

 The company's churn rate -- the number of customers who leave -- was expected to increase to nearly 3 percent a month. The rate had dropped during the second quarter. 

 Company officials said they were trying to add more high-dollar customers, including those who use the Sprint PCS Wireless Web and other premium services. 

 By year's end, Sprint PCS is aiming for more than 10 million subscribers, company officials said. 

 Colette Fleming, a New York-based analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said Wall Street wasn't looking at the PCS Group's overall strong revenue picture. 

 "It seems like the market is focusing on negative news, but I expect to see good news at the quarter. I believe that the market has overreacted," Fleming said. 

 ABN Amro analyst Kevin Roe lowered his third-quarter earnings estimate for Sprint to 46 cents a share from 49 cents a share. He also cut his 2000 per-share earnings estimate to $1.93 from $1.98 and his long-distance revenue growth projection to 5 percent from 6 percent. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. analyst Daniel Reingold also lowered earnings and growth estimates, but he continued a "strong buy" rating. Reingold lowered his target price for FON stock to $52 a share. 

 "We believe that Sprint is cheap," Reingold said. 

 Sprint's formal quarterly earnings report is expected Oct. 17.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Nasdaq and smaller-capitalization shares lost ground Thursday, as investors saw profit opportunities from the prior two days of gains. 

 The market's movement marked a reverse of course from Wednesday, when the Nasdaq Composite Index moved ahead while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped back. 

 Coming into Thursday's session, the Nasdaq had put together back-to-back gains after several days of losses. 

 That kind of up-and-down action has characterized the market lately. On Thursday, investors' favorites were drug, trucking and retail stocks. They sold off shares in the optical networking, computer component and financial services sectors. 

 On Friday, things could be very different. The market is pretty rudderless right now, analysts say. 

 "What you have is a lot of uncertainty, a lack of real direction," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Securities. 

 Dwyer said investors are unnerved by "the three e's," the economy, the euro and earnings, due to a spate of pre-announcements. 

 He expects stocks to remain volatile until early next month, when actual third-quarter earnings start coming in. 

 Then, "we could see a snap back," Dwyer said. "There will be a chance to move forward on news." 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 68.57 points, or 1.76%, to 3828.87. 

 The Russell 2000 index, a broad barometer of small-cap stocks, fell 7.08, or 1.36%, to 514.36. The Wilshire small-cap index, a narrower measure of 250 small stocks from the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, shed 12.75, or 1.47%, to 852.12. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 77.60, or 0.73%, to 10765.52. 

 The Nasdaq composite was pushed down by weakness across the board, with technology bearing the brunt of the selling. 

 The telecommunications index - beaten back Wednesday after Sprint's profit warning - lost another 1.78%. 

 The Nasdaq computer index, which is made up of small and large technology stocks, shed 1.99%. The index of the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq stocks, which is dominated by technology issues, lost 1.91%. 

 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index fell 4.49% and the American Stock Exchange Internet Index moved down 1.89%. 

 The transportation sector, after being up earlier in the day, slipped 0.08% 

 Among other industry groups, the Nasdaq biotech index was off 1.16% and the industrial index dropped 1.59%. 

 The bank index tumbled 1.01% and the insurance barometer was 0.22% lower. 

 The index that tracks financial stocks other than banks was the only barometer to advance, with a 0.53% gain. 

 On the Nasdaq, declining issues led of advancers, 2,390 to 1,463, on national market volume of 1.537 billion shares and overall volume of 1.572 billion shares. 

 Lernout & Hauspie tumbled $6.13, or 29%, to $15.13. The Belgian developer of speech recognition systems confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its prior financial statements. SG Cowen suspended its buy rating on the stock, and Ladenburg Thalmann cut its rating to neutral from buy, in addition to dropping the stock from its focus list. 

 NYSE-traded Mueller Industries dropped $6.94, or 24%, to $22.06. The Memphis manufacturer of tubing, fittings and valves expects to earn 50 to 55 cents a share in the third quarter, below last year's 66 cents. The company cited a sudden increase in raw material costs for components like copper and resin, and said market conditions have become extremely competitive. 

 Concero shed 88 cents, or 20%, to $3.50. The Austin, Texas, information technology consulting firm said it expects to post a loss for the third quarter on revenues that will be 15% to 20% below the second quarter's $17.1 million. Analysts had expected the company to post a profit of 4 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Concero blamed the shortfall on additions to bad debt reserves and lower sales. 

 Corrpro (NYSE) lost 56 cents, or 13%, to $3.69. The Medina, Ohio, provider of anti-corrosion engineering services said it expects fiscal second-quarter earnings of 5 to 10 cents a share, compared with 27 cents in the same period a year ago. Corrpro also said it is working with bankers to amend debt agreements, since it expects to exceed certain financial covenants. The company will cut 80 jobs, close two underperforming units and cut back in areas like sales and marketing. 

 Ionics (NYSE) dropped $8.94, or 28%, to $23.56. The Watertown, Mass., maker of water purification products said expects third-quarter earnings to be 40% lower than analysts' view of 35 cents a share, due to operating losses in Malaysia and Australia. Robert Baird cut its rating on the stock to market outperform from strong buy. 

 Mergers pushed a number of small-cap shares higher. 

 WesterFed Financial gained $4.13, or 26%, to $19.88. Glacier Bancorp will buy the Missoula, Mont., bank holding company for 1.1 Glacier shares plus $9.05 in cash for each WesterFed share. Glacier, Kalispell, Mont. dropped $1.44, or 11%, to $11.44. 

 Jefferson Savings added $2, or 17%, to $13.75. Union Planters agreed to buy the St. Louis holding company by swapping 0.433 of its shares for each share of Jefferson Savings. Union Planters (NYSE) dropped 38 cents, or 1.1%, to $32.88. 

 Sunburst Hospitality (NYSE) added $1.31, or 24%, to $6.88. The Silver Springs, Md., owner and manager of hotels will be sold to a group of shareholders and managers led by Sunburst chairman Steward Bainum for $7.38 a share in cash. Bainum and his family already control 46% of the company's shares. 

 Paradigm Geophysical added 88 cents, or 15%, to $6.88. The Herzlia, Israel, developer of computer aided exploration systems said it received a multimillion-dollar contract from TGS-NOPEC Geophysical to research the Mississippi Canyon section of the Gulf of Mexico. 

 Renal Care Group added $3.69, or 23%, to $19.81. The Nashville provider of dialysis and other kidney services said that earnings for the second half of the year will fall short of expectations, and Morgan Stanley, Legg Mason and Dain Rauscher downgraded the stock. But speculation was rife that the company might begin a share repurchase program. Some 4.8 million shares traded Thursday, compared with average daily volume of 597,000. 

 InKine Pharmaceutical advanced $1.19, or 15%, to $9.13. The Blue Bell, Pa., drug company received Food and Drug Administration approval for its Visicol tablets, a kind of sodium phosphate used to clean the bowels before colonoscopy. 

 PhotoWorks jumped 75 cents, or 24%, to $3.88. The Seattle photofinishing and online image company said it will provide services to Yahoo! through a new film development area in Yahoo's Photos section.

 Sprint Pummeled After  Profit Warning  Telecom: Despite shortfall, the company says growth expectations remain on target for the year.

 NEW YORK -- Shares of Sprint Corp. fell to nearly a three-year low Wednesday after it warned of lower third-quarter profit amid stiff competition in the long-distance telephone market and fewer-than-expected subscribers in its wireless telephone unit. 

 Shares of the wireless unit, Sprint PCS Group, plunged 19% to its lowest level in over a year after it said increased competition and its decision to cancel some unprofitable customers would hurt its third-quarter subscriber growth. 

 Until now, Sprint PCS had been known for setting industry records for its subscriber growth. "Here's PCS that beats [estimates] all the time and here they are taking their numbers down and that's what's got people nervous," said Chris Larsen, wireless analyst at Prudential Securities. 

 Despite the third-quarter profit shortfall, the Sprint parent company said it remained on target to meet its growth expectations for the year. Its cautious outlook for the third quarter followed similar warnings by its larger long-distance rivals and triggered another broad sell-off in the already downtrodden telecommunications sector. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Sprint fell $1.44, or 5%, to close at $26.81, and Sprint PCS, which trades as a tracking stock, plunged $7.56 to $33.25. 

 The U.S. telecom group, main casualties of April's technology stock implosion, has suffered amid investors' concerns about increased competition and price wars in the long-distance telephone market, rising capital spending costs as companies build out wireless and data networks, and the collapse of Sprint's merger with WorldCom Inc. The recent telecom stock weakness follows gains in the sector of more than 50% last year. 

 AT&T Corp. and WorldCom earlier this year scaled back their growth projections for the year, citing intense competition in the long-distance market. Sprint's warning confirmed that all of the telecom giants have been hard hit by price wars and competition, analysts said. 

 "The blind telecom euphoria of a year ago is over. Now, more than ever, telecom stock buyers need to be selective and vigilant. . . . The companies that meet or beat [Wall Street] expectations will outperform the market. You can't rely any longer on consolidation to be a catalyst for the sector," said ABN AMRO analyst Kevin Roe. 

 Sprint said it expects third-quarter earnings to be between 45 cents and 47 cents a share for its core FON Group, which includes long-distance and local telephone operations and its data business. 

 Analysts on average had expected earnings of 49 cents, with estimates ranging from 47 cents to 51 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Revenue for the FON Group is expected to grow about 4% in the quarter, driven mainly by growth in data services and bundled service offerings, and partially offset by price pressure in voice services. 

 Regulatory costs and seasonally higher maintenance costs in its local operations also weighed on the quarter's results, the company said. 

 Sprint reiterated that its core earnings for 2000 would grow at a mid-teens rate from the $2.31 reported for the full year 1999. 

 While weakness in the long-distance telephone business had been somewhat expected, the slower subscriber growth at Sprint PCS caught investors off guard, analysts said. 

 Sprint PCS said it would add only 800,000 new customers in the third quarter--about 100,000 fewer than Wall Street expected. 

 Sprint PCS cited increased competition and the company's decision to cancel some unprofitable customers. The customer cancellations would push its customer turnover, or churn, to the high 2% to 3% range, which would be above Wall Street expectations. 

 Still, Sprint PCS expects to add 4 million customers for the year, bringing its total to 10 million, including affiliates and resale customers. To meet that full-year target, analysts said the wireless company must add about 1.5 million customers in the fourth quarter, analysts said. 

 Sprint PCS' cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will be in the low $100-million range, which is above Wall Street expectations of about $60 million to $70 million, analysts said. 

 Sprint is set to report its earnings Oct. 17.

 Tampa, Fla.-Based Sykes Issues  Profit Warning , Again

 TAMPA, Fla.--Sykes Enterprises Inc., cementing its reputation as a company that can't meet its own forecasts, said Tuesday it will lose 8 cents to 10 cents per share in the third quarter, not gain 24 cents as Wall Street analysts had expected. 

 The Tampa company blamed the shortfall on contract delays, the weak euro and higher costs. But those explanations gave investors little cause for comfort as the company warned that its troubles are likely to run many months into the future. 

 Earnings in the fourth quarter, ending Dec. 31, and in 2001 also will fall far short of analysts' predictions, Sykes officials said. The company's 15,000 call-center employees worldwide provide technical support to the customers of computer hardware and software manufacturers. 

 Investors reacted frantically Tuesday. Shares of Sykes' stock fell $2.28, or 29 percent, to an all-time low of $5.56. Nearly 6.2-million shares traded hands, 13 times the average daily volume. 

 Tuesday's closing price left Sykes with a total market capitalization of about $230-million, a fraction of the company's $1.8-billion value as of Dec. 31. 

 Sykes' stock was already in free fall Monday afternoon when the Nasdaq Stock Market suspended trading. Seven hours later, at 11:18 p.m., the company issued a news release explaining its troubles. 

 In a hastily arranged conference call with analysts Tuesday morning, chief executive David Grimes said, "We're as disappointed as everyone on this call as to where we find ourself today." 

 The disappointing news didn't stop there. Sykes is still being haunted by accounting blunders from its past. In February, Sykes restated its 1999 earnings because of accounting problems. 

 Tuesday, Sykes said it now has found an error in its 1998 accounting of a software licensing contract with Kyrus Corp. To correct it, the company is lowering its 1998 earnings results by 7 cents per share and is conducting an audit of all other major contracts to look for similar errors. The error was found after Kyrus sued Sykes for allegedly providing defective software. 

 Officials also said the company was returning a $20-million software licensing fee to Perot Systems Corp., along with $700,000 in interest. Sykes characterized the move as part of a mutual agreement to modify the companies' "strategic relationship" involving Sykes' AnswerTeam software, which diagnoses computer problems. The change will reduce Sykes' third-quarter earnings by 1 cent and cut 2001-2004 revenues by $20-million. 

 Grimes tried to keep a lid on pessimism during the conference call. "We have all the tools to rebound from this temporary setback: the dedication of our employees and a strong balance sheet," he said. 

 But the numbers he and chief financial officer Mike Kipphut presented were grim. Sykes now predicts it will earn 32 cents to 38 cents per share in 2000 versus the $1.59 forecast in January. Analysts wasted little time shredding their own earnings predictions. 

 On Tuesday evening, for example, Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Fran Blechman Bernstein downgraded Sykes' rating for the second consecutive day, this time to a long-term recommendation of "accumulate." She also hacked her 2000 earnings projection for the company by about two-thirds. 

 "To say the least, today's announcements raise questions about Sykes' future growth prospects," Bernstein wrote. "The severity of today's announcement reduces our confidence in management." 

 Prudential Securities analyst Kevin Dyches downgraded Sykes' rating for the second time in two weeks. In an interview, he called Sykes a well-regarded, undervalued company whose broken promises have worn thin. 

 "They said a lot of nice things today, but they've done that before," he said. "Now it's time to put up or shut up." 

 Shares of Sykes' stock began trading -- and falling -- heavily Thursday, three trading days before the company announced its earnings shortfalls. The heavy trading led some analysts and many investors to suspect that the news had been leaked early to institutional investors at the expense of average shareholders. 

 In an interview Tuesday, Kipphut said he had no evidence of an internal leak. "I'm not aware of any leak that we have not pursued to an end," he said. 

 Raymond James & Associates analyst John Mahoney suspected a different culprit: a rumor that Sykes was holding an emergency board meeting Friday and that founder John Sykes, a leading backer of plans to bring the Summer Olympics to west-central Florida in 2012, had canceled a trip to the Olympics in Australia to attend. Mahoney said he was "95 percent certain" the rumor was true, but Sykes officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. 

 As for the future, Grimes said he is confident with the company's management and that no one would be fired because of the latest problems. He added that the company will follow through on construction of five new call centers and called Sykes' expected earnings for 2000 "quite respectable in today's marketplace." He added, "We feel comfortable with the business model we have." 

 The company's troubles have produced speculation that Sykes may become an acquisition target. Grimes said he would consider serious offers but that none had been offered or sought. 

 Analysts said potential buyers would be reluctant to pursue Sykes until the company gets its books in order and resolves litigation. 

 "You wouldn't want to buy this company with these class-action suits hanging over your head," Mahoney said.

 Jakks Shares  Decline  On  Profit Warning  For Third Quarter

 MALIBU, Calif. -- Shares of Jakks Pacific Inc. plummeted 25% after the toy company warned that it would miss analysts' third-quarter earnings estimates mainly due to a slowdown in sales of its World Wrestling Federation Entertainment licensed products. 

 Jakks said it expected earnings per share for the quarter to range from 45 cents to 51 cents, compared with 44 cents a share for the same period last year. First Call/Thompson Financial had estimated earnings at 62 cents a share for the quarter. 

 The company said it is experiencing "a greater-than-expected slowdown in sales of its wrestling action figures and accessories" as well as general softness in the toy industry. The company also said the industrywide chip shortage will result in shipping delays of one of its key holiday wrestling products. The company said it is optimistic about the coming releases of its new WWF video games for the fourth quarter and next year. 

 Shares fell more than 30% to a 52-week intraday low of $10.75 before recovering slightly to $12.25 yesterday, which is a decline of $4 and less than half its 52-week high of $29 in October. 

 Jakks issued the announcement after Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Southwest Securities Group Inc., yesterday lowered his earnings and revenue projections for the year. He said he cut earnings forecasts by about 15% to $1.51 from $1.75 based on slow sales at retail and soft sales of wrestling products. 

 Jakks Chief Executive Jack Friedman said in the statement that the company has been working to diversify its product offerings away from a reliance on wrestling through acquisitions and internal product development.

 PolyOne Corp. Sees 4th Quarter Earnings Above 3rd Quarter

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- PolyOne Corp. (POL), which revised its third-quarter outlook downward earlier Wednesday, expects challenging business conditions to persist through the fourth quarter and into 2000. 

 In a conference call to discuss its revised earnings guidance, the Cleveland speciality chemical company said it is faced with a slowdown in customer demand and higher raw material and energy costs. 

 PolyOne, which was formed Sept. 1 from the combined operations of Geon Co. and M.A. Hanna Co., doesn't expect to see a dramatic improvement in the fourth quarter. However, the company expects fourth-quarter earnings to be higher than those in the third quarter. 

 According to its earlier announcement, PolyOne expects to earn about $1 million, give or take $2 million, in the latest period. 

 PolyOne's projection includes about $5 million in after-tax merger-related charges. Among those charges are costs related to a severance package for former M.A. Hanna Chief Executive Phillip Ashkettle, who resigned Aug. 16 "as part of a mutual agreement with the board." 

 On a pro forma basis, the company's earnings excluding charges will be about break-even, compared with pro forma earnings of about $30 million in the year-ago period. 

 Analysts were expecting PolyOne to earn 18 cents a share on a pro forma basis in the third quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The current analyst consensus for PolyOne's fourth quarter is 21 cents a share. 

 PolyOne shares, which hit a new all-time low of $7.38, were recently down $1.50, or 16.8%, at $7.44. 

 PolyOne's profit warning comes on the heels of similar announcements by other chemical companies. 

 At this point, PolyOne's management hasn't determined how much of its third-quarter shortfall is due to the economy slowing and how much is associated with customers making adjustments to their inventory levels. 

 Once the company has made this determination, PolyOne expects to provide investors with further guidance about future periods. 

 During the third quarter, vinyl compound earnings fell 25% to 30% as a result of a 10% drop in shipments from the second quarter. 

 Oxyvinyls and AVC operating earnings fell 75% from the second quarter due to lower demand, lower pricing and continued higher raw material costs. 

 Earnings from the company's engineered materials and colorants fell 40% to 50% on a sequential basis as sales volumes fell and margin pressure continued. 

 Natural gas is one of the raw materials that PolyOne uses to make its products. Natural gas prices have more than doubled from a year ago to hit several all-time highs. 

 In a bid to improve performance, PolyOne plans to centralize procurement and technology decisions under two newly created positions. The company also is in the process of installing an enterprise-wide computer network that is expected to cost about $35 million. 

 All in all, PolyOne is hoping to capture $50 million in cost savings from its recent merger. However, the company is unsure of when all of the savings will be realized. 

 PolyOne Chief Executive Thomas Waltermire also believes the current industry conditions further justify Geon's merger with M.A. Hanna. 

 "Our fundamental profit level isn't strong enough to withstand the volatility in the hydrocarbon market," Waltermire said. He believes the merger will further strengthen top-line growth, lower overhead costs, and give the company the further raw material purchasing power it needs. 

 PolyOne expects to continue to seek acquisitions in areas where the company's performance is currently strong, such as in specialty polymer formulations and engineered films. 

 Any acquisitions that would add to PolyOne's weaker areas would need to be moderate in size. 

 "We are focused on fixing what we have," said a PolyOne official. "Anything larger clearly can't be a fix-it-up thing," he said. 

 One way PolyOne plans to build unity among its employees is the issuance of 200 stock options per employee. The options have a strike price of $9 a share, the company said. 

 In order to reduce the dilutive impact of the stock options, PolyOne plans to repurchase stock. On Sept. 6, PolyOne's board authorized the repurchase of 9.6 million, or about 10% of the company's stock.

Heard on the Street
 Outsourcing Firms Come Under Fire On Wall Street --- Investors Begin to Question High Valuations, Low Margins

 For a few hours last week, it looked like somebody had put out a contract on the highflying stocks of contract manufacturers.   

 The stocks of these companies, which increasingly build the personal computers, networking devices and wireless phones that brand-name technology concerns sell, have been on a tear this year. Several of the stocks have more than doubled in price. But on Wednesday, SCI Systems, one of the bigger concerns, said it would miss its quarterly earnings estimates. SCI's stock promptly plunged 30%, and the stocks of other technology contract manufacturers fell as well.   

 By the closing bell, Wall Street's damage-control mechanism had saved the day. Analysts quickly reassured investors that the problems were isolated, that the industry's growth would continue unabated. Many contract-manufacturer stocks recouped their losses, and even SCI recovered a bit to close at $44.69 (52.33 euros), down about 20%. SCI -- which in its profit warning cited seasonal weakness in demand for PCs as well as design problems and component shortages affecting set-top boxes -- said its business remains attractive and growing rapidly.   

 But fans of contract-manufacturing stocks may be forgetting the recent lesson in valuation taught by stocks of companies that range from Amazon.com to the smallest of Internet strivers: Growth is nice, but it isn't everything. Eventually, the market will look at the profitability of a company's business, and its prospects when growth isn't as assured. And at that point, the market can turn with a vengeance against its former darlings.   

 To critics -- including short-sellers who are betting especially heavily on a decline in the price of two stocks, ACT Manufacturing and Benchmark Electronics -- contract manufacturers are likely to get squeezed hard should there be a slowdown in PCs or mobile phones. Moreover, they argue, Wall Street is putting a lofty price on a bunch of businesses that have surprisingly low profits, are growing through high-priced acquisitions and are financing this low-profit growth with gobs of stock and debt issuance.   

 "What's the profitability on the business they're buying?" says Doug Pratt, a money manager at Willow Capital. "Any company can grow its business by buying less profitable businesses," but that isn't adding value, he argues. Mr. Pratt has at times bet against the stock of Solectron, one of the larger contract manufacturers, but he doesn't have a short position in the stock now, he says.   

 These stocks could have a long way to fall. The stock of Plexus has gained 199% this year, and the price of Sanmina has risen 91%. The price-to-earnings ratios are lofty -- Plexus's share price is 63 times the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus estimate of earnings of $1.05 a share for the year ending Sept. 30. Shares of Sanmina, which analysts expect to earn $1.53 per share in its current fiscal year, have a P/E ratio of 62.   

 In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trades at 25 times the expected earnings of its components in the current fiscal year. Benchmark, whose stock closed Monday at $57.06 in New York Stock Exchange trading, has left behind the $41 target price of an analyst who rates the stock a buy.   

 The reason Wall Street is in love with contract manufacturers is their rapid growth. There has been a wave of outsourcing by personal-computer, wireless-phone and networking-equipment companies. Often, a contract manufacturer will buy a plant from a PC or wireless-phone company, take over the payroll and the production, and sign a contract to supply the product to the PC company. While technology companies are being lauded for getting out of the capital-intensive manufacturing business, contract manufacturers are being praised for buying their factories, often at high prices.

 NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Embattled ICG Communications Inc. , which sells telephone and Internet services to businesses, said Tuesday its chief executive and two directors quit, and analysts said a bankruptcy filing or outright sale might be in cash-strapped ICG's future. 

 ICG's stock and bonds plunged for a second straight day. The stock fell 47 percent Tuesday and has fallen 78 percent since Friday. On Monday, the company slashed its profit and revenue estimates, citing problems serving customers. 

 Carl Vogel, a Liberty Media Corp. senior vice president who became chief executive just four weeks ago and board members Gary Howard of Liberty Media and Thomas Hicks of Dallas-based private equity firm Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc. all resigned, ICG said. The company gave no reason for the resignations. 

 ICG, Hicks Muse and Liberty Media declined further comment. 

 "We were all blindsided by the announcements yesterday and today," said Roger Metz, a research analyst at Janco Partners, a telecommunications-focused investment bank in Greenwood Village, Colo. "There are serious operational issues, including the ability to keep their networks running and provide services to their customers." 

 ICG's stock, which tumbled 58 percent Monday, closed Tuesday on Nasdaq at 7/8, down 25/32. It has fallen 95 percent this year. 

 The company's bonds also slid. Traders said the 13.5 percent senior discount notes maturing in September 2005 of unit ICG Holdings Inc. 2005 were bid late Tuesday at 24 cents on the dollar, up from 22 earlier in the day but down from 55 cents on Friday. 

 William S. Beans Jr. will remain as president and chief operating officer of the Englewood, Colo.-based company, and report to an executive committee of the board of directors, the company said. 

 Vogel, who became an ICG director in April, had taken over as chief executive following the resignation of Shelby Bryan. 

 At the time of their appointments, Howard was chief operating officer of Liberty Media, which is also based in Englewood, and Hicks was chief executive of Hicks, Muse. 

 Affiliates of Liberty Media, a unit of AT&T Corp. , bought a $500 million equity stake in ICG in April. Hicks Muse bought a $230 million stake. 

 "The departures of Tom Hicks and Gary Howard suggest that investors shouldn't look for Liberty Media and Hicks Muse to provide additional equity in the future to keep this company running," said Chris Martinelli, senior telecommunications analyst at CIBC World Markets Corp. in New York. 

 Aryeh Bourkoff, a high-yield telecommunications analyst at UBS Warburg LLC in Stamford, Conn., said ICG's problems reflect difficulties afflicting many so-called competitive local exchange carriers, or CLECs. 

 "The primary point to extract from the ICG news is the increasing fundamental, operational and financial hiccups facing the CLEC industry," he said. 

 "Companies that are not forward funded for at least 12 to 24 months will increasingly have difficulty gaining the confidence of the market," he said. "On top of that significant concern, the ability to demonstrate equity value above and beyond debt levels is becoming increasingly important." 

 Bourkoff said "there is sufficient asset value" to make the bonds attractive at their current price levels. 

 The equity picture may not be so positive, analysts said. 

 "How much equity value there is in the company is hard to see - it seems minimal, if any," said Martinelli. 

 ICG, in its second profit warning in six weeks, on Monday cut its expected revenues for the second half by one-quarter, and for 2001 by about one-half. 

 It expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the periods to total $75 million to $125 million, down from an earlier expected $410 million. 

 ICG said the cuts came amid problems such as network outages and other technical failures. 

 The company also warned it may default under a $200 million bank loan unless it obtains waivers, and was engaging financial institutions to explore "strategic options." 

 Standard & Poor's on Monday cut ICG's credit and debt ratings to low junk grades. It said it expects ICG to run out of cash by early 2001 unless banks give it more financing.

 Federal-Mogul CEO Steps Down; Analysts Not Surprised

 DETROIT -(Dow Jones)- The camel's back has finally broken. 

 After several quarters of disappointing earnings and a sagging stock price, Federal-Mogul Corp. (FMO) Chief Executive Richard (Dick) Snell has stepped down, replaced for an interim period by turn-around specialist Robert Miller. 

 The company also announced Tuesday that it expects third-quarter earnings to be far below expectations once again. 

 The news of Snell's departure was not shocking to analysts. After all there's been speculation for the past several months that Snell would step down once the company found a suitable replacement. 

 What surprised analysts more, they say, was the amount the Southfield, Mich., auto supplier would fall short in the third quarter. 

 The company said Tuesday that it expects earnings-per-share for the third quarter to be about break-even, with fourth-quarter earnings slightly improved from that level. 

 A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of eight analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 54 cents a share for the company's third quarter. A survey of seven analysts through First Call produced a mean earnings estimate of 55 cents per share for the fourth quarter. 

 Federal-Mogul said the earnings shortfall stemmed from the strength of the dollar against the euro, the weakening of the heavy-duty truck market and a lagging replacement parts market. 

 Analysts also said that asbestos payments the company has been making in association with its acquisition of T&N PLC are also taking a toll on the company. Federal-Mogul said cash flows for the company will include more than $310 million in asbestos payments. 

 "It's not the event that's surprising, but the magnitude of the event," said Ronald Tadross, an auto parts analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "Clearly the asbestos payments are not going down, contrary to what they've been telling us." 

 The company's latest earnings shortfall announcement, in conjunction with several disappointments throughout the year, drove Snell out the door, analysts say. 

 "You can only go to the board of directors so many times before they say 'You don't have a total grip on this,"' said Charles Brady, an auto parts analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities. "Based on the performance over the last year, many were wondering how long Dick would survive." 

 Shares of Federal-Mogul recently were off 81 cents, or 8.8%, at $8.44 on composite volume of 1.3 million, more than twice the average daily volume. Earlier Tuesday, the shares, which are NYSE-listed, traded at a 52-week low of $7.94, falling below the previous 52-week low of $8.94 set Aug. 1. 

 Federal-Mogul is suffering under the weight of multiple acquisitions that it made in 1998. The company spent about $4.9 billion to buy companies such as Cooper Industries Inc.'s replacement auto-parts unit and T&N Plc. 

 About a year later, the company issued a profit warning because the replacement parts market began to decline. Analysts said the $1.9 billion purchase price for Cooper Automotive was too much and the company didn't get the return on the investment that it expected. 

 Observers also say it was a mistake for CEO Snell to invest heavily in the replacement parts business just as cars and trucks began to last longer. 

 Since then, the replacement parts market has been on a steady decline, affecting many suppliers that do business in that segment. Because of that factor - combined with the euro issue and the softening of the heavy-truck market - Federal-Mogul's stock and earnings haven't been able to rebound. 

 While the euro issue, the lagging replacement parts market and the decline of the heavy-truck segment have plagued several supplies for the third quarter, the fact that Federal-Mogul has had problems for several quarters was intolerable to the board of directors, analysts say. 

 "Perception was poor," said Brady of Credit Lyonnais. "The company has to instill confidence." 

 CEO Snell's departure is expected to open new doors for Federal-Mogul. Analysts say despite the company's current woes, Federal-Mogul has good sales and reputable brands. The company just needs the right person to lead the way, analysts say. 

 That's where interim CEO Miller comes in. Given his solid reputation for turning companies around, the company should be well on its way to recovery, analysts say. 

 "He's a good turnaround guy," said Brady of Credit Lyonnais. "He stepped in previously when the last regime failed." 

 Federal-Mogul almost faced a meltdown in the mid-1990s when the company invested unsuccessfully in retail replacement parts businesses. 

 Miller will likely spend most of his time stabilizing the company's cash management situation. Miller probably won't take over as the chief executive on a permanent basis, analysts say. 

 The chief executive post at Federal-Mogul will likely be attractive because it will give the new person a new challenge of turning the company around, analysts say. 

 An outright sale of Federal-Mogul is also a possibility, said Kenneth Blaschke, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. But, he said the company would be difficult to sell. 

 Speculation about a potential sale of the company could cause Federal-Mogul's stock to rally in the near term, Blaschke added. 

 Federal-Mogul didn't immediately return phone calls for comment.

 The list of third-quarter corporate earnings victims keeps getting longer, and auto- and truck-industry suppliers are increasingly finding themselves on it. 

 Rockwell International Corp., a maker of factory-automation equipment, said Monday that profit in its current quarter and next year will be below forecasts because of slowing demand from truck and auto makers. 

 The company's shares (ticker symbol: ROK) plunged $7.69, or 20%, to $30.50, in the biggest decline since Rockwell was reorganized after the sale of its aerospace business in 1996. 

 Also, Dana Corp. (DCN) and Eaton Corp. (ETN) joined Rockwell in saying that profit will miss forecasts because of reduced truck and auto demand. 

 Dana shares slid 69 cents to $23.19, while Eaton slid $1.06 to $61.94. 

 Rockwell said it expects fiscal fourth-quarter automation sales to be 5% lower than last year's as customers such as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and their suppliers put off projects in their plants. 

 That will leave earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 about 11% below analysts' estimates, Rockwell said. 

 What's more, it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings to be about 20% below the 81 cents a share earned in the same quarter a year ago, and 2001 earnings to be between $3.10 and $3.20 a share instead of the $3.76 average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. 

 "I've never seen anything quite as precipitous as this slowdown," Rockwell Chief Executive Don Davis said during a conference call. Rockwell sells about a quarter of its automation control systems, which include sensors, motors and computers, to truck and auto makers and their suppliers. 

 Companies are also spending less in commodity-based businesses such as oil and paper, as well as in the food industries, Davis said. Meanwhile, a shortage of some electronic components and displays is increasing the company's material costs. 

 Spending on improvement by the auto industry will drop 8% in 2000, Davis said, citing an industry study. Rockwell's customers have canceled millions of dollars of orders in recent weeks for new equipment such as assembly lines, he said. 

 "The fact that [Rockwell] pre-announced is not a surprise," said Michael Regan, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Inc. who has a "hold" rating on the shares. "The magnitude is." 

 North American production of heavy trucks slipped to a 270,000-unit annual pace in the first half from a record 316,000 for all of 1999 as fuel and interest costs rose. 

 Navistar International Corp. (NAV), the world's third-largest truck maker, has said it may lay off as many as 500 workers in November at a Springfield, Ohio, plant as it cuts production. Ford closed three truck factories for three weeks to make more replacement tires available for customers affected by Bridgestone Corp.'s recall of Firestone brand tires. 

 Truck transmission maker Eaton expects third-quarter profit to miss estimates, partly because of production slowdowns by Ford and other auto makers. 

 Operating profit at the Cleveland-based company is expected to be unchanged or as much as 10% lower than the $1.45 a share the company earned in the year-earlier period. Eaton was expected to earn $1.58 a share, according to First Call. 

 Dana said third-quarter profit will fall to 41 cents to 46 cents a share, below the 86-cent average forecast of analysts. 

 The maker of light-truck axles also cited the euro's slide against the dollar, reduced U.S. and European demand for replacement parts, and computer difficulties.

 Nortel Networks Corp. lived up to its moniker of "market mover," once again dragging the country's benchmark index deep into the red zone. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-stock composite index dropped 281.61 points to 10,781.97 as Nortel fell $6 to $101.10. The network equipment supplier, which makes up more than 30 per cent of the weighting on the TSE-300, slumped after an analyst with BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. cut his 12-month stock-price target for Nortel to $110 from $148. Wary investors also mulled Nortel's latest deal: a three-year, $350-million (U.S.) supply contract with a subsidiary of San Diego, Calif.-based Leap Wireless International Inc. 

 In New York,the Dow Jones industrial average lost 118.48 points to 10,808.52 as the heavyweight blue-chip financial stocks struggled. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index declined 108.71 points to 3,726.52. ICG Communications Inc. was one of the big tech losers, plunging 57.6 per cent to $1.66. The Colorado-based Internet infrastructure company warned of sliding profit in the second half of its fiscal year. 

 Wireless phone maker Qualcomm Inc. was one of the few gainers on Nasdaq's most-active list, shooting up almost 5.5 per cent to $69.81 after an analyst with First Union Securities upgraded his investment rating on the stock to "strong buy" from "buy." 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 21.3 points to 1,444.51. 

 On the Canadian Venture Exchange, the junior high techs pulled the CDNX down 43.05 points to 3,647.02. 

 In Toronto, only two of the TSE's 14 subsectors closed in the black, led by the oil-and-gas grouping. The sector advanced as the New York price of crude oil touched another 10-year high. The metals and minerals grouping was the other gainer. 

 The rising price of energy weighed heavily on the minds of investors in the tech sector, who fear inflationary pressures could affect future earnings of tech companies. Toronto's industrial products grouping, home to most of the so-called New Economy stocks, fell more than 4.5 per cent. 

 JDS Uniphase Corp., Research In Motion Ltd., Certicom Corp., Descartes Systems Group Inc., Ballard Power Systems Inc. and BCE Emergis Inc. were among the large tech sliders. 

 In the communications and media sector, Rogers Communications Inc. closed a $232-million deal to buy Eastern Canada's Cable Atlantis Inc. Shares of Rogers, which recently lost a multibillion dollar bid for Quebec cable firm Groupe Videotron Ltee, declined $1.30 to $35.10. 

 Videotape and compact-disc maker Cinram International Inc. plunged almost 23 per cent to $5.95 after it issued a third-quarter profit warning.

 NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Shares of telecommunications services provider of ICG Communications Inc. plunged 58 percent on Monday after the company said profits and revenues will be "significantly" lower than expected this year and next amid network outages and other technical failures. 

 ICG Communications bonds also fell, losing nearly half their value. The company said it needs additional funding and warned its revised business plan places it at risk of defaulting on certain obligations under a $200 million bank loan unless it obtains waivers. ICG will also slow capital spending under the plan. 

 It was the second time in six weeks that the Englewood, Colo.-based company cut its forecasts for 2000 and 2001. ICG Communications also said it was engaging top financial institutions to explore "strategic options." 

 The company's stock closed on Nasdaq at $1-21/32, down $2-1/4. The stock has fallen 91 percent this year. 

 Meanwhile, corporate bond traders said the 13.5 percent senior discount notes maturing in Sept. 2005 of ICG Holdings Inc. were bid Monday at 29.5 to 30 cents on the dollar, compared to 55 cents on Friday. The company's notes are now considered "distressed." 

 ICG said it expects revenues this year to total $630 million, with interest before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totalling $17 million and capital expenditures $1 billion. 

 For the second half, it said it will achieve revenues of $300 million, down from an earlier estimated $400 million, and post an EBITDA loss of about $25 million, compared to an earlier expected $60 million EBITDA gain. 

 In 2001, ICG said it expects revenues to total between $700 million and $800 million, down from $1.4 billion, with EBITDA totalling $100 million to $150 million, down from $350 million. 

 Several analysts cut their ratings on Monday for ICG. 

 One, Trent Spiridellis of Banc of America Securities Inc. in New York, cut his rating to "market performer" from "buy," saying, "We do not foresee how the company will have sufficient capital to fund its revised business plan into the first half of next year." 

 ICG said network outages, equipment failures and technical difficulties have hampered its Internet remote access service (IRAS). 

 Some customers, it said, "have reduced their commitments to ICG" and intend to end their contractual relationships with ICG if these "quality-of-service" issues remain unresolved. 

 "As a result of these quality of service issues, the company expects to receive minimal revenues in the third and fourth quarters of this year from IRAS services," ICG said. 

 Moody's Investors Service in August put ICG's various ratings on review for possible downgrade. Moody's rates ICG Holdings' notes "B3," its sixth highest junk grade. 

 Standard & Poor's late Monday cut ICG's corporate credit rating to "CCC-plus," its seventh highest junk grade, from "B-minus" and its senior unsecured debt rating to "CCC-minus" from "B-minus." S&P also said it may further cut ICG's ratings 

 ICG declined further comment.

 UPDATE 3-Gillette says weak euro cutting into sales, profit.

 CHICAGO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Shares of Gillette Co. tumbled nearly 9 percent to their lowest level in four years on Monday after the world's largest maker of razors and blades said the impact of the weak euro and lagging sales of Duracell batteries were cutting into its profit for the third quarter. 

 Boston-based Gillette, which generates about 60 percent of its sales overseas, said quarterly earnings would come in only slightly higher than in the comparable three months last year. Sales will show little change, the maker of Mach 3 and Trac II razors and Oral B toothbrushes said, largely because of a steep slide by the single European currency, which has diminished the value of overseas revenues converted into dollars. 

 It was the latest in a two-year series of statements in which the company has sought to guide analysts' expectations downward before announcing its quarterly results. 

 "They basically 'preannounced' that earnings were going to fall below the Street consensus," said William Steele, managing director at Banc of America Securities. 

 Gillette shares closed down $2-3/16 at $27-5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling to $27-3/16 earlier in the session - their lowest since July 1996. 

 Before the warning, analysts on average expected earnings of 34 cents a share in the third quarter, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. In the third quarter of 1999, Gillette's profit reached $352 million, or 32 cents per diluted share, on sales of $2.5 billion. 

 By Monday afternoon, Gillette's earnings guidance prompted 6 of the 13 analysts that follow the company to lower their estimates, according to Charles Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson Financial. Consensus third-quarter and fourth-quarter estimates were each lowered by one cent, to 33 cents and 35 cents, respectively, he said. The consensus 2001 estimate was cut to $1.34 from $1.38, he added. 

 The revised estimates for the fourth quarter were made even though Gillette said it was comfortable with Wall Street estimates for the final three months of the year. Before the company's statement, analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of 36 cents a share, up from 32 cents a year ago, according to First Call. 

 Analysts noted that the company has a history of earnings warnings over the past two years. 

 Over the past nine quarters, the company has issued earnings "preannouncements" five times, a Gillette spokesman said. 

 Weaker European currencies, primarily the euro, are expected to cut dollar-denominated revenues by about 6 percent in the quarter, offsetting solid sales gains from a favourable volume mix and pricing, Gillette said. 

 With the euro trading at its lowest against the greenback in its 21-month history, many U.S. manufacturers are having difficulty competing in Europe against local rivals, whose costs are in the weaker currency. The euro was trading at about 85 cents on Monday and has lost about 27 percent of its value since its launch at $1.17 at the beginning of last year. 

 Last week, shares of Colgate-Palmolive Co., best known for its toothpaste and other personal care products, tumbled after an analyst downgraded the stock, based in part on the euro's impact on its sales. 

 Colgate responded that it was comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates, but did not address the issue of the euro's weakness. Analysts noted that Colgate's earnings would benefit from a lower tax rate. 

 Colgate may also have been able to cut costs in the quarter sooner than Gillette, allowing Colgate to meet analysts' estimates, said Connie Maneaty, consumer products analyst at Prudential Securities. 

 "I think if their cost-cutting programmes were more in place, there might not have been an earnings hit," Maneaty said. 

 Gillette has been especially hurt by the euro in September, a heavy selling month in Europe, Charles Cramb, chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. The European market is also too competitive for Gillette to offset the falling euro by raising prices, he said. 

 At the same time, the company's Duracell battery business is still performing below expectations in North America. Battery sales will likely show a decline in the third quarter, reflecting an eroding market share, Cramb said. 

 The company expects Duracell sales to improve in the fourth quarter, helped by a new battery line, increased in-store displays and an aggressive consumer sampling campaign.

 (Recasts, adds byline, details throughout, pvs ENGLEWOOD, Colo.) 

 NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Shares of telecommunications services provider of ICG Communications Inc. plunged 58 percent on Monday after the company said profits and revenues will be "significantly" lower than expected this year and next amid network outages and other technical failures. 

 ICG Communications bonds also fell, losing nearly half their value. The company said it needs additional funding and warned its revised business plan places it at risk of defaulting on certain obligations under a $200 million bank loan unless it obtains waivers. ICG will also slow capital spending under the plan. 

 It was the second time in six weeks that the Englewood, Colo.-based company cut its forecasts for 2000 and 2001. ICG Communications also said it was engaging top financial institutions to explore "strategic options." 

 The company's stock closed on Nasdaq at $1-21/32, down $2-1/4. The stock has fallen 91 percent this year. 

 Meanwhile, corporate bond traders said the 13.5 percent senior discount notes maturing in Sept. 2005 of ICG Holdings Inc. were bid Monday at 29.5 to 30 cents on the dollar, compared to 55 cents on Friday. The company's notes are now considered "distressed." 

 ICG said it expects revenues this year to total $630 million, with interest before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totalling $17 million and capital expenditures $1 billion. 

 For the second half, it said it will achieve revenues of $300 million, down from an earlier estimated $400 million, and post an EBITDA loss of about $25 million, compared to an earlier expected $60 million EBITDA gain. 

 In 2001, ICG said it expects revenues to total between $700 million and $800 million, down from $1.4 billion, with EBITDA totalling $100 million to $150 million, down from $350 million. 

 Several analysts cut their ratings on Monday for ICG. 

 One, Trent Spiridellis of Banc of America Securities Inc. in New York, cut his rating to "market performer" from "buy," saying, "We do not foresee how the company will have sufficient capital to fund its revised business plan into the first half of next year." 

 ICG said network outages, equipment failures and technical difficulties have hampered its Internet remote access service (IRAS). 

 Some customers, it said, "have reduced their commitments to ICG" and intend to end their contractual relationships with ICG if these "quality-of-service" issues remain unresolved. 

 "As a result of these quality of service issues, the company expects to receive minimal revenues in the third and fourth quarters of this year from IRAS services," ICG said. 

 Moody's Investors Service in August put ICG's various ratings on review for possible downgrade. Moody's rates ICG Holdings' notes "B3," its sixth highest junk grade. 

 Standard & Poor's late Monday cut ICG's corporate credit rating to "CCC-plus," its seventh highest junk grade, from "B-minus" and its senior unsecured debt rating to "CCC-minus" from "B-minus." S&P also said it may further cut ICG's ratings 

 ICG declined further comment.

 LONDON, Sept 18 (Reuters) - HSBC said on Monday it was downgrading its recommendation for Dutch supermarkets group Koninklijke Ahold NV to "hold" from "add". 

 European food retailing analyst Kate Calvert said HSBC's sum-of-the-parts fair value estimate for Ahold now matched the bank's target price for the retailer, at 32 euros following a more cautious view on U.S.-based stores. 

 A profit warning by grocery and drug store chain Albertson's Inc. last month prompted falls across US food retail stocks. Ahold has more than a fifth of its business in the United States. 

 "We have reduced our recommendation to a hold," Calvert said. "With forecasts underpinned, macro factors are likely to determine performance rather than fundamentals." 

 Ahold was down 0.84 percent at 31.72 euros at 1437 GMT.

 NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Dresdner Kleinwort Benson said Monday that analyst Thomas Burns Jr. has downgraded Timken Co. to reduce from buy following the company's issuance of a profit warning earlier Monday. 

 - "We are lowering our Q3 2000 EPS estimate to $0.12 per share from $0.28." 

 - Burns pointed out "Timken has been unwilling to respond to questions about the negative impact on its earnings from exchange rates, including during its Q2 2000 EPS conference call. Clearly, the problem has become too big to duck. TKR now says it is the major factor responsible for the now expected significant decline in its Q3 00 EPS." 

 - He noted: "The problem for Timken includes the weakness in the British pound versus the Euro. Timken has significant Bearings manufacturing in the UK, and it sells to the continent. 

 - "Timken also cited the Euro weakness against the US dollar, noting this has pressured its North American steel prices and margins. Oddly enough, TKR stated on Friday, 15 September 2000, it has raised prices on single-treated tube by 2 percent and double thermal-treated products by 4 percent. 

 - "We do not expect the problem to go away in Q4. It also appears that the weakening in North American auto-related bearings markets at the margin is offsetting the moderate strength in its sales to industrial markets." 

 In afternoon trading Monday, Timken shares were off 3/8 at $15-3/16.

 DEBORAH MARCHINI, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  We`re going to take a look now at the action on the floor of New York Stock Exchange. 

 Christine Romans joins us with a little bit of the color of what`s going on down there today -- Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Deborah. 

 Indeed we`re watching shares of Abbott Laboratories,  A-B-T is the ticker symbol.  This is a company that was moving sharply higher in the pre-market trading.  It closed on Friday at 43 3/8.  So any trades above 43 3/8 are actually higher on the day in terms of how we measure it from Friday`s close.  So it`s down 1 5/16 from the best levels in the pre-market.  But still higher on the day for Abbott Labs.  Investors are cheering news that there`s a new drug Kaletra, a new anti-HIV drug approved from the company that was approved by the FDA in an expedited approval process. It combines two medicines to make a virus killing - to make the virus-killing properties more effective.  And the interesting thing about this drug, many say, is the fact that it can be used for youngsters as young as six months old, all the way up to adults.   So it`s the only drug that can be used for children that small. 

 Micron Technology is another one we`re watching, M-U, the ticker symbol. 

 It is trading on the upside here.  Lehman Brothers out with positive note on the company, raising fourth quarter earnings per share by a quarter. Also raising 2001 earnings per share by about 90 cents, citing increase of PC sales in September, up 40 percent from August.  And also watching Hershey Foods, H-S-Y is the ticker symbol, a positive note from Bear Stearns.  Among other things, Bear Stearns said that this company might have less exposure or less of an impact on its bottom line from the weakening euro, also saying that it might be in a position to recapture some of that blue chip name that it has in the food is sector.  So Hershey is one of the stocks we`re watching as well. 

 Back to you. 

 MARCHINI:  All right, Christine, thanks, we`ll see you later. 

 Well, despite weakness of the European currency, European companies are continuing to increase their foothold in the United States  through buy-outs and alliances.  This morning, we`ve got three deals to talk about. Britain`s Cadbury Schweppes is buying Snapple from Triarc for about a billion dollars.  We`ll have more on this deal from Triarc`s chief executive in a  few moments` time. 

 After days of speculation, Germany`s Dresdner Bank confirms it`s buying privately-held investment bank, Wasserstein  Perella, for about $1.4 billion in stock.  And British Telecom tells CNNfn it`s in talks with AT&T to combine their business services divisions.  The two companies may spin them off at a later date. 

 Well, checking how the stock in those companies are faring today, you can see Cadbury Schweppes is down about a half, as the acquiring company often times is.  Triarc up nearly $2 at $26 and change.  We`ve got AT&T up 3/16 and British Telecom gaining better than three points today on the news. 

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  All right, now the deal that should have a lot of folks talking around the water cooler is Cadbury Schweppes` bid for Snapple.  Just six years the Snapple brand has traded hands three times.  Quaker Oats owned it for a time but then sold it after it slipped in the market.  Triarc bought Snapple three years ago, added it to a soft drink line that includes RC Cola, Grape Nehi soda, and most recently, Mistic tea and fruit juices.  But now Snapple is being served up again.  So knowing this we decided to take a closer look at Triarc. It`s our "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER (voice-over):  When Triarc acquired the Snapple ice tea line from Quaker Oats three years ago, the Snapple brand was in shambles.  Quaker Oats paid a premium for the Snapple line and then watched it as its value went down the drain.  Frustrated, Quaker Oats served up Snapple for a mere $300 million, or just 1/5 for what they paid for it.  With Triarc, sales of Snapple have been brewing along.  For 95 years, Triarc has done surprisingly well in a soft drink universe dominated by Coke and Pepsi. As part of today`s Cadbury deal, Triarc will sell its soft drink holdings which include RC Cola, Mistic fruit juices, Grape Nehi, and Snapple. Once settled, it will have the Arby`s roast beef restaurants, and T.J. Cinnamon`s, a pastry shop.  Triarc has gone through several incarnations. It changed names several times, went public in 1992, considered going private again in 1998.  And Triarc was preparing to the take Snapple line public later this year.  Still shares of Triarc did pretty well, up more than 30 percent this year before the deal was announced. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  All right, here`s how the looks of shares of Triarc are doing today.  We saw them a little earlier, there you go again just to drive the point home, Triarc getting a nice kick out of the market today, up 1 15/16 at $26 and change today. 

 MARCHINI:  For more on the deal, we are joined by Triarc`s chief executive, Nelson Peltz.  Welcome to IN THE MONEY, nice to have you with us this morning. 

 NELSON PELTZ, CEO, TRIARC:  Good morning, nice to be here. 

 MARCHINI:  You`re turning a really nice profit on this.  That`s basically more than tripling your investment. 

 PELTZ:  Well, we look at it even better than that.  I think we made about 10 times our money in the acquisition of Snapple. 

 MARCHINI:  OK, that being case, what are you going to do with money? are you going to give it back to shareholders? Use it for acquisitions? what? 

 PELTZ:  No, we have a good track record of making sound investments. And we`d done this a few times before and we expect to do it again.  So watch the space and we`ll see what we`ll do for you next time. 

 TUCKER:  Not to be a nit picker, but. 

 PELTZ:  Go ahead. 

 But going ahead and being the fly in the ointment for just a second here, you paid $300 million for Snapple.  Now you`re not selling just Snapple today, you`re selling Snapple along with a group of other soft drinks as well.  So it`s not quite a three-times deal for you in terms of the Snapple brand. 

 PELTZ:  Well, it is, we put $75 million in cash, we figure we`re getting about $800 million of the billion 450 is allocated to Snapple and the rest is to RC, Mistic and Stewart`s.  So Snapple was bought in mid-`97. Two-and-a-half years, we figured pretax we made about 10 times our money on Snapple.  And, you know, the rest of the products sort of came along. We inherited RC when we took over this company in `93. 

 MARCHINI:  Snapple in particular, the sort of alternative beverage market has been growing rather rapidly, although Snapple early on did not partake in some of that growth.  But the market is growing rather substantially, why not keep it and grow it a little longer? Why did you want to get rid of it? 

 PELTZ:  Well, we`re going to do an IPO, OK, and Cadbury, who is the logical owner of Snapple, came in to see us.  And they just offered us a price that far exceed what we could expect from an IPO.  So we took it. I mean, we`re in the valuation creation business.  And that`s what we have to do.  And this was a great value creator for our shareholders.  So we`re very pleased with the price.  And they`re getting a great company. 

 TUCKER:  Now part of the deal, for the viewers of this show, IN THE MONEY, is that we`ve made Triarc our "Stock of the Day," which means its posted on the CNNfn Web site, and they get to go and vote on it.  So what are - I mean, to go back to the question Deb asked, what do you do with money that you realizing from this? how are going to grow what is left of the company? 

 PELTZ:  Well, we have a track record of knowing how to invest money. We bought National Can in the `80s, out of a very tiny company Triangle Industries, then we bought American Can and then we sold that and gave shareholders about 100 percent compounded annual return for about five years.  So we thought that was a good ride.  We think we`re going to do the same thing here again.   This is the first act of a several-act play. We have the cash to make other acquisitions.   And I think we know how to do that. 

 MARCHINI:  Will you stay in the food and beverage business with your other acquisitions? 

 PELTZ:  Not necessarily, you know, we`ve been in lots of businesses, we`ve been in chemicals, we`ve been in packaging.  But we like consumer products, though.  We think owning brands is good thing to do. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Nelson, thanks for coming on. 

 PELTZ:  Thanks for having me. 

 TUCKER:  Nelson Peltz, he`s the CEO of Triarc. 

 PELTZ:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Thank you. 

 All right, for a look at how Wall Street is digesting this deal, let`s bring in Ann Gurkin, she`s a beverage analyst at Davenport & Company. And she joins us this morning from Richmond, Virginia. 

 And Ann, welcome to the show. 

 ANN GURKIN, DAVENPORT & COMPANY:  Good morning. 

 TUCKER:  I don`t know if you had a chance to listen to Nelson, but he`s pretty enthusiastic about where this company`s going to go and what they`re going to do with the money they realize from this.  Are you as enthusiastic about Triarc`s future? 

 GURKIN:  We are enthusiastic.  We put a lot of faith in the management team of Triarc.  And as we`ve seen today, they do a good job of buying low value assets and realizing the value of those assets. 

 MARCHINI:  You don`t think there was perhaps more value to be realized by holding onto some of these alternative beverages perhaps a little longer and letting them grow? 

 GURKIN:  I think Triarc received a good price, 12 1/2 - 13 times EBITDA for their beverage operations, that`s a good price for this operation and they realized good value. 

 MARCHINI:  The flip side of that question is did Cadbury Schweppes pay too much? 

 GURKIN:  Cadbury Schweppes increased their volume, their case volume by probably 15-20 percent.  That gives them greater weight in that space. So that`s a positive for Cadbury. 

 TUCKER:  I remain intrigued about where this company goes from here. They just sold off a substantial portion of it.  They got $1.450 billion.  I mean, even if you pay everything off, there`s still a lot of money left. 

 And they can go pretty much where ever they want.  Have they given you any indication, Ann, of what the next direction might be? 

 GURKIN:  No, they`ve been reviewing a number of acquisitions, a number of opportunities.  It works out to like $16 per share in cash.  That`s a pretty hefty amount.  They have to go out in two years to make an acquisition.  And no, I don`t know which direction they`ll head. 

 MARCHINI:  All right, Ann Gurkin, Davenport & Company, she`s a beverage analyst there, thank you for joining us today. 

 GURKIN:  You`re welcome. 

 TUCKER:  All right, now that you`ve had the discussion about Triarc, and you`ve heard about them, head  on down to the bottom of our CNNfn.com Web page and tell us whether or not we should  buy the stock. 

 On Friday, remember, we put up Maytag  up for a vote.  Let`s take a look at those results.  More than 60 percent of you thought we should not buy it. So, obviously it gets a red light, does not go into the package, that`s a pretty strong negative vote here.  Maytag man`s just going to be a little lonelier for a little while longer. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Our next guest sees the  retail sector as a good place  to be. She`s attracted to its profit  growth, along with the  group`s lower valuations. 

 MARCHINI: Christine Callies is the investment  strategist at Merrill Lynch, and  joins us from her firm`s  offices here in New York. Christine, this would run counter to conventional wisdom because people think the economy is slowing down and retailing may not be  the place to be. Tell us why it is. 

 CHRISTINE CALLIES, MERRILL LYNCH: Slowing and slower are two different things and  when you`re slowing from 6 percent GDP growth to something that`s a little bit more sustainable that still can mean a fairly robust environment for personal consumption expenditures and retail. Another point that we make is that  the retail data is very heavily influenced by auto sales and  the case that we`re making is that because of the wealth created we both real estate market and  the stock market  the over last couple years, and because a lot of this wealth has been showered on baby boomers who are at  the peak of their earnings life cycle that  the market is likely to find that personal consumption expenditure and retail sales ex-auto hold up reasonably well. So for instance we would point out that the growth rate in retail sales for furniture and appliances  and for general merchandise is actually fluctuating near the cycle highs which happen to be  the highs for the last several decades. So we think that there is actually a much more stable consumption environment for these company than the market believes. 

 MARCHINI: Christine, two factors that some people think will weigh against increased consumer spending or at least health consumer spending. Of course one is the tripling of oil prices, which we`ve seen gasoline and are about to see in home heating oil in the Northeast. The second is  the fact that consumers are said to be quite in debted.  What do you think of those? 

 CALLIES: Well,  I think that we need to remember that consumers have had to experience or had to deal with these kinds of increases before. So it`s not the first time that we`ve had some higher or stronger than expected energy prices. I would point out  that in 1986 we had very much the same situation in which energy prices rose from approximately $11 a barrel to finally over $40 a barrel as Kuwait was invaded in  the summer the 1990. And it still took approximately three years for investors and consumers to get really defensive. And I think when you consider  that this environment is actually much more construtive we have tended to have tax put for  the middle class and tax cut on capital gains rather than a tax increases that many investor experienced  and consumer experienced  in  the late 80s. 

 TUCKER: Well, Christine, let`s get some names from you. What are you looking at? And what do you like in this group? 

 CALLIES: Well. we`d like to combine our overall upbeat analysis of consumer spending and retail activity with our baby boom spending thesis. And this is basically grounded on the observation that baby boomers tend to spend more on quality of life and personal indulgences than  their parents did when they were at the same age. So companies like Tiffany (URL: http://www.tiffany.com/) and Zales (URL: http://www.zales.com/) really come in to focus very nicely in this sort of a situation. Tiffany is a terrific brand franchise. We think very well managed  and the company is not predisposed to over investing in store space. So we think that will help protect  the company`s exclusivity. And I think that Zales is a good example of a company also making fairly shrewd merchandising decision. But in this case operating in many of the more popular price points in the market. We would also take look at Lowe`s (URL: http://www.lowes.com) which is  the home improvement retailer, because one of the thing that homeowners mention as one of their prime reason for doing a cash out home equity refinancing for instance is home improvement and that is also one of  the bigger spending categories that baby boomer tend to avail themselves of. 

 TUCKER: Christine, this upbeat scenario and the case certainly that you`re making for  the retailer, it sounds like this would be a good sector to hide -- put money in to because I believe short-term you`re looking for continuing turbulence in the overall equity market, right? 

 CALLIES: We`re looking for a little bit of softness in the early fall. And we think that this is a typical seasonal response to things that tend to happen towards the end of the year. For instance analyst earnings revision very often take a negative tilt in the final 3 or 4 months of the year. It does not necessarily mean that profits are actually suffering. It might mean that analyst were too optimistic earlier in the year and I think that this is one of  the factors that the market will struggle with short run. I also do think it`s a little bit of afraid of rising energy prices. We do not seem to have made the peak just yet and I also think it`s a little bit concerned about the upward creep in longer term interest rates. So reasonable growth is where we like to hide  and that is consumer cyclicals. 

 MARCHINI: All right. Thanks very much, Christine Callies with Merrill Lynch. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 MARCHINI:  Nice day in New York.  Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I`m Deborah Marchini. 

 TUCKER:  And I am Bill Tucker.  Coming up in this half hour, we`re going to take an in-depth look at the home building sector. Is this current interest rate environment a good time to invest in homebuilders? 

 MARCHINI:  Plus, we`re going to go live to San Francisco where Bruce Francis is covering the 30th Annual Bank of America Securities Investment Conference.  Many top firms are making pitches.  He will fill us in. 

 First, we`re going to check the markets. 

 TUCKER:  Let`s do that.  And let`s talk about the Dow.  It`s down 78 points.  A good weight on the Dow today is J.P. Morgan.  It is down better than $5 a share, trading well under, by the way.  It`s where it should be trading in terms of its merger agreement with Chase Manhattan Bank. 

 Transports taking a big hit, down 32.  Oil about $36 a barrel.  That`s hurting them there.  And tech stocks also trading lower.  The Nasdaq down 33. 

 MARCHINI:  The breadth is negative by a margin of about two to one - stocks headed down to stock headed up on both the big board and the Nasdaq market today. 

 And, Bill, you hinted earlier, we`re taking a look at the Dow transports. We`ve got the price of oil up over $36 a barrel.  The transports are down a little better than one percent today 31 points. 

 For a closer look now at what is going on in the markets, Christine Romans is at the New York Stock Exchange and Charles Molineaux is at the Nasdaq MarketSite.  And, Christine, we`re going to start with you.  What`s ailing investors this morning? 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  I tell you, lots of folks talking about the fact that last week was not a pretty week in the markets.  And all the cross currents that were at play last week, they say, are still at play this week, although they`re watching some individual stories, like Abbott, which is, of course, moving higher here.  But they`re also watching the oil market, especially as it moves above $36 a barrel.  One trader said they`re still beating the oil drums.  Some people think they`re talking $45, $50 a barrel oil.  He says, "Oh, that`s just hype when you have. When you`re up here at extremes you start to get a lot of hype."  But he says that the oil situation is still worrying people in terms of corporate profit for most of the corporate world, although it`s pretty good news for some of the oil companies. 

 Also, they`re talking here about the corporate profit concerns overall in terms of the euro and other issues.  They`re saying that we`re heading into the next earnings-reporting season, which really starts about the second week in October.  This is the prime time right now for pre-announcements. So, there`s a lot of nervousness surrounding the corporate performance frontier. 

 Also, they are watching the charts.  The Dow has come well off the 11,400 level that it managed to achieve on this rally in August.  And there are some support levels down here that some folks think might need to be tested because, certainly, it looks like the market, the S&P and the Dow, both rejected some of the old highs that many goals had wanted to pierce through, and it just didn`t happen. 

 So, that`s where things stand right now.  The Dow now down 81 points below the 10,900 level.  And there seems to be a bit of pessimism brewing here. 

 For a look at how things are faring over there at the Nasdaq, let`s bring in Charles.  Hey, Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Christine.  We are looking at a progressively deteriorating picture right now at the Nasdaq.  For starters, the breadth, which has always been negative today, now is extremely so.  We`ve got decliners leading advancers by a two to one margin.  We`re off by 39 points at 3,795, which is a new session low for this market.  Check it out, we teetered around some, bounced from gains to losses to gains to losses again. And then the selling really kicked in in earnest and down we went again.  We`re sitting here right at our low for the session after plummeting all the way from our session high of 3,862, a gain of 27 points.  Again, now down by 39 points sitting here at our session low. 

 Check it out, we`ve got banking stocks down by 2 percent, financials down by 2 1/2 on the day, computers down by 1, telecoms down by 1 1/2, chips continue to lose ground.  They are off now, let`s see, by about close to 1 percent.  Actually, chip stocks holding onto their strength, but they were up by 2 percent earlier in the day today.  The Internet stocks continue to be very negative.  So, this market has gone from a real waffling forecast, at least as far as the composite concerned, into a decidedly negative tone for the bigger name stocks that, of course, pushed these stocks - the composite around the most.  But again, the broader market has been negative throughout this session and is now decidedly more so. 

 Bill. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Charles.  Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq MarketSite. 

 Now, am I the only guy that thinks the technology index being named gin is a more than a bit ironic?  Technology companies, energy providers and healthcare firms are pumping up their companies in San Francisco this week. They are making pitches as part of the Bank America Securities 30th Annual Investment Conference. 

 Bruce Francis joins us now live from the conference with that and, oh, so much more.  Hey, Bruce, good morning. 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Bill.  When tech stock engines start taking off, usually the revving often starts right here at the Bank of America Fall Securities Conference.  Joining me is John Skeen (ph), director of portfolio strategy.  John, thanks for being with us this morning. 

 JOHN SKEEN, DIRECTOR PORTFOLIO STRATEGY, BANK OF AMERICA SECURITIES: Good morning. 

 FRANCIS:  What are you telling investors?  This is a nervous time right now.  We`re in earnings warning season.  What are you telling investors? 

 SKEEN:  Well, the higher price of energy and the higher price of money have taken its toll, so revenue growth is harder to come by in general. So, we expect that earnings aren`t going to be as good as people expect for the next two quarters, but there`s still lots of parts of the market that are attractive. 

 FRANCIS:  Yeah.  We were speaking before, and your focus is on not an area that investors have been buying up, tech, for example.  You`re looking at utilities? 

 SKEEN:  Actually, right now, we have a tremendous investment theme that probably is going to be good for four or five years.  The country is short of power because we haven`t put up enough power generating plants, and with the deregulation of the utility industry, and demand is growing much more rapidly than anybody expected because of the Internet. So, this mismatch creates opportunities for companies that have power that isn`t regulated, i.e. power that they can sell at any price they`d like to. 

 FRANCIS:  Yeah.  The Dow Jones Utility Index, I believe, is near an all time high as we speak.  Is there still value there, or are these ... 

 SKEEN:  It`s up 50 percent since the Nasdaq meltdown in late March. So, investors are realizing what`s going on.  And that`s one part of defensive leadership as well as healthcare, and financial securities have been strong.  But there are a number of companies that still aren`t fully recognized.  Constellation Energy would be my favorite now. 

 FRANCIS:  What about in the tech area?  Because that`s often what gets a lot of attention at conferences like this one. 

 SKEEN:  Yes.  Well, the semiconductor outlook is mixed.  Those semiconductor companies are tied to the personal computer.  They`re having a lot of difficulty.  While those that are tied to the build out of the Internet are doing extremely well.  The companies we think are most attractive right now are the contract manufacturers because they`re playing the outsourcing of the communications industry as well as the computing industry. 

 FRANCIS:  We did have one though to report disappointing results, I believe last week, SEI I think we`re talking about. 

 SKEEN:  Yes. 

 FRANCIS:  Flextronics is presenting here at the conference. 

 SKEEN:  Flextronics, Celestica and Sanmina are three favorites right now. They`re all very heavily exposed to the communications industry. SEI`s difficulties occurred with a shortfall in PCs and desktops, and we think it`s a temporary phenomenon.  SEI should be purchased on this price weakness. 

 FRANCIS:  And the others - you have Flextronics, Sanmina and Celestica. 

 SKEEN:  And Celestica.  All are very highly exposed to the communications industry outsourcing phenomena.  All are growing well in excess of 40 percent.  We expect that to continue for the next three years.  All three stocks to our target prices offer appreciation potential of over 50 percent in the next 12 months. 

 FRANCIS:  John, thank you very much for joining us.  We appreciate it. 

 SKEEN:  Thanks a lot. 

 FRANCIS:  Appreciate you being here.  We`ve got a lot more coming up from the conference.  Later on today, Tom Siebel, the CEO of Siebel Systems. Also later on, Michael Ruettgers, the CEO of EMC.  A lot more to come. 

 Bill. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Bruce.  Thank you.  Bruce Francis out in San Francisco. Why does he get the good gig? 

 MARCHINI:  I don`t know. 

 TUCKER:  That`s great. 

 MARCHINI:  Still ahead on IN THE MONEY - I get the good gig of sitting here with you.  The stocks tumbled the nation today led by fast Korea`s reaction to Ford.  The latest moves.  Phillip Coggin of the "Financial Times" will have an international financial wrap-up. 

 TUCKER:  Plus, tropical storm Gordon has gone from fearful to fizzle. Prudence Solomon will have the details plus all of the latest world and national headlines just ahead on IN THE MONEY. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 MARCHINI:  The stocks plunged throughout Asia overnight.  Last week`s losses on the Nasdaq hurt the region`s tech issues.  And South Korea was hit hard by Ford`s decision to pull out of a bid for Daewoo Motors.  For more on the story, we go to London, check in with the "Financial Times" market editor, Phillip Coggin. 

 And, Phillip, South Korean whole market took it on the chin as a result of Ford`s decision not to make a big investment at Daewoo. 

 PHILLIP COGGIN, MARKET EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES:  That`s right.  It was an eight percent fall in the Kospi Index.  And the big concern for South Korea is that they`ve been hoping for a restructuring of Daewoo, which was one of the biggest companies in Korea, and that leading a restructuring as a whole of the Korean industry, which, as you recall, a couple of years ago, was overwhelmed by debt problems.  But with Ford pulling out, that raises questions about the credit of banks of Daewoo and whether they will get their money. And the banking sector itself was down 13 percent or so. 

 There are also big losses elsewhere in the region in Jakarta in Indonesia where there was a bomb that disrupted the stock exchange last week.  And also, Defense Secretary William Cohen said today that they might be a loss of 82 in Indonesia if the violence in Timor wasn`t stopped.  So, it was a very bad day for the region indeed. 

 MARCHINI:  Yeah, but that standard Tokyo got off easy with a one percent loss. 

 We`re looking at considerable weakness in the euro touching another record low again.  And the pound sterling`s not doing all that well either. What`s the story today? 

 COGGIN:  Well, again, it`s been another indication today of the willingness of European investors to buy U.S. assets.  Not only did we have the Dresdner confirmation of the bid for Wasserstein Perella but another deal involving Cadbury and Snapple.  Now, we`ve got so many Europeans going out to buy assets that there`s a lot of conversion of purchases of dollars in sales of euros, which is a continuing drain on the European currency. Also, the dollar is simply strong against most currencies worldwide.  It wasn`t just the euro hitting an all time low today, it was also the Australian dollar and the Indian rupee.  The attraction of U.S. remains in that very strong economy and the productivity gains and the very attractive companies that investors are interested in buying worldwide. And it`s hard to see the dollar turning around at the moment. 

 MARCHINI:  The reading here on the Cadbury deal for Snapple is that Triarc did really well.  The congroves (ph) of that Cadbury paid too much? 

 COGGIN:  Well, people don`t seem too concerned. Cadbury shares are up on the day about 2.8 percent.  For Cadbury, it`s really a strategic move. They already own Dr. Pepper and 7-Up.  And by getting Snapple and also Mystic they`re getting into the number three position in the U.S. soft drinks market.  So, investors responded pretty well. 

 MARCHINI:  All right.  Phillip Coggin of the "FT".  Good to see you again. 

 TUCKER:  Well, OPEC is once again promising to increase production to lower oil prices.  The secretary general says it will automatically hype production by another 500,000 barrels a day if prices remain above $28 a barrel during October.  Do we have a banner for how much it is today? It`s over $36. 

 In a related development, Venezuela says it will maximize production of heating oil to boost supplies and stabilize prices in the U.S.  One step the U.S. could take now to reduce prices is to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, but at least one oil analyst say there may be a good reason why the president has not approved such a move. 

 "Bill Clinton has been known as extraordinarily politically savvy. We`re in an election year.  His wife and his vice president are both running in tight races.  Why doesn`t he release the oil?  That begs the question, `Is there something wrong with it.`  If he were to release and we find that there is something wrong with it, then all of a sudden we`ve got 550 million barrels of worthless oil, and that takes a huge potential cushion out of the markets." 

 And here`s the price.  It is up, look at that folks, 88 cents a barrel at $36.80.  We`re getting close to $37.  And I just want to reiterate what Mr. Butel (ph) was talking about.  Peter was making it clear that this is a rumor that is the market and has substantially affected trading in the market. 

 MARCHINI:  Interesting.  One thing that apparently is not going to have a further impact on trading is tropical storm Gordon.  While it is washing over Florida, it does not seem to be about to derail any refineries. And we`re going to get more on that now from Prudence Solomon. 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks Deborah and Bill. Hello, everyone. 

 Gordon has lost some of his gusto as the tropical storm has been downgraded to a tropical depression.  Gordon`s now heading towards Georgia, and that`s where we join CNN`s Eric Phillips.  He is on Tybee Island.  And the storm is weakening considerably, Eric.  Any reason to fear Gordon? 

 ERIC PHILLIP, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, I don`t know if there`s any reason to fear Gordon, but the wind is definitely still blowing here in Tybee Island.  The rain is sort of off and on, but this thing has gone from a hurricane to a tropical storm, now a tropical depression.  And from all indications, it probably won`t be much more here than a rainmaker. 

 "Gordon hit land in Florida around 8:15 last night, packing near hurricane strength winds of up to 70 miles an hour.  The hardest hit area was Cedar Key, a barrier reef town about 100 miles north of Tampa. Electricity was knocked out for most of its 800 residents.  Waves reported at six feet, and gusting winds along with pounding rain brought flooding in central Florida that left man and animal waiting in the order.  Boat orders tried to batten down the hatches at nearby piers, hoping for the best.  In Crystal City, Florida, the storm left some debris in its path." 

 "I`ve seen it worse.  No name storm was worse." 

 "And here on Tybee Island, Georgia, Gordon brings periods of pounding rain and strong winds, less that what neighbors to the south have seen. The storm is expected to continue weakening as it makes its way north. But just to be on the safe side, schools here are closed for the day." 

 "Well, it`s a little windy.  It looks like it`s going to stop us from doing our construction work.  My crew hasn`t showed up yet.  I`ve been out here for about an hour and a half waiting on them.  It`s stopping me from making money." 

 "I guess it could be worse.  I`m here on vacation, so I`m here to enjoy it." 

 And that`s probably the best attitude to have.  It could`ve been worse. Again, the storm is expected to continue weakening as it heads north because it`ll be over land and sucking in the dry, hot air. 

 Eric Phillips, CNN live, Tybee Island, Georgia. 

 SOLOMON:  Eric, thank you so much. 

 In Los Angeles, an estimated half a million commuters who rely on public transportation have no ride.  A two-day transit strike is in effect for greater Los Angeles.  Striking workers are demanding higher wages and better benefits.  But no new contract talks between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the unions have been scheduled. 

 George W.  Bush will try to cut into his opponents lead as he hits the campaign trail this week.  The latest CNN, "USA Today" Gallop tracking poll shows vice president Al Gore with an eight percentage point lead over Bush. That`s consistent with last week`s tracking polls.  Bush is kicking off a six-day campaign swing today.  He`ll highlight his plans for education, tax relief, healthcare and social security, all aimed at attracting women voters.   Gore will also be focusing on female voters. He`ll be in Las Vegas today focusing on breast cancer.  Gore will also pull up the formal endorsement of the Teamster`s Union. 

 And those are the latest headlines, Deborah and Bill.  Back to you. 

 MARCHINI:  Thanks a lot, Prudence. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Prudence, thank you. 

 MARCHINI: And ahead, we`ve got interest rates backing up in the long end of the bond market today.  What it might mean for homebuilders, if anything. We`re going to talk about that. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  And does that make their stocks a good buy?  We`re going to put them under our sector spotlight and we`re going to introduce you to our word of the day.  That`s disinversion.  Plus, we have Greg Clarkin along with a look at movers a little bit later. 

 Be right back. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  All right, in today`s sector spotlight we take a look at building your portfolio with homebuilding stocks.  Our next guest expects a rally in the early winter months.  To get a closer look at the homebuilding sector, we`re joined by Stephen Kim of Salomon Smith Barney.  Stephen, welcome to the show.  Nice to have you here. 

 STEPHEN KIM, HOMEBUILDING SECTOR, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY:  Nice to be here. 

 TUCKER:  One could argue with energy prices rising, with the economy coming to a stalling halt here, maybe like homebuilders aren`t a real good place to go here.  We seem to be doing a theme of contrary investing. We heard the case for retailers at this point.  Give us the case for homebuilders at this time. 

 KIM:  Well, I think the homebuilders are a very interesting group at this point.  And I think what`s key to understand is that what you`re seeing is a confluence of all the factors you need to get this group moving. Let`s understand of course we`re dealing with a late cycle environment, but we`ve seen two major rallies in these stocks over the last five years, and both those rallies were in late cycle environments. What you need to get a stock - these stocks moving in a late cycle environment is to see a decline in housing stocks, not a big one but a decline in housing stocks.  And you`ve seen that.  You also need to see a reduction in analyst earnings estimates for the out year to come back to a level that people believe. And we have now seen that as well.  And also, we`re only looking for about 10 percent EPS growth, and that`s a level that people can believe in. These stocks have started to run/ 

 MARCHINI:  So you`re saying buy when the outlook looks bleak.  That`s really counter intuitive.  Can you explain the economics mechanism by which this works? 

 KIM:  Absolutely.  You have to understand you`re talking about a group which was trading t basically one times book value a little while ago, four times earnings.  Really, what you need in this kind of environment when you have stocks trading at that kind of valuation, is to have people focused on the group.  And when you`ve got a catalyst such as people believing that things have slowed sufficiently so that they`re not buying these builders when things can`t get any better, that`s exactly what you need to see. Bear in mind also that we`re still talking about earnings growth here. And starts being down isn`t the same thing as earnings being down for this group for a whole host of reasons, not the least of which is that the biggest builder in this country has two percent market share. So, what happens on the national front doesn`t necessarily happen to these companies. 

 TUCKER:  Are the homebuilders necessarily attached to the credit markets now?  I mean, there seem to be so many different kinds of financing vehicles available to people who want to go in and buy homes.  To what degree is the interest rate environment as seen in credit markets important? 

 KIM:  Well, what I would tell you is that if you see a market reversal in the interest rates such that you see 150, 200 basis point increase from here, and that probably will have an impact on the homebuilder`s fundamentals.  You`ll see a modest deterioration from what we are looking for.  However, I would tell you, one, we don`t envision that scenario, and number two, that I think if you see a 50 basis point increase that the rates are low enough now that that kind of move isn`t going to have a big impact on the demand for housing in this country. 

 MARCHINI:  CS First Boston this morning raised its earnings estimate on Lennar Corp. by a nickel to 85 cents, but the stock down today.  What do you think about Lennar? 

 KIM:  Well, Lennar is actually one of our favorite names.  And, in fact, we`ve had a buy on that all year.  The stock`s done very nicely here. It`s doubled.  However, what I would tell you is that what has been part and partial of our call in this group is that you`re going to continue to see the kind of upward estimate revisions that we`ve seen over the last month. Lennar is just one good example.  In fact, we`ve seen that estimates for five out of the last 10 - out of the 10 companies we cover, five of them have seen numbers go up in just the last four weeks.  And we think this is going to continue here as we head into the winter. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Stephen.  Thank you, Stephen. 

 KIM:  Sure. 

 TUCKER:  He is the housing analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.  And, Deborah, it`s really interesting because just last week Courtney Smith was on the program.  He likes the homebuilders now too, and he`s got a - and some of the same stocks that Stephen`s does.   So ... 

 MARCHINI:  This the economy slows down again.  It`s counter intuitive. 

 TUCKER:  Who would`ve thought. 

 MARCHINI:  Yeah.  But I guess maybe that`s why they`re out there making money.  If they don`t - they think out of the box. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  Well, some things aren`t counter intuitive, namely that when you get stocks who give earnings warnings that go down. 

 MARCHINI:  Yeah, we`ve had a few of those this morning. And our stocks editor, Greg Clarkin, is along to bring us the, reported nicely, morning movers.  Hi, Greg. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, guys.  We`re following Rockwell again.  A profit warning out of that company, as well as Gillette.  Both of those stocks had been particularly weak this morning. Rockwell hitting a new 52-week low actually. 

 I want to bring up the date on one company that`s actually making some news this morning as well, and that`s Avon products.  Now, the company confirming that they are speaking with J.C. Penney and Sears about possibly building what they`re calling a store within a store to sell Avon products. Now, at the same time, Avon executives going to great lengths to say that they will not - hopefully not cannibalize your core direct selling, the Avon lady base of the business.  And they say that these products to be sold at Penney and Sears, if they do come about, will be different from what is sold to the home market as well as sold in their catalogs and their brochures.  And they say they hope to have this new product line at Penney`s and Sears by the second half of the year 2001. 

 Now, we have seen shares of Avon today.  Little changed really.  We`ve seen a fractional loss actually in an overall fairly tough environment for some of the consumer stocks.  But still, Avon shares have had a nice run. Back in March or April or so this stock was trading in the mid-20`s and then ran up there.  You can see on the right hand side of that chart.  Ran up to about $41 and change or so.  And that`s presently where it stands.  Now, we should point out that just two weeks ago Avon came out with a bit of pre-announcement on the good side.  They said that they are on track for low mid teens net growth in the year 2000 and sales were ahead mid single digit year growth targets.  So, they`re seeing pretty good business. And on top of that, in that announcement two weeks ago, they said that they were allocating about $60 million for second half growth initiatives.  No word on whether or not this store within a store falls into that category. But either way, Avon looking to basically reach a new demographic, new consumer, some of the folks who may not be home, working women basically. 

 Deborah and Bill, back to you. 

 MARCHINI:  Yeah.  The secret out.  A lot of us in the office during the day.  And maybe their bosses don`t like us showing those products here. 

 Greg, I wanted to just ask you a little bit about interest rates.  The bond markets backing up today.  Does anybody see this as a meaningful back, what`s going on with stocks? 

 CLARKIN:  You know, we haven`t heard a lot of talk about that particularly this morning, Deb.  Most of the talk in the markets this morning has been focused on kind of on the foreign currency problems, the weak euro again, which seems to be really just foremost.  We had a profit warning last week from Colgate-Palmolive, this morning was Gillette, and then McDonald`s actually as well last week, saying that the exchange rates would hit their bottom line.  So, there still hasn`t been much about that.  I think what`s dominating traders` minds on the equity side really are the potential for some more profit warnings. They`re expecting the consumer goods folks to come out and say something.  They, for the most part, have, but still, you get the sense that a lot of folks are wondering if there`s another shoe to drop out there in terms of a big name company coming out saying they won`t be able to meet earnings targets. 

 TUCKER:  Greg, thanks. 

 CLARKIN:  Sure. 

 TUCKER:  Greg Clarkin as the markets editor.  And, you know, that little graph you saw of the bond market, that`s what folks call disinversion, because that means that the rates at the long end of the market are beginning to reflect the risk over time in their rising.  And that was our word of the day. 

 Thanks for joining us.  That`s the show as well. 

 MARCHINI:  Indeed.  I`m Deborah Marchini.  Thanks for joining IN THE MONEY. 

 TUCKER:  And I`m Bill Tucker.  We`ll see you tomorrow.

 Dana Corp: Ford Prod Cuts Affecting Top And Bottom Line

 DETROIT -(Dow Jones)- Dana Corp. (DCN) officials said several factors contributed to its profit warning Monday. 

 In a conference call Monday with the media and analysts, Dana Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Magliochetti listed four items which he said hurt the supplier industry: unscheduled production cuts, a decline in heavy truck output, the strength of the dollar against the euro and a lagging replacement parts market. 

 And while some suppliers have been hit by only a couple of these issues, Dana has suffered from all four, Magliochetti said. 

 "The unscheduled production cuts have affected our top and bottom lines," he said during the call. 

 Magliochetti also said Dana hadn't expected the weak euro to be such an issue for the company. The euro has haunted many suppliers over the past couple quarters, and lately it has been hitting record lows below 90 U.S. cents. 

 "We didn't plan for this much erosion," Magliochetti said. 

 While Dana's profit warning was for the current third quarter, the company said it expects some rough spots in the fourth quarter as well. Among these, the market for heavy duty trucks is expected to be down the balance of the year, Dana said. 

 Analysts have said the replacement parts market may also be soft well into next year. 

 Regarding the recent decision to close the company's plant in Reading, Pa., Dana said in the conference call that job cuts could boost earnings in the fourth quarter by 10 cents per share. 

 In August, Dana said it would close the plant, affecting 682 of the 1,300 employees working there.

 DuPont 3Q earnings warning triggers stock slide.

 A 3Q 2000 profit warning from E.I. du Pont de Nemours has sparked off a fall in share prices for US chemical companies. Du Pont shares fell from $47 to $40.19. Analysts have revised forecasts downwards for Dow Chemical, Lyondell, Rohm and Haas and Millennium. DuPont cut its prediction for 2000 EPS to $2.85 (previous forecast $2.95). This was due to higher energy and raw material charges, exchange rates between the Euro and the dollar and a slowing in the US economy. DuPont expects these factors to cost it $250-275 M in the 2H of 2000. The analysts Merrill Lynch have reduced the forecast for 2000 EPS on Dow Chemical to $2.40, a drop of 40 cents. Although Rohm and Haas is expected to benefit from the lower propylene prices, the cost other raw materials such as natural gas, acetone and vinyl acetate have increased. Some analysts are also cutting EPS forecasts for 2001.

Investors expect profit dip to continue; Experts blame declining foreign currencies, rising cost of energy

As they do every quarter, companies that expect profits to fall short of forecasts are breaking the bad news.

So why are investors taking it so hard this time around?

Part of the problem is that Wall Street has been spoiled by the rapid profit growth at U.S. companies in 1999 and early this year. Earnings for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index reached 23.6% in the first quarter, the highest in more than six years.

It's been downhill since, and investors are betting that with the economy slowing, oil prices surging and Europe's common currency weakening, company results will only get worse.

"Earnings are still terrific, but they ain't what they were," said Vincent Farrell, who helps manage $4.5 billion at Spears, Benzak, Salomon & Farrell Inc. The slowdown "is going to get reflected in the prices people are willing to pay for stocks."

Just this week, computer assembler SCI Systems Inc. plunged 32%, farm and construction equipment maker Gehl Co. fell 27%, airplane-parts maker Crane Co. sank 18% and drug maker Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. plunged 21% all after warning of disappointing profit.

For the week, the S&P 500 lost 1.9%, the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 3.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.5%. For the second week in a row, all three indexes declined.

Even the S&P 400 MidCap Index, which racked up a series of records in late August and is up 22% this year, lost 0.5% for the week.

Two months ago, analysts expected companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to report earnings growth of 19.2% in the third quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.

Now, with the end of the third quarter two weeks away, that forecast has fallen to 17.2%.

There have been 110 announcements of lower-than-expected earnings for the third quarter, according to First Call, up from 69 at the same time last quarter. The outlook for earnings growth at consumer products companies has fallen to 6% from 15% since April. Predictions of profit growth for transport companies have dropped to 25% from 36%.

Companies that sell goods in Europe find that they can buy fewer dollars when they try to convert euros into the U.S. currency.

McDonald's Corp. said declining foreign currencies will cut 2000 earnings by 7 cents a share. Shares slid 2.6% this week and are down 17% in a month.

The euro has lost 14% of its value against the U.S. dollar so far this year. Crane also cited the weak euro in its profit warning.

"McDonald's is a good example of what might be epidemic," said Farrell. "If McDonald's is going to have problems, then everyone who does business internationally is going to have the same problem."

Solutia Inc., which makes chemicals used in nylon carpets, and glass maker PPG Industries Inc., and paint company Sherwin-Williams Co. all cited rising energy prices in their profit warnings.

Faced with slowing growth, Farrell said he's been buying shares of companies that have relatively low price-earnings ratios, indicating investor expectations already are low.

Recent purchases include AmSouth Bancorp., SunTrust Banks Inc. and CIT Group Inc. He sold Intel and International Business Machines Corp.

IBM sells for 28 times this year's expected profit and Intel's price-earnings ratio is 33. AmSouth's PE is 11, SunTrust 12 and CIT is 8.

Crude oil futures finished the week at a 10-year high. That's not all bad news for stock investors, of course. Phillips Petroleum Co. jumped 7% this week, McDermott International Inc., which builds offshore oil platforms and pipelines, rallied 16%, and Unocal Corp. gained 7.7%.

As the economy slows, purchases of computers and other products are likely to decline.

The economy perked along at an 8.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1999, slowing to a 5.3% rate in the second quarter this year. Now many economists expect it to slow to a 3% to 4% rate in the second half of 2000.

That means warnings from companies such as SCI Systems could become more common. The firm, which builds personal computers and TV set-top boxes for other firms, said Wednesday that fiscal first-quarter profit wouldn't meet forecasts because PC sales fell.

Technology companies, whose price-earnings ratios are generally higher than non-computer-related firms, will be hurt the most, investors say.

 NEW YORK, Sept 18 (AFP) - Stocks drifted in a narrow range Monday as traders were cautious ahead of quarterly earnings reports from US companies. 

 The Dow Jones industrials slipped 31.91 (0.29 percent) to 10,895.09 and the Nasdaq rose 23.58 points (0.61 percent) to 3,858.81 at 1435 GMT. 

 The Standard and Poor's 500 edged up 1.06 points (0.07 percent) to 1,466.87. 

 Although the major indices were mixed, advancers led decliners on the broader marker 1,514 to 836 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Analysts said traders were cautious about the outlook for US corporate earnings for the third quarter because of the slumping euro and surging oil prices. 

 Gillette slid 1-1/16 to 28-3/4 after issuing a profit warning because of the effect of the euro on its earnings. 

 Other companies that could also see exchange-rate woes were being sold: Colgate-Palmolive shed 1-1/4 to 45-1/4, Procter and Gamble 3/8 to 61-9/16, and Eastman-Kodak 9/16 to 62-1/4. 

 Electronics maker Rockwell tumbled 6-3/16 to 32 after issuing its own profit warnings due to lower demand for automobile components. 

 Time Warner rose 3-15/16 to 83-3/4 after news that it was offering concessions to European regulators examining its merger with EMI Music. America Online, which is in the process of acquiring Time Warner, rose 2-1/16 to 57-3/8. 

 In the tech sector, Micron Technologies rose 3-1/4 to 62-3/8, Intel gained one dollar to 59-3/8 and Altera rose 1-3/16 to 53-1/4. But Motorola slipped 1/2 to 34-1/2. 

 Oil shares rose with the price of crude: Exxon Mobil gained 15/16 to 89-15/16, Chevron rose 1-15/16 to 92-5/16, Texaco edged up 3/4 to 55-3/4 and BP Amoco 3/8 to 55-1/2. 

 On the bond market, the yield on the 10-year bond edged up to 5.888 percent from 5.833 percent Friday and on the 30-year bond to 5.958 percent against 5.895 percent. The rise in yields translates into a decline in bond prices.

 UPDATE 1-Maytag shares fall after  profit warning .

 CHICAGO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Shares of Maytag Corp. fell 6 percent Friday after the appliance maker said disruptions in the retail landscape and a slowdown in consumer spending would cut into earnings in the fiscal second half. 

 Newton, Iowa-based Maytag said late Thursday that lost business from Circuit City Stores Inc. and Heilig-Meyers Co. would cause earnings to fall 8 percent-10 percent from the $1.74 a share it reported in the second half of 1999. 

 Circuit City exited the appliance business in July and retailer Heilig-Meyers recently said it would close more than 300 of its 800 stores under a bankruptcy reorganization. 

 "Although it is worse than we expected, people have known that Circuit City was exiting the business," said Larry Horan, analyst at regional brokerage firm Parker/Hunter. He also noted that Heilig-Meyers had been in financial trouble for some time. 

 The earnings warning from Maytag, maker of refrigerators, clothes washers and Hoover vacuum cleaners, follows competitor Whirlpool Corp.'s warning in August that third-quarter profit would miss analysts' forecasts due to the loss of Circuit City as a major outlet for its products. 

 Swedish appliance maker AB Electrolux in August also warned it faced tough business conditions in the second half due to flattening demand from U.S. and European consumers. 

 Maytag shares were down $2-3/16 at $33-5/8 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has a 52-week high of $50-3/16 and a 52-week low of $25-15/16. 

 Maytag on Thursday said it now expects earnings per share in the mid-70-cent range in the third quarter and in the low-to-mid-80-cent range in the fourth quarter. 

 Analysts had expected Maytag to report third-quarter earnings of 96 cents and fourth-quarter earnings of 97 cents, according to a poll by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 In guiding analysts' forecasts down for the second half of 2000, Maytag also cited increased price competition in major appliances, triggered largely by Circuit City's actions, and an overall softening in major appliance industry sales, reflecting general economic conditions. 

 Justin Maurer, Merrill Lynch consumer durable goods analyst, said a slowdown in orders could dog Maytag beyond the second half. 

 "Unfortunately it is going to linger into next year," Maurer said. "The issue is do the other retailers use this opportunity to take their inventory down given the slowdown in consumer spending?" 

 Maytag's stock may have further downside potential, he said, because the price had been propped in recent weeks by rumours the company could be acquired by Electrolux.

 Real Software needs help to reduce debt-analysts.

 BRUSSELS, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Belgian software firm Real Software , which once had a good appetite for acquisitions, may now need to sell up to a 10 percent stake to reduce its crushing debt, analysts said on Friday. 

 Real Software needs to cut its a debt-to-equity ratio of 180 percent to a more manageable level and restore management credibility, they said. 

 "They need money," Smeets Securities analyst Bert Maes told Reuters. "They have a balance sheet problem." 

 Real Software shares plunged 9.64 percent to close at 49.70 euros on Friday, after earlier touching a 21-month low of 49.55 euros. 

 The stock had soared 500 percent in 1998 following the company's flotation in 1997, but has fallen sharply since. 

 Analysts said Chairman Rudy Hageman told them on Thursday he was considering selling a stake of up to 10 percent. 

 Hageman told Reuters the company could sell up to a five percent stake. 

 On Thursday the company reported first-half net profit plunged 81 percent to 600,000 euros ($518,100) from 3.1 million last time. Turnover rose to 128.1 million euros from 125.4 million. 

 The company said it had net debt of 223 million euros. 

 Analyst Maes said Real Software needed to raise more than 75 million euros to reduce its net debt to equity ratio to 100 percent. 

 Bank Degroof analyst Piet De Neve said the company would have to sell the equivalent of about a 10 percent stake to raise that kind of money. 

 U.S ACQUISITION DAMAGED CREDIBILITY 

 "The market is no longer buying the Real Software story," said one fund manager. "Credibility has come down a bit." 

 In July 1999 the company acquired Tava Technologies for $190 million, its largest ever acquisition which it said was designed to win it a substantial foothold in the U.S. market. 

 The acquisition, however, has proved to be a disappointment. The group has since issued two profit warnings, both related to its U.S. operations, and been forced to restructure Tava at a cost of $12.6 million in the first half. 

 "That was the biggest mistake that (Real Software) ever made," Maes said. "It's not easy for a Belgian company to go do business in the United States because nobody knows who you are over there and you have to put a lot of working capital into it." 

 "Expanding into the United States proved to be a wrong move," agreed De Neve. "If had just remained as a Benelux company, it would be very nice," he added, referring to the company's core market of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 

 "Real Software's track record was great until it acquired Tava," chimed in another fund manager. 

 On Thursday, Real Software revised downward its net profit growth forecast for the 2000 full-year to 45 percent, down from 50-60 percent. The revision was the second profit warning in less than a year.

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Utilities looking strong again as we end the week here.  It is some triple expiration, I believe, today on the Street, but that doesn`t seem to be doing much for the markets. Those inflation numbers, what`s going on? 

 Let`s check in with Christine Romans. 

 It seems to be a bit of a muddle here this morning, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  That is the best way to put it. I`ll tell you, Bill, a lot of different cross-currents going on in this market.  Traders saying that overall, it`s sort of masking some individual stock stories.  So we`ll zero in on those.  Among the biggest gainers in the Dow, United Technology, U-T-X is its ticker symbol.  S.G. Cowen has said a very solid third quarter results in prospect despite a difficult environment.  Their earnings per share estimate is 97 cents a share. The price target of $92.  The company sees 15 percent earnings per share growth intact for 2001.  This is all S.G. Cowen with comments about United Technology, UTX. 

 Another stock we`re watching, although it`s moving in the opposite direction, that is Pentair.  And the ticker symbol is PNR.   It`s a diversified manufacturer.   And it`s coming out with a profit warning. We heard all sorts of people talking about this one earlier today watching it, and indeed, it did sell-off. Besides turn around of its tools and equipment units it was not expected until early 2001.  It warned for its earnings for the third quarter year 2000 and 2001.  It`s saying all of them will be below the Street`s expectations.  U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray weighing in, cutting its price target to $24 from $49 a share on Pentair and cutting it`s rating to a neutral from a buy. 

 And finally ArvinMeritor, A-R-M is the ticker symbol.  It`s a Michigan company that is an auto parts supplier.  And it is warning of -- stock is trading weaker here.  It says it expects fourth quarter earnings well below the Street`s expectations, 40 to 45 cents a share versus the First Call estimate of 60 cents a share, citing a downturn in production of certain vehicles, citing weakness of the euro and customer plant slowdowns and shut downs.  So that`s what`s going on there.  Those are among the stocks that we are watching.  Meanwhile, the Dow just stuck right near yesterday`s closing level. 

 See you later. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Christine, stuck is the word.  But it`s Friday so we can get unstuck and get out of here soon.  Thanks, Christine Romans, at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Oracle has announced positive earnings results, but it`s stock is certainly being weighed down at the Nasdaq this morning. 

 Let`s head to midtown Manhattan where Charles Molineaux is at the Nasdaq marketSite. 

 Hello, Charles, that`s an understatement, isn`t it, for Oracle? 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, afraid so, you`ve got to keep in mind, of course, that Oracle has had really a phenomenal run-up. 

 It saw a big jump, before it reported it`s earnings yesterday.  And actually hit a 52-week high just a couple of weeks ago.  So it has been priced just about to perfection.  And while good, this result was not quite perfection.  Yes, look at this, down by $4.25 or five percent right now. 

 Yes, Oracle made 17cents a share in it`s first quarter, that is four cents better than the First Call consensus forecast, and more than twice last year`s profit figure.  It also announced a two for one stock split. But there`s a lot of concern about the growth of the company`s application software business. That growth was shy of some extremely bullish analyst predictions, thinking  this is the fastest growing segment of Oracle`s business.  There`s a lot of promise there and it didn`t quite live up to it.  Salomon Smith Barney is raising its profit forecast for Oracle, although Salomon analysts say the soft applications numbers could be trouble in short-term. 

 Prudential is calling this quarter solid growth, and reiterating its strong buy rating on the stock and raising its earnings forecast for the stock for this year and next year.  Red Hat, on the other hand, is falling a lot more dramatically, off by $3, or 14 almost 15 percent right now at $21.50. It sells software based on the Linux operating system.  And it lost a penny a share in the second quarter.  That`s half the two cents a share loss the market had expected and a big improvement over the six cents a share Red Hat`s lost same time a year ago.  But ABN AMRO is now downgrading Red Hat from a buy to an outperform.  Check out ANADIGICS which is off as well, down by $5, or 18 percent.  This isn`t earnings, this is an earnings warning.   The company said that it expects its fourth quarter revenues to come in 30 to 50 percent below the third quarter.  The company says it has run into trouble because a top wireless customer has cutback on production to balance its inventory.  And the Nasdaq is sliding.  Oracle`s one of our biggest big caps, and down it goes.  We`re looking at a steep drop for now 55 percent -- 55 points, rather, down on very heavy volume, 644 million shares traded.  That`s very heavy, at least, compared to what we`ve come to see lately -- Susan. 

 LISOVICZ:  Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq, thanks, Charles. 

 TUCKER:  Well, as Charles just told us, Oracle is on the move on the Nasdaq today.  For a closer look at what`s behind Oracle today, let`s bring in Jeff Henley.  He`s the company`s chief financial officer, and he joins us from the Oracle`s headquarters in California. 

 Jeff, good morning and thanks for coming on. 

 JEFFREY HENLEY, CFO, ORACLE:  Yes, good morning, my pleasure to be here. 

 TUCKER:  Hey, you know, a real nice solid set of numbers, but in a lot of ways you can`t win for losing.   Last quarter, people were upset that database sales weren`t as strong as expected.  And application sales were stronger.   It`s the reverse this quarter.   I mean, is this a reflection of just some investor anticipation or what`s going on here? 

 HENLEY:  Yes, I think so, it`s -- we had a fairly stunning quarter.  I mean, it`s the best first quarter start we`ve had in license growth in six years.  We more than doubled our earnings.  We rebounded sharply in our biggest database business.  So I think it`s just sort of the sign of the times.   What we always tell people is you can`t look at just one quarter. We had a really terrific break out quarter in applications in the fourth quarter to end our year at 63 percent.  We started the year at 42 in applications.  And I think people`s expectations are very high.  Ours are too, by the way.  And we`ve said that we don`t think that we`ll do 42 for the year.  We think we`ll do a lot more.  So I think we just have to go wait another quarter, post a bigger number and maybe people will feel a bit better. 

 TUCKER:  Well, actually, you know, Jeff, you anticipated my next question. I was going to say you`re the one setting the standard, though.  I mean, the Street`s not happy with 42 because they expected 43 to 57.  You`re already out there saying it`s going to be 50, maybe even 100 percent. 

 HENLEY:  Well, I think it`s true.  I think that people who follow the company over the years know that our Q1s are sometime a little bit shy of things.  So I think everyone that knows us and has watched us over the years, typically doesn`t get too spooked by just one quarter if we, you know, miss the mark a little bit.  And I think that`s what we did. We had a good quarter, it`s just that we maybe fell a little bit short. So, we`re not worried at all.  We think this new release of applications we call 11I is going to be absolutely phenomenal.  We are going to blow this industry away over the next couple of years.  We have no reservations to say that this is going to be an unbelievable next couple of years in the applications business for Oracle. 

 LISOVICZ:  Jeff, it`s Susan Lisovicz here, want to switch gears for a minute.  Certainly your technology depends on the talent that you have. One of your most respected players, Ray Lane, left a few month ago.  One of the reasons why, he just wasn`t getting along so well with the mercurial Larry Ellison.  How important is it for the company to retain the best and the brightest? 

 HENLEY:  Well, it`s obviously really important.  I`d say - I`m not quite sure you said it right about Ray.  I don`t think it was getting along, it`s just Ray`s role had been reduced quite a bit.  And so I think it was just he felt there wasn`t enough to do, wasn`t the lack of getting along with Larry.  But Larry has gotten very deeply involved in the operations of the company.  I might say he`s added a tremendous value over this last year or two.  But it`s obviously really important that we keep - we`ve about over 40,000 employees.  And the people are important to the company.  So we`re always working at trying to retain good people and so forth.  And we`ll keep doing that. 

 LISOVICZ:  Just a quick follow-up, though, you acknowledge that he was one of your best, and he didn`t have enough to do.  That seems like a contradiction right there. 

 HENLEY:  Well, as I said, Larry has gotten more deeply involved in the operations of the business.  And he used to be more involved in just product side.  So it just is a case of Larry took over a lot of things that Ray used do.  So Ray just wasn`t as deeply involved in some of the parts of the business that he used to be. 

 TUCKER:  Last question for you, Jeff.  You`re having to deal with the potential slowdown in the economy.  Your forecasts are pretty rosy.  And you do have great expectations for the company.  Could those get unsettled or perhaps unseated if we see a more dramatic slowdown and less capital spending? 

 HENLEY:  Well, of course, I mean, you know, we`re not impervious to economic cycles.  So if there were some big economic downturn, it would have some effect on all of us.  We`re not predicting that, but who knows for sure? 

 TUCKER:  All right, thank you, Jeff Henley, he`s the chief financial officer at Oracle, thanks for being here. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  We decided to take a look at  Maytag (URL: http://www.maytagcorp.com/) in our "Stock of the Day" profile. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) 

 TUCKER:  The company that FL Maytag founded in 1893 began life as a manufacturer of feeder attachment for grain threshing machines. I was not until 1907 that  the Maytag  Corporations introduced its first hand-crank washing  machine complete with wooden tub. Today Maytag is the number three home appliance maker behind Whirlpool and General Electric. Maytag also makes Hoover brand vacuum cleaners and vending machines for cold beverages. Lower than expected sales growth last year forced Maytag to pair down its excess inventory and a sharp drop off in its beverage vending machines business is cutting into this year`s profit. Add to that Circuit City`s decision to exit  the appliance sales business and you`d think Maytag`s all washed up. Not so. Home Depot is ramping  up its sales of appliances at its home improvement warehouses which could translate in  to several hundred million dollars of sales for Maytag. The company`s ongoing develop of its e-procurement activity should result in significant cost saving down the road.  And analyst continue to speculate that the Swedish appliance maker Electrolux is interested  in making a bid for Maytag. Maytag stock meanwhile has been stuck in  the spin cycle. It`s down 25 percent so far this year, but it has manage to add climb 37 percent since hitting a low of 25 in early March. 

 (END VIDEOCLIP) 

 TUCKER: All right. Let`s check  the stock price. It is down $2 to 33 3/4.For more on Maytag, we  are joined by Lawrence Horan,  director of research at  Parker/Hunter. He joins us from Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania. Welcome, sir. 

 LAWRENCE HORAN, PARKER/HUNTERL Good morning. 

 TUCKER:  The Maytag man has got to be getting lonelier. Not only are they are not breaking down, they`re not selling them as well. But this Home Depot deal strikes me as interesting. Does it have  a potential to be even better for Maytag than perhaps  the Circuit City deal? 

 HORAN: No, because I don`t believe that Home Depot will dedicate  the floor space that Circuit City did to the appliance business. 

 LISOVICZ: Actually this story is so reminiscent, Lawrence, of Whirlpool which just reported its same problem with Circuit City with slowing appliance sales. So do you think that will Maytag can completely replace the venders with Circuit City and  the other store that has filed forever bankruptcy? 

 HORAN: I think that  the market will absorb  it. People still need to buy their appliances although the number of shipments will probably be going down after all the Fed has been telling us for over a year it wants the economy to slow and it really wants consumer spending to slow. And so you know that is being priced in to the stock. I mean Maytag  a little over a year ago was at $75. So, it has lost. And Whirlpool lost a similar percentage. 

 TUCKER: It`s been brutal for all of them. I`m raising  the question can Maytag survive. It is a perennial rumored takeover target. Electrolux is a name that gets bandied about the most. Does Maytag need do a combination here with somebody? OR can they make a go of it? 

 HORAN: I think they can make a go of it. There`s no question about that; although it is a metal bending business with very high fixed cost. If you could combine with somebody who is larger or roughly the same size, you may be able to spread your fix costs over more units and be able to become more efficient, and challenge Whirlpool and GE. 

 TUCKER:  Give us one quick answer here. Is it a buy in your book or do you want to stay away from it and watch it for a bit? 

 HORAN: I would stay away from it, I like it under 30. 

 TUCKER: Under 30. Lawrence Horan, thank you very much for being our guest, with Parker/Hunter. 

 HORAN: My pleasure. 

 TUCKER:  Out in Pittsburgh. Now that you`ve heard  everything about Maytag, head  down to the bottom of the  CNNfn.com web page and tell  us whether or not we should  buy the stock. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 LISOVICZ: It`s Friday, and that  means Business Week`s Gene  Marcial is in the house with  today`s edition of "Inside Wall Street." The three stocks gene touted  last week had a mixed  performance. KEMET(URL: http://www.kemet.com/) , the electronics gear  maker, rose more than 3 percent,  while American States  gained more than 7 percent. But Ultramar Diamond (URL: http://www.udscorp.com/) , the oil refiner, fell slightly. Gene returns today, this time  with a list of three names that will be familiar to all  of us! Gene, welcome. Good to see you. And we`re going to start with Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) , which is best known lately for disappointing the street, but that`s not what you`re talking about. 

 GENE MARCIAL, BUSINESSWEEK:  No. this glamorous stock has been deglamorized. The stock has been cut to 15 from 30 and that has stirred speculation. My big story is it`s a takeover candidate. 

 LISOVICZ:  And you`ve got some names actually. 

 MARCIAL: Right. 

 LISOVICZ: Who`s looking at it? 

 MARCIAL: My sources say that Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) the giant high tech company. 

 LISOVICZ: Dow 30. 

 MARCIAL: Is out there. And there`s another interesting acquirer, would-be acquirer is Canon of Japan. It`s working with a US investor group that`s known for buyout --financing buyout. 

 TUCKER: Has the company indicated, Gene, that they might be interested or perhaps entertain offers? 

 MARCIAL: I was in touch with the company and they say it`s a matter of policy they don`t want to comment, but the street hopes that it happens because the stock`s been thrashed and it needs to enhance its stock. 

 LISOVICZ: And more than that, there`s not  a lot of  expectations that it will really meet even those limited reduced forecasts in the next couple of quarters. 

 MARCIAL: Right. One analyst was saying it`s walking a tight rope. Not enough elbow room to even meet, as you say, the expectations. 

 TUCKER: Funny you mentioned tight rope because one of the other stocks you talked about walked a tight rope and fell off of it the and that`s QUALCOMM (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) . A lot of people hoping to see it get back up. 

 LISOVICZ: It was the best performing stock of the market last year. 

 MARCIAL: Number one last year. 20-fold gain, believe it or not. But now this year the stock is down 60 percent, but this is what I call a comeback kid. The stock is coming back. 

 LISOVICZ: Not to the magnitude of last year. 

 MARCIAL: Well, in a couple of year, my sources say it could go up to $150 a share. Three reasons. Japan is back, using its so-called CDMA technology. Wireless technology. And Korea, sales of handheld devices have been ramping up and they use CDMA. And next year, they`ll have new products equipped with Internet access facilities. 

 LISOVICZ: But the competition in that field is so fierce and you think that Qualcomm is still on top of its game in terms of new technology and products? 

 MARCIAL: Well, there is a prediction that it will be the Intel of the wireless space because they expect CDMA to be the standard for wireless. 

 LISOVICZ: That`s pretty good. 

 TUCKER:  It is pretty good. Last stock is the The Gap (URL: http://www.gap.com/) which has gapped down. 

 LISOVICZ: Big gap there in expectations. 

 MARCIAL: Trying to bridge the gap. The stock is down about 50 percent. It is a victim of its own success. Last year the Gap`s fashion was a big hit. They couldn`t do that this year. At first, there was a distribution snafu at the Old Navy, one of its stores. And that delayed the shipments, but this year, it`s, again, another rebounding stock. This year, they are coming up with smarter fashion apparel and they say that the stock --the earnings would be up 20, 25 percent growth rate starting  2001. And it`s back, the Gap. 

 LISOVICZ: That`s a tough one; the teen audience, fashion audience. 

 TUCKER: My kids love the Gap and Old Navy both. So it will be interesting if they do turn it around. 

 LISOVICZ: That alone will help it. The Tucker family. 

 TUCKER:  That`s right. Gene, thanks. Gene Marcial. See you next Friday. 

 MARCIAL: Thank you. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I`m still Bill Tucker. 

 LISOVICZ:  And I`m still Susan Lisovicz.  Coming up, we`ll talk to a Ford analyst who attended this morning`s meeting with the automaker`s CEO, the very embattled, Jacques Nasser. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  Plus, we`ll hear from a market watcher who thinks the Dow will hit a record high by the end of the year.  But first, let`s get you caught up to date on where the markets are at the moment. 

 LISOVICZ:  No records today, that`s for sure.  Well, the Dow tried to rally briefly, but it`s down 12 points now at 11,074.  Nasdaq, well, it`s continuing its losing streak, down 60 points at 3,853. 

 For a closer look at the market action we have Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange and Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq MarketSite. Let`s start with you, Christine.  TGIF. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, TGIF.  But you know what, Susan?  It`s not a getaway Friday on a day that`s also a triple witch. This is the kind of day when everyone`s got to be on their toes and be ready in case there`s any volatility that should perk up.  Nothing much right now, but what you are seeing traders say is that buyers are ditching the triple witching.  They`re not really around here today.  A lot of people sort of keeping an eye on things, waiting to see what`s happening. But definitely the imbalances in the very early going and the trend has been to the sell side really all morning.  What I`ve been hearing for the last couple of days, and indeed again today, as we wrap up this week and head into the next week is that it`s really a trader`s market, that the action in the indexes really sort of masks some of the things that are going on in the broader market.  There are some people who are saying that the broader market`s still acting OK, especially when you take at the new highs versus new lows.  They say they still like that for the breadth books over all pretty well, but they all agree - lots of people here saying that it is a trader`s market.  You got to pick you stocks, pick your positions. As one trader said the other day, it is a disaster avoidance.  Also, these pre-announcements continue, as Art Cashin (ph) from PaineWebber says. He says it`s the parade of the dog ate my third quarter earnings.  He said that they`ll see that continue, and we`ll watch for that next week, which is really supposed to be the biggest, heaviest week in terms of pre-announcements in the traditional season. And, of course, the next earnings reporting season gets under way in mid-October. 

 So, that`s where things stand.  We`ve got the Dow down about 12 points, 11,074.  Volume coming in about 584 million shares at this point. 

 For a look at things over at the Nasdaq, let`s bring in Charles Molineaux. Charles, earnings warnings the sentiment for the leading scene there as well? 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, earnings warnings and, of course, Oracle`s earnings, which were above up expectations but included some difficulties in the fine print, which has dragged down Oracle and has dragged down the rest of this market as well.  And, of course, that tripe witching also contributes to the Nasdaq`s volume and, yes, volatility. We`re down 56 points right now at 3,856. 

 Although if you take a look at what we`ve done over the course of this session, actually it`s been wobbly, but we`ve been worse.  We actually hit a low of 3,835, down s78 points.  We were never in positive territory. Actually, we opened up not too far from our session high of 3,905, still down by 8.  So, not such a good picture.  We`ve got all sectors down except for biotechs.  And, of course, the declining issues are way ahead of advancers by about a two to one margins.  Computers are off by 1 1/2 percent.  Telecom stocks are off by 1 percent.  Industrial stocks are off by 1 percent.  We got chip stocks down by 2 percent on the day, and Internet stocks are still sliding.   They`re down by about 1 1/2.  And, of course, here we have Oracle.  Yep, down by $3 or 4 1/2 percent.  It reported 17 cents a share.  That was better than expected, but there`s concerns about its application software sales growth rate, which was expected to be the strongest growth rate of Oracle`s respected divisions. And it was not quite what some of the more bullish analyst anticipations had been.  And sure enough, that stock is selling off.  Although, actually, even as they`ve sold it off, a lot of analysts said that it was a very strong and solid-looking quarter with good growth. 

 Again, down by 54 points right now at 3,859, 745 million shares traded. So it is a busy day here on the Nasdaq. 

 Bill.  Susan. 

 LISOVICZ:  Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq MarketSite.  Thanks, Charles. 

 TUCKER:  Our next guest - we`re already talking with him - says the broader markets will reach new highs by the end of the year, but his outlook on tech stocks appears to be less positive, and that`s weighing down his forecast for the Nasdaq. 

 LISOVICZ:  Courtney Smith of ORBITEX Global Funds ... 

 TUCKER:  No, he`s not ORBITEX any more. 

 COURTNEY SMITH, ANALYST, ORBITEX GLOBAL FUNDS:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

 TUCKER:  ORBITEX?  Is that OK? 

 SMITH:  You got it. 

 TUCKER:  It says Courtney Smith & Company. 

 SMITH:  Both, both. 

 LISOVICZ:  Let`s face it, that`s really what it is.  Well, he`s here to tell us about the Nasdaq and about daycare.  Let`s start with technology, though, because it`s certainly the story today.  You`re not so bullish about it, and certainly it`s selling off today.  What`s going on? 

 SMITH:  No, I`ve been calling for a number of months that I`d see that the Nasdaq would underperform the broader markets largely because of supply of tech stocks in the marketplace.  We have a record setting IPO calendar right now, we have the lockups coming due from last year`s record setting IPOs, and then we`re also seeing record setting insider selling, and that`s also keeping me nervous.  Combine that with the fact that we have very high valuations with a lot of the bellwethers is also leading to institutional investors to bail out of some of these names as well.  So, when I sit down and I say the underlying fundamentals of the companies are very good but the underlying fundamentals for the stocks are poor, and that`s keeping a weight on the Nasdaq, but no applying to the S&P or Dow-type stocks, which are more interest rate sensitive. And the interest rate picture is much more bullish.  So, that`s why I`ve been saying focus on interest rate sensitive S&P, Dow stocks.  Stay away, generally speaking, from Nasdaq. These are blanket statements, of course, but ... 

 TUCKER:  Right now, the Nasdaq, as a matter of fact, year to date is underperforming not by much.  It`s down 3.8 percent. 

 SMITH: Right. 

 TUCKER:  The Dow is down 3.6 percent. 

 SMITH:  And the S&P`s about flat. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, the S&P, I think, is running just about flat.  It`s up like 3/4 percent.  But your call for a record high on the Dow is somewhat cautious too, because we`re only seven percent below the high on this. 

 SMITH:  Exactly.  But I think we have to get through the whole market first through a dip here in September and October, simply because, once again, there is new supply coming into the market.  So, we normally see a decline in September/October because of this increase in supply coming off of the summer doldrums.  So, I think we`re going to see that across the board, but that`s going to be a very minor dip and that`s going to then lead us up to new highs.  So, we may be coming from a base, not of seven percent from the highs but maybe 10 percent from the highs, or 11 or 12 percent.  So, then we have to make up that 10, 12 percent in just a couple of months or maybe early January, something like that. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK.  So, let`s switch to one of your picks.  I`ll bite corporate daycare. 

 SMITH:  Corporate daycare.  This is a huge trend in America.  This is a very strong demographic trend.  More and more companies want to provide daycare centers for their employees.  The labor market is tight, so this is clearly going to be the type of perk that people are going to want to provide to their employees.  I`m sure you`ve got one here, right? 

 TUCKER:  Oh, yeah. 

 SMITH:  Oh, I`m in the daycare center here. 

 TUCKER:  You`re in the daycare center. 

 SMITH:  I see.  OK. 

 LISOVICZ:  I think that`s a big, big parent. 

 TUCKER:  The makeup room qualifies as a daycare center here. 

 LISOVICZ:  We might lose it if you keep talking. 

 SMITH:  That`s why I look so funny.  The makeup - OK.  But the - so a company called Bright Horizons - ticker symbol is BFAM - this is a company that provides daycare centers to corporate clients.  And they`re growing incredibly fast.  It`s not a particularly expensive stock right now, so I think that one`s poised to really - you got a tight labor market? How can you make money from it?  This is a way to make money from a tight labor market. 

 TUCKER:  Your other two labor picks, not surprising given your comments on interest rates, one`s a financial stock.  But I want to ask you about the builder.  You want Kaufman and Broad.  And there are other builders. There`s Ryland Homes, there`s Toll Brothers, there`s CenTra. Why them over ...Tra.  Why them over ... 

 SMITH:  You know, honestly, in my portfolio I own Kaufman and Broad, I own Toll Brothers, I own Pulte, I own Lennar. 

 TUCKER:  OK. 

 SMITH:  Those are the four that I own.  And I`m very interested in Katelas (ph), but I don`t own it.  Those are the ones that I really like, but I can only pick one.  Basically, Kaufman and Broad is more California-based. I thin that California`s coming on stronger than the general economy, so that`s one of the reasons why I wanted to be focused - that`s the one I picked Kaufman and Broad rather that Toll or Pulte or Lennar. 

 TUCKER:  Does the California theme hold for Washington Mutual? 

 SMITH:  It holds for a certain extent there.  Washington Mutual`s the interest rate sensitive stock.  Once again, this is not a stock that you want to hold for the rest of your life, but its` a good, well run company. But it`s a pure interest rate play because it`s a savings and loan whereas the big banks are not pure interest rate plays anymore. They`re much more hedge funds, investment banks, venture capital funds. So, we`re left with just the pure savings and loans.  So, we`ve made some good money in Washington Mutual.  We also own Charter Financial, a couple of other ones. But the California theme is not a bad theme to be working on right now. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  It`s good to see you, Courtney. 

 SMITH:  It`s good to you see guys. 

 TUCKER:  Courtney Smith of ORBITEX. 

 LISOVICZ:  ORBITEX.  Or, Courtney Smith ... 

 SMITH:  And the daycare center. 

 TUCKER: And the daycare center. 

 LISOVICZ:  Thank you. 

 SMITH:  Thanks. 

 LISOVICZ:  A mixed bag of quarterly results from the tech sector this morning.  First, the good news.  Oracle`s first quarter net income rocketed 111 percent from a year ago to $501 million.  The world`s largest database of software maker reported earnings of 17 cents a share, three cents better than analyst estimates. 

 But PSINet, a provider of Internet access and Web hosting services, says it`s revising its forecast for the second half of the year.  The company cites anticipated softness in the carrier access business and weakness in Internet spending for the second half of the year.  PSINet expects revenue between $920 million to $960 million.  PSINet warned earlier this month that earnings for its third quarter would fall short of analyst expectations. 

 ANADIGICS also out with a warning.  The maker of wireless communications equipment sees a substantial reduction in fourth quarter revenue.  The company had expected to earn 23 cents a share for the fourth quarter. 

 And Abode Systems, finally, the largest maker of Web publishing software handily beat expectations with its third quarter earnings.  The San Jose, California based company reported profits of 57 cents a share, five cents better than estimates. 

 Looking at the current trading there, well, we`re seeing a theme here, except for Adobe.  Oracle down more than 3 1/2.  It is one of the most actively traded issues on the Nasdaq.  PSINet down about 1 1/2. ANADIGICS losing about 4 3/4.  And Adobe having a great day, up about 8 3/4. 

 TUCKER:  Medical device maker Agilent Technologies says it plans to significantly boost its manufacturing capacity by opening a new DNA micro array production facility at its site in Santa Clara, California. The faculty - factory is expected to allow the Hewlett-Packard spinoff to ship more than one million micro arrays per year by 2002.  Shares of Agilent are off sharply this year, more than $100 below their high back in March. 

 LISOVICZ:  Ford`s CEO Jacques Nasser met with Wall Street analysts in New York this morning to talk about the financial consequences of the Firestone tire recall and other issues.  Those tires are standard issue on several Ford vehicles, including the Explorer, which had been connected with at least 88 deaths.  Wasserstein Perella auto analyst, Scott Merlis (ph), attended the Ford meeting and is here to tell us what Jacques Nasser said. Thanks for being here. 

 SCOTT MERLIS, ANALYST, WASSERSTEIN PERELLA:  My pleasure. 

 LISOVICZ:  The first question is what was the tone of the meeting? 

 MERLIS:  The tone was actually quite positive.  And we covered a broad range of issues that went beyond the Firestone fear. 

 TUCKER:  What`s his basic message to the community? 

 MERLIS:  The basic message is that the outlook for the company remains quite excellent despite this very difficult crisis. 

 TUCKER: Yeah.  I noticed, in fact, and I was surprised, that you`re still bullish in terms of the fourth quarter earnings, even though they`ve said, look, we`re going to have a little bit of a slowdown and we`re going to bring some of these facilities to a halt temporarily. 

 MERLIS:  Well, actually the message this morning was that the fourth quarter is looking pretty good ... 

 TUCKER:  Really? 

 MERLIS:  ... and that the analyst estimates could very much be close to the mark.  Even if the estimates were to somehow fall below - slightly below expectations, there`s still a huge amount of cash coming into this company and being returned to shareholders.  And that`s what great stocks are made of. 

 LISOVICZ:  But getting back to that upbeat tone of the meeting, is that just a little bit nave or is it denial?  You`ve got the Justice Department talking about possible criminal charges.  You`ve got consumers who are panicked about unsafe cars when a lot of times SUV purchases are made because - precisely because of their safety image. Is that just unrealistic? 

 MERLIS:  No, but the data is the sales data is showing a positive surprise relative to what you`re saying.  The August sales data showed Explorer sales near record levels despite having substantially lower incentives than the competing SUVs.  The positive surprise this morning was that Explorer sales are very strong despite the negative publicity that you just mentioned and despite the fact it is at the near the end of its life cycle and despite the fact it is substantially lower incentives than the competing models.  How can that be is probably your next question. 

 LISOVICZ:  It is. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah. 

 MERLIS:  And the answer to your question, which I correctly anticipated, is evidently the consumer is seeing this as a tire problem and not a vehicle problem, which we`re over a month now. 

 TUCKER:  Which is what Jacques Nasser has been saying, right? 

 MERLIS:  ... and the consumer is voting with his and her pocketbook. Secondly, this is a testimony to the incredible strength of the Explorer brand and the Explorer product.  Very few products in American history has had such strong sales after so much negative publicity, and that is testimony to the utility and the customer satisfaction inherent to four million Explorer vehicles that have been sold over the last 10 years. 

 TUCKER:  More importantly, we don`t have much time here, it cuts right to the question that I get asked a lot, and I`m sure you get pointed at you, is this stock a buy at these prices, or is it still got some downside to it? 

 MERLIS:  This stock is a buy because there`s $20 billion in cash, the Explorer`s doing well and that Ford is returning cash to the shareholders and they have a great product plan going forward and the new Explorer looks very strong and the new Explorer should do well just like the old Explorer. 

 TUCKER:  Scott, thanks.  Scott Merlis of Wasserstein Perella. Appreciate you dropping by. 

 MERLIS:  My pleasure. 

 LISOVICZ:  Coming up on IN THE MONEY, oil protests end in the U.K. but gather energy in Germany as Europeans continue to fume over the price of petrol.  We`ll have more from the newsroom at the "Financial Times". 

 TUCKER:  And astronauts are setting up house on the international space station.  A progress report coming right up. 

 LISOVICZ:  Thank you, Scott. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  All right, time now for us to turn our attention to motorist protest and shareholder uprisings.  And who else would we turn to for those stories but the "Financial Times" market editor, Adrienne Roberts live from London. And, Adrienne, hello and welcome. 

 I don`t hear her.  Do you folks out there hear her?  Because she`s not in my ear.  She is all gone. So, you know what we`re going to do? We`re going to take a check on world and national news headlines. 

 LISOVICZ:  And for that, we have to turn to Prudence Solomon, who`s going to tell us about the Indian Prime Minister`s visit to the White House. 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. 

 LISOVICZ:  Hello, Prudence. 

 SOLOMON:  Hello there, Bill and Susan.  Good morning, everyone. 

 President Clinton greeted a frail-looking Indian Prime Minister at the White House today.  The welcoming ceremony did away with the customary review of the troops because of Prime Minister Vajpayee`s poor health. The two leaders are expected to discuss a number of issues, including India`s nuclear weapons program and closer U.S.-Indian ties. 

 PRESIDENT CLINTON:  "I don`t think it should be another 20 years before an American president goes to India.  I think we should have a regular, sustained partnership.  We should identify our common interests, we should be forthright about the places where we still have differences, and we should set about trying to resolve them." 

 SOLOMON:  The president said he believes that U.S.-Indian cooperation will continue regardless of who wins the U.S. presidency. 

 A newer round of the president also talked about the Mid East Peace Process just a short while ago, saying that talks between Secretary of State Madeline Albright and Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have not produced a breakthrough but haven`t failed.  Mr. Clinton added that both sides no time is short. 

 The debate is finally over.  Vice President Al Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush will face off on October 3rd for their first encounter in Boston.  Yesterday, the Bush Campaign agreed to take part in three televised primetime debates. The 90-minute events will take place next month.  Separately, an anonymous package that was mailed to a Gore aide turned out to be authentic Bush debate material.  The FBI is investigating. 

 Gore attended a celebrity packed Democratic fundraiser last night. Harrison Ford, Julia Roberts and Bette Midler showed up to entertain and help the Democrats raise $6.5 million.  Later, the presidential hopeful showed off his lighter side on the air with David Letterman.  In the spirit of the show, Gore introduced his own top 10 list of rejected Gore-Lieberman campaign slogans.  Here are a couple of them. 

 AL GORE:  "Number 10, vote for me or I`ll come to your home and explain my 191 page economic plan to you in excruciating detail.  Number nine, remember America, I gave you the Internet and I can take it away. Think about it." 

 SOLOMON:  Gore`s running mate, Joe Lieberman, also appeared on Late Night with Conan O`Brien and sang, "My Way", sang his way. 

 LISOVICZ:  I heard it. 

 SOLOMON:  Did you hear it? 

 LISOVICZ:  We did not have an extra ... 

 SOLOMON:  He should stick to his day job, I say. 

 LISOVICZ:  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, it`s late night TV? 

 SOLOMON:  Right. 

 LISOVICZ:  They let a lot go there. 

 TUCKER:  They let a lot go on that.  You`re exactly right. 

 SOLOMON:  Oh, it`s you, guys.  Have a good weekend. 

 TUCKER:  All right, thanks, Prudence. 

 LISOVICZ:  Thanks, Prudence. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  We`re going to try this long connection once again. 

 We`re going to go to - there she is.  I see you, Adrienne.  Now, the question is can we hear you?  Adrienne Roberts from the "Financial Times" newsroom again. 

 ADRIENNE ROBERTS, EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Morning, Bill.  Well, I hope you do hear me. 

 The key word in Europe at the moment is still fuel.  Protests still simmering there in Germany.  Berlin traffic was disrupted quite badly this morning.  The other hotspot is the Netherlands, which is also being disrupted.  There are quite a few bottlenecks there.  And also Ireland. There`s a fair amount of protest.  Protestors have backed off or are backing off in Belgium, Czech Republic, Greece and the U.K.  They`re threatening, though, in Denmark, Finland and Poland.  So, pretty much every country in Europe is either in a bit of a crisis or emerging from one. 

 TUCKER:  There doesn`t yet to be a motorist though to be protesting these things these days.  Shareholders at the London Stock Exchange doing a little revolt at their own? 

 ROBERTS:  Well, yes.  We spoke yesterday about the annual shareholders meeting.  There were harsh words, mainly about the IX deal.  This was supposed to be a big Pan-European merger.  A Pan-European stock exchange laid by the merger between London and Frankfurt.  Now, shareholders have never really liked that deal.   They didn`t like the way it was managed and they voiced those thoughts at yesterday`s meeting.  In fact, the deal was jettison by the LSE - by the London Stock Exchange - earlier this week. Now, at that vote, Gavin Casey, the chief executive, was, in fact, voted out by show of hands.  Now, he was voted back in in a formal ballot later on in the day, but by a very narrow margin.  I think he won by about 56 percent.  Now, today, obviously I think they`ve decided somebody has to basically take the full for the whole IX taboccal (ph), and Mr. Casey has tended his resignation.  The question, of course, now is who will replace him.  There is some speculation around the market that possibly Brian (ph) Williamson, who is chairman of the London Financial Futures Exchange, might possibly be a worthy candidate.  He`s very well respected.  But as I say, at this stage that`s pure speculation.  There will be more detail on FT.com later in the day, so watch that. 

 TUCKER:  We will, as a matter of fact, watch it.  I`m curious, is this whole idea of a Pan-European Exchange dead now?  I mean, there`s some talk that the Nasdaq might join forces with the Swedish Exchange and perhaps concoct a bid that way.  But is this deal effectively dead? 

 ROBERTS:  Well, that does seem to be the case.  I mean, the initial vision was of Pan-European Exchanged linked to Nasdaq in the U.S., linked to Nasdaq in Japan, creating a whole wonderful 24 hour trading platform. Some people did feel that was full plan.  Now, of course, OM of Sweden is making a hostile takeover bid.  We don`t know yet whether OM is going to try and get Nasdaq on board in that bid or not.  But certainly the IX deal there`s been no talk of a future date for resumption.  As far as we know, that is dead in the water. 

 TUCKER:  Adrienne, thank you very much.  Adrienne Roberts at the "Financial Times".  Have a terrific weekend.  And all of you who want to stay up on this story, go to FT.com. 

 LISOVICZ:  And we`ll be right back.  Stay with us. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  All right.  And finally today on this Friday a corporate tug of war on the high seas, which ruined vacations for nearly 1,000 people. And there is financial troubles.  Five ships from the Premier Cruise line were seized by the authorities on behalf of the company`s biggest creditor, the Wall Street firm Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette. 

 LISOVICZ:  It`s thought DLJ may sell the ships to recover $49 million in debt.  The ships were seized in Cozumel, Mexico, Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Nassau, the Bahamas.  The stranded passengers are being flown home. As for the cruise line, it has seized operations and may now seek bankruptcy protection.  And I have to say, Bill, it kind of ruins the image of a relaxing cruise. 

 TUCKER:  Can you imagine?  Fully getting out and saying, "Excuse me, you got to home now.  They`re taking this ship away." 

 LISOVICZ:  I`ll tell you one thing, it sort of is a great anecdote to tell. 

 TUCKER:  It`s a good story, but it`s a lousy vacation. 

 You have a great weekend, everyone.  That does it for today`s edition of IN THE MONEY.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 LISOVICZ:  And I`m Susan Lisovicz.  See you next week.

 Steel Processing Giant Ryerson Tull Expects 3rd-Quarter Loss

 CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Ryerson Tull Inc., the country's largest steel service center, or steel processor, and a bellwether for the industry, said it will post a surprise loss for the third quarter and warned volume and profitability will be weaker than expected in the fourth quarter. 

 In 4 p.m. EDT trading, Ryerson Tull's (RT) stock fell 62 cents, or 6.4%, to $9.19 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 A rise in short-term interest rates has hit the steel industry hard. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times in little more than a year to try to slow the economy 's breakneck pace and a string of recent economic reports suggest their work was successful. Higher interest rates have been behind drops in manufacturing. Rate increases slowed demand for a lot of big-ticket items as well as capital goods bought on credit. 

 Ryerson Tull issued a profit warning in May noting its sales volume was plummeting. At the time, the Chicago company held out hope the steel industry's sudden drop-off was a temporary blip instead of a sign of a coming slowdown. 

 However on Friday, the company cited a "continued slowdown in the metal-using sector of the economy," adding that "price volatility in the metals industry is negatively impacting gross profit per ton more than previously expected." The company expects volume and profitability to decline further in the fourth quarter. 

 Ryerson Tull expects to post a loss of 15 cents a share in the third quarter. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of one cent a share in the third quarter. In the year-earlier third quarter, the company reported net income of $9.6 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $686.8 million.

 Pentair Gives 3rd-Quarter  Profit Warning ; Lowers 2000, 2001 Estimates Again

 MINNEAPOLIS -(Dow Jones)- Pentair Inc. said it will post earnings for the third-quarter, 2000 and 2001 below analysts' estimates because of its "underperforming" tools business. 

 The announcement comes after the company in July announced that its 2000 and 2001 earnings that would fall well below analysts' expectations at the time because of delays in realizing cost savings. 

 The Minneapolis-based maker of electrical and electronic enclosures, professional tools, service equipment and water products, expects to report third-quarter earnings between 25 cents a share and 30 cents a share and 2000 earnings between $2.35 a share and $2.45 a share. 

 Pentair (PNR) also predicts it will post 2001 earnings of about $3.50 share. 

 The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 75 cents a share in the third quarter, $3.24 a share for 2000 and $3.96 a share for 2001. 

 In July, Pentair said it expected to post earnings of $3.25 a share in 2000 and $4 a share in 2001, compared with analysts' estimates at the time for $3.66 a share and $4.28 a share, respectively. 

 Last year, the diversified manufacturer earned 69 cents a share in the third quarter and $2.89 a share for the 1999 year, before a restructuring charge of 56 cents a share. 

 Pentair said it expects to report 2000 free cash flow exceeding $100 million. 

 The company said about one-half of the third-quarter shortfall occurred because its tools business experienced a sales drop through the industrial tool channel and margin compression as a result of mix, pricing and cost issues related to selling and distribution. 

 Pentair said it doesn't expect to resolve the turnaround of its tools and equipment businesses until early 2001. 

 The rest of the third quarter shortfall was the result of the establishment of a reserve in Pentair's service equipment unit. 

 James A. White, executive vice president and president of the company's tools and equipment businesses, resigned effective Wednesday. 

 Pentair's senior management has assumed direct responsibility for the tools business on an interim basis while it seeks a "strong executive" to direct the tool operations. 

 Pentair said it is continuing to resolve issues at the unit by cutting the cost of goods sold, tightening internal controls and implementing tactics to cut working capital and improve cash flow. 

 Despite the measures, Pentair said it is cutting growth estimates for the tools and equipment businesses to "more normal levels," rather than expecting the strong growth performance of the past several years. 

 Pentair expects fourth-quarter tool sales to exceed those of the fourth quarter in 1999 but also sees third quarter volume and margin issues carrying over to the fourth quarter, reducing income below expectations. 

 In addition, the company expects to post third-quarter sales gains exceeding 25% at its Water Technologies Group and nearly 20% at its Enclosures Group. 

 Operating income is expected to improve 45% at the Water Technologies Group and 55% at the Enclosures Group. 

 For the 1999 third quarter, sales at the Water Technologies Group were $183.4 million and operating income was $22.8 million. At the Enclosure Group sales came in at $161.7 million and operating income was $16.4 million. 

 The company expects continued "excellent growth" at the water and enclosures business through increased emphasis on technology and service. 

 As a result, Pentair plans to continue its emphasis on the groups, which are expected to represent more than 55% of its 2000 sales and 85% of its operating income, based on current estimates. 

 For 1999, Pentair's total revenue was $2.37 billion and operating income was $214.3 million. 

 The company said that while it can't predict future competitive pressures, it anticipates double-digit growth and profitability beginning in 2001.

 Solutia Says Energy Prices, Weak Euro Will Hurt Earnings This Year

 ST. LOUIS -(Dow Jones)- A week after chemicals giant DuPont Co. issued a profit warning, chemicals company Solutia Inc. said 2000 earnings will fall short of analysts' expectations by about 15%. 

 Like DuPont, Solutia cited high energy and raw materials costs. Solutia also blamed currency exchange rates and slowing volume growth. 

 The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for 2000 earnings of $1.48 a share. 

 Solutia (SOI) shares traded down 81 cents, or 6%, to $12.88 by 4 p.m. EDT on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Solutia, a maker of chemical-based products, said higher crude-oil prices, natural gas futures markets raw material and energy costs account for about half of the expected earnings shortfall. The weak euro and general economic softening account for the balance of the expected decline. 

 The company's raw materials' woes aren't new. Solutia had cited higher raw-materials costs for a disappointing first quarter. Meanwhile, energy-based raw material costs and exchange rates were behind a plunge in Solutia's second-quarter earnings despite 17% higher sales. Second-quarter earnings were also hurt by charges related to acquisitions, restructuring and investment write-offs. 

 The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial calls for third-quarter Solutia earnings of 33 cents a share. For the year-earlier third quarter, Solutia earned $61 million, or 53 cents a share, on sales of $731 million. 

 For the fourth quarter, the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial calls for earnings of 37 cents a share. For the fourth quarter a year earlier, the company earned $51 million, or 46 cents a share, on sales of $736 million.

 BAE Systems: Figures On Target But Some Worries Surface Leaves Some Disappointed With 1H

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Analysts remain upbeat about BAE Systems PLC's (U.BA) long-term prospects, but some concern about the short-term outlook have surfaced following its interim results. 

 The figures themselves met market expectations but there was some worry regarding the weighting of the results to the second half, the delivery schedule for Hawk aircraft and risks to cost-savings targets. 

 "It was slightly disappointing," said Schroders Salomon Smith Barney's Nick Cunningham, "which is very bad timing since the market isn't well disposed to the sector at the moment." 

 BAE Systems, he said, is living with sentiment fostered by the recent profit warning from Rolls-Royce PLC (U.RR), past merger integration troubles with U.S. companies in the sector and warnings from capital goods makers such as Invensys PLC (U.IVS) this month. 

 The stock fell back to take back some of the 10.6% gain it had seen this week ahead of half-year earnings. 

 The bulls, meanwhile, remain upbeat. Brian O'Keefe, analyst at Commerzbank, liked what the company had to say and maintains a long-term buy recommendation. "The tone may have been unexciting, but at least there were no surprises," he pointed out. 

 And he added BAE Systems is better positioned than any competitor or peer in the industry, but is currently going through a transitional period as it beds down Marconi Electronic Systems and two important U.S. acquisitions. 

 The group is also only now moving such projects as the Eurofighter Typhoon jet into production. 

 BAE Systems turned in a GBP480 million profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill, up 34% on last year and in line with market forecasts. Earnings per share on that basis, however, slipped to 10.8 pence from 14.4 pence. 

 Sales climbed 38% to GBP3.66 billion and the board has proposed lifting the interim dividend 10% to 3.3 pence a share. 

 The group held an order book of GBP37 billion at the end of June, similar to the GBP36.6 billion in orders logged at the end of the last fiscal year. 

 And Finance Director George Rose told Dow Jones Newswires the group's margin improved in the half to 9% from 8.3%, and net debt was reduced to GBP523 million from GBP825 million at the end of last year. 

 "No one can hang a bear hat on cash flow," said Prudential-Bache senior research analyst Howard Wheeldon, who describes himself as very much in the positive camp on the company. 

 Wheeldon said doubters were unnecessarily caught up by the fact that seven Hawks were delivered this half and 50 are slated for the second half, which could mean some could be delayed until next year. However, he said deliveries of the aircraft are expected through 2006, and an order from India seems likely by Christmas. 

 But with earnings per share this year diluted somewhat, ahead of strong benefits from the merger with MES, some analysts remained cautious. 

 Adrian Murray at Teather & Greenwood said the risk profile for BAE Systems is slightly higher than he'd envisaged. There is a potential for the company to miss its synergy target of GBP55 million this year, GBP150 million next year and at least GBP275 million in 2002. 

 This year's savings should all come through in the second half, the company said. 

 Murray noted that short-term concerns about such things as savings and Hawks help keep BAE Systems on a lower trading multiple than rivals. He calculated it trades at about 5.3 times 2001 earnings before interest, tax and depreciation - compared with about 8.8 times for much smaller military supplier Cobham PLC (U.CBH), which posts results next week. 

 He and SSSB's Cunningham expect to see BAE Systems trading at about 400 pence until signs of 2001 earnings are evident. 

 At 1300 GMT, BAE was at 367.5, down 30.5 pence, or 7.7%. 

 Murray maintains a reduce stance on shares, while Cunningham has them as a buy. 

 House broker Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Thursday downgraded BAE Systems to add from buy and trimmed its 2000 pretax profit forecast by 7% and 2001 by 11% to reflect caution towards major programs. 

 JP Morgan's Chris Avery has initiated coverage with a buy, noting: "BAE Systems is a transformed group deserving fresh investor attention." He has a price target of 520 pence.

 McDonald's shares fall on currency worries

 CHICAGO (AP) - McDonald's Corp. stock, mired in a yearlong slump, sank to a 2 1/2 -year low Thursday after the company warned that foreign currency problems would hurt its third-quarter earnings. 

 Some analysts also said the fast-food giant might have bitten off more than it could chew by continuing to open an average of five restaurants a day this year, mostly abroad, despite slowing sales overseas. 

 Shares in the restaurant chain fell $1.06, or 4 percent to $26.94 on the New York Stock Exchange in a second consecutive sharp decline reflecting the impact of the euro's slide. 

 In falling to its lowest closing price since March 1998, the stock is down 34 percent for the year and has lost nearly half its value since reaching an all-time high of $49.56 last November. 

 "It's kind of a show-me stock," said Mark Kalinowski of Salomon Smith Barney. "They're going to have to show investors they're going to reach the goals they've set for themselves, and right now they're having a hard time doing that." 

 McDonald's said in a statement Wednesday night after warning analysts of the currency troubles that it remains on target to achieve 10 percent to 15 percent annual profit growth through 2002 - excluding the impact of foreign currencies. 

 "Importantly, the fundamentals of our business haven't changed," said Jack Greenberg, chairman and chief executive. "Our global business remains solid and growing." 

 Seven weeks ago, the company called its meager 2 percent second-quarter profit gain - its worst quarterly showing since 1997 - an anomaly and blamed it on foreign currency declines and unusually hot weather in Europe that had carved into summer sales. 

 Analysts share Greenberg's view of a healthy long-term outlook for the world's largest restaurant company. They are less bullish about the short run at a time when international sales growth has declined and some economies are slowing. 

 "Worldwide, the company generated about 1 percent volume growth in August," said Howard Penney of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "For McDonald's it's not great, but it's also not a company that's in severe trouble." 

 Analysts lowered their estimates of third-quarter earnings to reflect the currency situation. 

 "The euro is a rising concern for a number of consumer companies, and it's a concern for the fourth quarter, too," said Ann Gurkin of Davenport and Co. 

 "But it's not a negative reflection on McDonald's earnings if you exclude currency. ... On a non-currency basis, international markets are strengthening and their U.S. market is strengthening." 

 Crowell Weedon analyst Doug Christopher said he thinks the euro is likely to be bottoming out. Coupled with a strong showing by McDonald's at its U.S. restaurants and continuing dominance overseas, he thinks the bottom is almost at hand for the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company's stock, too. 

 "We don't see it (currency) as something that's going to derail the long-term outlook of the company at all," he said.

 Watson Pharmaceuticals shares tumble after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Shares of generic drug firm Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. tumbled on Wednesday after the company warned of sharply-lower-than-expected earnings for the rest of the year related to its recent acquisition of Schein Pharmaceutical Inc. . 

 Shares of the Corona, Calif.-based company were off nearly 23 percent in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange, down $14-9/16 to $49-9/16, making it one of the largest percentage losers on the Big Board. The shares' 52-week range is $26-1/2 to $71-1/4. 

 "We expect Watson to trade lower today, based on the fact that management has its work cut out for itself in the near term," UBS Warburg analyst Andrew Foreman said, referring to the $980 million Schein acquisition announced in May. 

 Late Tuesday, Watson warned that lower-than-expected product sales as a result the Schein deal would hurt near-term earnings per share. The generic drug firm expects to report third-quarter cash earnings per diluted share of 12 to 14 cents, and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) earnings per diluted share of 3 to 5 cents. 

 Analysts' consensus GAAP earnings forecast is 48 cents per diluted share, according to First Call/Thomson financial. 

 Due to unexpectedly high inventory levels of Schein products with customers, Watson said it would reduce product sales to moderate those levels. The company said the situation should correct itself by the first quarter 2001, but the warning irked Wall Street analysts and investors. 

 Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Kenneth Kulju cut his near-term earnings projections on Watson. He cut the third quarter to 4 cents a share from 47 cents, the fourth quarter to 38 cents from 54 cents, and the full year to $1.28 from $1.87. 

 UBS Warburg's Foreman cut earnings projections for the third quarter to 4 cents from 46 cents, and for the fourth quarter to 40 cents from 54 cents. 

 Banc of America Securities analyst Jerry Treppel said Watson is the only generic drug company he rates as "buy" rather than "strong buy." 

 "The reason we do not have a 'strong buy' rating on Watson was because of our concern about what they would find at Schein. Unfortunately, inventory adjustments like this are not atypical in the industry," he said, pointing to recent inventory adjustments at generic firms such as Mylan Laboratories Inc. , IVAX Corp. and Forest Laboratories Inc. . 

 But Treppel echoed Watson's optimism that the earnings shortfall will not persist. 

 "The issues are not related to demand, so at end of the day it is short term," he said. "And I can tell you, if you buy when others are selling due to inventory issues, you tend to make money." 

 He added, "Ultimately, it will just take them more time then they thought to bring them up to snuff, and (the Schein acquisition) makes them the largest generic company in the United States in terms of prescriptions. So it was something they needed to do." 

 Watson executives said the remainder of 2000 would be transitional. They expect fourth-quarter cash earnings per diluted share of 48 to 51 cents, and GAAP earnings per diluted share of 39 to 41 cents. 

 For fiscal 2001, Watson expects cash earnings per diluted share of $2.78 to $2.82, and GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.38 to $2.42.

 Williams-Sonoma Fans See Retailer Thriving With Many Sales Channels

 Williams-Sonoma's full plate of new outlets for its upscale housewares is whetting the appetites of investors. 

 The San Francisco-based retailer has been slowly branching out from its roots, namely the familiar Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn stores and catalogs, with new initiatives -- an online wedding registry here, a Williams Sonoma-brand Web site there. Now it's in high-speed expansion mode, with a series of potential stock-moving events in the works, bulls say. 

 Last month, Williams-Sonoma launched a Web site for the Pottery Barn division, its fastest-growing brand. This month it is opening its first Pottery Barn Kids stores, featuring furniture and home fixtures for discerning moms and dads. Then in November comes Taste, a quarterly lifestyle magazine meant to provide another connection to current and potential customers. In 2002, the company plans to launch a new chain to sell lower-priced housewares, called Elm Street. 

 Bulls say the ventures increase the potential for both top- and bottom-line growth. "With all the new initiatives, we think those could be catalysts to drive the stock forward," says Mason Ford, a portfolio manager at Wentworth Hauser & Violich in San Francisco, which held 965,305 shares, or a 2% stake, at the end of the second quarter. 

 Bonnie Tonneson, an analyst at Chase H&Q in San Francisco, recently boosted her 12-month price target on the stock to $50 from $45. The stock is now trading near $42.50. She says the company "epitomizes the breed of next-generation retailers" by making its wares available in stores, through catalogs and over the Internet. "Williams-Sonoma is really leading the charge when it comes to a multichannel retailer," Ms. Tonneson says. 

 The big question for investors, she and others say, is whether the company can smoothly deliver on all its undertakings. The retailer has a history of occasional missteps that have sliced its stock price. In early 1996, for example, the stock swooned on a warning that profit from the critical holiday-season fourth quarter would miss analysts' expectations, in part because of problems at its order-fulfillment and distribution center in Memphis, Tenn. 

 "We pretty much lost control of the process," says Gary Friedman, Williams-Sonoma's president. 

 Distribution is a critical cog for Williams-Sonoma, which has about 350 stores with varying inventory needs, as well as thousands of customers placing orders directly by phone, fax and computer. 

 The latest bump came in March, when the company warned that it would miss earnings estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30. Executives cited an accounting change that required the establishment of higher reserves to cover possible merchandise returns and higher-than-expected costs, driven by stronger-than-expected sales. To fill orders, the company had to hire more workers and lease extra space. The physical expansion resulted in inventory being moved from building to building. Shares plunged more than 40% after the warning, hitting a 52-week low of $17.13. Per-share earnings for the quarter were 82 cents, compared with an original 94-cent estimate. 

 Another potential risk is an economic slowdown, which might lead shoppers to curb their purchases of the fancy pots and pans, gourmet foods, bedding and knickknacks that are Williams-Sonoma's hallmark. Even fears of a slowdown are sometimes enough to put retail stocks in a funk. 

 Kristine Koerber, an analyst at W.R. Hambrecht & Co. in San Francisco, says investor concerns about the company's ability to manage through the coming holiday season may keep the share price steady for now. In addition to the new initiatives in the short term, she says, the company faces a tough year-over-year comparison for third-quarter comparable-store sales. Last year, the figure grew 9.6%. 

 Still, Ms. Koerber initiated coverage on Williams-Sonoma last week with a "buy" recommendation and a 12-month price target of $48. "The management team is a little deeper, and I think a little more focused on operations" than in the past, she says. "That's what's going to help them get through the next quarter or two." 

 The company has added executives to areas including distribution and merchandise design. In May, the company promoted Mr. Friedman to president, from president of the retail division and chief merchandising officer. Mr. Friedman, with the company 11 years, is largely credited with the successful development of the Pottery Barn brand. 

 A search continues for a chief operating officer, something Ms. Tonneson says the company needs to ensure that systems and supply channels are in order. Later this month, the company is taking Wall Street analysts around its Memphis distribution center, hoping recent upgrades there will prompt them to tell investors that if the orders come, they can be filled efficiently. 

 John Tate, chief financial officer, says increased space and upgraded equipment have "dramatically increased" the capabilities of the "picking" process, in which ordered items are picked and packed. 

 Michael Novak of Frontier Capital Management in Boston, one of Williams-Sonoma's biggest investors with 1.6 million shares, or a 3% stake, says the company is paying greater attention to the bottom line than before. Known mostly for smart merchandising that has driven sales, Williams-Sonoma is also "acting like a grown-up retail company in terms of their fiscal responsibility now," he says. 

 For the quarter ended July 30, the company had revenue of $344 million, up 30% from a year earlier. Net income was $5.1 million, or nine cents a share, a penny ahead of the First Call average and 13% above last year. 

 Mr. Ford, the portfolio manager from Wentworth Hauser & Violich, says buzz from the openings of the kids' stores could give the stock a lift near-term. The first store opened last weekend in Costa Mesa. A second opens this weekend in Corte Madera and five more openings are scheduled in November. The stores follow the successful launch in January 1999 of a Pottery Barn Kids catalog. A dedicated Web site is expected next spring. 

 Early sales numbers off the Pottery Barn Web site could also provide some impetus. The stock hit its 52-week high, at $60.31, in early December amid holiday-season buzz and the release of figures for the first month of the Williams-Sonoma brand site, showing sales topped $1.5 million. 

 There is some concern that online sales could cannibalize store or catalog buying. But during the fiscal fourth quarter, the company says, one-third of the buyers at Williams-Sonoma.com were new to the retailer's customer database. Two-thirds had purchased products from catalogs, retail stores or both. 

 Mr. Novak says he wouldn't mind seeing movement from mail order to the Internet, a shift that could eventually pay off by eliminating the costly mailing of more than 190 million catalogs a year. Meanwhile, he expects the retailer to do well in all three channels: store, catalog and Internet. "They have a core competency that's going to translate well into all these different initiatives," he says.

 Hospital Helper: Shares of Neoforma.com, a Santa Clara, online health-products company, rose 92% last week to $5.81. The company said it has signed up 79 hospitals to buy supplies, ahead of its year-end goal of 56.

 Clothing Clicks: Huntington Beach clothing maker Quiksilver climbed 41% for the week, to $21, after reporting that third-quarter net income rose 19%, in line with estimates. Revenue increased 16%, with particular strength in Europe.

 Litton's Lament: Litton Industries, the Woodland Hills-based shipbuilder, skidded 24%, to $42.375. The company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in line with projections, but indicated that fiscal 2001 net income won't meet Wall Street expectations because of a changing product mix. The Street had been projecting double-digit increases in both sales and earnings for the fiscal year ending July 2001. The company says it expects sales growth in the middle to high single-digit range and per-share income growth of 5%, at best.

 Technology Shares Advance; Cisco Rebounds, SCI Sinks

 NEW YORK -- Technology shares advanced Wednesday in choppy action. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 44.38 to close at 3893.89, while Morgan Stanley's high-tech index rose 7.97 to 1021.75. The Dow Jones Internet Index edged up 6.78 to 304.25. 

 The Nasdaq bounced around for most of the morning as tech stocks tried to overcome pressure from the electrical-equipment and personal-computer sectors. A profit warning from SCI Systems stoked concerns about PC demand and sparked selling in the groups. An analyst downgrade of chip giant Intel added a dose of caution to the market. 

 "It's the roller coaster," said Ken Sheinberg, head of listed trading at SG Cowen. "You go down, you go up, you go up, you down." 

 On the plus side, investors jumped back into Cisco Systems one day after the stock closed at its lowest level in over three months. 

 The market bellwether surged $2.4375 to $61.3125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Many investors view Cisco's performance as a key symptom of the overall health of the tech market. The stock had broken through two support levels this week, falling below its 200-day moving average of $62.25 on Monday and dropping under $60 on Wednesday. 

 After the Nasdaq's strong performance in August, the index has pulled back 7.4% in September. 

 However, Mr. Sheinberg noted that the action in the stock market this week might not accurately reflect current market trends. 

 "We are oversold, and there is triple witching this Friday, [which causes] a lot of volatility in the market," he said. "You might see the true tape next week as opposed to this week." 

 Triple witching is the simultaneous expiration of stock options, future contracts and index options that happens near the end of each quarter. 

 Meanwhile, SCI said its fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings would come in below Wall Street expectations because of seasonal weakness in consumer electronics and personal-computer demand. The company now expects first-quarter sales of $2 billion and earnings of 34 cents a diluted share 

 "The reason for the weakness in the quarter is full-system PC, which represents 20% of sales," said Merrill Lynch in a report. 

 The negative preannouncement sparked tremors for two of SCI's largest customers, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer. 

 SCI dropped $10.13 to $45.81, H-P shed $7.56 to $105.94 and Compaq fell $1.56 to $29.94, all on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Other players in the electrical-equipment group also fell. Jabil Circuit slid $2.75 to $61.88 and Solectron slipped $1.25 to $45.81 on the Big Board, while Flextronics International lost 11 cents to $82.98 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 The picture wasn't much brighter in chip land. Semiconductors were led lower Wednesday by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, as Banc of America cut its recommendation on the stocks to "market perform" from "strong buy." 

 Intel retreated $3.69 to $61.25 on Nasdaq and AMD eased $1.75 to $28.50 on the Big Board. 

 Elsewhere, Rambus gained $7.66, or 10%, to $84.94 on Nasdaq after NEC and Rambus signed new licensing pacts for SDRAM, DDR and RDRAM products. The companies said the agreements include the development of the next-generation 1066-MHz Direct RDRAM as part of a larger strategic alliance and a broader licensing agreement between the two companies. NEC rose $1.88 to $130.88 on Nasdaq. 

 Savvis Communications jumped 56 cents to $10 on Nasdaq. Savvis said Tuesday it plans to establish its own fiber-optic backbone by the fourth quarter of 2001, using Nortel Networks and Level 3 Communications products. Savvis estimates it will deploy $155 million in Nortel's Optera optical Internet products over the next 42 months, while Level 3 said it signed agreements with Savvis valued at $135 million over 20 years. Level 3 gained $3.63 to $77.88 on Nasdaq. 

 Hybrid Networks surged 94 cents, or 11%, to $9.13 on Nasdaq. Sprint ordered 16,000 wireless broadband routers from the telecom company.

 U.S. shares flat in Europe,  cautious  on Nasdaq.

 LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. shares traded flat in quiet European trade on Monday, with worries about recent weakness in technology stocks instilling caution among investors, dealers said. 

 The December future on the S&P index was down 3.0 points at 1,516.0 by 1020 GMT, little changed from fair value to indicate a steady opening for the Dow Jones industrial average. The Nasdaq December future was 20.5 points lower at 3,848.0, down from fair value to suggest a weaker start for technology stocks. 

 "There may be more downside in the Nasdaq area, while it looks quiet on the economic front," said one dealer. 

 He said there was concern about more warnings on company profits. 

 "We have seen profit warnings in old economy names and analyst warnings in technology stocks and it is still early days in the warning season," he said. 

 Dealers noted some trade in Intel Corp. , which was quoted unchanged from Friday's close at $65-3/8, after edging up in after-hours trading to $65-3/4 on the electronic brokerage system Instinet. 

 Internet media and services company Yahoo! Inc , was quoted at $104 compared with a close of $104-1/8. Yahoo! shares slipped on Friday amid concerns about advertising spending. 

 There was no sign of activity in Ford Motor Co , which rose to $26-1/2 in Friday's after-hours trading, up from a regular session close of $26. The gain came after U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said there was no evidence that either the world's No. 2 car maker or Firestone knowingly misled regulators about tire problems linked to 88 deaths in the United States. 

 On Friday, U.S. technology stocks were hit by investor concerns about the sector's earnings growth. The Nasdaq composite ended down 119.94 points or 2.93 percent at 3,978.41, breaking through a 200-day moving average of 4,009. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 39.22 points or 0.35 percent to 11,220.65.

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY: Of course, last week we saw the Dow actually lose a little bit of ground.   And let`s take look at how things are faring in the early going. 

 We go to Fred Katayama at the New York Stock Exchange, a bit of a recovery. 

 Fred, what is going on down there? 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Christine, it looks good, the Dow Jones industrials are rising.  But those gains are tempered by some weakness in tech stocks, notably IBM.  Big Blue is trading lower after Goldman Sachs slashed its profit estimates on IBM, basically citing, saying that IBM`s profits will come under pressure because the euro is eating into them.  Goldman Sachs cut IBM`s fourth quarter per share earnings by three pennies, down to $1.50 a share.  It also slashed its revenue growth estimate for the third and fourth quarters, for third quarter saying that it will grow at 6.6 percent, that is down from its previous forecast of 8.4 percent.  For the year, it sees EPS estimate at $4.50.   Also Vodafone, despite a buy rating by Bear Stearns, that stock is sliding a little more than a dollar, down 1 5/16.  And finally NorTel Networks, that`s a Canadian networking company, we saw it slide all week last week, but right now that stock is gaining three-eight`s at 72 5/8. 

 Bill and Christine, back to you. 

 ROMANS:  OK, thanks, Fred. 

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  OPEC wrapped up its two-day meeting in Vienna by  agreeing to boost crude output by 800,000 barrels a day.  The three percent hike is slightly more than some had expected. But is it enough to significantly lower prices here in the U.S.? because that`s really bottom line question. 

 Greg Clarkin is covering oil trading from the New York Mercantile Exchange. He joins us this morning. 

 And Greg, the word doesn`t look that good so far. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Not at all, Bill.  I`ll tell you, this a bit of a surprising rally right at the outset of trading here in New York.  A lot of folks we spoke to this morning expected to see the London trading theme, where oil is trading slightly lower, to follow through here in New York.  Instead, what they got was a rally. 

 Let`s take you back here to the pit right now, give you an idea of what`s happening.  We a much more frantic trading situation about 45 minutes ago or so.  Right now where oil stands is trading of October crude at about $34.95 a barrel.  It closed at Friday about $33.63 a barrel.  So it`s up better than a buck a barrel.  But it has come of its session highs, which is about $35.10 a barrel.  So it`s pulling back a little bit. And again, the theme that we`re finding here today is that this increase from OPEC, 800,000 barrels, really in eyes of some folks is too little too late. This rally that we`re seeing here today really is a reversal of the sell-off that we saw on Friday in anticipation of this announcement out OPEC. 

 Now for the year, including this announcement from OPEC, there`s been increase of 3.2 million barrels per day out of the oil cartel. Let`s show you how that breaks down.  Back in the spring, in April, they increased by 1.7 million.  And then in June they increased by 700,000. And then September, this most recent announcement just over the weekend, 800,000 barrels per day, bringing again the total to about 3.2 million barrels per day. 

 Now all that sounds nice.  We do have an increase in the marketplace. But at this point, analysts that we`ve spoken to say it really makes little dent in the demand and it still leaves this country kind of in poor shape as the home heating oil season approaches for the winter. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) 

 PETER BEUTEL, CAMERON HANOVER:  I think we`re going to be looking at one of the most volatile winter that we have ever seen.  If the weather becomes bitterly cold at any point, we`re going to see prices of heating oil, I would expect, over $2 in some locations.  We will see spot outages. We`ll see terminals in various states just run out of oil for a day or two if it gets very, very cold.  You know, I mean, the squirrels are better prepared for the winter this year than we are.  I mean it`s really pathetic. 

 (END VIDEOCLIP) 

 CLARKIN:  Now Beutel also this morning that he doesn`t see oil getting below 30 dollars a barrel, really  for any sustained period.  He says if it dips below that, it`s just going to be momentary.  And at this point, Bill, we`re seeing oil trading up around $35 a barrel. 

 Back to you. 

 TUCKER:  All right Greg, Greg Clarkin at the New York Mercantile Exchange. 

 ROMANS:  While oil prices remain high, so do gas prices.  However, most drivers aren`t paying the nearly $2 a gallon they had been paying earlier this summer.  Our Dan Ronan is live at a gas station in Atlanta with more -Dan. 

 DAN RONAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Christine, consumers so far have said to me and to across the country that the prices, even though they`re going up, there`s really been no reluctance to buy.  And as we saw over the Labor Day holiday, the AAA and a lot of associations, travel groups were talking about how we were going to be seeing a record volume in terms of holiday travel.  Well, sure enough that`s one of the things that caused this last spike in oil prices, where according to the Lundberg Survey, gas prices have now gone up seven cents a gallon nationwide for regular unleaded in just the last two weeks.   Los Angeles is one of the cities they were looking at.  Of course, the most expensive gas in the country, now in San Francisco.  The least expensive is here in Atlanta, just about $1.40 a gallon. Los Angeles, Chicago, and couple of other cities mix in there, Des Moines, Iowa, another on with gas in that $1.50-$1,60 range.  One of the reasons the for real expensive gas in San Francisco has to deal with refining issues and taxes.  And here we have ample refining and very, very low taxes.  And we are, of course, having the benefit for that.  But many consumers say even with gas prices inching on up, because the economy is so strong, they`re really not that reluctant to go out and drive and do their vacation trips and make their long weekends. 

 Christine, we go back to you. 

 ROMANS:  OK, Dan Ronan in Atlanta, thanks for joining us. 

 TUCKER:  Well, for some analysis on gas in all markets in light of OPEC`s decision to boost production, we`re going to turn to Bruce Lanni. 

 ROMANS:  He`s an oil analyst with CIBC World Markets here in New York, and he joins us from his  office this morning.  So it looks like, at least in the minds of New York traders that 800,000 barrels per day extra production is not enough to cap the price.  What`s your assessment? 

 BRUCE LANNI, CIBC WORLD MARKETS:  That is pretty true.  You know, we went into it knowing that, or at least believing that OPEC was only going to raise around 800,000 barrels a day.  Believe or not, that should be enough to try and balance the markets by year-end.  And that`s assuming we have a normal winter.  But we don`t see any relief, at least near-term, as a result of their production increase.  I think you know, you stated earlier, it`s too little too late.  The production increase don`t come until October, takes about 40 days for new oil to hit the market, net effect, high oil prices near-term. 

 TUCKER:  Bruce, explain some rhetoric coming out of Vienna this morning where the OPEC oil ministers are meeting.   OPEC ministers saying, look, 

 this is not really a demand problem, some of our members are selling products at a discounted rate.  It is the lack sweet light crude on the market. 

 LANNI:  Well, yes, you know, there`s some truth to that.   You know, the light sweet crudes are the more preferable crude oils that are refined by the refining companies and the integrated oil companies.  The heavier crudes are more difficult to refine.  And those are starting to come to the market more because they are the ones that are currently available. But, you know, again, keep in mind, you know, that -- there is tax issues that OPEC is talking about.  I think our gasoline taxes in U.S. are about 25 cents a gallon.  Europe, they`re as high as 75 cents a liter.  So there are other issues at play here. 

 ROMANS:  There are also capacity issues here, too, right? I mean, some people are saying that there might not be that much more upside potential for production.  And I was reading in several different places estimates from 400,000 to 600,000 barrels per day extra they were producing in August anyway. 

 LANNI:  Exactly, so you know, the production increasing that OPEC has put on the table, at 800,000 barrels a day, is pretty close to what they`re already producing.  So, I mean, but this is typical of OPEC. Now I think one thing to keep in mind, though, it probably is a pretty smart move at this juncture just because we do not know what the winter`s going to be like.  And they do have a 20 day clock.  So in the event that crude oil stays above $28 price basket, then they will increase production once again. 

 TUCKER:  Which it is staying comfortably above today, crossing above $35 as we talk.  Bruce, all of this adds up to the fact that it gives you a measure of long-term bullishness in this market. 

 LANNI:  Yes, it sure does, I mean, you just can`t overlook it any longer. I think, you know, all the factors that we`ve been talking about all year, at least our company, we`ve been saying look, crude oil prices are going to be strong, well above average.  Natural gas prices are very high. They`re close to $5 in MCF.  We rarely have never seen it this time of year at that level, or even truthfully look at $5 gas normally. And then refining margins.  You know, I`d like to kind just put in a plug there.  People normally think that refining margins go down with high oil prices, but refined product inventories are so low right now, especially heating oil in the U.S., and gas oil in Europe, that, you know, even with the heavy refinery turn around sequence scheduled for now and early fourth quarter, we think margins are going to be high.  So the investment climate just could not be any better. 

 ROMANS:  So, Bruce, in that $20 or $22 to $28 price band, that basket, how elusive is that at this point, then if given this outlook? 

 LANNI:  Well, you know, it`s really going to come to the test very quickly. 

 ROMANS:  Great, Bruce Lanni, CIBC World Markets, thanks for joining us. 

 LANNI:  OK, thank you, bye bye. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  There`s A former technology  highflier that is taking steps to improves it investment  value of its its stock. Iomega (URL: http://www.iomega.com/) ,  the maker of the popular  Zip Drive storage devices,  announced late Friday that it will repurchase up to $150 million  of its own stock. After struggling for much of this year, shares of Iomega are  starting to show signs of  life. So, we`ve chosen the company  as our "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) 

 TUCKER:  Iomega`s tumultuous  history one of  the tech darlings of 1990s can barely squeeze on to one of its Zip discs. The company started in 1980 as an off shoot of  and IBM research facility. Three years later the company came out with a product that would change the  landscape of the industry; a new storage device for PC users. By 1995, Iomega had worked through several marketing and design kinks introducing  the consumer friendly Zip drive and its 1 gigabyte cousin  the Jazz Drive. Over  the next 3 years, sales would surge more than tenfold. And it acquired a loyal following of investors thanks to efussive support from a foolish corner of the world. And as financial chatrooms on the Internet came of age, everyone was talking about the little company from Roy, Utah with the slick data storage product. The hikes in shares of Iomega zooming, peaking at $27 in May of `96 accounting for spits. But sales peaked  the next year and investor quickly grew wary of Iomega`s high valuation. The stock now trades at just over $4. but that is up 30 percent from the beginning of the year. Today computer makers such as IBM, Dell, and Apple make Iomega zip drive standard equipment in their machines which accounts for half of Iomega sales. 

 (END VIDEOCLIP) 

 TUCKER:  And it`s still trading in a $4 range today up 5/16 at 4 11/16. 

 ROMANS: Now that you`ve heard  about Iomega, head down to  the bottom of CNNfn.com and  tell us whether you think we  should buy the stock. On Friday, we looked at TRW (URL: http://www.trw.com/)  and you told us what you  thought about the company that makes components for  cars, boats and planes. 43 percent of you recommended we buy  the stock, while 57 percent told us  to pass it up. That means TRW shares get a  red light and it will not  make it into our "In The Portfolio". The stock is trading up today. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Our next guest sees the  combo of a healthy economy  and low interest rates  leading to a rise in stock  prices. His advice to investors: hold off from buying until  the end of the month. 

 ROMANS: Let`s head to Baltimore,  where Richard Cripps joins us  with his outlook on the  market and his stock picks. Thanks for joining us. You know, August, if you were a bull, was a really great month on the street. Last week wasn`t so great especially if you were a tech investor. What next? 

 RICHARD CRIPPS, LEGG MASON: Well, you know, as I think as we unfold through this month we do have some issues to be concerned about, again, but the context is we`ve had a very good strong market for the last six weeks and we`re due for profit-taking anyways.  But I think that Dupont`s warning last week that clearly oil prices will impact them for the quarter. We had IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) numbers being lowered here this morning by some analysts on concern of a weak euro. Those kinds of earnings concerns were in that period where they`ll be coming out and that will be a depressing effect on the market. 

 TUCKER:  Does part of your hold off until the end of the month advice have anything to do with the fact that part of the earnings seasons we`re in the midst of right now is  the confession  time and that might coincide with the end of the month, Richard? 

 CRIPPS: Yes, indeed. You should also remember there`s another important dynamic here and that October is usually the December for mutual funds in terms of tax loss sell  for individual investors. So I think  that those stocks that are down particularly, you`re likely to see some more pressure as fund managers try to offset any gains that they`ve taken during the year. So that will put more selling pressure and again provide a good opportunity to be a buyer, but  I think I`d wait for those opportunities as opposed to going in right now. 

 ROMANS: Richard, September and October traditionally not the best time of the year for the street on the bulls plus an election coming up in November. We keep hearing this rumors that election years are traditionally good years for the market. Does this all throw volatility to the wind here? 

 CRIPPS: I don`t know that it throws volatility to the wind, but I think that it is important, while September and Octobers are generally poor months for the markets in terms of performance, they`re great months to be a buyer of stock for performance four to six months down the road. So it`s very important to be thinking opportunistically over the next couple of months. In terms of the elections I would just say that I don`t buy the election theory in terms of the performance unless we see a big radical change, I don`t think that the markets will necessarily react. 

 TUCKER:  I want to ask you about a couple of your picks because they`re a couple of stocks that have been taking beatings in the market. I`d like to know why you see them turning around here anytime soon. Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) and especially SBC Communications (URL: http://www.sbc.com/) . Telecommunications group just in terrible shape. 

 CRIPPS: Well, first off, our stock picking methodology is looking out a year to 18 months, so I`m not picking a stock that will perform over the next couple of months. Both of those names are clearly blue chips. They`re industry leaders. They`re out of favor. In  the case of Honeywell, which of course did have a bad week, it was down almost five points last week had some of the same issues  that DuPont (URL: http://www.dupont.com/) had. But I think that if you look into  the valuation look at this long-term growth rate, look at its management, look at its financial prowess, I think this is a company that if you look two to three to four years from now it will be double or triple from current prices. 

 ROMANS: What about Liberty Media (URL: http://www.libertymedia.com/) . That`s on your list as well. What do you see in that one? 

 CRIPPS: Just probably one of the best management teams out there. Someone that in terms of John Malone who understands the convergence of all these media, Internet and the various other fields there or industries there. And plus who has the corporate finance savvy to put it all together. I like good management, like the assets underneath the stock. 

 TUCKER: Richard Cripps, the chief market strategist at Legg Mason. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Wow, look at that.  Beautiful, beautiful shot here in midtown Manhattan what actually is turning out to be quite a nice day. Humidity`s evaporating from the air. 

 Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 ROMANS:  And I`m Christine Romans.  In just a couple of minutes we`ll have more on our top story, OPEC raising oil production.  We`ll talk to the author of a new book, "The Color Of Oil". 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  And news this morning of several other mergers and possible mergers, too.  We`ll have the latest on those, but first, let`s see how the markets are doing today. 

 We have the Dow Industrials up 39 points, starting the week on something of a positive note.  The Nasdaq composite, which started the day with losses, now showing gains of nearly 13 points. 

 Let`s get a quick check on the action in the market.  And for that, let`s check in with Charles Molineaux over at the Nasdaq MarketSite. Good morning, again, Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, good morning, Bill.  We are still looking at a Nasdaq that`s all over the place.  At the moment, we are now up by 9 points at 3,987, but it`s been a pretty inconsistent day. Look at this, we started off down, fell down by 70 points to a low of 3,911 and bounced back up again to a high of 4,008, back above that 4,000 mark, and here we sit now holding onto positive territory, but now back below 4,000. 

 Check out Genzyme General, which is now down by $6, or 10 percent, on news of a big, expensive purchase.  It`s buying the biotech company, GelTex, for $1 billion, $47.50 a share, a 27 percent premium over GelTex Friday`s close.  This gives Genzyme control over two promising drugs for which GelTex has patents, Renagal for kidney patients and Welchol to lower blood cholesterol.  Genzyme says the deal will, however, involve taking a hefty charge in the fourth quarter, although it says allowed to its profits in 2002.  GelTex is up $6, or 16 percent.  Good news for GelTex shareholders. Again, a nice premium for that one. 

 Cyberonics might be bought and might be taken over.  It`s up by $8, or 54 percent.  This is a company that makes medical devices for treating epilepsy. And medical device maker, Medtronics is planning to buy Cyberonics in a stock swap worth $480 million, $26 a share, a 60 percent premium.  Hence, the nice response.  Medtronic says it has made the offer, but here`s the rub, no deal has been struck yet, although the companies have been in talks for two months.  So, we may or may not have a deal here, but at the moment the stock is rallying on the news, looking pretty nice, up 54 percent. 

 Phone.com is not looking so good, down by $3, or 3 1/2 percent.  We`ve got some rearranging going on in the head office.  Phone makes wireless communication software and is bringing a former executive vice president from Cisco.  Don Listwin is going to be president and CEO.  The current CEO will stay on.  He`ll be the company`s chairman.  Right now, we are not seeing, however, very happy response for Phone.com. 

 Well, the rest of the Nasdaq continues to be up but not by much and not as high as we were.  Up by 6 points, 620 million shares traded.  So, the volume, yet again, remains a question here.  We are sitting about 1 hour and 15 minutes away from the half way point in this trading session. 

 Bill.  Christine. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Charles, thank you. 

 ROMANS:  And oil is the big story of the day.  OPEC announced in Vienna a few hours ago it`ll increase production by three percent or 800,000 barrels a day.  But that pledge is doing nothing to stem rising oil prices. Right now, New York trading, if you like sweet crude, is up $1.46 a barrel at $35.09.  So, the next guest today is much talked about boost will not have a significant effect on prices in the long run. He`s the author of a new book called, "The Color Of Oil". 

 TUCKER:  Ronald Oligney now joins us to explain his views.  And, Ron, thanks for coming on and being a guest on IN THE MONEY. 

 RONALD OLIGNEY, AUTHOR, THE COLOR OF OIL:  Indeed. 

 TUCKER:  Let`s talk about oil from a bigger picture.  We`ve heard from the analysts, we`ve heard from Greg Clarkin at the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Let`s cut to the chase and go to an energy policy or a lack of an energy policy being articulated here in this country.  Is that part of our problem? 

 OLIGNEY:  Certainly.  I think the - with this status quo weekend for OPEC, you really have to understand this is a last gasp of excess production for OPEC.  So, I think the air of finger pointing at OPEC and finger pointing at big oil is about to come to a quick end.  And, in fact, I would expect with no real relief in sight for consumers that going into the election this is going to become a very defining issue. 

 ROMANS:  In part, one of the problems here is that these OPEC members are at or very close to capacity, right?  They can`t produce much more. 

 OLIGNEY:  Certainly.  Really, the overall issue is one of investment. It`s going to take a trillion dollars over the next decade to supply this insatiable appetite we have for oil to fuel the new economy. Those investments aren`t flowing currently.  Now, of course, today the recommendation on the street is to buy oil, buy oil.  And I think that`s probably about 12 months late, but certainly it will take massive investment.  I would point you to look at the next way, which could very well be natural gas, not a commodity, of course, manipulated by OPEC, and a commodity that`s an all time trading. 

 TUCKER:  Exactly.  And it`s a commodity that get talked about a lot, because people talk about home heating oil.   But in truth, natural gas is the third biggest source for electricity generation in this country, about to become the second.  It is the way most of us heat our homes, and we don`t talk a lot about natural gas. 

 OLIGNEY:  That will emerge as a big issue.  I`d like to say that the $5 natural gas price we have today will have the socioeconomic impact of $60 oil as we move from a internal combustion engine to a fuel cell economy. 

 It will happen over the next decade to two.  Natural gas is going to be the fuel of choice. 

 ROMANS:  Now, putting your economics hat on for those broader economy, at what point do these sorts of prices, oil - crude oil above $35 a barrel, these other prices - gasoline prices.  What point does that become a consumer tax and start to really seep into other parts of the economy? 

 OLIGNEY:  Already, of course, we`ve got the heating oil and gasoline discussion.  That will migrate into the cost of airline tickets, the cost of computers, the cost of pantyhose, everything.  It shows up eventually. But my real concern is not so much the price of the commodity.  I think the economy can sustain quite a lot of price problem.  The thing that I`m worried about is out and out shortages. When you turn on your light switch and you don`t get the power for a high tech computer economy that we`re moving to, that`s a disaster. 

 TUCKER:  Well, at some point are we going to hear discussions about alternative fuel tax breaks?  Are we going to hear talk about exploration and drilling tax breaks domestic - on the domestic side of this?  Do you expect to hear that soon? 

 OLIGNEY:  It`s already coming.  You see Al Gore making comments in Louisiana over the last couple days, a little big favorable toward the oil industry, something that he hasn`t done in a long time.  I think he sees the reality of that.  The reality of renewable energy is that, as a percentage of the world, energy mix is less than one half of one percent today.  So, this is really not a solution in the short term. 

 ROMANS:  They say investment is the solution.  Where does that investment come from?  What needs to change to see that buildout? 

 OLIGNEY:  Well, I really think the key is education.  I think as personal investors recognize the value of this investment - in fact, people that have picked up our book and used it as an investment guide over the last year or so have made up to five times their money.  I`d say we put to shame many of the dot-com investments.  People not recognizing that, of course, as a big part of the problem shying away, withdrawing the investment, and that has to reverse.  So, its` a matter of education. In fact, we`ve just recently set up a vertical Web site portal, EnergyCentralUSA.com, exactly to do that, to really hasten the discussion.  We`ll have a teleconference today at 1:00 for the media to try and answer questions.  In fact, you can connect to that by getting instructions off the Web site.  But I think that`s a big part of the solution is just education. 

 TUCKER:  Educate us really quickly.  What - do we look in the natural gas sector here?  What kind of companies should we be looking at here so we can educated and wealthy at the same time? 

 OLIGNEY:  The common report on the street today is run to the oil business, but if you want to look at a place with real big upside potential it`s going to be in the natural gas sector.  We still have room for folds of increase in many, many of those stocks, probably a four or five-year bull run ahead of us.  And I would point to companies like El Paso, Integrated and Energy, a tremendous upside potential there.  If you look at another segment in the trading business, Enron, if not already, is becoming the blue chip investment there.  And then there`s niche players that have a very good footprint in natural gas, such as Arco Petroleum and companies like that.  So, if I give you a little bit of a bandwidth with that recommendation. 

 ROMANS:  And they`re not inflated?  I mean, you`d come in at this level? 

 These are the kind of levels people could buy? 

 OLIGNEY:  They have so much upside potential that it`d be difficult to go wrong. 

 TUCKER:  Ron, before we get out of real, real quick, the Web site address again, just real quickly. 

 OLIGNEY:  Yes.  It`s EnergyCentralUSA.com. 

 TUCKER:  All one word? 

 OLIGNEY:  Yes, sir. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Terrific, Ron.  Thank you.  Ron Oligney. Appreciate it. 

 OLIGNEY:  Excellent. 

 ROMANS:  Goldman Sachs is buying Spear, Leeds in Kellogg for $6.5 billion in cash and stock.  The investment bank company acquisition will improve its position on Wall Street, specifically in the market making execution and clearing areas.  Spear, Leeds is the largest share dealer or specialist firm on Wall Street.  Goldman Sachs expects to close the deal by the end of the year. 

 Earlier on CNNfn Henry Paulson, Goldman CEO, had this to say about the acquisition. 

 HENRY PAULSON, CEO, GOLDMAN SACHS:  "This is a merger that`s about growth. And we`ve got two cultures that fit very well together.  It`s an accretive transaction from a gap standpoint and from - on a cash basis.  And we`re just very, very excited about it." 

 ROMANS:  In other merger news, Hewlett-Packard confirmed it`s in talks to buy the consulting arm of Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the world`s number one accounting and consulting firm.  HP says the deal could be worth between $17 billion and $18 billion in cash and stock, but says talks are preliminary and significant issues still need to be worked out.  PWC has been under pressure to sell its consulting business since last year when regulators expressed concerns about conflicts of interest between its consulting and auditing operations.  Shares of Hewlett-Packard right now are down about $3. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Over in the drug sector one deal has been announced, another delayed.  Irish pharmaceutical firm, Elan, says it is buying U.S.-based Dura in a $1.8 billion stock deal. 

 Separately, Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham have been forced to delay the completion of their merger.  The Federal Trade Commission has asked for additional information about their hold on the smoking cessation market. 

 Shares of the companies in the deal - let`s check and see how they`re trading today.  Elan is down.  It`s got to pony up the money to buy Dura. Dura, understandably, is higher.  Glaxo and SmithKline, ah, a lot of favor with investors right now. 

 Coming up on IN THE MONEY, taking cues from the French.  British truckers and farmers have stalled the distribution of oil in the U.K. Ahead, Phillip Coggin from the "Financial Times" will be here to talk about the unrest over oil. 

 ROMANS:  And, after a year of research, the FTC says Hollywood is spoon-feeding violence to teenagers.  Coming up, we`ll have more on that story. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  And welcome back.  We`ve got a story that is in the middle of developing, even as we speak.  The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have announced that they will be sanctioning four option exchanges for anti-competitive behavior. 

 ROMANS: And they say that they`re going to order them to spend $77 million on surveillance and enforcement.  Obviously, the options exchange has been in and out of merger talks over the past few years. And lots of scrutiny on the way things - the way business is done these days as we head into the new technology-driven sorts of ... 

 TUCKER:  Exactly. 

 ROMANS:  ... environments. 

 Well, time now to head over to the "Financial Times" and check in with the paper`s market editor, Phillip Coggin.  Phillip, truckers not only in France are unhappy about oil prices but elsewhere as well.  What`s going on? 

 PHILLIP COGGIN, EDITOR, "FINANCIAL TIMES":  Well, as you say, Christine, we`ve had protests mimicking the French.  In Brussels this morning we had lorries blocking entrance to the European Commission buildings. It`s tempting to think here of an economy will function more efficiently if the commissioners don`t get in.  But still, in Britain we`ve also had main roads been blocked, we`ve had refineries cut off by picket lines, and we`ve had petrol stations running out of fuel. And we`ve inevitably got some panic buying from consumers as well, which is adding to the whole problem. 

 Now, Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, is saying that he`s not going to give in the way that the French did.  And we also have paying (ph) disputed island where truckers are planning to do the same kind of thing unless the Irish government gets in.  So, the OPEC agreement over the weekend has done nothing to sway consumer`s anger about this issue.  And they`re pressing very heartful tax cuts.  Tax forms are much higher proportion of fuel costs than it does in the states, of course. 

 ROMANS:  Now, Phillip, speaking of lorries, what about Daimler and Mitsubishi?  What`s the latest on that auto sector? 

 COGGIN:  Well, we interviewed Daimler yesterday and they`re saying that when the three year period is up - they just took a 34 percent stake in Mitsubishi Motors on Friday - so then they will take over the entire company.  They parachuted in their executives on Friday, but it`s clear that they want to take charge of the whole business.  That might lead to a dispute with Volvo.  Volvo is undertaking a joint venture with Mitsubishi Trucks, in which it will take a 20 percent stake.  But, of course, it`s not going to be terribly happy if it`s only a 20 percent partner in a business which DaimlerChrysler effectively owns 80 percentile. So, we could have to see some negotiations direct within Daimler and Volvo about that. 

 ROMANS:  And Phillip, quickly, it sounds like a broken record, but the euro hits a new low against the dollar, and other currency as well. What`s the currency action there? 

 COGGIN:  Well, we hit a new low of 85.67 cents earlier today.  The European Finance Ministers met on Friday.  They talked and they didn`t do anything. And the markets want them to put up or shut up - intervene, make some action, do something - but they`re not doing anything and it`s not impressing the foreign exchange markets. 

 ROMANS:  OK.  Phillip Coggin at the "FT".  Thanks so much. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Now, it`s time for a quick check on world and national headlines. 

 ROMANS:  Including a new report out on how the TV industry markets violence.  For that and the rest of the day`s headlines, here`s Prudence Solomon. 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Christine and Bill. Hello, everyone. 

 A new government report says the entertainment industry doesn`t follow its own rating guidelines when it comes to marketing its products to children. 

 "The problem is this FTC report says that some entertainment companies are engaged in marketing practices that, if not illegal, are clearly wrong because they`re trying to sell their movies and their other products to the very people that they themselves say shouldn`t see them." 

 President Clinton requested the study in May of 1999 in the wake of a Columbine High School shootings. 

 In response to that FTC report, Vice President Al Gore says he`ll promote sanctions against Hollywood.  Gore is appearing on the non-violent Oprah Winfrey this afternoon in attempt to appeal to some of Oprah`s 22 million viewers, mostly female. 

 Gore`s rival, Governor George W. Bush, is expected to appear on Oprah next week.  He`s stumping in Clearwater, Florida to promote his prescription drug plan at a center for senior citizens. 

 Former Los Alamos nuclear scientist, Wen Ho Lee, could be a free man as early as this afternoon.  For more on his expected release, we`re now joined by CNN`s Justice Correspondent, Peter Thomas.  Peter, what happened to the government`s 59 count indictment against Lee? 

 PETER THOMAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the government is agreeing to drop 57 of those - actually, 58 of those counts against Wen Ho Lee in exchange for him pleading guilty to one felony count of mishandling classified information.  The government is saying that it has become very important to find out what happened to seven missing computer tapes that had classified information about nuclear weapons design.  The government is saying that that is now more important.  The national security implications are now more important than seeing Wen Ho Lee go to jail. 

 SOLOMON:  Peter, and those seven tapes are still missing.  Lee was never charged with espionage.  How solid is the government`s case? 

 THOMAS:  Well, they say they have clear evidence that Wen Ho Lee did download this information.  But one of the problems with the government`s case from early on they never charged Wen Ho Lee with espionage, yet they did have 59 counts against him that would have put him in jail for life. 

 The question that the government has to ask itself as it approached trial was could they get a conviction that would put Wen Ho Lee in jail for life when they did not have evidence that he actually gave this information to anyone. 

 SOLOMON:  Peter, thank you so much for joining us.  CNN`s Peter Thomas reporting from Washington. 

 Now, Bobby Knight has committed his last foul at Indiana University. The head coach at Indiana University was fired yesterday, just days after he grabbed a student by the arm to lecture him about manners.  Last night, more than 2,000 students marched on Indiana University to protest Knight`s firing.  The volatile coach led Indiana to three national basketball titles and 15 straight appearances in the NCAA championship tournament. Obviously, a little bit of flamboyance going on today. 

 TUCKER:  Boy, I was going to say, probably the most notable thing he ever started was that video tape of CNN aired last year ... 

 SOLOMON:  Right. 

 TUCKER:  ... of grabbing that basketball player by the throat.  I think that might have done Mr. Knight in. 

 SOLOMON:  Yeah.  Well, there you have it. 

 ROMANS:  Thanks,  Prudence. 

 TUCKER:  Thanks, Prudence. 

 ROMANS:  Coming up, we`ll talk to one mutual fund manager whose company is nothing short of a family affair.  He`ll join us after the break. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  An online parts marketplace formed by the three largest U.S. automakers will get the go ahead from the federal regulators soon.  The new B-to-B exchanged named Covisint is expected to combine $240 billion in supply spending by Ford, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler.  A government sources tells CNNfn that the Federal Trade Commission will attach no conditions to the joint venture, finding that it could provide great efficiencies and cost savings, but will provide for close monitoring to avoid collusion issues.  More than a dozen major parts suppliers have agreed to participate. 

 And Northwest Airlines says it`s joining other carriers by adding a $20 surcharge per roundtrip to cover the higher cost of jet fuel. United, American and Delta all plan to do the same.  Jet fuel prices have increased along with crude oil prices. 

 ROMANS:  In today`s mutual fundamentals segment we`re going to look at a fund that`s been in the family for 18 years.  The Calamos Growth Fund is run by a father, son and nephew.  The fund has seen a 46 percent growth rate since January and has a 208 percent turnover rate.  How long might stocks like Juniper, Sienna, TriQuint Semiconductor, Calpine Trust and Veritas Software stay in their portfolio?  Nick Calamos joins us from the windy city. 

 Nick Calamos, thanks for joining us. 

 NICK CALAMOS, CALAMOS GROWTH FUND:  My pleasure. 

 ROMANS:  First off, let`s talk about your fund and your returns.  And you have a very high turnover.  Tell me what`s your strategy and how are you weathering the volatility we`ve seen over the last week in, actually, the last year. 

 CALAMOS:  Well, our - if you see our 50 percent return this year is indicative of how we`ve weathered some of this.  But really, our turnover is a result of looking at long-term secular trends and trying to stay in the highest growth companies we can find within the industries or sectors. So, we have a high individual position turnover rate.  But if you look at the sectors that were overweight or the industries that were overweight, we have a very low turnover regarding that. 

 TUCKER:  Well, it`s hard to argue with a guy who`s got a 50 percent return rate year to date, particularly when you look at the rest of the markets and they`re on the downside.  But doesn`t that high turnover rate have a dark side in increased fees?  Doesn`t that cut into the return? 

 CALAMOS:  Well, we try to keep our transaction costs low and, at the same time, we try to be as tax aware as possible for some of our clients that may be taxable.  But the long-term returns on the fund are still extremely, extremely strong.  We`re in the top one percent of all funds the last five years. 

 ROMANS:  And you have a team managing money.  Let`s see, the uncle, nephew and son.  How does that work out? 

 CALAMOS:  Well, we`ve been managing money together.  This is the senior team at our shop at Calamos Asset Management.  We`ve been managing money together for more than 16 years, the three of us, and then two of us have been managing money together more than 18 years, and I think it works real well as the performance in this fund and as our whole fund family shows. 

 It`s been a very successful team. 

 TUCKER:  No food fights?  I would imagine that you`d get a little family discussion at Thanksgiving that might get a little heated from time to time.  Tell me about your funds in terms of the types of investors that you attract to the fund. 

 CALAMOS:  Well, this fund, in particular, the growth fund, we`re looking for the aggressive investor, not the widows and orphans.  We`re looking for people that want to participate in the exciting growth opportunities we see out in the world and they`re not afraid of volatility.  On the other hand, we have some other funds that are also rated relatively high in the Morningstar ratings, four and five star funds that are geared towards the more conservative investors.  In fact, we`re coming out with a global -a convertible technology fund.  And that`s a means to utilize convertible securities to lower the volatility in a tremendously volatile and exciting sector. 

 ROMANS:  Nick, quickly tell us about some of your picks.  What do you like right now?  Fleshed with opportunity right now, but also flush with volatility this market. 

 CALAMOS:   Absolutely.  The flip side of opportunity is volatility, and that`s why we`re excited about this marketplace.  From a secular standpoint, we look at companies or industries that we think will continue to grow regardless of the volatility out there.  So, we`re looking at companies in the electric utility industry, like Calpine, that`s - that understands that the infrastructure we have in place in this country will not allow for the capacity that we need to generate the efficiencies that we need to generate in that area.  So, they`re out buying old, inefficient utilities and what they`re doing is putting in higher turbine or higher quality turbine generators that are going to allow capacity efficiencies to be run through the utility industry to keep up with the demand and the infrastructure from the computer PC business, from the networking and also from the telecom industry. 

 ROMANS:  OK. 

 TUCKER:  All right. 

 ROMANS:  Nick Calamos, thanks for joining us so much. 

 TUCKER:  And that does it.  We`re out of time for this edition of IN THE MONEY. 

 ROMANS:  See you tomorrow.  Happy trading.

Even solid earnings don't protect stocks in fickle; marketplace; Author says to avoid risk of loss, sell first

WASHINGTON - Last year we were naughty. We bought

companies with no earnings. Our cry: No profits, no problem.

This year we're behaving and buying solid earners. Now we say no profits, no way.

But are we being rewarded for working hard and playing by the rules? All together now: ``Noooooooooooooo."

Wal-Mart, one of the great profit centers in America, comes out with its report matching The Wall Street Consensus for earnings per share and loses nearly 8 percent of its value thanks to a mild warning about quarters to come.

WorldCom matches TWSC and takes an 8 percent bath, too.

American Express, KLA-Tencor, Texas Instruments, Pfizer - all matched or beat TWSC and lost a chunk in response. From the earnings reporting season just completed, the list is long. Do we care? ``Nooooooooo." These are all "short-term"

reactions. Keep up the incantation: "I'm in it for the long term. I'm in it for the long term."

But the earnings/gratification ratio is pretty crummy these days. The reason, as far as I can tell, is that last year's obsession with price momentum has been replaced by an equal obsession with earnings momentum.

In this market, to get a "pop" in the short term, a company's got to deliver perfect profits every quarter. It's got to "surprise" Wall Street, so that the money manager has probable cause to believe that the company will continue to surprise as long as they both shall live.

The slightest wavering results in a sell-off.

Being in it for the long term, I don't ordinarily pay much attention to the reactions to quarterly earnings reports. But I was intrigued by an article in the current issue of the AAII Journal, published by the American Association of

Individual Investors.

In the article, Donald L. Cassidy, a senior analyst at Lipper Inc. and author of the book ``It's When You Sell That

Counts," says the pattern I've described is making him very cautious about his portfolio.

When he's feeling "especially cautious," he sells any stock with heavy institutional ownership before the "earnings

warning" and earnings reporting season begins.

"While FDA denials, post-merger indigestion write-offs,

product delays, and occasional accounting frauds do drop stock prices harshly," he writes, "by far the most frequent culprit is an earnings disappointment. . . . When I am being

especially cautious, I will not hold a stock with large

institutional exposure through its warning or earnings share reporting date. . . . This advice admittedly flies in the face of long-term buy-and-hold principles, and will clearly raise transaction costs.

"In my mind, however, the risk is simply too great, and

today's minuscule commissions make stepping aside cheap

insurance. Positive surprises are few and generate only a small upside reward, which is usually fleeting," Cassidy

argues.

News perceived as negative, he writes, can knock 25 percent off a stock overnight, and it may not be recovered for many months.

Now plenty of money managers do exactly this sort of thing to protect their bottom lines. But for the individual investor, all this talk of selling is heresy.

I decided to call the heretic, Donald L. Cassidy. "Yes," he says. "It's the S-word. I'm afraid that's where I come down on it." (He hastened to note that he also has a stable portfolio of securities he doesn't touch.)

Through the middle of 1998, when the rising stock market had much broader leadership, there seemed to be a lot more

instances of forgiveness where the stock goes down and then comes crawling back up. Now, Cassidy says, the institutional investors follow "the old cockroach theory: If there's one (problem), there's going to be another one."

Cassidy stressed that he is speaking only for himself and not for Lipper. And he had no empirical studies to back up this strategy for the individual investor. I'm not sure an

empirical study would prove much, as every situation is

different, depending on the stock, the gain or loss, the tax consequences and the cost of commissions.

How depressing it would be, for example, to sell a long-held stock on which you've gained, say, $20,000; fork over $4,000 to the U.S. government and whatever you also owe to the state tax collector; and then see it bounce back up again within a month.

And note that Cassidy doesn't describe this as a way to make money. He calls it a form of insurance against loss.

"Your cost basis is irrelevant," he says. A 20 percent hit is a 20 percent hit. It's to be avoided.

"I'm about 55," says Cassidy. "I don't need to get rich. I would like to continue growing my capital. But I want to do it in a way with lower risk. I have moved myself to where I have a lot of things that let me sleep well - REITs (real estate investment trusts), convertibles, a lot of utilities, value stocks. And so if we get a bad market, I'm not going to hurt that bad."

Cassidy's approach might have some validity for Internet

stocks and other small-capitalization issues that can really get pounded, says Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland

business professor specializing in the trading habits of

institutional investors.

"There is risk around earnings announcements," he says.

And by definition, you reduce the risk of sudden loss any time you sell a stock. But you could be missing a stock's positive movement just as easily, Wermers says. He's been studying institutional investors for 20 years and "there's no academic research that has shown that there's an overreaction one way (to a negative earnings report) and no reaction the other way."

Cassidy's strategy, Wermers suggested, seems misguided.

Peter Di Teresa, senior analyst at Morningstar, agrees that institutional investors are paying more attention to quarterly earnings reports and especially to the "whisper numbers" on Wall Street - the informal estimates of earnings per share. "You have to beat not only analysts' estimates. You have to beat whisper numbers to avoid getting punished," Di Teresa says. And the more people participate in this game, the more the whole process becomes self-fulfilling.

Nonetheless, he says, "my preference as a long-term investor is to ignore them. I tend to ignore the whisper numbers and the analyst estimates. Its very much a short-term issue." So what lesson are we learning this year? Chronic

profitlessness may be a road to ruin.

But that doesn't prove the opposite. Chronic profits may not be the road to wealth.

Play them as you will, the markets hold no magic.

 What now for Orica? Shock  profit warning  has led analysts to change their recommendations concerning the Australian major.

 In early Aug 2000, a warning was given by Orica that its net profits before abnormals for year ending 30 Sep 2000 are likely to be 5-10% below its net profit in the previous year, which was A$156.4 M. As a result, the company's share price has fallen sharply. Partly, the company's problems have been caused by higher costs for raw materials and oil with subsequent reductions in margins. The three business areas that have been identified as particularly problematical are the PVC joint venture with Geon, Australian Vinyls Corp (AVC); the agrochemicals joint venture with Incitec, Crop Care Australia; and the explosives business in North America. In 1999-2000, a loss is forecast for AVC, compared with earnings of A$20 M in 1998-1999. Until the end of Sep 2000, the company has obtained its vinyl chloride feedstock from the US. However, the price differential with material obtained from Asia has increased to over $100 /tonne. 

  PVC prices in Australia are generally based on the Asian vinyl chloride price, and this has put AVC at a disadvantage. Vinyl chloride is to be obtained from Asian source from the end of Sep. Demand for pipes for construction showed a particular decline. On 1 Jul 2000, a new Goods and Service Tax was introduced and many builders brought work forward to before this date. In early 1999, an antidumping petition was brought by AVC against PVC imports from Indonesia, Singapore, Hungary and South Korea. However, duties were only imposed on material from Hungary and South Korea, leaving AVC still vulnerable to cheap imports from Indonesia in particular. Plans to privatise AVC are not likely to be considered again until the market situation improves. In 1H 1998-1999, there was a 69% drop in earnings before income taxes for the agricultural chemicals operations of Orica. In spite of an improvement in 1H 1999-2000, for the full year, weaker earnings from Crop Care Australia are expected to contribute to a decline in EBIT for the sector. In Moura, Queensland, a new ammonium nitrate facility has been brought onstream by a joint venture between Wesfarmers and Dyno Nobel. Orica had forecast that this would adversely affect its explosives business in Australia, but was confident that this would be offset by improvements in profits elsewhere. However, the company was unable to pass on sharp increases in prices of gas and oil in North America. In late Aug 2000, $44 M was paid by Orica to LaRoche Industries for two ammonium nitrate facilities with a combined capacity of 310,000 tonne/y. In North America, the company has sales exceeding 1 M tonne/y. Its capacity in the region is now greater than 800,000 tonne/y. Orica also paid A$75 M for the industrial explosives operations of Dynamit Nobel. Within two years, Orica is aiming to achieve a return on assets from explosives amounting to 20%. An 11% return on assets in 1999-2000 and a 16% return by 2004-2005 is forecast by one analyst. The abortion of AVC's plans to float on the stock market resulted in corporate charges of A$2 M. The implementation of the Goods and Service Tax cost the company A$6 M.

NURSING MISTAKES KILL, INJURE THOUSANDS; COST-CUTTING EXACTS TOLL ON PATIENTS, HOSPITAL STAFFS

As a result of significant changes in the daily routine of the nation's registered nurses, hospitals patients are more and more at risk for injuries and accidental death. That's the conclusion of an extensive study undertaken by the Chicago Tribune, which analyzed 3 million state and federal hospital computer records. It also examined records from the Food and Drug Administration and Health and Human Resources Department, federal and state files of hospital surveys and complainant records and other factors for each state. One of the major findings was that since 1995, approximately 1,720 hospital patients have been accidentally killed and more than 9,580 injured from action or inaction by registered nurses. The situation has gotten progressively worse and patient safety is being compromised. The American Hospital Association representing 5,000 hospitals nationwide acknowledges that inadequate staffing and insufficient training are placing patients at risk.  

 Blamed for the decline in nursing care by the AHA are the growth of managed care programs, decline in federal Medicaid reimbursements, and the deliberate cutting of nursing services (by profitable hospitals) to preserve historic profit levels. This in-depth article (the first of three parts in the series) cites specific examples of injuries and deaths because of lack of training, understaffing, failure of warning alarms and monitoring systems, use of unlicensed and unregulated nurses aides, problems as a result of deteriorating and oppressive working conditions, specific examples of errors linked to staff cutbacks, patients receiving the wrong medicine or dosage, lack of proper training and adequate supervision, the increased use of temporary nurses, and finally the reforms that take place after a patient dies. Accompanying the article is a list of the typical nursing duties for ids, licensed practical nurse and registered nurses. Subsequent articles will cover the deadly consequences of misusing a common machine by nurses and the absence of disciplinary oversight.

 Technology-Driven Nasdaq Market Falls 6 Percent

 The week's mini-tech wreck continued Friday, as dour earnings forecasts for computer and semiconductor firms shook investors. 

 The technology-driven Nasdaq market, coming off a strong August, fell 6 percent for the week, closing below the psychologically significant 4000 mark for the first time since Aug. 22. 

 By the end of August, the index had made up more than half the ground it had lost from its March record close through the April 14 market implosion, but Friday's loss of 119.94 points, or 2.9 percent, left it at 3978.41, down more than 21 percent from its peak. 

 Tech and blue-chip stocks fell despite a drop in oil prices, though food stocks got a lift from speculation about more consolidation in the industry. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.22, or 0.3 percent, to 11221.76. For the week, it lost 18 points. 

 "What's interesting today is that the price of oil is down $2 a barrel and the market still can't get anything going," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist with Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago investment firm. 

 Food stocks were among the market's few bright spots. 

 Chicago-based Quaker Oats Co. shot ahead $5.06, or 7.5 percent, to $72.69, on renewed speculation that it may be in merger talks with Kellogg Co. of Battle Creek, Mich. Shares of Kellogg rose $1.75, or 7.6 percent, to $24.75. 

 Rumors of a combination between the two companies have heated up recently amid a consolidation wave in the food industry, in part because each is considered undersized in a market that values scale. A merger would unite two powerful cereal companies that also have complementary convenience foods, such as Kellogg's Pop-Tarts and Quaker cereal bars. 

 Representatives for Quaker and Kellogg declined to comment on the speculation, citing company policy. But the possibility of further consolidation in the food industry lifted other stocks. Chicago-based Wm. Wrigley Jr. rose $2.56, to $75; Campbell Soup increased $1.50, to $26.62, while H.J. Heinz Co. climbed $1.06, to $37.12. 

 Meanwhile, shares of computer and semiconductor stocks took a drubbing. 

 Intel fell $2.06, to $65.37, after an analyst downgraded the stock. Online broker National Discount Brokers fell $8, or 22.3 percent, to $27.81 after a profit warning. 

 WorldCom fell 2.0 percent to $29.94, while Cisco Systems Inc. fell 3.6 percent to $63.87. 

 Among local tech issues, Motorola fell $1.69, or 4.7 percent, to $33.81; Tellabs dropped $1.87, or 3.3 percent, to $53.62, and Molex slid $1.56, or 2.9 percent, to $52.44. 

 Westfalia Investments economist Peter Cardillo downplayed the Nasdaq market's fall, saying he's still looking for technology stocks to outperform other sectors over the long term. 

 "Right now, the market is defensive because we have so many stocks that are still selling at 50 to 60 times earnings. Until that changes we'll see turbulence," he said. 

 Wesbury was more cautious, saying investors are now pricing expectations of an economic downturn into the market. 

 "Next week, we'll be inundated with data that will show a slowdown, including retail sales that will be significantly weaker for August than they were in July," he said. "This slower growth will continue to weigh on stocks until the Fed telegraphs it is finished raising rates." 

 Wesbury is predicting very low growth or slight declines by year-end for both Dow and the Nasdaq, though he believes technology sector stocks are better plays than old-economy shares through the coming business slowdown.

 The buck flops here: The U.S. economy may be booming, but earnings of firms like Reebok, with significant overseas exposure, are being hurt by the strong dollar

 WASHINGTON - The euro's 13% drop against the U.S. dollar this year is hurting the reported results of shoemaker Reebok International Ltd. and other U.S. companies selling auto parts, chemicals and other products in Europe. 

 The decline in the European currency means a pair of training shoes selling for 87 euros in Germany is now only US$77 in dollar terms, down from about US$90 at the start of the year. That currency translation effect cut Reebok's sales by more than US$10-million in the quarter ended June 30 compared with a year earlier. 

 Reebok's example underscores a paradox of the U.S. economic expansion. The 21% gain in the Federal Reserve's trade-weighted dollar index since the middle of 1995 has made U.S. investments attractive to overseas investors and held down inflation by making imported goods less costly. At the same time, that competition has prevented many U.S. companies from raising prices on steel and other products. Overseas sales booked in foreign currencies also shrink during conversion to dollars. 

 "Despite the economy slowing a bit this year, it's still healthy and vibrant and we still have a strong U.S. dollar," said Jake Dollarhide, vice-president and portfolio manager of Fredric Russell Investment Management Co. in Tulsa, Okla. "U.S. companies whose sales are dependent on European countries -- their profits will continue to be reduced or hurt by the weak euro." 

 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. received less for tires in dollar terms than it would have without the currency swing; Whirlpool Corp., less on its appliances; and Hercules Inc., less on its paper-making chemicals. In all, 206 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index did business in Europe last year, according to S&P CompuStat, a database. 

 Reebok, based in Canton, Mass., reported on July 25 that its worldwide sales of the Reebok brand in this year's second quarter were US$559.6-million, down 1.8% from a year earlier. It said sales would have grown by US$1.6-million without currency fluctuations. Even so, cost-cutting enabled Reebok to report net income of US$10.7-million, compared with US$4.6-million a year earlier. 

 Reebok's rival Nike Inc. reported its European revenue would have grown 23% in the quarter ended May 31 without the euro's decline. Instead, revenue grew 8%. 

 U.S. athletic shoe companies are competing for a rising European market and against Germany's Adidas-Salomon AG. Such competition limits what Reebok, which sells in local currencies, can do. 

 "U.S. companies don't have any flexibility how they translate their local currency sales into U.S. dollars," said Neil Kerman, vice-president of corporate finance and investor relations at Reebok. As a result, the company is looking at "alternative materials" and other ways to cut costs. 

 The appreciation of the dollar since 1995 may be spelling deeper trouble for U.S. companies. "The U.S. is losing market share because the dollar's high," Robert Mellman, an economist with J.P. Morgan Securities in New York, said. "You can see that in the auto industry, where imports are rising. You also see it with producers of steel and commodity chemicals." 

 The growing strength of the dollar has aggravated the decline of U.S. traditional manufacturing at the same time U.S. production of chips, communications equipment and computers has expanded, Mr. Mellman said in a recent analysis. U.S. spending on consumer goods has grown between three and four times as fast as production since the mid-1990s, the study says. 

 Overseas companies are filling the gap. While part of this reflects the underlying trend of moving mills and factories to lower-cost sources overseas, the appreciation of the dollar has played a role. 

 Hercules, the Wilmington, Del., chemical company, counts on Europe for almost a third of its sales. The company said last month that lower prices for products such as paper-making chemicals combined with unfavourable currency translation contributed to a 57% decline in profit in the second quarter, which ended June 30. 

 Whirlpool said in a profit warning last month that "pricing pressures are becoming more evident," while the strength of the dollar "is expected to reduce both revenue and earnings translations." European business conditions, which also include "varied and volatile consumer demand," should reduce earnings by US20 cents to US25 cents a share in the second half. 

 A reason for the attractiveness of the dollar is the record U.S. expansion combined with the Fed's target lending rate for overnight loans between banks of 6.5% -- the highest central bank benchmark rate among the Group of Seven industrialized nations. European central bankers last week raised the main refinancing rate a quarter point to 4.5% to keep inflation in check. 

 The European Central Bank's rate increase "is being seen as starting to hurt growth" in the 11-country euro region, said Niall O'Sullivan, an economist at Bank of Ireland. 

 While currency problems aren't new, the decline in the euro -- introduced in January, 1999, at US$1.17 per euro, but trading yesterday around US86.86 cents -- caught many companies off guard. 

 "Most investment houses had expected the euro to strengthen last year and this year," said Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Mellon Bank in New York. 

 That's a reason fewer companies benefited from such hedging activities as buying Eurodollar futures or entering into custom-made derivatives contracts. 

 Global companies do get benefits from financing business or purchasing goods and services in local currencies. McDonald's Corp. buys most of its cheese slices for European burgers from Golden Vale PLC, based in Ireland, which uses the euro as its currency. McDonald's also reported in July that a stronger Japanese yen "partly offset" the damage from the weaker euro, Australian dollar and British pound. 

 The difficulties for U.S. companies could ease, analysts say. The growth differential between the United States and its trading partners should disappear in 2002, according to analysis in August by Chase Securities Inc. If cooler economic growth in the U.S. keeps interest rates from rising, foreign currencies could strengthen. 

 "At that point, U.S. minivans, SUVs and trucks become more attractive abroad," said Mr. Chandler.

 breakingviews.com: Tiscali Merger May Need More Work --- World Online's Cash Could Help Build Network and Buy Licenses

 It is easy To see why Tiscali and World Online are huddling together. World Online's credibility was shot to bits when it emerged that its founder had sold a large chunk of shares surreptitiously before its March initial public offering. Meanwhile, Italy's Tiscali could do with a cash injection. World Online's 1.6 billion euro cash pile will help it complete the build-out of its European fiber-optic network and invest in a third-generation mobile license in Italy if it and its allies win one. 

 Precisely because World Online has been so badly mauled by investors, Tiscali has been able to pick it up on the cheap. It is paying only about 1,700 euros per subscriber net of cash. Tiscali itself trades at nearly four times that level. 

 But management will have to come up with a convincing tale to justify the new group's nearly 13 billion euros market capitalization. In the first half of the year, Tiscali-World Online together generated only 5.5% of its revenue from electronic commerce and advertising. The bulk of the sales came from charging Web access fees and voice telephone services -- businesses whose margins are being eroded by competition and increased capacity. Its valuation equals about 36 times greater than estimated sales this year. 

 As a bigger group with about 6.1 million users, Tiscali-World Online may make a more appealing gateway for advertisers and merchandisers. But it's not a given, because its content is far from compelling and its customers will be geographically scattered. Even after huddling together, Tiscali-World Online will have its work cut out for it. 

 Invensys 

 Invensys seems to have caught the BTR disease. The controls group, born out of the merger of BTR and Siebe two years ago, is inheriting the old U.K. conglomerate's reputation for value-destruction. At the time of the merger, Invensys shares were valued at about GBP 9 billion (15 billion euros). After this week's profit warning, Invensys is worth nearly a third less. 

 Since the merger, underlying profit margins have barely budged. All the GBP 300 million of cost savings has effectively been handed back to customers. It looks as if management took its eye off the core business during the integration process. Sales at the residential and industrial controls businesses -- the very heart of old Siebe -- are stagnating. True, the company is reacting swiftly to contain the damage and is confident that it will quickly turn the situation round. But the glitches uncovered may still lop off up to 10% from earnings this year. 

 And worse, Invensys has now embarked on another risky diversification, it is trying to turn around Baan, a close-to-bankrupt Dutch software company. This would have been a challenging feat even for a well-run company. After Thursday's news, it looks even more so. The only crumb of comfort for investors is that the shares are now so cheap that Invensys may itself be vulnerable to a predator. The global controls industry remains sufficiently fragmented that any of the top five could buy one another with few antitrust problems. Invensys has not impressed as a predator. It might still make tasty prey. 

 Infostrada 

 Vodafone AirTouch is finding it harder to auction off Infostrada than it thought. The deadline for bids for the Italian fixed network was supposed to have been Sept. 6. But the sale process is still dragging on. There's certainly interest in buying Infostrada. It would make an especially neat fit for Albacom and Wind, which both have Italian networks and might therefore be prepared to pay a premium price. The snag is that Vodafone wants cash. And all the obvious bidders are strapped for cash. So financing a deal will require somersaults 

 Look at Albacom. British Telecommunications is the only member of this multiheaded consortium with a strong strategic interest in acquiring Infostrada. But it is also under pressure from shareholders to cut its debt mountain. One neat way of financing a deal would be for BT to offer Vodafone its stake in Airtel, the Spanish mobile group they jointly own. That would be sufficiently interesting to Vodafone for it to abandon its demand for cash. But BT has not yet offered the Airtel stake. And, even if it did, there would still be a question of how the other Albacom partners would finance their share of the deal. 

 Matters are not much easier for Wind. Rumors are flying around Rome that it might finance a deal by paying partly in its own shares. To make this more palatable, the idea is that Wind could offer Vodafone some guaranteed cash exit when it gets round to its own IPO. 

 Maybe such contortions can produce a deal. And maybe some non-Italian outsider -- Deutsche Telekom is the name most frequently mentioned -- will enter the picture with a bulging wallet. But it is also possible that Vodafone will be reduced to launching an IPO for Infostrada. That will be less lucrative. 

 Spirent 

 Substance is lurking behind the spin in Spirent's new name. The U.K. company formerly known as Bowthorpe really has transformed itself into a firm providing testing kits to the telecom industry. This business now contributes two-thirds of the group's operating profit. It is outpacing its fast-growing market and more or less maintaining its generous margins. Investors have gotten the message, and lifted the shares into the U.K.'s blue-chip index. 

 But Spirent is still saddled with noncore businesses. This is a shame. It stops management from concentrating on other areas, which are delivering more value to shareholders. Spirent can perhaps justify keeping its systems unit, which supplies the aerospace and power industries. This underperforming division won't attract worthwhile offers until management turns it around. But the sensory-components business is keeping its head up in a tricky climate. It may be more valuable to a rival that can eliminate duplication by combining the business with its own. 

 Investors have long known about Spirent's disposal plans. Hence the shares command a similar rating to U.S.-listed rival Inet, which is a pure telecom-kit play. Both trade at more than 50 times greater than this year's expected earnings. This is a premium to Agilent of the U.S., whose mix of high-growth and low-growth businesses resembles Spirent's. Unless Spirent gets a good price from its disposals, and soon, the company's next re-rating may be downward.

 Companies: Invensys Issues  Profit Warning , Plans to  Cut  Thousands of Jobs --- Shares Plunge 36%; Firm Says Problems Aren't Linked to Baan Purchase

 LONDON -- Invensys PLC issued a profit warning and said it would cut several thousand jobs, sending shares in the British automation conglomerate plunging 36%. 

 Shares of Invensys dropped to 167.75 pence (2.77 euros) each, down 93.25 pence, after Chief Executive Allen Yurko said the company's first-half results would be "slightly down" owing to sluggish second-quarter trading. As a result, the company announced as many as 3,000 layoffs, or 2% to 3% of the total work force, mainly in Mexico and the U.S. 

 Mr. Yurko said the problems had nothing to do with the company's recent acquisition of Dutch software company Baan Co., where some 1,000 jobs are already being shed. 

 Invensys, created by the 1999 merger of Siebe PLC and BTR PLC, said the "expected recovery in our capital goods markets has not materialized" because customers from the oil and gas sectors are spending 3% less in capital expenditure than they were a year ago. 

 The company also said that an 11% drop in U.S. housing starts over the past year contributed to a decline in its residential-controls business in the second quarter. Further, Invensys said the dollar's recent strength against the euro negatively affected the company, which does a lot of its business in the U.S., because European rivals are priced in cheaper euros. 

 Analysts said, however, that Invensys's troubles go far beyond such factors, and they cast doubt on the company's aspirations to become a high-tech player and a world leader in automation and controls. 

 "We think there is more bad news to come," said Sanjay Jha, an analyst with Williams de Broe in London. "Big companies take a long time to turn around." Deutsche Bank cut its 2000 and 2001 earnings estimates by 15% and 10%, respectively. 

 Analysts said that Invensys lost its technology edge a couple years ago and problems have been brewing for some time. "The timing is a surprise, but some of the issues have been publicly known for a while," said Mark Cusack, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "The extent of the problems appears to have caught the market by surprise." 

 Invensys said its results for the first half ending Sept. 30 will be slightly lower than first-half 1999 results of GBP 514 million in profit before interest and tax. 

 Mr. Yurko said in a telephone interview that the disappointing results are only "a specific second-quarter issue." Defending the company's management, he added that "we caught the issue in July and August and have taken action. Bumps in the road happen to companies of our size. It has not been building for a while, and the second half of last year was a darn good half." 

 Mr. Yurko said that he blamed 70% of the difficulties on macroeconomic factors and only 30% on the company itself. "This is not a complete collapse, it is pressure in very specific places," he said. "In the second half of the year we will see a return to growth."

 Earnings jitters pin U.S. stocks near day's lows.

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Stocks slumped to session lows on Friday, after a fresh slew of companies warning their earnings will not match up with Wall Street's expectations heightened worries about the U.S. corporate profit picture. 

 High-tech shares suffered the brunt of investors' panic, led by computer and semiconductor makers, while blue-chip shares were dogged by losses in some "Old Economy" names. 

 "There is great uncertainty about corporate earnings," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist with Primark Decision Economics. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 41.44 points, or 0.37 percent, at 11,218.43, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 8.82 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,493.69. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, slumped was 97.44 points, or 2.38 percent, at 4,000.91. The index broke below the key 4,000 level on Friday for the first time since mid-August, and breaching its 200-day moving average of 4,009. 

 Big computer-related companies were leading the retreat into negative territory, with Juniper Networks , a maker of high-speed routers used in computer networks, down $12 at $202-7/8. 

 On the plus side, Quaker Oats was one of the New York Stock Exchange's biggest percentage gainers, up $5, or 7 percent, at 72-5/8 on speculation the food company could be bought by a larger rival. 

 The Dow was dragged down by some of its big technology names, like International Business Machines , which tumbled $3-7/16 to $129-15/16, and semiconductor giant Intel Corp. , which slipped $1-12/16 to $65-11/16. 

 Some of the blue chip average's "Old Economy" components were also bruised as Wall Street fretted that the dollar's strength against Europe's single currency and the high price of oil could bruise corporate profits further. 

 But on Friday, shares of oil and and natural gas companies retreated as crude oil prices slumped from their 10-year high on signs that the OPEC cartel will order an increase in supply to cap rising prices. 

 The high-tech sector's troubles started earlier in the week when one Wall Street brokerage cut its investment rating on Intel. 

 That has "investors really scratching their heads as to whether this quarter is going to be the last quarter of really strong growth for a while," said Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management, referring to the technology sector. 

 The latest profit warnings came from a number of firms, including TRW Inc. , a maker of automotive, space and defence products, which was down $1-5/16 at $43-15/16; semiconductor equipment maker SpeedFam-IPEC Inc. , off $2 at $14-1/16; and brokerage National Discount Brokers Group Inc. , which slumped $8-11/16 to $27-1/8.

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNFN ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Let`s bring Christine Romans into the picture at the New York  Stock Exchange to explain the damage. 

 Good morning, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, well, you know, it`s interesting because the financials, some of them are some of the sole groups to be able to move a little bit higher here today along with the airlines.  But National Discount Brokers is not one of them.  NDB moving lower, it warned its first quarter earnings will be in the range of a loss of  six cents, nine cents a share from continuing operations, sees revenue at $57 million.  The Street had been looking for earnings per share growth on the plus side.  So there`s a bit of disappointment there.   It says its revenues were negatively impacted by adverse market conditions affecting July performance of its Nasdaq Market-Maker and plans to report its first quarter earnings on September 26. 

 Also watching First Data, FDC, this is a Georgia-based credit card processing company.  This one says that actually, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has downgraded this one, cutting its rating to an outperform from a strong buy, citing some consolidation among its banking customers. It cut the price target to $52 a share from $70 a share.  You`re seeing this stock move down something like 14 percent in the early going here. So still watching First Data Corporation. 

 And Celestica, CLS, Banc of America Securities has raised its 12-month price target to $140 from $120 and Goldman has added it to its recommended-for-purchase list.  So these are some of the stocks that we`re watching here today, but I`ve got to tell you, guys, people here on the floor are saying that it feels a little lethargic, these just - just profit taking ruling today, mostly, so. 

 LISOVICZ:  A lethargic Friday, Christine, we`ve seen those before. 

 ROMANS:  Definitely. 

 LISOVICZ:  Christine Romans at the Big Board. 

 TUCKER:  Well, Ford says the Firestone tire recall will affect its bottom line for the second half of 2000.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the automaker says the recall will cut its revenue and increase its cost.  However, Ford said there`s nothing new in the SEC filing.  And it is still too early to determine the full impact.  Many of 6 1/2 million recalled Firestone tires are standard equipment on Ford Explorers.   They have been linked to accidents involving 88 deaths in the United States. 

 Kelli Arena is following the development for us from Washington. 

 Kelli, bring us to do date. 

 KELLI ARENA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Bill, my head is spinning, I will tell you this.  We -- the big hullabaloo today is over what Firestone will do for consumers who have tires that were included in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration`s consumer warning.  Those are the tires that Firestone said it would not recall.  It included further sizes of ATX and Wilderness tires, but that NHTSA can be dangerous.   Well, first Firestone came out last week and you have -- if you`re concerned, we`ll replace the tires for free.  No recall, but you can get them replaced.  Well, lo and behold, on Saturday, they put in a clarification which nobody could figure out, on the Web site.   Well, we just got off the phone with Firestone and here`s what they have to say, which is - seems to be a flip-flop on their original promise.  Basically they say if you bring in your tire, and we find a problem, we`ll replace it.  But if we can`t find a problem, if the tire is under warranty, and you`re still concerned, we will prorate that cost of that tire onto a new set of Firestone tires for you.  But if it`s not under warranty, well, then, you`re out of luck.  So, you know, public relations experts are saying, you know, this is just one more mistake that Firestone is making.  This is what we`ve got for you today, Bill, it continues. 

 TUCKER:  So if you have Firestone, I just want to get this straight, if you Firestone tires on your Ford Explorer.  You go in because you know they`ve been recalled, and they say no, these tires are fine. 

 ARENA:  No, no, no, these aren`t the recalled ones.  These are the ones from the NHTSA warning. 

 TUCKER:  Oh, OK, so these are the ones that NHTSA came out last week and said, listen, we`re concerned. 

 ARENA:  And said they`re even more dangerous than the ones that were recalled, right, those tires. 

 TUCKER:  So if you want to change those tires, basically it comes down to your pocketbook, now.   Firestone is not accepting any financial responsibility whatsoever. 

 ARENA:  Exactly, they say unless they find a visible defect.  But, you know, a tread separation doesn`t always, you know, give you an early warning.   That, you know, these are things that are happening, you know on the road spontaneously, so. 

 TUCKER:  That`s astounding, Kelli, they don`t seem to be taking any steps to reassure people who use Firestone products whatsoever. 

 ARENA:  You said it, not me, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  I will say it, and I`ll say it again, because it leads to the next question.  Attorney General Janet Reno said she would act upon a request to look into possibility of civil or criminal charges. 

 ARENA:  That`s right. 

 TUCKER:  Given that hanging over their head, I would think the response would be different.  Is there anything to update us on in that situation, Kelly? 

 ARENA:  Well, basically, you are right, I mean, Janet Reno said that they would review it, that was on the request of Senator Patrick Leahy. But Justice officials and Justice sources say that it`s going to be very difficult to bring criminal charges.  This is a very difficult thing to prove that a company had information that it did not act on, and that it was involved in some sort of a cover up.  But if ,you know, if -- NHTSA`s investigation continues, if they come up with something, then they`ll move. But they have not opened an investigation yet.  We`re waiting to see. But as you know, there have been a lots of legislation already introduced that would provide for criminal penalties if corporate officials do withhold information or don`t act in a timely fashion.  So we have two major bills already.  And as you know, John McCain`s hearing, Senator  John McCain`s hearings start next week.  So the Senate, you know, goes at this again where there will be a lots more proposals from NHTSA and from legislators there as well. 

 TUCKER:  Terrific, Kelli, thanks for that update. 

 ARENA:  You`re welcome, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  Kelli Arena, in Washington. 

 LISOVICZ:  Well, Christine Romans says that the mood seemed lethargic at the New York Stock Exchange, but we`ve got the Nasdaq down nearly 2 3/4 percent right now. 

 So Charles Molineaux, is it more than just a couple of earnings warnings that is effecting the type of trading we`re seeing up there today? 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we`ve certainly got our share of earnings warnings.  But it`s certainly more than that, because we`ve got broad selling going on.  We`re down by 108 points at 3,989, at our session low, on very negative breadth.  Declining issues outnumbering advancers by a two to one margin.  Check it out, biotech stocks down by 1 1/2 percent.  Industrials down by 2 1/2 percent. Telecoms down by three percent.  Computer stocks down by three percent. We`ve got chip stocks, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index is now down by almost five percent right now.  And check out the Goldman Sachs Internet index, the Web stocks are also off by something like three percent.  So we`re seeing some pretty broad selling.  Although, of course, we do have significant warnings in the likes of Empower and SpeedFam to weigh things down as well in the Nasdaq composite.  Now off by 107 points at 3,990. 

 So we continue to see weakness.  Banking and insurance stocks are up. But all other sectors on the Nasdaq are down on volume of 535 million shares -Susan, Bill. 

 LISOVICZ:  Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq marketSite, thank you. 

 According to our next guest, in the last 50 years, the markets have tended to move higher seven months before a presidential election. Seven months before November , of course, takes us back to May, and it`s been a mixed picture so far.  July and August, of course, have been great months for the Nasdaq, while the Dow has shown gains only in the last two months. 

 For more on his outlook, we are joined by Al Goldman, stock market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis,  Missouri. 

 So, Al, you think that despite the fact that it seems like a dead even presidential race right now, the markets are going to take all that uncertainty and trade up? 

 AL GOLDMAN, A.G. EDWARDS:  I think so, it`s not the -- whoever is living in the White House after - well, next year, that determines what the market`s going to do.  It`s the outlook for the economy.  And actually it`s the last seven months of the year not seven months into the election.   So we still have time to meet that historical standard. We`re looking at the market, today, for example, as a buying opportunity.  We have a very strong economy, good carpet earnings.  Why we`re down so sharply today, nobody knows.   But in bull markets you take advantage of it.  You become a buyer. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, so the fundamentals are good in your opinion.  One area that`s been hard-hit by some of the - of certainly by the presidential campaign is pharmaceuticals.   But yet you like sector right now? 

 GOLDMAN:  Yes, I think that pharmaceuticals, which have been in the emotional dog house all this year, they`re being used as a political football.  But number one, the group has come down substantially, so valuation levels are better.  Number two, the economy is going to slow down to healthier rate of expansion.   And in that environment, folks are going to look for defensive growth stocks.   So I think you take a half position in issues like Pfizer right now.  And rather than try to guess when the moods going to change, take a half now and a half later. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, and one quick pick from you? 

 GOLDMAN:  Well, Pfizer in the pharmaceuticals. 

 LISOVICZ:  But you like techs too. 

 GOLDMAN:  Oh yes, you bet I like techs, Advanced Micro Devices looks attractive; down today.  In the Internet, Cisco has been down.  We like the financial area, both in banks Wells Fargo.  And in the direct finance area, American Express; which is acting very well and ready to break out. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards, thanks so much. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 LISOVICZ: On the heels of last month`s  tire recall, many automotive suppliers are starting to  feel the effects of Ford`s  production-line paralysis. Ford suppliers Dupont and  Visteon have both issued  earnings warnings, now so has  TRW (URL: http://www.trw.com/) . The maker of air bags,  steering wheels, sensor systems and other auto  devices, announced that it  will miss its third-quarter  earnings by as much as 20 percent. What will it take to recover? TRW is our "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISOVICZ: Chance are unless you`re a defense contractor or automotive engineer you`ve never heard of TRW. But chances are if you drive, fly, or watch satellite TV there is a TRWproduct in your life. TRW makes components for cars, planes, satellites, and battle cruisers. One of its key products is the air bag. And  TRW is Ford`s sole supplier. Now that relationship is starting to hurt  TRW. Just a month after it got entangled in  the Firestone tire recall, Ford has had slowed its production line. And it was just a matter of time before  the impact of that trickled down to  the subcontractors. Late yesterday TRW announced its would miss third quarter earning estimate by as much as 20 percent because of Ford`s troubles. And it has been a mixed year for TRW. In January TRW missed  the street`s estimate and the stock dipped to a 52-week low below $40. Since then the company  has posted some strong earnings and  the stock climbed to peak last spring before recessing again. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISOVICZ: And here`s  a look at how shares of TRW are doing on Wall Street today. And look at that. They are trading up better than 2 1/2 at 42 11/16. For a closer look, let`s  bring in Efraim Levy, auto  analyst at Standard & Poor`s in New York. Welcome.  And Efraim, what`s going on? Why is  this stock trading sharply higher? 

 EFRAIM LEVY, STANDARD & POOR`S: Actually it`s trading lower if you go by the closing price yesterday at 4:00. It had been about 45 1/4  and then after  the market closed , there was trading activity that  brought it down to  the 41 range. So that is why it appears to be up today. 

 TUCKER: So it`s an illusion at  the moment that we`re looking at. TRW announcing problems with Ford. The problems here are bigger than just Ford alone, aren`t they? 

 LEVY: Right. You will see shortfalls across  the industry. Some of them will be related for Ford, and a lot of them will be related to the euro and other currencies that are falling against the dollar. And what happens when you have the dollar strengthening against these currencies is that when you translate  the profits into dollars you`re getting less bang for your buck and then you miss your numbers. 

 LISOVICZ:  How is TRW regarded in  the industry? I know it has a sole supplier contract with Ford. So of course, Ford`s problems are going to hurt it. But it`s had 2 major recalls for its air bag in 1990 and 1995. It`s had  some other problems with accounting. How is -- has - what kind of regard is it held in? 

 LEVY: It`s still the leading player in the industry that it`s involved. There  sometimes have been questions about the leadership team and how successful they have been. And one of the things that maybe a catalyst for a rebound down the road is that David Cone (ph) has been brought in from General Electric. And he is positioned to takeover the reins of CEO next year. 

 TUCKER: Do you like the stock? Do you have a rating on them? 

 LEVY: We downgraded it yesterday from a hold to an avoid. And that is based on  the fact that the earning shortfall plus the fact that we don`t think that all these factors will go away so fast. While  the Ford news is probably temporary and it`s related to  the Firestone tire recall. So they have temporarily shut some of their production. We`ll get some of that back likely in  the fourth quarter. The bigger issue is the euro that has been weakening and about half of the companies automotive sales are in Europe. And that will have a big negative impact on them going forward. 

 LISOVICZ: Efraim Levy, analyst with Standard & Poor`s, thank you. 

 LEVY: You`re welcome. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Ooh, look at that.  That is a beautiful, beautiful sky no matter where you live. 

 LISOVICZ:  A beautiful day. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  Too bad we have to be in here working.  May account for some of the lackluster lethargy that Christine Romans was talking about down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 LISOVICZ:  And I`m Susan Lisovicz.  In a few minutes we`ll talk to "Business Week`s" Jean Marciel (ph) about the stocks in his "Inside Wall Street" column. And we`ll talk to a fund manager whose small cap fund is up over 100 percent. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  But first, let`s get a quick check on the markets.  At the moment the Dow is down 58 points, 11,201 is the level there.  Dow now down about three percent on the year.  Nasdaq, 4,020, back below where it started the year as well, down about a percent on the year and about almost two percent on the day, losing 78 points.  Technology really the problem here, both with the Dow and the Nasdaq.  Intel selling down sharply, as is Honeywell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM. 

 LISOVICZ:  For a closer look behind the numbers, we have Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange and Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq. Let`s start with you, Christine.  What are the traders chatting about this morning? 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they`re chatting about a variety of things. Mostly this is a shortened trading week, and that seems to be dampening some of this end of the week demand.  Overall, we`ve got buying coming in about 388 million shares.  The Dow down 58 at 11,201. They say it`s individual stock stories.  It`s a little bit of softness or a little concern about profit taking and the fact that the market really wasn`t able to muster much upside this week.  And that`s where things are going.  Overall, there`s just no a lot of rounds this morning.  They say in terms of order flow and interest, in particular, sectors are not seeing quite a lot.  Some Arthur (ph) passion to PaineWebber, who prowls around down here.  Four-day week Fridays.  They really just aren`t barn burners. Let`s be honest.  So, he`s looking, and some are a lot of other people, for maybe things to dry to up a little bit into the afternoon, although that can also mean more volatility.  And, don`t forget this Sunday is the big day for OPEC in Vienna.  Folks will be there to decide what to do with oil output and 700,000 barrels per day.  Output production is anticipated, but, as one trader said, it`s totally inadequate anyway. So, folks are waiting to see just how much oil output will be coming into the market, and they say that`s likely to direct interest here on Monday morning for a variety of different reasons.  But really, they don`t want to see oil above $35 a barrel.  They say that acts as a consumer tax and can make things a little tough down here in terms of corporate profits. 

 For a look at things over at the Nasdaq where corporate profits and the tough going there are definitely in focus, we`ll bring in Charles. Hey, Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, definitely, Christine. Yeah. We got computers, telecoms, industrials, chips and Internets taking a real bath today.  The one bit of good news, I guess, we can tell you is that the Nasdaq is back above the 4,000 level, up to 4,021, down still by 76 points, but up from our session low below 4,000, which was 3,988.  At that point this market was down by 109 points.  Check out Speedcam (ph).   It`s getting pulverized by a warning, down 14 percent after announcing that it is projecting a loss of 23 to 27 cents a share in its first quarter. The market had been expecting a loss of only 12.  Credit Suisse First Boston says it`s going to be reviewing its forecasting for Speedcam (ph) results, and so does Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette. 

 Gadzoox.  Gadzoox is down by 21 percent.  Look at that one.  It`s warning as well.  It says its second quarter revenue numbers are coming below the expectations.  It says adoption of its Capellix family of switches has been slower than expected.  It`s going to take a charge for excess inventory produced to meet demand, which never materialized.  So, that is causing plenty of problems. 

 Well, we see the Nasdaq does continue to be down.  Breadth is negative as well.  We`ve got decliners leading advancers by something in the neighborhood of two to one. 

 Bill. 

 TUCKER:  That`s convincing.  Thank you, Charles. 

 In today`s mutual funds segment, we`re taking a look at the world according to small cap stocks.   The Sit Small Cap Growth Fund invest in bottom one to two percent of the market universe.  Now, over the past year, that is, over the last 52 weeks, not year to date, the fund`s growth has climbed 109 percent versus the Russell`s 2000, which has gone up about 23 percent. The fund is not limited only to small cap stocks, as a look at this list will tell you.  It includes companies like SDL, PMC Sierra, Plug Microcircuits, Flextronics, then we got a couple of small ones in there.  Biosite Diagnostics also upped the fund`s performance.  Jean Sit Fund Manager and CEO of Sit Investment Associates joins us from Minneapolis now with more on his firm`s strategy and outlook.  And thanks for being here on IN THE MONEY. 

 GENE SIT, FUND MANAGER, CEO, SIT INVESTMENT ASSOCIATES:  Thanks, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  Are you - I`m confused, and help me sort this out first.  You call yourself a small cap fund.  Clearly, though, some of these stocks, like Flextronics, SDL and JDSU, are not small caps.  Explain the investment philosophy to us, please. 

 SIT:  Oh, Bill, we buy small companies so they can become bigger companies. We don`t buy small companies for the sake of small companies, and we`ve been very fortunate.  We bought a number of names over the last couple years, namely that we bought them when they were small caps. And they`ve gone up 10 to 20 folks.  Example, our cost basis in JDS Uniphase is 91 cents. 

 TUCKER:  Whoa. 

 SIT:  That`s 120 plus time or so.  Our objective is that we will seek capital appreciation by buying companies in the bottom one to two percent of the market universe and that we can bet a part of those holdings run as they continue to grow in a very dynamic sense, but they`re limited to about 30, 35 percent of the portfolio.  But we do look for new names in that $1 billion to $3 billion cap size or the bottom one to two percent of the market universes.  We do look for the very high dynamic growth companies and that we would - we will hold onto our long positions if their prospects remain very, very dynamic. 

 LISOVICZ: Gene, I`m looking at the turnover rate that, for this year, is 15 percent roughly compared to a year ago.  It was about 68 percent compared to the year.  Before that was 110 percent.  Why such a big difference? 

 SIT:  Well, in 1998 we made a policy change and kind of update ourselves and said that instead of putting $1 limit on cap sizes, as the market rose in value we said, well, we always meant the bottom one or two percent. As the market doubled we`ve raised our limits in terms of the companies we would look at.  And that resulted in more turnover rate in 1998.  So, that was a policy change. 

 Typically, our turnover rate would be about 50 percent.  But our objective is to hang onto our winner with the belief that the company`s fundamentals remain sound.  We will be investors rather than traders. 

 TUCKER:  Gene, we got like 30 seconds left here, and I can`t let you get away without getting a pick from you, or at least a sector.  What`s your favorite sector or favorite stock? 

 SIT:  Well, I would say tending to three smaller ones that look like the best value today would be Millerpool (ph), Biosite and Neopuric (ph) Exploration (ph).  We feel basically natural gas is very, very cheap. Their position is very, very strong.  Biosite is in the diagnostic products area.  Millerpool is in both electronic tech and biotech, and those stocks are very attractive. 

 TUCKER:  Excellent.  Gene, thank you. 

 SIT:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  We`ve been speaking with Gene Sit.  He is the CEO and Fund Manager - as well as Chairman - of Sit Investment Associates. 

 LISOVICZ:  Doing very well this year to date. 

 Time for our weekly look inside Wall Street with "Business Week" magazine`s Jean Marciel. Each week, Jean chooses three stocks that are prime to move. First, let`s check how the stocks in last week`s column performed. 

 TUCKER:  In one week, Rent-Way was 11 1/2 percent.  International Speedway picked up some speed and gained better than 8.  And Beckman Coulter rang out 7 percent for the week. 

 And now onto this week`s stocks.  And here he is, ladies and gentlemen, Jean Marciel. 

 JEAN MARCIEL, BUSINESS WEEK:  Good morning. 

 TUCKER:  Welcome.  How are you?  Good to see you again.  You got a really diverse collection of stocks here today.  The one that kind of caught my eye, because I was listening to the weather report, was the water company. Seventy days without rain down in Dallas made me curious about water. 

 MARCIEL:  Yes. 

 TUCKER:  Why is it an investment though? 

 MARCIEL:  Water is everywhere.  Very few people know about investing in water stocks. And there`s not much information out there, but the gain is not in the fundamental gain.  It`s a takeover play because a lot of foreigners are buying all our water utility companies.  And there`s a wave of consolidation going on.  And one that I picked - my sources did - is American States Water.  It serves California and a lot of with their customers and then are in California, but they also have a unit, a water utility, in Arizona.  Now, this is one of the most undervalued water utility companies in the United States and it`s trading at about 1.4 book. And book value`s $18.  Deals - takeover deals in the water situation is from 2 1/2 to 3 times the book.  So, if you apply 2 1/2 book, it is worth $45, and I think it`s trading at ... 

 LISOVICZ:  It`s under $30. 

 MARCIEL:  Yeah. 

 TUCKER:  Under $30, yeah. 

 LISOVICZ:  Also, Jean, takeover interest is what attracts you to something in the oil sector.  And certainly there`s been a lot of activity there. 

 MARCIEL:  Oil and water usually don`t mix, but in my talent it does this time.  In - this is one of the major independent oil refiners and marketers.  And lot of the big guns in oil industry - in the oil industry are looking to increase their refining and could bring in store exposure in the United States.  And this Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, UDS on the big board, owns about 5,000 convenient stores.  And so, that`s a big asset. And companies like oil, that`s the number two - the second largest in the world.  And BP Amoco and TOTAL FINA.  They acquired Elf Aquitaine.  They are interested in - my sources say that they have been talking with Ultramar.  And at the price, they say, is - the bidding price is 35, but some analysts I spoke with that onto fundamentals alone this stock is worth 35 already. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Jean, we`re going to have to leave it at that. For those of you who want to know more about Jean`s picks, pick up a copy of "Business Week". 

 LISOVICZ: And the third stock was Current, by the way.  Something to look out for in the next week. 

 Straight ahead on IN THE MONEY, a major truck strike is brewing in Britain and France.  Phillip Coggin of the "London Financial Times" has the latest international business news. 

 TUCKER:  And today marks the final day of the United Nations Millennium Summit.  Prudence Solomon will be along with the latest on today`s talks plus all of the latest world and national headlines.  We`ll be right back. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 TUCKER:  All right, there you saw it.  Tokyo took a little bounce back from the blue chip stocks there, but mostly markets in Asia lower.  And it would look like the markets in Europe are going to close the day and the week on a down note as well.  Let`s check in with Phillip Coggin for the latest international business news.  He joins us from the "Financial Times" office in London. Welcome, Phillip. 

 PHILLIP COGGIN, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Welcome, Bill.  It`s been a bad day for European stock markets generally.  They started off on the down note, thanks to worries about corporate profits.  And then when Wall Street opened rather weakly, we`ve seen further losses. 

 It`s also been a turbulent day in Europe with more protests from the French truck drivers.  The head of one of the trucker`s unions called on the members to end the blockade.  However, the members have turned him down. 

 The second French trucker`s union has vowed to continue its blockade. They both want a 20 percent cut in fuel prices, and the government in France has said no more than 15.  And, of course, in the past the French governor`s always given in to these kinds of protests. 

 And meanwhile, in Britain we have also a protest.  There was an attempt to blockade a refinery by Welsh farmers.  And now, Lorri (ph) drivers are attempting to block one of the main roads between England and Scotland. My colleagues are disputing whether it`s England or Scotland which is going to be cut off from civilization as a result. But the fleet have rather wider powers in the U.K. than in France and they can probably put a stop to that protest. 

 TUCKER:  Well, I`m tempted to wait in on that argument, but I won`t. I`ll stay out of it.  We also have news that Mitsubishi`s chief has stepped down, prompting some action by Daimler-Chrysler. 

 COGGIN:  That`s right.  Daimler has been negotiating with Mitsubishi for some while about the size of the stake it`s going to take in the company and also its control.  There`s been this big scandal where Mitsubishi has admitted covering up the customer complaints for some 20 years. Now, it seems Daimler is parachuting in a new chief operating officer.  Several executives has taken a 34 percent stake in the company.  There was some talk about them taking more earlier in the week, but they`re not going to initially.  But they have negotiated down the price from $2.1 billion to $1.9 billion.  There`s a potential they could take over the rest of the company in about three year`s time. 

 There`s also some potential dispute with Volvo, because they`re in the trucker`s division. 

 TUCKER:  Very quickly here, Phillip, this is my favorite story this morning.  It has to do with the Germans warning Wal-Mart about low prices. Please explain. 

 COGGIN:  Yeah.  The Germans are worried about companies selling goods below cost.  They`ve warned Wal-Mart and two other German stores, Albi (ph) and Little that they`re charging a little too little for goods like flour and mild and worried that they`re trying to drive out some of the weaker retailers out of business.  And, of course, in their eyes if - what monopolies do is they drive out the weakest competitors and then they can push up prices later on.  But it`s obviously a bit strange to consumer`s ears. 

 TUCKER:  I bet it is.  Phillip, thank you very much.  We`ve been speaking with Phillip Coggin of the "Financial Times". 

 Well, now let`s get a quick check on world and national headlines. 

 LISOVICZ:  Including the last day of the United Nations Millennium Summit. For that and more we turn to Prudence Solomon.  Hello, Prudence. 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Susan, Bill.  Thank you. Hello, everyone. 

 It is indeed the final day of the historic United Nations Millennium Summit, but President Clinton has not yet closed the door on behind the scenes diplomacy.  He`s meeting with Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin.  For more now, we`re joined by CNN`s Major Garrett, who is in New York City. Hello, Major. 

 MAJOR GARRET, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Prudence.  And good morning. Yes, the meeting between President Clinton and President Jiang still going on at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.   A couple of very big issues on the platter, for the United States, at least.  Trying to talk to the Chinese about improving human rights and also about ending, or, at least, slowing down their export of technology and equipment used to make weapons of mass destruction.  Two reports this year casting a very unfavorable light on Chinese activities on that front.  The state department report released earlier this week showing religious prosecution up in China.  And a CIA report released a few months ago showing that China has increased sales of equipment in technology to emerging nuclear power such as Pakistan, two key issues on the table.  But it appears the Chinese have the upper hand because they`re enjoying very good relations with the United States. 

 The senate next week is expected to approve permanent normal trade relations with China.  And China, last week, won from - won something that it wanted from President Clinton for a good, long while, which is a delay in a decision on a deployment of a national missile defense system. 

 Prudence. 

 SOLOMON:  Major, the Clinton Administration comes to a close within the next two months or so.  What, if anything, significant has come out of these meetings that Clinton has had with various other leaders over the past three days? 

 GARRETT:  Well, Prudence, of course one of the big topics here was the Middle East peace process.  There`s no good news to report on that front. U.S. officials very discouraged in their talks with both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian Leader Yassir Arafat.  One area of encouragement for U.S. officials is there does seem to be a consensus among world leaders about changing the way the United Nations deals with peacekeeping.  A lot of very good and positive words about reforming that process as yet.  No money`s been put on the table.  That would, obviously, be the next step, something the president will push for in his waning days. 

 Prudence. 

 SOLOMON:  Thank you so much for joining us.  CNN`s Major Garrett reporting from New York City. 

 White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart will leave his post at the end of this month.  Lockhart took over the position two years ago from then press secretary Mike McCurry, during the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Lockhart will be replaced by Deputy Press Secretary Jake Seward. 

 The presidential race is extremely tight, according to new polls, as Republican George W. Bush hits the road today with his newly energized campaign.  Bush was in Warrendale, Pennsylvania factory a short while ago, pushing his social security plan.  He made good on his new promise to talk with voters, taking questions from factory employees. 

 Vice President Al Gore is in New Orleans today.  He`s scheduled to visit a community college at this hour to outline his plan on education and job training.  Gore wants to boost college attendance by making college tuition tax deductible and keeping interest rates low for student loans. 

 And those are the latest world and national headlines.  Susan and Bill, have a wonderful weekend. 

 LISOVICZ:  You as well, Prudence.  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  And it will get much better for those of us who were in New York over the weekend.  All of those people will be leaving.  The traffic will get much, much ... 

 SOLOMON:  They`re leaving.  Aren`t we happy? 

 TUCKER:  We`re glad and honored that they`re here, but, boy, it`ll be glad for them ... 

 LISOVICZ:  Stick to the west side of Manhattan in the meantime. 

 TUCKER:  Exactly.  Still ahead on IN THE MONEY, stocks are lower as we head onto into the afternoon. 

 LISOVICZ:  Greg Clarkin has a preview of some of today`s mover.  Greg, please, give us a quick look. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  It is.  We`re looking at a lot of companies are moving lower on profit warnings.  We also have a earnings tweaking, or a recommendation, change that is driving one credit card company sharply lower as well.  So, we`ll tell you all about that when we come back. 

 COMMERCIAL 

 LISOVICZ:  Let`s get a final check on some stocks moving the market this Friday morning with our stocks editor, Greg Clarkin. 

 CLARKIN:  Susan and Bill, they`re keeping an eye on shares of First Data all morning over at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.  The analyst there lowered the investment rating on First Data, which is a provider of credit card processing as well as shareholder services.  Now, the analyst there cut his price target on the stock $2.50 from $70 a share. He`s worried about basically, and he stresses this in his research note - he`s worried that consolidation among First Data`s banking customers will limit a revenue growth potential through the year 2000 and then possibly beyond that. So, he takes that down a bit and lowers the price target.  And that stock`s been weak all day. 

 Also wanted to tough again, if we can, on TRW.  We talked about this throughout this show.  The profit warning out of that company this morning - they were expected to earn $1.05 a share in earnings.  They will be somewhere 19 to 24 cents below that level.  And we did speak with the company a while back who said it`s just a variety - really, host of factors.  Ford also figuring into their statement to provide steering -suspension systems for the Explorers.  There are a couple of Ford plants were either treated (ph) or idled for a few weeks.  So, that is going to affect their bottom line. 

 Let`s look at National Discount Brokers, also out with a profitwarning due to soaring costs.  Their cost internally up 35 percent or so.  That stock has been losing ground, also pulling down a lot of the other online brokerage houses. 

 And, guys, let`s finish on a positive note.  J.P. Morgan, we`ve been following that stock. The rise of that stock goes up about $2 or so now. 

 LISOVICZ:  We`ve had $3 earlier today. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah. 

 CLARKIN:  Off about $3.  And news ... 

 TUCKER:  Who`s going to buy them now? 

 CLARKIN:  Nothing driving it out.  It`s just that everybody wants to get in there before somebody does actually make the announcement. Earlier this week, I believe - was it a German business magazine that had Deutsche Bank Alex Brown interested in them.  We`ve heard Chase as well.  And we all know this stock.   Folks are saying this is that real kind of jewel left on Wall Street. 

 TUCKER:  I mean, it`s worth looking at that chart that you have up beside your head there.  Because when we think at this point in takeover premium, we pretty much built into the stock. 

 LISOVICZ:  It`s pretty close to it. 

 CLARKIN:   That`s what you would have to expect at this point.  It was $110, I believe, back in July.  So that thing is just soars. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  Look at that.  It has just gone through the roof. It`s trading like at $160. 

 TRW`s interesting.  We didn`t throw a quote up on TRW because it`s one of those stocks that closed at around $45.  The news came out afterwards and dropped into the low 40`s.  So, it`s actually trading down about $2 roughly. 

 CLARKIN:  Wasn`t it about $43 and change. 

 TUCKER: Yeah. 

 CLARKIN:  Yeah.  OK.  Yeah.  Close to $45 and change.  And again, that`s just kind of a spillover from Ford affecting a lot of folks.  And again, TRW stressed to us that Ford isn`t their only problem.  It`s one of their problems.  And they provide airbag, suspension, braking systems and the like, a lot of it for the Explorer models.  So, when those plants are idled, it`s going to hit them. 

 LISOVICZ:  But, you know we`ve had a wave of earnings warnings this week and it`s being blamed for some of this sell off today.  So, I called First Call and just tried to get a quick check as to see what`s going on, is it greater. And they said, "No," and, in fact, watch out third week of September.  A lot of the tech companies, in particular, are back end loaded.  And so, you get a real sense of ... 

 CLARKIN:  OK.  You get a sense of what the quarter starts doing. 

 LISOVICZ:  ... whether the third quarter is really going to see that slide in profits that a lot of investors fear. 

 TUCKER:  And you`re right, it is worth noting.  We are coming inward the beginning of confession time.  So, all those companies that are a little shaky are going to come out and say it. 

 CLARKIN:  And we saw, I guess, the most back end loaded example we saw dramatic was Computer Associates.  Remember that?  I think like the last day or two or of their quarter came out with a bombshell profit warning. 

 The stock has never recovered. 

 TUCKER:  Never recovered as well.  Greg, have a great weekend. 

 CLARKIN:   Sure.  You too. 

 TUCKER:  I appreciate it. 

 CLARKIN:  Take care. 

 TUCKER:  And we got the Dow down some 60 points.  The Nasdaq down just about 80. 

 LISOVICZ:  But it`s off its lows, that`s for sure. 

 TUCKER:  And that`s the good (INAUDIBLE).  Have a good weekend. 

 LISOVICZ:  Bye-bye.

 UPDATE 6-Invensys shares slump to 5-year low on warning. 

 By Dan Lalor

 LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British automation and controls group Invensys Plc fell over a third in value on Thursday after a profit warning sent its shares to a five-year low and left a question mark over its future. 

 Invensys, which has been trying to reposition itself further up the high-tech engineering ladder, said its first-half performance would be "slightly down" on 1999 following second quarter trading below expectations. 

 As a result Invensys will shed two to three percent of its workforce - up to 3,000 jobs, mainly in Mexico and the United States - and accelerate an ongoing restructuring in what it called a "quick reaction to a short-term downturn". 

 Invensys Chief Executive Allen Yurko told reporters he had not been working on the plan for long. "It is a reaction to July and August's figures." 

 However, as Invensys's share price action suggested, not many were confident such a quick fix would work long term for the firm formed in early 1999 from the takeover of one British engineering concern, BTR by another, Siebe. 

 At the time Invensys set itself the goal of becoming the world leader in automation and controls. To that end, it embarked on a 1.8 billion pounds disposal programme to thin its industrial portfolio - notably automotive and polymers divisions - in favour of software and electronics acquisitions. 

 Invensys's share price closed 36 percent lower at 167-3/4 pence, just above an earlier 60-month low at 163 pence. The dive lopped around 3.6 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) off the company's market capitalisation. 

 "People are just throwing in the towel," said an analyst at a U.S. broker here. "Investors clearly feel this is a reaction not just to today's statements but to a feeling that has been around for a while." 

 PROBLEMS UNEARTHED 

 U.S.-based broker Merrill Lynch said Invensys had raised a number of key issues. "Concerns will focus on management credibility as well as the outlook for earnings. We think that the stock will take some time to recover from this." 

 It cut Invensys's intermediate-term rating to 'neutral' from 'buy' and long-term rating to 'accumulate' from 'buy'. 

 German Deutsche Bank cut its 2000 and 2001 earnings forecasts for Invensys by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively and repeated its view that Invensys's core automation and controls markets were not growing. 

 Deutsche also said the group's restructuring was not working, that its accounting policies needed re-alignment and the acquisition of Dutch software group Baan was unlikely to generate shareholder value. 

 Yurko said the acquisition of Dutch software firm Baan in July was not an issue. Baan was trading as forecast and 1,000 job cuts had nearly been completed. 

 Yurko pinned blame for some of the woes on dollar's strength versus the euro. "What we are seeing is price pressure. Our European competitors are on the right side of the euro." 

 Another problem facing Invensys was that expected recovery in its capital goods markets has not materialised, with oil and gas capital expenditure down a further three percent year-on-year. 

 The effect of an 11 percent year-on-year reduction in U.S. housing starts hurt the company's residential controls markets. 

 As a result, Invensys said it would make selected price increases and cut costs generally, aside from quickening the pace of restructuring throughout the group. 

 Around half the job cuts elsewhere announced on Thursday have been made already, Yurko said, adding the white-collar job losses involved would take longer to implement. 

 STILL A MARKET LEADER 

 But all was not doom and gloom. "On the plus side, key markets such as telecoms, IT and electronic equipment have remained very strong," Invensys said. Showing confidence in the company, Yurko said he had bought 20,000 shares. 

 Merrill Lynch said it believed Invensys remained a market leader in some attractive growth businesses, such as power systems, and its strategy would prove sound in the long term. 

 Invensys closed at 261 pence on Wednesday to value the company at 9.9 billion pounds. That close was in the bottom half of the year's prior 218-338 pence trading range and meant it had underperformed its sector by 43 percent at the time. ($1 = 0.6967 pound).

 S&P cuts A&P ratings to junk after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Thursday cut its credit and debt ratings for Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. , better known as A&P, to junk status from investment-grade after the supermarket company warned of lower-than-expected profits. 

 The downgrades came after Montvale, N.J.-based A&P, which runs more than 750 stores in 15 states and Canada, said on Wednesday it expects to lose 14 to 16 cents per share after charges in its fiscal quarter ending Sept. 9, compared to a profit of 14 cents a share in the same year-ago period. 

 Excluding the charges, A&P said it expected to earn 12 to 14 cents a share, compared to 45 cents a year ago. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected A&P to report a profit of 6 cents a share. 

 A&P's stock fell $1 in Thursday morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, to $13. It has fallen more than 50 percent this year, having closed Dec. 31 at $27-7/8. 

 S&P said its cuts for A&P's corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings to "BB," its second highest junk grade, from "BBB-minus," its lowest investment grade, reflected continued "disappointing operating results and cash flow protection measures, and a poor outlook for any near-term improvement." 

 A cut to junk status can raise corporate borrowing costs and force sales by investors not permitted to hold junk bonds. 

 S&P said A&P is missing its targets for same-store sales and for its new and acquired stores. The company said it expects overall and same-store sales to rise a respective 7 and 1.5 percent in its quarter ending Sept. 9 from the same year-earlier period. 

 On the other hand, A&P holds the No. 1 or No. 2 market position in four of its major markets, which account for 80 percent of its sales, S&P added. 

 A&P Chief Executive Christian Haub said Wednesday that "the retail food sales environment remains difficult" and won't improve for the rest of this year. 

 Two weeks earlier, No. 2 U.S. supermarket chain Albertson's Inc. also warned of lower-than-expected quarterly profits due to rising competition. 

 S&P said A&P's rating outlook is stable. 

 Though A&P earnings could again disappoint, "ample bank borrowing capacity, potential asset sales, and management's willingness to pare capital spending provide downside protection," S&P said. 

 "Earnings weakness should begin to be offset by benefits from the company's supply chain initiatives over the next couple of years," S&P added. 

 Another credit rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, rates A&P's senior unsecured debt "Ba1," its highest junk grade, and its bank loans one notch higher at "Baa3." Its rating outlook is negative. 

 Founded in 1859, A&P operates stores under the A&P, Dominion, Farmer Jack, Food Basics, Food Emporium, Kohl's, Sav-a-Centre, Super Fresh, Super Foodmart, and Ultra Mart trade names.

 ANALYSIS-Invensys crashes on road to new economy.

 LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - British automation and controls group Invensys turned from hunter to hunted on Thursday when a profit warning savaged its credibility in the market, wiping almost four billion pounds off its value. 

 Fund managers and analysts said an announcement that Invensys's first-half results would be "slightly down" on 1999 was the last straw and that the group's reinvention as a high-tech engineering company had failed. 

 "The company is now dead...It's now almost uninvestable for institutions," said one of Invensys's top 10 fund managers. 

 "One suspects that the situation is probably worse than they are actually saying...There is no possible catalyst to get this thing moving again, because no matter what they say people won't trust them." 

 And Invensys, which just last spring won a 714 million pounds agreed cash bid for Dutch software firm Baan, may now have to watch its own back, some said. 

 The group, formed last year by the merger between conglomerate BTR and automation firm Siebe, has good U.S. market share, especially in the potentially high-growth sector for controls systems - such as those that automate industrial plants or control the environments of buildings. 

 It could be attractive to some big U.S. rivals such as Honeywell and General Electric Co - especially since its market value fell more than a third to about six billion pounds, said John Hatherly, head of research at M&G Asset Management. 

 "If you were a big company with deep pockets, you might take the view that there are some good assets for sale here at a relatively cheap price and now's a good time to come in and buy it," Hatherly said. 

 "Six billion to some of the big US operators - considering Invensys has got meaty U.S. involvement - is pretty small stuff," he added. 

 NEVER TRULY CONVINCING 

 Invensys has had a hard time convincing investors that it has left behind its frumpy engineering peers and slipped into the sexier high-tech market. 

 Besides controls systems, it also makes complete power systems for telecommunications and information technology industries - sectors that are performing quite well. But the company's newly-formed software systems unit has been disappointing. 

 Moreover, while the company has slowly shed non-core assets in order to focus on automation and controls, some analysts have often warned the restructuring was not enough. 

 And, like many other UK manufacturers, it has been plagued by the strength of sterling. 

  "Today's profit warning confirmed our fears...the core 

  automation and control markets are ex-growth, restructuring is 

  not working..." Deutsche Bank said in a research note as it 

 provisionally cut its 2000 and 2001 earnings per share forecasts by 20 and 10 percent respectively. 

 The market has also not been convinced by the Baan purchase, saying Invensys faced an uphill battle to turn around a company that had reported losses for seven straight quarters. 

 SOME FAINT OPTIMISM 

 Despite the plunge in the shares, a few brokers have remained faintly optimistic about Invensys, saying the company's market share in some attractive growth businesses will enable it to pull through in the long term. 

 And Invensys's chief executive Allen Yurko showed his own confidence in the company, buying 20,000 shares. 

 But others maintained that a key reason to hold the stock could be to await a predator. "There could be more to come, but the limit to the downside is that they do have market share...and someone else might come in," Hatherly said.

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Utilities are up fractionally, and as we know, Bill, they`ve been hot. 

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  They have been, they`ve been as well.  They set a record yesterday but DuPont (URL: http://www.dupont.com/) , one of the stocks that Susan mentioned under pressure today. 

 It all comes down to basics, Christine Romans has more on that from the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Good morning, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Bill. 

 It has to do with raw materials.  And you know, when we heard from this company earlier this summer, they had said that raw material costs were going to be a problem but that they thought that they were going to meet expectations and now they`ve decided no; raw material costs are a little worse than they had expected.  And they also talk about the euro as well.  The euro continued to weaken in the period and  still looking pretty weak.  So higher natural gas and oil costs affecting DuPont and the company warning it will now see 2000 earnings per share of $2 85 or $2.95, that compares with the First Call estimate of $3.01 for the year. So we will continue to watch DuPont. 

 As you know, a Dow earnings warning can usually hit the blue chips pretty hard.  But the Dow actually rebounding a bit from its worst levels of the session.  Also watching United (URL: http://www.ual.com) , UAL is the ticker symbol. Merrill Lynch coming out and slashing its third quarter earnings per share estimate for the airline to 30 cents from $2, citing the company`s operational problem.  And it said UAL`s service disruptions are mainly benefiting America Air.  So still watching UAL.  Also, you know, fuel prices on the rise are not necessarily good news for these transport companies.  DLJ also cutting into 2000 earnings per share estimate for UAL to $6.85 from $7.90. 

 IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) also, Big Blue is in the Dow, trading higher. Today it unveiled a wireless notebook computer.   Sanford Bernstein maintaining its outperform rating and a 2000 price target of $1.55 - I`m sorry, $155 a share.  So these are all some of the movers that we are watching today with the Dow off of its worst levels of the session but still under water.  Back to you guys. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Christine,  thank you, Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 LISOVICZ:  We`ve got a different story at the Nasdaq marketsite, gaining back most of what it lost yesterday at this early stage in the session. 

 Charles Molineaux , there, monitoring all the action. 

 Hello, Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Susan. 

 We continue to see strength in these technology names.  We`ve got advancing issues picking up their strength over decliners.  They`re now leading by about a three to two margin.  And check out the composite, now up by 82 points at 4,095.  That is our session high.  So we do continue to see strength here.   Biotechnology stocks are putting in a pretty  dramatic run-up.   They are now up by four percent on the day. But all sectors are actually up, except for finance, insurance and transports, which actually were doing pretty nicely on the day yesterday when this market was selling off, go figure. 

 But check out Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) .  This, of course, is a story we`ve been keeping an eye on, now up by a dollar or 1 1/2 percent.  What a nice improvement that is.  After last night, we had - at a Robertson Stephens conference, Yahoo! CEO Tim Koogle told investors that the consolidation in dot.com advertising, with weaker on-line revenues, and keep Yahoo! from beating the market`s expectations any time soon.  The analysts at Lehman Brothers say they`re cautious after those comments.  But they`re confident Yahoo!`s near-term results are not at risk.   They say Koogle`s comments were misinterpreted, although they do expect Yahoo! will stay volatile until it can prove it`s ad model can evolve in this tough environment.  Volatile? look at what happened to Yahoo! after the close yesterday.  It fell down in the dumper then continued to sell-off in the morning.  And now we have the stock up again by 1 1/2 percent. 

 MP3.com (URL: http://www.mp3.com/) is now down by a dollar, 11 percent loss for that stock after it got  nuked by the judge in a whopper of a lawsuit.  Universal Music has been suing MP3.com, claiming it violated Universal`s copyright on the MP3 site.  Yesterday the judge in the case ruled that MP3.com willfully violated the copyright, and ordered to pay damages up to $205 million.  Meanwhile, look at Liquid Audio (URL: http://www.liquidaudio.com/) ; which provides software for music downloads.  It`s off by six percent.  And Musicmaker.com (URL: http://www.musicmaker.com/) , which does music downloads, although  it actually went out of its way to say its library is fully licensed and it provides for the payment of royalties, nonetheless, it`s off by 27 percent.  It`s one of the worst sellers on the Nasdaq today. Retek (URL: http://www.retek.com/) , meanwhile, is looking a lot happier, up by $6 or 19 percent.  It`s got a huge new deal with a huge customer, IBM.  Retek provides inventory management software that let`s retailers interact on the Internet.  It`s teaming up with IBM to market retail e-business solutions.  They figuring on generating a billion dollars by 2003. A look at the market now, up by 85 points at a new session high, 4,098, -- Susan, Bill. 

 LISOVICZ:  Charles Molineaux, at the Nasdaq marketsite. 

 TUCKER:  All right,  our next guest sees a split  personality in the Nasdaq, due to the recent analyst  downgrades of big tech companies names like Intel and  Micron Technology. 

 LISOVICZ:  But he says the fundamentals are sound and that will boost the market by the end of the year. 

 Donald Selkin, chief investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar, joins us now from the AMEX marketsite with  his market outlook. 

 Good morning. 

 DONALD SELKIN, JOSEPH GUNNAR:  Good morning. 

 LISOVICZ:  You think though, that at least in the immediate going, that the month of September will live up to its dubious history? 

 SELKIN:  Well, I`m not so sure, August, which is supposed to be a terrible month, actually did very, very well with the Nasdaq up 12 percent and Dow and S&P up six.  So far this month, the Dow has been up three days, the Nasdaq has been up one and down two going into today. So I would think that hopefully we can tread water which will launch us a good platform for a nice consistent rally later in the year. 

 TUCKER:  But tread water is exactly what the markets have done all year long so far, Donald.  I mean the Dow, pretty much right about where it began the year.  The Nasdaq also just now today getting --breaking back above levels where it began the year.  What`s going to give the market a reason to break out here, move higher? 

 SELKIN:  Well, I think the realization that the Fed does nothing. That`s universally accepted, especially  with that strong productivity number yesterday; also the consensus that perhaps the next move will be to the downside and -- on the interest rate front, and also the fact that technology earnings are expected to be up 35 percent in the coming third quarter.  And that should, you know, result in more days like today where you get these big sell-offs, you know, yesterday and Tuesday, and then you get nice snapbacks. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, and part of that snapback would be an opportunity to buy, right? you`re saying that some of your picks are precisely because they`ve been sold off? 

 SELKIN:  Absolutely. I mean, to me, you know, a psychiatrist would describe this market as schizophrenic.  You know, yesterday, the Dow way up, the Nasdaq way down, and today, the opposite.  You know, and you look at these stocks like Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) , Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) and NTAP (URL: http://www.netapp.com/) , the stocks with real good stories.  And then they get sold off irrationally.  And then sure enough, they`re all bouncing back  today.  So hopefully we can get more consistency once we get through the pre-announcement period and the earnings come in, especially on technology, better than expected. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, Donald Selkin, chief investment strategist at Joseph Gunnar, who sees bargains out there, thanks for joining us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  The big communications  speculation today comes from  AT&T Wireless (URL: http://www.attws.com/) . This cellular operation reportedly may be eyeing Nextel in a merger that would  create a wireless empire  flush with 18 million  subscribers. We decided to take a closer  look at AT&T Wireless as our  "Stock of the Day.". 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  On paper AT&T Wireless looks like a young company just its made debut on Wall Street in April. But in fact this company has roots dating back to  the infancy of  the cellular revolution. In  the earlier 1980s when  the FCC was granted license, it granted one to a  Washington state cable company executive named Craig Mccaw. Under  the conditions of that license, Mccaw built up a cellular company 

 and by 1987 established Mccaw Cellular Group. By 1992 Mccaw Cellular was a communication empire  that was so attractive to investors that AT&T bought a third of it for $2 billion. Part of that deal included changing the name to AT&T. Since then AT&T has acquired all of Mccaw`s Cellular  and has been building upon that franchise through other mergers and acquisition. Today in a US market dominated by Sprint (URL: http://www.sprint.com/) and Verizon (URL: http://www.verizon.com/) , the AT&T Wireless group holds 20 percent market share. In April AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) spun its division off as a tracking stock taking it public . AT&T Wireless opened around $29 a share peaked above 30 and has since retreated.

 TUCKER:  And today shares of AT&T Wireless are trading up modestly 5/16 at 25 13/16. All right. Now that you`ve heard  a little about AT&T Wireless , let`s  get an analyst`s outlook on  the company. We`re joined by Tim Burke of Edward Jones. And he  joins us now from his office  in St. Louis.  Tim, thank you for being here.  TIM BURKE, EDWARD JONES: Thank you for having me on. 

 TUCKER: I guess  arguably  an all Nextel Communications (URL: http://www.nextel.com/) combination of some sort makes a great deal of sense. It would make for certainly a much bigger AT&T Wireless. I think it would make them number two, wouldn`t it? 

 BURKE: It would make them number two. They would have 18 million, so they would only be behind Verizon Wireless. But we think there`s probably a lot of regulatory hurdles  that they will have to overcome to make that deal if it is in the works happen. 

 TUCKER:  Why? Making a rather huge assumption that they are in talks at all because neither company is commenting. But what would be potential regulatory problems? Certainly not that it would diminish competition. 

 BURKE: No. Well I think what we`ve seen the FCC with the WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) -Sprint (URL: http://www.sprint.com/) opinion that they came out that combining the number two and number 3 to still make number two is anti-competitive or not in  the consumer`s best interest. With wireless you are basically combining number 3 now and maybe number four or 5 depending on what day of week it is. But you are making them number two. So there still may be some anti-competitive concerns in the FCC. 

 TUCKER: Speculation aside you are not a big fan of - I think you have a rating  of hold  on the stock, right? . BURKE: That`s correct. We have a hold rating from the beginning mainly because we think it is fairly value at about $25 a share right now. 

 TUCKER:  This is a tracking stock, and people should keep that in mind when they`re taking a look at  the stock. 

 BURKE: Yes. exactly. It is a represents  the financial performance of the wireless industry but you do not have any legal claim on any of the asset of AT&T Wireless. 

 TUCKER: And if you were going to go in this sector and make a choice, this would not be the company you would buy, but I am curious. I have to ask you. Are there any in  the group that you do like? 

 BURKE: We have a strong buy  right now on Vodafone (URL: http://www.vodafone-airtouch-plc.com/) . It`s  my top pick. And  the eason we like is because  the wireless industry is adding a new customer every 2 seconds and companies like Vodafone and Sprint PCS (URL: http://www.sprintpcs.com/) another one of our recommendations, we really feel have both feet on accelerator. They are adding new customer. And now is the time to do that. We`re going to add 100 million new customer in the US in  the next 3 to 5 years. So we like companies like that with both feet on  the accelerator  rather than companies like AT&T Wireless right now who are kind of tapping  the brake, trying to save gas. 

 TUCKER: All right. Tim, thank you for your thoughts. Tim Burke with Edward Jones. Appreciate it. 

 BURKE: Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Joining us now are the  companies` CEO`s: Mark Hoffman, he is the  chairman and  CEO of Commerce One (URL: http://www.commerceone.com/) , and  Stephan Schambach, he is the CEO of INTERSHOP Communications . Gentlemen, welcome to the show. Thank you for being here. 

 MARK HOFFMAN, CEO, COMMERCE ONE: Thank you. 

 TUCKER: My first question goes to either one of you that feels like taking  this one on. You both expedite and facilitate e-commerce, but what does this merger and expanding of this alliance do for you and for your shareholders? 

 HOFFMAN: Well, I think that -- from the commerce one side, we`ve been focused on the buy side of the equation creating buy side applications, market exchanges. And Stephan and INTERSHOP has been focused on the sell side of the equation, how do you help companies sell better. And so we`ve brought those now two solutions together to form an end to end solution from the buyer to the seller. And the result of that will be that it will save buyers and suppliers money. And they`ll both get a significant return on investment out of it. 

 LISOVICZ: So let me expand upon that question. Stephan, I was going to ask you, this is a relationship that already exists. You`re expanding upon it and it`s all about simplicity. Can you give me an example of how this will benefit, say, the customer. I know that Shell (URL: http://www.shell.com/) Oil -- Shell Chemical Company is something that you`ve used in one of your release. Can  you explain this? 

 STEPHAN SCHAMBACH, CEO, INTERSHOP: Absolutely. See, marketplaces only function if enough suppliers are being connected to them and if they upload content and can transact automatically. In the past they had to do this in a cumbersome way. They had to integrate manually and that would  take very long. Also they already had or they wanted to have an electronic commerce initiative on their own. With this partnership and with the technology behind it that would we developed, we are enabling all the suppliers to use a single platform to sell in multiple ways both directly on the Internet and through exchanges as well. 

 TUCKER: Mark, I`m sorry to be sounding like I`m struggling with this, but I am and I understand it`s a buy and say sell side. Is part of this arrangement and expansion of a joint venture the fact that you`re facilitating hooking up the sellers with the would-be buyers? Is that what you`re doing in this?  HOFFMAN: Right. Let me give you an example of the exchange like the automobile exchange. So you have the big three automakers participating there, but --so you`ve got GM (URL: http://www.gm.com/) , Chrysler (URL: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com) and they have literally thousands. And GM alone has 33,000 suppliers. And so how do you get them connected  up to the system to be able to transact with them and  create liquidity within the system? And so in the case of Intershop, they go in and sell a side solution. So it allows the supplier not only to sell better to their own customers, but then to also connect up to the buy side. So we`ve integrated that interface to make it simple, easy to do instead of taking days or weeks. Now it will take hours to be able to plug in to somebody that`s already Intershop-enabled to plug in any one of the exchanges that we have. 

 SCHAMBACH: More generically speaking, in the past 15, 20 years, companies focused on automating internal business processes through the introduction of European systems. And now electronics commerce allows for the very first time to automate -fully automate the external business processes so that they can compete from an efficiency standpoint  with the internal ones. And this alliances back this dream come true for the very first time. There`s no one else who has this today. 

 TUCKER:  Gentlemen, thank you for being here to explain it. I think I understand it a little bit better as well. Mark Hoffman of Commerce One and Stephan Schambach of Intershop. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 LISOVICZ:  And this alliance makes this dream come true for the very first time.  There is no one else who has this today. 

 TUCKER:  Gentlemen, thank you for being here to explain it ... 

 LISOVICZ:  I think so. 

 TUCKER:  ... a little bit better as well. 

 LISOVICZ:  It`s all about ... 

 TUCKER:  It is.  Mark Hoffman of Commerce One and Stephan Schambach of INTERSHOP. And it`s worth noting that - I can`t quote you Stephan`s company.  Stephan`s company trades on the Neurmarket, so I can`t get a quote.  But Commerce One is trading up 4 7/8. 

 LISOVICZ:  That`s a good pop. 

 TUCKER:  So, the market`s clearly happening. 

 Coming up in the next half hour.  Dow component, Dupont, issued an earnings warning this morning, and shares are under pressure. 

 LISOVICZ:  And other blue chips, well, they`re under pressure as well today.  We`ll talk with Larry Pulia, mutual fund manager of T. Rowe Price, to find out which blue chips he favors when IN THE MONEY returns. Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  All right, the lady in the harbor.  A nice day here in New York. Wouldn`t you figure, in the middle of the week?  Gorgeous, gorgeous weather.  Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I`m Bill Tucker. 

 LISOVICZ:  And I`m Susan Lisovicz.  Let`s take a check on the markets. We`ve got a two-way streak going on.  The Dow under pressure today, especially from Dupont after its earnings warning, but J.P. Morgan also giving back some of its recent gains.  And the Nasdaq, well, it`s gaining most of its losses from yesterday, up 80 - nearly 85 points. And that is a percentage gain of more than two percent. 

 For a closer look, we have Christine Romans at the New York Stock Exchange and Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq MarketSite.  Let`s talk with Christine first.  Hello, Christine. 

 CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Susan.  Well, you hit the nail right on the head.  Traders here are talking about what a sleek market.  And it`s been this way for a couple of days now. They say withered techs, the other direction goes blue chips, and that`s a risk that is holding, at least for now. 

 One that they`re talking about is the fact that the financials are also acting a little sickfully here, especially J.P. Morgan coming off of those gains that it saw yesterday.  But we looked within the financials.  It looks like not a great performance.  In the meantime, you`ve got the chips doing very, very well.  And there are folks down here have been saying they want to see the leadership together between the chips and the financials.  They want to see both of those groups helping lead these markets back into that territory that they need to see on the upside and start breaking out into new ground.  Also, they`re pointing out that as volume grows direction in this market is starting to wane.  One market analyst telling me that take a look at the volume yesterday at the big board.  It was almost a billion shares, yet the Dow was up just modestly.  And today, you`re seeing volume right now at 11:30 in the morning at 392 million, a little better than we`ve been seeing in the month of August.  Yet the market is still down about 28 points and has been waffling around.  It had been in positive territory.  Had been down as many as 85 points.  So, they`re saying even though you`ve got this money that seems to be moving back into the market, as everyone said it would, they`re not getting a lot of conviction about where exactly that money appears to be going.  So, that`s concerning a few people. 

 In the meantime, we`ve got the Dow down 26 points at 11,284. 

 For a look at things over at the Nasdaq, which is the other side of that slipped market, we bring in Charles Molineaux.  Hey, Charles, what`s going on there? 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Christine.  We`re looking at a continued improvement for tech stocks today.  We saw two days of steep sell offs, and today, the rally just keeps on coming. We`re at a new session high of 4,101 right now, up by 88 points.  So, this market has finally decided that it wants to get back into business again. 

 Look at what`s happened over the course of the session, because we started off with a nice rally.  OK, we lost a little ground, but never left  positive territory.  We were up at 4,035 here and then continued finding new session highs until we`re at a new one right now.  And the strength of biotech stocks now up by four 1/2, almost, percent. Computer stocks are up by about 3.  Telecom stocks up by 1 1/2.  Chip stocks, after falling off yesterday, are now better than 3 percent.  And we`re looking at even Internet stocks, which, of course, have gotten beaten up, are still looking at a decent gain of more than 1 percent on the day today as well. So, we`re looking at a rally going on pretty much across the board.  Advancing issuers outnumber decliners by about a nine to eight margin.  And volume here is 670 million shares traded. 

 Bill. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Charles.  Thank you. 

 Let`s talk a little bit more about Dupont. The chemical manufacturer, Dupont, today issuing an earnings warning, lowering its year 2000 estimates between $2.85 a share and $2.95 a share.  Research firm first call estimates for a profit of $3.01 a share.  The company blames higher energy and raw material cost and a weak euro.  Dupont stock has been declining steadily over the past year, down 29 percent. Meanwhile, Campbell`s Soup reported quarterly earnings today in line with forecast, but then issued its own warning.  The company made $59 million, or 14 cents a share, in the fourth quarter.  However, that was down from 28 cents a share in the same period a year ago.  Campbell`s also said its profit for the next quarter will come in somewhere between six to eight cents below expectations.  Analysts had been anticipating a profit of 53 cents a share there.  Says significant increases of marketing investments will dampen bottom line results. 

 LISOVICZ:  In today`s mutual fund segment, we`re dealing with blue chips. In the last year, the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund significantly outpaced the S&P 500 Index, climbing 21 percent.  The fund`s manager attributes the fund`s performance to the quality of its holdings.  Companies like Pfizer, Citigroup, Cisco Systems, GE and Corning have been sustaining the fund`s long-term growth and make the fund attractive for retirement investors. 

 Larry Pulia, a fund manager of the Blue Chip Growth Fund since 1993, joins us now from his office in Baltimore, Maryland with his pick of the blue chip.  Welcome and congratulations.  You`re beating the markets handily, certainly year to date.  S&P`s only up two percent, your fund up 12 1/4 percent.  What`s your investment philosophy? **8  LARRY PULIA, FUND MANAGER, T. ROWE PRICE:  Well, we, over  time, have really focused on a strategy of emphasizing companies with leading market position, seasoned management and strong financial fundamentals, principally higher return on equity.  We think if we get those three criteria right we`ll find companies with durable, sustainable earnings per share growth.  That allows us to have lower turnover and hold these wealth-creating stocks over a longer period  of time. 

 TUCKER:  Larry, I got a portfolio management question for you.  I`m sure there isn`t a day that goes by you don`t thank somebody for Corning (URL: http://www.corning.com/) being in there.  But being up as much as it is, how do you decide what to do with the stock? Do you start to unload part of it?  Or, how do you manage a stock like that when  it gets so out in front of everybody else? 

 PULIA:  Well, I think that that`s one of the big challenges in this market. The market`s done very well.  The month of August was a great month, and it`d be normal to see the market consolidate in here.  But specifically on the subject of Corning and other big winners, what we try to do is really evaluate the risk return trade off.  For Corning, the estimates are around $4 for next year, but we actually think they can earn maybe $4.50.  And we actually look out to year 2002 and beyond and we think the company could earn perhaps over $6 in the year 2002. So, with the stock in here at about $320, we make a judgment that it`s trading about 55 times the 2002 estimate. And to us, that still looks reasonably attractive.  We`re not averse to trimming holdings, though, that have run up dramatically and where we feel the risk-return trade off is not quite as attractive.  So, as you inferred, it`s really a balancing act to try to not sell winners too soon but not over stay our welcome in companies who might have deteriorating fundamentals. 

 LISOVICZ:  Larry, your fund is really focused on - for retirement. These are long-term investments.  But I`m looking at your top 10 holdings, half of them are tech stocks.  Do you see any sort of trouble there between the two, given the volatility that we`ve seen in that sector? 

 PULIA:  We`ve been quite concerned about the valuations in technology over time, and we think that that makes it imperative to really find the companies that have very, very solid fundamentals.  Our fund currently has about 35 or 36 percent in technology, which is roughly an S&P type weighting in technology.  So, we`re not betting the farm, so to speak, on technology.  However, we think it`s important not to underestimate the long-term earnings growth of companies like Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) . Cisco, for example, in the most recent quarter have reported revenue growth of 61 percent, and the stock`s trading at about 63, 64 times what we think it will earn next year.  And so, while there are plenty of 

 risks to the Cisco story, we think they will continue to compound earnings at a very strong rate and we don`t think that stock is really priced egregiously above its historical level in the market. 

 LISOVICZ:  Well, the last two years you`ve done real well, up nearly 29 percent.  Larry Pulia, Blue Chip Growth Fund Manager at T. Rowe Price. Thank you so much for joining us. 

 PULIA:  Thank you for having me. 

 TUCKER:  Well, still ahead, Philip Coggin of the "London Financial Times" explains why Invensys has issued profit warnings.  And just what exactly what Invensys is? 

 LISOVICZ:  I`m glad you tackled that one.  Plus, it`s day two of the U.N. Summit in New York.  Prudence Solomon has the lowdown on today`s events, plus all the latest world and national headlines when IN THE MONEY returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Well, all right, it is time now for a quick check on world and national news headlines. 

 LISOVICZ:  Including some of today`s behind the scenes meetings at the U.N. Millennium Summit.  For that and the rest of the day`s news we turn to Prudence Solomon.  Good morning. 

 PRUDENCE SOLOMON, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Thanks, Susan.  Good morning, Susan and Bill.  Good morning, everyone. 

 The second day of the U.N. Millennium`s Summit is under way, and international issues dominate President Clinton`s agenda today. That follows behind the scenes meetings yesterday to give Mid East peace back on track.  CNN`s Richard Roth is at the U.N. with more.  Good morning, Richard. 

 RICHARD ROTH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Prudence. President Clinton with met with Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia - the president said he fears the high cost of oil could lead to a recession, meanwhile, in the roaring U.S., and he`s asked the Saudi`s to help lower crude prices.  President Clinton`s also meeting with leaders of South Korea and Turkey.  Meanwhile, there are speeches going on inside the general assembly, but while the leaders are appearing on the roster there they`re also holding closed door, so called round table, discussions, working out the nitty gritty, the details, on their closing millennium declaration.  That declaration will have a lot of promises.  It may be years or months to see whether they live up  to their challenge of lowering poverty and reducing the drastic AIDS epidemic, especially in Africa.  One of the speakers of the general assembly today, South Africa`s president, who warned that none of the leaders can forget the living whose mandates have given the leaders the privileged possibility to speak from the podium. 

 "Billions among the living struggle to survive in conditions of poverty, of deprivation and underdevelopment.  As offensive to everything humane as anything would decry about the second millennium. The poor of the world stand at the gates of the comfortable mansions occupied by each and every king and queen or president or prime minister or minister, privileged to attend this unique meeting.  The questions these billions - the questions this billions ask is, `What are you doing, you in whom we have placed our trust?  What are you doing to end the deliberate and savage violence against us, but everyday, sentences many of us to a degrading and unnecessary death?`" 

 And, of course, perhaps to the weary eyes of international monetary organizations and some of the richer countries, many of the poor and developing countries hear their leaders are again asking for debt relief, saying this is a major way they could perhaps get out of poverty and help the U.N. hits these targets. 

 Richard Roth, CNN, reporting live at the United Nations Millennium Summit. 

 SOLOMON:  Richard, thank you so much. 

 Republicans will try to override President Clinton`s veto of the estate tax bill today, but GOP leaders concede they may fall short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.  Still, Republicans hope the move will highlight their commitment to tax cuts. 

 In the race for the White House, Texas Governor, George W. Bush, is talking about military readiness and how he`d lead as commander in chief.  Bush says the Clinton-Gore administration has failed to modernize the military.  He was supported by retired General Colin Powell at a veteran`s rally in Michigan.  Powell says the Clinton Administration paints  a distorted view of the U.S. military. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 COLIN POWELL:  They want to play "let`s pretend".  They want to let`s pretend that junior officers are not leaving at an alarming rate, that if you go to the infantry school at Fort Benning you won`t find the highest attrition rate among captains that we`ve seen in decades. They want to play let`s pretend that our aircraft operating levels are at an acceptable level and haven`t been dropping precipitously in recent years. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 SOLOMON:  Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore is expected to pick a major endorsement from the Teamster`s Union today, even though Gore`s position 

 on free trade is not popular with many union leaders.  Gore is also challenging his Republican opponent to clarify the specifics of his economic plan.  He`ll make a campaign stop in Pennsylvania today. 

 The number one tennis player in the world, Andre Agassi, has withdrawn from the Olympics.  The defending gold medallist notified the U.S. Tennis Association yesterday that he would not go to the Sydney Olympics, citing personal reasons.  Agassi disclosed a few weeks ago that both his mother and sister have been diagnosed with breast cancer. The defending U.S. Open champion was eliminated in the second round, and that`s quite sound.  Don`t you think? 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  And quite understandable as well. 

 SOLOMON:  Yeah, absolutely.  He`d want to spend some time with his family. 

 TUCKER:  Get the priorities straight. 

 SOLOMON:  Absolutely. 

 TUCKER:  Thank you, Prudence. 

 SOLOMON:  Thank you. 

 LISOVICZ:  Prudence Solomon.  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  You know, one story we do need to mention and we should talk about, because we mentioned at the beginning of this show, and that is the developments at the Justice Department today.  Attorney General Reno today saying that she would act upon a request from the ranking Democrat and the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is Senator Patrick Leahy out of Vermont.  And the Justice Department is reviewing whether they should be pursuing criminal or civil ... 

 LISOVICZ:  Or civil. 

 TUCKER:  ... charges against Bridgestone/Firestone. 

 LISOVICZ:  This story after 13 hours of testimony yesterday makes it completely unclear yet who is to blame behind this. 

 TUCKER:  One thing that is ... 

 LISOVICZ:  So much being reported ... 

 TUCKER:  ... clear is - exactly right, there was a lot of finger pointing going back and forth, and obviously passions are running very intense in this particular case.  Now, previously the Justice Department said they were not looking at NHTSA - the National Highway Safety and Traffic Administration - but they are also going to be looking at where was NHTSA in all of this and why didn`t they get involved sooner. 

 LISOVICZ:  Well, that is a story, obviously, that we will continue to monitor.  And, unfortunately, it`s probably going to go on for some time to come. 

 Now, we`re going to switch our attention overseas.  You saw before with our screens, it was a mixed performance there.  We have profit warnings.  We have mergers.  We had the euro heading south.  And in London to talk about all of those things is Philip Coggin of the "Financial Times". Hello, Philip. 

 PHILIP COGGIN, FINANCIAL TIMES:  Hello.  Yes, as you say, we had a bit of a mixed day on Europe.  IN the end, most markets finished higher, thanks to technology stocks rebounding, of course, with the help of the Nasdaq.  But we saw some big losses in chemical stocks, of course, in back of the Dupont warning.  The biggest single casualty of the day in Europe is a company called Invensys, which was formed for the merger by BTR & Siebe.  That share is down 36 percent on a profits warning.  It`s blaming the strong dollar against the euro.  It`s blaming the weak U.S. housing market.  And it`s going to lay off 3,000 workers, mostly in the U.S. and Mexico on the back of that profits warning.  This is a company that has disappointed the market several times before. And clearly, the market lost all patience with this and has marked shares down extremely heavily. 

 But on the merger front, we have got the creation of the second biggest Internet Service Provider in Europe.  That`s from the merger of Tiscoli (ph), an Italian company, and World Online, which is based in the Netherlands.  World Online was a company that floated earlier this year. 

 Its float turned out to be a disaster as it turned out the chairman had sold some shares just before flotation in a brink.  She had to resign. And the shares have languished ever since below the offer price. So, this merger will consolidate the ISP sector.  T Online, the subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, is by the far the biggest.  It`s clear there are not many ISPs going to be profitable in Europe. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK.  Philip Coggin at the "Financial Times" in London. Thank you for joining us. 

 Still ahead on IN THE MONEY, stocks on the move.  David Haffenreffer will be here with this morning`s movers. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  CMGI (URL: http://www.cmgi.com/) announcing a little bit of a corporate restructuring today, and the market selling the stock down a couple of bucks anyway.  Not too excited. 

 LISOVICZ:  Not hurting the Nasdaq. 

 TUCKER:  No, not putting a dent in those gains, is it?  Let`s get an update  on some of the movers in the market this morning from our stocks editor of the day, David Haffenreffer.  David. 

 DAVID HAFFENREFFER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  That`s for sure.  Wasn`t your stock supposed to go up when you announce a restructuring? 

 TUCKER:  That`s what I thought.  That`s what ... 

 HAFFENREFFER:  Unless the street thinks it hasn`t gone low enough. 

 TUCKER:  That`s right.  Absolutely. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  This is a story about how it helps when IBM is in your court right here.  IBM is sort of broadening an alliance that it has with a company called Retek, which is a Nasdaq traded company.  RETK - Retek - makes software for the retailing industry.  As you know, IBM makes a lot of hardware so that, together, they sell the hardware and software for a lot of back office things for the retail industry, like electronic business software and hardware. They do Retek`s planning, forecasting, customer relationship management -that sort of thing. Well, now they`re broadening it and IBM is going to wind up increasing its Retek dedicated staff to more than 300 people.  That is up from just 60.  IBM also investing in Retek, which is why we do have Retek shares higher by better than 6 points thus far in today`s session.  IBM shares also up just a bit.  And IBM shares, just in case you`ve been holding it for the past year, you`re losing a little bit of money.  The stock is actually down about 4/10 of one percent. 

 LISOVICZ:  But it looks like it`s on the rebound. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  Yes. 

 TUCKER: Yeah. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  They have been looking great of late, but again, over the past year they`re down a little bit. 

 TUCKER:  Retek - also it`s worth noting not only 6 1/2 points higher. It`s also very actively traded, so a lot of people jumping in on this bandwagon vis--vis ... 

 HAFFENREFFER:  A Nasdaq reporter on that one. 

 TUCKER:  IBM.  That`s right. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  Also, PECO Energy today.  DLJ has upgraded the company to its top pick.  This from a buy recommendation.  So, that`s pretty nice, isn`t it?  This based on the near term closing of its merger with Unicom Corporation.  PECO is a utility, serving about 1 1/2 electricity and 400,000 natural gas customers in Pennsylvania.  And they`ve also increased their target price from $55 all the way up to between $59 and $60 a share.  So, PECO Energy.  Ticker symbol PE on the New York Stock Exchange.  Doing quite nicely. 

 TUCKER:  Well, and the utilities, as we keep noting over and over again, have been at record highs.  In fact, they`re edging up - well, last time I looked they were at record highs as well today. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  Utilities have had a great year this year. 

 TUCKER:  They have. 

 LISOVICZ:  They`ve also very active, given all the deregulation. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  They`ve had a very active and great year this year. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, you. 

 TUCKER:  I can`t remember (ph) existing (ph) groups.  Oh yeah, that too. 

 Absolutely. 

 HAFFENREFFER:  I`m very agreeable. 

 TUCKER:  He is agreeable. 

 You know, the markets today have not been necessarily agreeable to all. We have the Dow Jones Industrial Average currently trading down for a change, but maybe with some perspective that makes some sense. 

 LISOVICZ:  Some modest losses, but ... 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, they`re modest losses.  We`ve seen some ... 

 LISOVICZ:  ...  the Nasdaq gaining strength after its three percent loss yesterday, and getting some help from Intel, which was one of the big losers yesterday. 

 TUCKER:  We`ve got Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) also moving $1 higher as well.  So, technology back in favor, at least for the day. 

 LISOVICZ: For the day. 

 TUCKER:  That does it for today`s edition of IN THE MONEY. Thanks for watching.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Mexican stocks rallied Thursday, boosted by news that the country's largest telecommunications company is planning a major spin off. But elsewhere in the Americas, Canadian shares fell in Toronto. 

 European markets closed mostly higher, supported by gains among oil shares and encouraged by a recovery in technology stocks on Wall Street. 

 The tech-sector tumble in New York Wednesday pulled Asian markets lower earlier Thursday, with Tokyo stocks falling for the eighth straight day. Shares also fell in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. 

 Telefonos de Mexico announced late Wednesday that it would spin off its cellular business and international assets into a new company. That company is expected to have a future value of $37 billion, equal to its parent's current worth. 

 In Mexico City Thursday, the IPC index surged 163.58 points, or 2.4%, to 6953.31. Telmex L shares rose 6.8%, while the company's A shares gained 7.3%. Shares of its holding company, Telecom A1, added 8.1%. 

 Investors, who had recently punished Telmex for its poor earnings results, were happy with the spinoff news. Traders said the news also renewed interest in the Mexican telecom sector and the market as a whole. 

 "Now we'll be able to see how much hidden value there was in Telmex," said Cesar Murillo, a trader at Valores Finamex in New York. "And we'll see how much value will be released with this move." 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index also provided support to the Mexican market, climbing 2.1% after plunging 3% in the previous session. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.5%. 

 Elsewhere in Latin America, main stock indexes climbed 1.2% in Caracas, Venezuela and 0.2% in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Brazilian financial markets were closed for a holiday Thursday. 

 But Canadian stocks closed lower. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index dropped 89.04 points, or 0.8%, to 11061.63. 

 Overall, nine of the TSE's 14 stock groups fell. The pipeline group was the biggest loser, down 2.9%. In the group, TransCanada Pipelines dropped 3.8% and Westcoast Energy, another pipeline operator, fell 3.5%. 

 Gordon Higgins, vice-president of Canadian equities for Elliot and Page Ltd., attributed the sell-off in the pipeline group and other interest-rate-sensitive sectors to concerns over the possibility of rising rates due to soaring energy prices. 

 In Paris, the CAC-40 index rose 37.67 points, or 0.6%, to close at 6834.46. 

 Frankfurt's Xetra Dax closed up 40.32 points, or 0.6%, at 7373.34. 

 But in London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index slipped 5.5 points, or 0.1%, to finish at 6689.2. The market shrugged off news that the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee left its key interest rate unchanged, a decision that had been widely expected. 

 The FTSE 100 was weighed down by a 36% tumble in shares of Invensys, after the company warned that its second-quarter sales were below forecasts and it expects to cut 2,000 to 3,000 jobs. Merrill Lynch downgraded shares of the British automation conglomerate to intermediate-term "neutral" from "buy" and to long-term "accumulate" from "buy." 

 Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers, described Invensys' profit warning as a "falling knife" that investors should avoid, adding that, "We would be very wary of trying to catch a falling knife." 

 Oil stocks in Europe gained on continued strength in crude-oil prices, which traded at their highest levels in 10 years. Analysts say any production increase by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is unlikely to ease prices, at least in the short term. OPEC ministers meet in Vienna Sunday, where members are widely expected to lift output quotas by at least 500,000 barrels a day. 

 In London, BP Amoco peaked at a gain of 25 pence, before retreating to end up 4.5 pence, or 0.7%, at 661.5 pence. Shell closed up 10 pence, or 1.7%, at 616 pence. 

 Among a weak telecom sector in Europe, British Telecommunications dropped 2%, Deutsche Telekom fell 1.7% and France Telecom slipped 0.1%, 

 Elsewhere, main stock indexes rose 0.5% in Milan, 0.4% in Madrid, 0.3% in Stockholm and 0.1% in Zurich. But stocks finished little changed in Amsterdam. 

 The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell 0.53 point, or 0.1%, to 400.76. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in countries that joined the single currency, rose 0.59 point to 443.04. 

 Several stocks rose as they are viewed most likely to gain from increased portfolio weightings when the Dow Jones Stoxx indexes move to free float weightings after the close Sept. 15. Individual companies will be assigned weightings that reflect the actual number of shares investors can buy and sell, rather than the number of shares issued. 

 Danone, seen as a strong gainer from the reweightings, climbed 4.2%, while Alcatel, Royal Dutch Petroleum, and TotalFina Elf, set to also see their index weightings increase, were also higher. 

 In Asia, Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 99.41 points, or 0.6%, to close at 16300.46, its longest losing streak since August 1998. Over the past eight trading sessions, the Nikkei has lost 880.66 points, or about 5.4%. 

 The Nikkei's decline was led by selling in technology issues, including Fujitsu and NEC. Technical factors also weighed down stocks. 

 In Hong Kong, profit-taking in the real-estate sector and weakness in telecom stocks undermined strength in banking and financial shares. The Hang Seng index fell 173.28, or 1%, to 17431.95 points, with the property subindex dropping 2%. 

 In Taipei, Taiwanese shares fell more than 2% in the wake of Wednesday's 3% plunge in the Nasdaq and amid concerns about global demand for computers and chips, analysts said. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange tumbled 179.85 points, or 2.4%, to close at 7430.93. 

 In Seoul, South Korean shares plunged amid heavy selling in semiconductor shares and program-led selling, analysts said. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi, fell 20.32 points, or 3%, to close at 656.37.

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR: Tonight on MONEYLINE: a third day of divergence on Wall Street. 

 But today it was technology stocks that shined, while blue chips faltered. We`ll tell you how spiking oil prices are playing in this market. 

 The Justice Department steps into the crisis that led to a historic tire recall. Could Firestone and Ford (URL: http://www.ford.com/) face criminal charges? 

 And our "MONEYLINE Road Trip" hits Exodus Communications: Willow Bay goes inside a high-security oasis for the servers powering top Web sites. We`ll meet the chief executive who possesses a rare commodity in Silicon Valley: experience. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Tonight, coast to coast, reporting from the world financial capital, New York, and Silicon Valley, here`s Stewart Varney and Willow Bay. 

 VARNEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. I`m Stuart Varney in New York with all the day`s business news. 

 And Willow, tonight, is in Woodside,California -- Willow. 

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR: Stuart, our West Coast road trip continues, coming to you from inside the Filoli Mansion. 

 It was built with money from the California Gold Rush of the 1800s. Appropriate, we thought, for our look tonight at the high-tech gold rush taking place here in Silicon Valley today. 

 We have a special report on the boom in biotech. And we`ll go inside Exodus (URL: http://www.exodus.net) Communications: a high-flying company that hosts some of the biggest sites on the World Wide Web. 

 But first, let`s go back to Stuart for a look at what happened in the markets today -- Stuart? 

 VARNEY: All right, thank you, Willow. 

 The buyers were back on Wall Street today, but they were not looking for blue chips like they have been all week, oh no. Today, technology stocks benefited from bargain hunting, while the Dow industrials suffered from the big drops in two stocks: DuPont (URL: http://www.dupont.com/) and J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) , accounting for all of its more than 50-point loss. 

 The Dow finished the day at 11259, off its worst levels of the day. Volume on the Big Board close to a billion shares. 

 The Nasdaq composite erased some of its two-day, 220-point drop. The index ran up 85 points to close at 4098. The volume there: 1.6 billion shares. 

 Big names that have taken it on the chin this week bounced back: Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , for example, rose 1 3/4, and Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) up two points. Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) gained more than six on positive analyst comments, and the stock closed near its all-time high. 

 Commerce One (URL: http://www.commerceone.com/) rocketed more than 7 3/4 after it said it will expand an alliance with INTERSHOP Communications. Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) lost more than five after its chief executive Tim Koogle said advertising revenue will be hurt by the dot-com shakeout. 

 But, the overall strength in technology boosted the S&P 500 back above that 1,500 mark. 

 Terry Keenan has been watching the market action right from her perch at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 She joins us now -- Terry. 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, we haven`t heard much about the tug of war between the new economy and the old economy stocks here lately, as the Dow has outperformed the Nasdaq over the last six months. 

 But that was exactly what was on the minds of traders here today, as the soaring price of oil sparked worries about the profit fallout on  many of the old economy names. Those fears sent the traders rushing back into the silicon-driven names after two days of brutal selling that took the Nasdaq down 5 percent. 

 I can tell you there was a big sigh of relief here when the Nasdaq managed to hold on to that 4000 level, which is still considered a big psychological support. 

 In addition to those Nasdaq winners you just mentioned, Stuart, we also had heavy buying in Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) , Apple Computer (URL: http://www.apple.com/) , QUALCOMM (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) , Ariba (URL: http://www.ariba.com/) and Read-Rite (URL: http://www.readrite.com/) - that company getting funding for a new fiber-optics venture from Integral Capital Partners. 

 And the positive sentiment on the Nasdaq spilled over to the big biotechs as well. Amgen (URL: http://www.amgen.com/) snapping back today, analysts making some positive comments about testimony in its ongoing patent infringement trial. That trial is expected to finally wrap up in a couple of weeks. Things looking good for Amgen, there. Also to the upside: Biogen (URL: http://www.biogen.com/) , Genzyme (URL: http://www.genzyme.com/) , Gilead (URL: http://www.gilead.com/) and MedImmune (URL: http://www.medimmune.com/) as you can see, up more than five. 

 Here at the Big Board, the three Dow tech components also ended the session higher. In addition to Intel, we saw buying interest in Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) and in IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) . And look at General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) , continuing its recent run; the company confirming that it will decide the fate of its highly coveted GM Hughes (URL: http://www.hughes.com/) unit within the next three months. The news driving that stock to levels we haven`t seen since the early the summer here. 

 On the losing end of things, JP Morgan giving back much of yesterday`s takeover-inspired rally, and DuPont plunging more than 10 percent. It warned that higher oil prices will cut into profits. 

 DuPont, in fact, has lost 35 percent in the last year, as oil prices have skyrocketed. The news had traders here buzzing about the impact of higher oil prices and what it will have on many of those old economy stocks in the 3rd and 4th quarters. 

 And I`ll have more on that, Stuart, at the top the hour. 

 VARNEY: And we`ll see you later. Terry, thanks very much. 

 Now, as Terry mentioned, the spike in oil prices pressured -- created a growing concern about energy costs cutting into corporate profits. Crude oil prices surged again today, cracking $35 a barrel, and that`s a level we`ve not seen in almost a decade. In New York trading, light sweet crude closed at $35.39 a barrel. It was up 49 cents on the session. 

 Prices spiked even as President Clinton lobbied Saudi Arabian leaders to boost OPEC`s production. 

 Peter Viles has been following the action in the oil markets. He joins us  now -- Peter. 

 PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, there were several indications today that OPEC is, indeed, ready to increase oil output again this weekend, but the traders here in New York who control the price of oil in  this market were simply not impressed. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES (voice-over): Crude spiked to a 10-year high above $35 a barrel, now more than triple its price in late 1998, as traders sent a message to  the world`s producers: show us the oil. 

 DAVID GREENBERG: You`re not finding a lot of people that are willing to step out and sell this market right now. 

 VILES: The president pressed OPEC member Saudi Arabia to increase production, and most analysts believe OPEC will do just when it meets this weekend in Vienna. 

 The question is, how much new oil, and whether it will make a difference. 

 JOHN TOALSTER, SG SECURITIES: Well, it should take the heat out of the market, it`s certainly not going to lead to any substantial fall. In fact, the price is know to, sort of settle two, three, four dollars at most, sort of, below these sort of levels. VILES: Meantime, anxiety over energy prices was on the rise. 

 In France, truckers and farmers blocked roads to protest fuel taxes. In Massachusetts, the governor warned of a possible heating oil crisis. 

 Chemical and plastics maker DuPont warned Wall Street the oil spike will hurt profits. Its shares lost more than $5 in heavy trading. 

 But elsewhere on the street, analysts were predicting an oil sell-off. Bear Stearns argues that inventories are building in Asia, and a huge amount of oil is on tankers right now, creating a wall of oil headed for the United States. 

 FRED LEUFFER, BEAR STEARNS: Because when we start to see the supplies, and we start to see the build up of inventories, oil will drop and it will drop hard; and when that will happen, that`s a very difficult  thing to time. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: Now, two years ago, when oil was $11 a barrel, Bear Stearns had a bullish forecast: that oil would eventually settle at $20 a barrel. Tonight Bear Stearns is sticking with the exact same forecast: $20-a-barrel oil by next year. 

 VARNEY: We`ll be watching it, too. Pete Viles, thanks very much. 

 Now, turning -- now to the latest in the Firestone tire crisis. 

 Today the Justice Department said it will examine whether Ford and Firestone could face charges for failing to notify customers about possibly defective tires. 

 Kelli Arena has been following the story, and has more on it. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Attorney General Janet Reno says the Justice Department is looking at both criminal and civil statutes to see whether it may be necessary to take action against Bridgestone/Firestone. 

 JANET RENO, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We`ve received a request from Senator Leahy to look into the matter, and we`re reviewing that request to see what, if any, federal action by the Justice Department is warranted. We are discussing the matter with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has primary regulatory responsibility. 

 ARENA: Leahy is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 

 SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT: I was a prosecutor. I know that if you`re dealing with a corporation, a fine is one thing, that just goes on the books as a part of doing business. 

 If someday, some of the people in the chain of command know they could go to jail for what they might do to their buyers, then they pay a lot more attention. 

 ARENA: Leahy just introduced legislation requiring U.S. tire and auto makers to notify U.S. regulators within two days of any overseas recall, or face criminal penalties. That, in direct response to the fact that neither Firestone nor Ford alerted U.S. regulators when Firestone tires were replaced overseas. 

 That`s just one of the lapses that has some members of Congress seething. 

 SEN. ARLEN SPECTER (R), PENNSYLVANIA: And when corporate officials know there is a danger which might cause the loss of life or serious bodily injury, and they permit that situation to continue, that is a reckless disregard for the life of another, and that is equated in the law  with malice. And that rises the level of second- degree murder. 

 ARENA: Internal Firestone documents presented at Wednesday`s marathon Congressional hearings showed the company compiled a record as early as January of this year of customer claims for tire-tread separation. 

 But the company did not act to recall tires until August, a full eight months later. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 ARENA: Neither Bridgestone/Firestone nor Ford would comment on the Justice Department`s review. 

 Separately today, Firestone announced another tire recall, this time in Colombia. The recall includes 15- and 16-inch wilderness tires made in Venezuela, which were mislabeled as being five ply when indeed they were four ply. The company says the recall is not related to problems with Firestone tires in the United States -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Second-degree murder, that is strong stuff indeed, isn`t it, Kelli? 

 ARENA: Very serious, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Fair enough, Kelli... 

 ARENA: ... very serious allegation. 

 VARNEY: ... Arena in Washington. Thanks very much. 

 Ahead on MONEYLINE, the "quest" to cut costs will leave more than 10,000 people out of their jobs. A telecom giant takes a hatchet to its workforce. We`ll have Wall Street`s reaction to that. 

 Plus, the fierce debate over chip stocks: Should you be a bull or a bear? Sorting out fact and fiction in this extremely volatile sector right now. 

 And Willow in Silicon Valley and inside the modern day gold rush, as our special road trip continues. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: It`s the kind of news that Wall Street likes to hear: cutting costs, streamlining operations. But it still failed to lift shares of Qwest Communications (URL: http://www.qwest.net/) . In the wake of its merger with U S West-Qwest said it will cut 11,000 jobs -- that`s 15 percent of its workforce. It will also sell about a billion dollars in non-core assets, investments that are not related to its focus on high-speed Internet access and wireless communications. 

 Qwest says the move should boost revenues this year and next. 

 Earlier on CNNfn, its chief executive spoke about where the company`s heading. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 JOSEPH NACCHIO, CEO, QWEST COMMUNICATIONS: We announced this morning on DSLs we`ll double the revenues in 2001 versus 2000. We`ll double the revenues in our wireless business in the same period, and we`ll double the revenues again in our hosting and IT business. So, you know, we`ve got some pretty strong growing product lines, and that`s where the bulk of the new capital investment goes. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: Yes, but investors expected more from the announcement, and its stock fell 2 3/4 points, though Qwest shares are still up 70 percent over the past year. 

 Earlier this year, there was speculation that Deutsche Telekom (URL: http://www.dtag.de/) was interested in buying both Qwest and US West -- didn`t happen. But now, D.T. has moved one step closer to completing that deal with VoiceStream (URL: http://www.voicestream.com/) Wireless. Late yesterday, the Department of Justice approved the merger, and today both companies took their case to U.S. legislators. They`re trying to win over a group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Senator Ernest Hollings, who opposed the deal mainly on the grounds that the German government holds a big stake in Deutsche Telekom. D.T. stock has lost nearly 12 percent of its value this year, while shares of VoiceStream Wireless have jumped nearly 140 percent, up more than one and a half points today. 

 MONEYLINE will return in just a moment for you. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Turning to news outside of business, we have breaking news about a  near miss in the skies. Wolf Blitzer joins us from Washington with the "MONEYLINE News Digest." 

 What do you have, Wolf? 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart. 

 This just in, United Airlines says one of its plane heading for Boston with 166 passengers on board and a crew of seven had a near collision over Southern California this morning with a military jet. The airline says the military jet is believed to be an Air Force F-117 stealth fighter. There were no injuries and the flight landed safely in Boston. 

 House Republicans meanwhile today failed to get enough votes to override President Clinton`s veto of a bill repealing the estate tax. They fell 14 votes short of the two-thirds necessary to override the veto. Republicans have said the tax is unfair to small business owners and farmers who want to pass on their estates. 

 On to politics, CNN, together with "USA Today" and Gallup, will issue daily tracking polls of the presidential campaign starting today and running through Election Day. The first installment indicates Vice President Al Gore may be gaining some support. The poll shows him  with 47 percent compared to Bush`s 44 percent. Green Party candidate Ralph Nader drew 3 percent, Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party less than one-half of 1 percent. 

 Bush is also getting some help from former General Colin Powell, as he pushes for military reform. Speaking to a group of veterans, Bush said that the U.S. Armed Forces had suffered under the Democrats. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Should I be fortunate enough to become the commander in chief, the first order of the day would be to restore moral and make sure those who wear our uniform are well treated, well housed and well paid. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BLITZER: Gore, campaigning here in Pennsylvania, picked up a key endorsement today from the Teamsters union. 

 These are some of the top stories. Join us later for "THE WORLD TODAY." That`s 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 p.m. Pacific -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Wolf, is there any evidence that Mr. Bush`s emphasis on military readiness will resonate in the polls? 

 BLITZER: So far there doesn`t seem to be a whole lot of evidence to pick up because for the past several weeks, since Dick Cheney in fact became defense secretary, this has been a central theme, a  central source of attack by the Bush-Cheney team. But with the country at general peace right now, it doesn`t look like that issue alone is scoring a whole lot of points. 

 VARNEY: Wolf Blitzer in Washington. Thanks very much, Wolf. 

 Now let`s go to Willow standing by in Woodside, California -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, in tonight`s tech watch, the boom in biotech. Stocks in the sector today snapped back after a major beating yesterday. The AMEX biotech index jumped nearly 6 percent. For the year, it`s nearly doubled. While biotech and high-tech are completely different industries, today they`re working together more than ever to break new ground. 

 Casey Wian has story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This may not be the kind of mouse you`d expect to find in Silicon Valley, but the breeding ground of high technology is also the cradle of biotechnology. And in the Fremont, California laboratory of Abgenix (URL: http://www.abgenix.com/) , the two industries converge. 

 SCOTT GREER, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ABGENIX: We have a powerful technology, which we call "XenoMouse" technology, for generating fully human antibodies in transgenic mice, and antibodies are immune system proteins that can be used to treat a wide range of diseases. 

 WIAN: Biotechnology has come of age as a business. After two decades in the incubator, there have been a succession of new development: the mapping of the human genome, manipulating genes to fight disease, growing cells to repair or replace damaged tissue. Industry insiders say it`s a revolution, and like high tech before it, the biotech revolution is thriving on the West Coast. 

 JOHN MCCAMMANT, MEDICAL TECH STOCK LETTER: There`s two key ingredients, and it`s this cutting-edge technology. It comes out of universities: UCSF, Stanford, U.C. Berkeley, U.C. San Diego, Scripps Institute, Salk Institute. These are the leading scientific centers in the world. That with venture capital money, which came out of the Valley and was comfortable taking risk. 

 WIAN: One of the men the venture capitalists put their money behind was Dr. George Rathman. Nearly two decades ago he co-founded industry leader Amgen (URL: http://www.amgen.com/) near Los Angeles. He went on to start another biotech called ICOS (URL: http://www.icos.com/) . Now, he`s running Hyseq (URL: http://www.hyseq.com/) , a small company at the forefront of human genetic research. 

 DR. GEORGE RATHMAN, CHAIRMAN & CEO, HYSEQ: What we`re trying to do now in the genomics revolution is just take a gene that we know nothing else about, except its sequence, and translate that into a useful product for human therapy. And of course, that`s why the whole capital markets have responded to the biotech revolution at this stage. 

 WIAN: From Seattle to San Diego, biotechs are benefiting from the financial and technical base established by their high-tech predecessors. In Bothell, Washington, ICOS is working on a new product that works like Viagra but without some of the side effects. Bill Gates is an investor and sits on the board. 

 PAUL CLARK, CHAIRMAN & CEO, ICOS: I think we have benefited greatly from being in the Northwest. It`s very supportive of technology, in general. We`re fortunate here in the Seattle area to be close to some academic institutions, and we`ve had -- enjoyed some significant financial support here. So the Northwest has been a wonderful place for us to be. 

 WIAN: Two years ago, the total annual investment in biotech was just over $5 billion. Last year, that number more than doubled to 11 billion. And this year investment has already surpassed $10 billion. Abgenix is one beneficiary. 

 GREER: Things have really changed in the biotech industry. Historically, biotech companies, as they were developing, raised enough money to sort of get to the next milestone, and then they hoped that the market was receptive at the time they needed more money and then they would move on. In our case, the financial markets were receptive enough that we raised over $725 million in our most recent financing. 

 WIAN: And Abgenix stock has been on a tear. Since its public debut two years ago, Abgenix shares have jumped 3,000 percent, performance previously reserved for high-tech, not biotech. The question now: Can companies like Abgenix deliver results fast enough to keep up with investor expectations? 

 THOMAS DIETZ, PACIFIC GROWTH EQUITIES: Remember that the product development cycles are very long in biotechnology, but the product life cycle is extremely long, much longer than anything in technology. In fact, it`s quite the opposite. You have very short product development cycles in high tech, but very short product life cycles. And for that reason, investors realize that if they can pick a winner now, early on, and they can carry through to the long term, they`re going to be able to get significant return on their investment. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 WIAN: Analysts say despite the current enthusiasm for biotech stocks, it`s unlikely we`ll see anything like the Internet bubble burst. Although most biotechs are still not profitable, analysts say the industry is working on solid science that should eventually produce solid returns -- Willow. 

 BAY: Casey, but what is there -- this is the second go-around for biotechs. What is there to prevent a repeat of the soaring and then the crashing we saw with biotechs in `91 and `92? 

 WIAN: Well, back then, no biotech companies were profitable. While the industry overall lost $2.8 billion last year, 20 percent of the companies were making money. So, that`s what different now. 

 BAY: Twenty percent are profitable? 

 WIAN: Twenty percent are profitable. 

 BAY: Casey, thanks. 

 We`ll be back in a few moments, and we`ll tell you a little bit about where we`re reporting from today: The Filoli Estate, right here in Silicon Valley. Stay with us as our West Coast road trip continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: As we`ve mentioned, Willow has been traveling up the West Coast, stopping in some hot spots of the new economy. So, Willow, where exactly are you now? 

 BAY: Stuart, I`m coming to you from the Filoli House and Gardens. We`re in Silicon Valley, about halfway between San Francisco and San Jose, home to high-tech industries such as semiconductors, computers, and as Casey told us, biotechs, and of course, those dot.coms. And this estate was funded with the riches of an earlier California gold rush. Now it`s a National Trust and really one of the Valley`s treasured local landmarks. 

 But next, we`ll head back to the future to check out the Fort Knox of the digital age. We`ll hear from a true survivor of the high-tech roller coaster ride, Ellen Hancock, whose Exodus (URL: http://www.exodus.net) Communications stands guard over the new economy. 

 VARNEY: And we`ll check out all the news from Wall Street and weigh into the great chip debate with the chief executive of National Semiconductor (URL: http://www.national.com/) , out with strong earnings. All of that`s coming up on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Tonight on MONEYLINE, the price of oil rides high again as the oil market shrugs off signals from Saudi Arabia that it will pump up production. And it`s the hottest debate on Wall Street. Is the surge in chips running out of juice? We`ll ask the boss of National Semiconductor, riding high after a strong earnings showing today. Plus, Willow`s road trip up the West Coast stops in on the watchdog of Silicon Valley. 

 What have you got for us tonight, Willow? 

 BAY: Well, Stuart, if it`s Thursday, it must be Silicon Valley, and we are taking you directly to the heart of the new economy, Exodus Communications. The business of Exodus, Web hosting, grabbed headlines earlier this week when WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) bought a big stake in the company that Exodus had its eye on: Digex (URL: http://www.digex.com/) . 

 Tonight, we have our eyes on Exodus. We`ll ask CEO Ellen Hancock about fending off the competition and if she thinks the stock is headed back to its highs. 

 But first, Stuart has the day`s market action from New York -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right. Thanks, Willow. 

 Tonight`s top story: a much-needed turnaround for tech stocks, while the Dow industrials take a step backwards. After two days of intense selling, bargain hunters emerged on the Nasdaq, snapping up beaten-down chip and biotech stocks: the Nasdaq rebounding more than 2 percent after losing 5 percent on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

 But it was a different story for the Dow industrials. Weakness in DuPont and J.P. Morgan sent the blue chip index down more than 50 points to close just under 11260. 

 The Nasdaq gained ground early this morning, then closed near its high of the day, up 85 points at the close at 4098. The S&P 500 also higher today: up more than 10 points. 

 Now, check some of the biggest movers: DuPont down more than five points after it announced a profit warning. J.P. Morgan slipped 4 3/4, but that was after gaining more than eight points yesterday on renewed takeover speculation. One Dow component that did move higher: Hewlett Packard. It was up nearly 2 3/4. 

 PMC-Sierra (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com/) gained more than eight, and then, of course, it lost 16 1/2 yesterday. 

 And the biotechs got a real lift today. Human Genome Sciences (URL: http://www.hgsi.com/) gained more than 7 1/2 points. 

 Now, check out the price of oil today, and look at that final closing price: $35.39 a barrel, up 49 cents today. That puts oil at close to the best and highest level in a decade. 

 Today`s bounceback for the Nasdaq leaving many investors questioning what`s next. Is it really time to get back into tech stocks or will the volatility continue? 

 Allan Chernoff joins us now with more on this -- Allan. 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, it is the classic question: Of course, we`d all like to wait until the right moment when a great stock has sold-off, then buy just as the price begins climbing higher. Good luck. 

 Today was a case study of how great stocks often give investors little time to buy on the dips. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF (voice-over): After a sell-off of only two days, some of Nasdaq`s shooting stars led the rebound: Siebel Systems (URL: http://www.siebel.com/) , provider of sales and marketing software; Network Appliance (URL: http://www.netapp.com/) , maker of data storage devices; and Applied Micro Circuits (URL: http://www.amcc.com) , which creates microprocessors for fiber optic networking. 

 It seems every time these stocks dip for a couple of days, they bounce back even higher, in spite of the fact they`re selling at sky-high valuations: Siebel Systems at a price to earnings ratio of 321 based on trailing 12 month earnings; Network Appliance at 634; and Applied Micro Circuits at 531. 

 So do you buy such stocks with fantastic momentum but sky-high valuations? 

 PETER GREEN, GERARD KLAUER MATTISON: If you`re a momentum investor, certainly. They look very strong long-term, and consequently, you want to be buying stocks that are outperforming the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite on a relative strength basis. That`s certainly bullish for those names that you would be involved in, and that`s what an investor does. He wants to buy high-quality stocks with a long-term perspective. 

 CHERNOFF: The risk, of course, is that shooting stars can quickly turn into fallen stars. Witness QUALCOMM (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) . It`s lost nearly two-thirds of its value this year after peaking at the end of last year. And old reliable Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) : It`s down 40 percent on the year. 

 It`s part of the risk-reward equation: to get big gains you usually have to take big risks. 

 From mid-March through late May, the Nasdaq lost 35 percent, but it`s bounced back since then, and many fund managers think the rally has further to go. 

 JOHN DAVIDSON, ORBITEX MANAGEMENT: Well, I think technology will continue to really lead. Unfortunately, with the technology comes volatility, and volatility, I think, is what you`ve seen. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: For all the Nasdaq`s ups and downs, it is virtually unchanged so far this year: up a fraction of a percent -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Allan Chernoff, thanks very much. 

 Now, while today`s tech turnaround may have commanded the headlines, another major story unfolded on the big board. DuPont says higher energy costs will cause it to miss full-year profit estimates. We go now to the New York Stock Exchange, where Terry Keenan goes behind the numbers for us -- Terry. 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, it was a profit warning that wiped more than $4 billion off of DuPont`s market value today and sent the stock to levels that we haven`t seen since the end of 1996. It was also a warning that reminded investors about the peril of higher petroleum prices. Although oil prices have been rising steadily and rapidly all year, up 37 percent since January 1st, the fallout is only recently being felt in the bottom line. 

 This summer, the airlines began to raise the red flag. Now, it`s the chemical companies that are following suit. 

 In addition to DuPont, many analysts say Dow Chemical (URL: http://www.dow.com/) , Rohm and Haas (URL: http://www.rohmhaas.com/) , Union Carbide (URL: http://www.unioncarbide.com/) , and Newell Rubbermaid (URL: http://www.newellco.com/) are the most exposed to higher oil prices. But investors aren`t picking and choosing here. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 PAUL LEMING, ING BARINGS: As you saw today, there was really no distinction within the group. Investors really went out of the whole sector. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KEENAN: And it may not stop with the chemical companies. Portfolio manager Francis Gannon of SunAmerica Asset Management tells me he`s also worried that higher oil prices are already cutting into consumer spending and hurting the retailers, as reflected by profit warnings  that we got today from May Department Stores (URL: http://www.mayco.com/may/) and Circuit City (URL: http://www.circuitcity.com/) . 

 And even the U.S. Postal Service is feeling the pinch, reporting its first loss since 1994: One reason, higher fuel costs are cutting into profits --Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Hurts a lot of people. Terry Keenan at the big board, thanks very much. 

 Next on MONEYLINE, well, she`s worked in the tech business longer than Jerry Yang of Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) has been alive. Ellen Hancock, chief executive of Exodus Communications, out to take a hotshot company to the next level. Inside Exodus as our special road trip continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Welcome back to this special MONEYLINE. 

 Top Web sites have become so big, so complex and so vital to operations that companies have looked for outside help to manage and to guard their servers. They often look to Exodus Communications, a leader in the field with a high-flying stock. It`s up nearly 50 percent this year, and today up more than three to close at 66. 

 Still, Exodus is facing tough questions and even tougher competition. Just this week, WorldCom bought a stake in Exodus rival Digex. 

 A look now at the Web hosting pioneer Exodus. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY (voice-over): Outside it looks like every other low-slung Silicon Valley office building, but walk inside and it`s a high-tech Fort Knox. The glass, bulletproof; cameras, tracking every move; a high-security chamber straight out of sci-fi. Why all the fuss? Because these cages house the heart of the new economy: Web sites, where millions log on. Their every click is processed right here. 

 For clients like Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) , Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) , Lycos (URL: http://www.lycos.com/) , and British Airways (URL: http://www.britishairways.com/) , Exodus (URL: http://www.exodus.net) connects their customers to the Internet and manages the data flow. Chris Harden runs the complex, which also houses vaults for top clients who want their servers bombproof, fireproof, even floodproof. 

 CHRIS HARDEN, EXODUS COMMUNICATIONS: If there were war, this is where you`d want to be. If there was an earthquake, I`d want to be in here too. 

 BAY: That maximum security is a big selling point for Exodus, and so is its size. It expects to have 36 centers around the globe by year`s end. Ambitious expansion plans prompted by tremendous demand: The company has had explosive revenue growth, up more than 300 percent over the past year. And the stock is up nearly 7,000 percent since its 1998 debut. 

 ELLEN HANCOCK, CEO, EXODUS: Up three. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Up three. 

 HANCOCK: Three and a half. 

 BAY: And no one is watching the stock more closely than CEO Ellen Hancock, a gray-haired woman in a sea of 20-something men. But make no mistake, her credentials make her a high-tech heavyweight. Before joining exodus at the time of its IPO, she was Apple`s (URL: http://www.apple.com/) CTO and spent 29 years at IBM. 

 While Hancock does have an impressive track record, she`s also hit some hurdles along the way. 

 (on camera): There`s a headline that`s framed in your office here: "Fired From Two Jobs, a High Tech Manager Gets the Last Laugh." Are you a comeback story or just a sign of these Internet times? 

 HANCOCK: Well, hopefully both. I have to say it is nice to go towards an end of the career with something as successful as Exodus. I mean, that is really pleasant. 

 BAY (voice-over): Pleasant, how about fast and furious. This brand new center sold out before it opened. 

 HANCOCK: On average, a customer spends about $220,000 a year. Now if you take this particular cage and this particular customer, you`ve got to assume this customer is spending at least a million dollars or more per month. 

 BAY: And so that would be a Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) kind of customer, somebody of that size? 

 HANCOCK: It would be a large customer. 

 BAY: Analysts say its prestigious customer list is a huge plus. 

 (on camera): So do you have the Yahoo! guy and the Microsoft guy getting together in the hallway here and chatting? 

 HANCOCK: Actually, we do. There`s a community of Exodus users. 

 BAY (voice-over): It may sound cozy, but Hancock admits clients sometimes get a bit touchy sharing close quarters with their rivals. That`s a minor challenge facing Exodus. 

 More significant: while sales are growing, so are losses, as Exodus funds its massive expansion plans. And the market is growing impatient. The stock is down sharply from its high. Still, it`s up more than 200 percent over a year, and Hancock insists profits are in sight. 

 Another concern: Will Exodus lose pricing power as competitors rush in to build their own facilities? The company can charge high prices now because it specializes in customized, high-end sites for blue-chip customers. Customer problems, for example, are handled in the Exodus response center, where dozens of specialists troubleshoot across the network 24/7. 

 For Ellen Hancock, troubleshooting is part of the territory. And she`ll clearly have her hands full, taking Exodus from adolescence to adulthood. 

 HANCOCK: I`m loving it. I`m having a great time. I really do think the industry needs some more executives at the CEO level who have had experience in similar, though not necessarily the same, field. And so I think our instincts work, we`re able to make decisions because we`ve seen some of this before. So I do think there`s value to that. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Next on MONEYLINE, Ellen Hancock on expansion plans, tough competition and the deal that got away, as our West Coast road trip continues. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: In tonight`s "MONEYLINE Focus," she is one of the top female executives in Silicon Valley. Named last year as one of "Business Week"`s e-biz 25, the most influential people in the industry, Ellen Hancock, CEO of Exodus Communications, joins us now. 

 Welcome. 

 HANCOCK: Thank you. 

 BAY: In the news this week, of course, WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) `s acquiring Intermedia , acquiring, in effect, Digex (URL: http://www.digex.com/) . Does that put you in head- to-head competition with WorldCom? 

 HANCOCK: I would say we`d already seen some competition from WorldCom. We`ll see now increased competition because they have Digex. 

 BAY: But will it be now competition in your segment of the market? 

 HANCOCK: Actually, Digex was in a different segment. They were more in the segment of managing more of the customer service all the way up to the application layer. Over time, I think we`ll all be in each others` segments, so we will see them in the future. 

 BAY: Now you were reportedly interested in acquiring Digex yourself. Why didn`t you? 

 HANCOCK: Well I certainly can`t comment whether we were in that deal or not, but I can comment on the fact that we think Digex is an excellent company, a very good management team, and I think WorldCom is lucky to get them. 

 BAY: You also passed on GlobalCenter . You`re clearly shopping. What is it you`re looking to acquire? 

 HANCOCK: We`re definitely in acquiring mode. We`re looking at acquiring hosting companies. We already acquired two small hosting companies, one in Chicago and one in Tokyo. We`re interested in acquiring technology companies. We`ve done some of that also. We acquired a performance company, we acquired a stress-testing company, and then finally we`re looking to acquiring consulting companies, primarily in Europe and Asia. 

 BAY: So why not GlobalCenter? 

 HANCOCK: Again, what we`ve said on that deal is that we are interested in acquiring the assets for the right price, and one can assume that that wasn`t that way. 

 BAY: So it`s really tough shopping at these prices? 

 HANCOCK: It is tough. 

 BAY: You -- with more companies, more competition in the high end segment of the market, are you going to be able to keep raising prices? 

 HANCOCK: Yes, we think we can. We`ll be assessing that again probably as we go into next year. What we do every time is as we go through the year we increase our offerings. So we increase the types of offerings we have in our data centers, we increase our bandwidth with work we`re doing with other companies such as Mirror Image , and we`re increasing all our professional services. And so I have to say right now there`s more of an impetus to raise price than decrease them. 

 BAY: Earlier we described you as a woman who stands apart from her competitors. But in part you stand out because you are a woman. Do other women cheer you on? 

 HANCOCK: Yes, they do. I mean, I think we`re very supportive of each other. I was with Carol Bartz last night, Sandy Kurtzik (ph) this morning. We get together, several of us, so we are supportive of each other. 

 BAY: You noted earlier that the business needs more experienced managers. But does the business, does the tech business need more women? 

 HANCOCK: I think they do. But again, I`m usually on the hopeful side. And I have seen progress, so I think that we should acknowledge the progress, that we are seeing more women. And I we`re seeing more women in technology than some other industries. But I`d say across the United States, we need more female CEOs. 

 BAY: Ellen Hancock of Exodus Communications, thanks for joining us. 

 HANCOCK: You`re welcome. 

 BAY: Coming up next on MONEYLINE, Stuart will be back with more of today`s market news, and he`ll talk with the CEO of National Semiconductor. 

 This is MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Checking tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers": CMGI (URL: http://www.cmgi.com/) lost 3 1/2. Now, this Internet incubator said today it is reorganizing. It is going to reduce the number of its operating companies in an effort to achieve better financial performance. 

 Nextel Communications (URL: http://www.nextel.com/) gained nearly 3 - that following a "Wall Street Journal" report today that said AT&T Wireless (URL: http://www.attws.com/) is considering a combination with the rival wireless telephone provider. Both companies called the story speculation and declined to comment. 

 And MP3.com (URL: http://www.mp3.com/) lost nearly 1 3/4. That is more than 21 percent. And that follows yesterday`s court order that it pay a big fine to Universal Music for willfully violating copyright laws. 

 A blowout quarter for National Semiconductor: The chip-maker said its first-quarter profits jumped more than 200 percent -- National Semi reporting earnings of 74 cents a share, including special items. Analysts expected 65 cents. The chip-maker jumped more than 2 1/2 today. It is still, though, off 45 percent from its 52-week high. 

 Joining us now with more from Santa Clara, California: the chairman and chief executive of National Semi, Brian Halla. 

 Brian, welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 BRIAN HALLA, CHAIRMAN & CEO, NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR: Hi, Stuart. Thanks for having us. 

 VARNEY: Now look: In the last two weeks, there have been two upgrades of the chip sector by the analysts, and two downgrades. And some stocks been really whip-sawed with all the confusion. Would you please give us your point of view, your assessment of the future demand for key areas of the chip business? 

 First of all, how do you assess the future for PC demand? 

 HALLA: You know, I`ve got this coy pond. And I watch these fish. And they all swim together. And every now and then, one of them spooks and jumps the other way. And everybody follows them. I think what`s happening in the marketplace is, every now and then, somebody jumps up and says the sky is falling. And then they look around to see if they`re right. And if they`re not, then somebody has got to back with another upgrade. And it`s just kind of chaos. 

 Let me tell you what I think. If you look back over the last 20 years, the personal commuter has driven disproportionately the semiconductor industry. For example, over half of all the electronics that we do go into the personal computer. Now that has changed, because we`re being driven by the age of information. That`s the Internet. 

 And guess what? The Internet has all kind of drivers for the semiconductor industry: servers, server farms, server factories, Ellen Hancock`s business, that you just showed, information appliance -- one of which is the personal computer, but it doesn`t dominate that segment anymore -- and wireless -- and wireless bandwidth increasing all the time from what we have today to WAP phones to GPRS, to Edge and then onto third generation where we transfer data, video and voice. 

 VARNEY: But let`s isolate some of this and look at it from your perspective  from your business. PC demand in the future: What do you make of it? 

 HALLA: I think there`s always going to be a demand for PCs. And if you look at the world -- if you look at the world, you say: OK, what`s going to happen to these high performance Athlons and Pentiums when people want to hold a device that doesn`t require a hand, and talk to it, and get access to all the world`s information. 

 The CPUs -- these big number-crunching CPUs disappear behind that curtain that we call cyberspace today into those server farms, server factories, data centers, whatever you want too call them. What`s left are these information appliances, which are optimized for some job, like playing DVDs. But they can access the Web. 

 Why? Because everything they do will be done better when they access the Web. But now, what drives the technology in those boxes, it`s analog. It`s the better-battery life. It`s better wireless. It`s better displays. It`s better audio. All of those are analog. There is a resurgence of analog semiconductor technology, because that`s what left on this side of curtain, the real world. Real-world signals are analog. 

 VARNEY: Brian, sum it up for us. Looking down, for the next six months, is demand for all these different kind of chips really strong --next six months? 

 HALLA: Driven -- driven by the Internet, by analog, and by information-access devices, the demand is strong for the next six months, and I think beyond that. 

 VARNEY: Fair enough. Brian Halla, chairman and chief executive of National Semi, thanks for being with us, sir. 

 HALLA: Good stuff, Stuart. Thanks. 

 VARNEY: Up next: AHEAD OF THE CURVE, some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open again tomorrow. We`ll also check back in with Willow to see where she`s headed next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: And here is some of what could move the markets tomorrow: TRW (URL: http://www.trw.com/) issued an after-the-bell warning, saying it would miss third-quarter profit forecasts by 19 to 24 cents-a-share. This is an automotive product-maker -- well, actually, a much broader-based product-maker --blamed production cutbacks at Ford Motor Company for that warning. 

 Also, keep an eye on the share price of Siebel Systems. It`s a software company. And it is set to split its stock two-for-one tomorrow. And to stay ahead of the curve -- or rather, a step ahead of the markets, I should say -- tune in to AHEAD OF THE CURVE tomorrow morning at 5:00 a.m. Eastern here on CNN. 

 And MONEYLINE does want to hear from you. Please, send us your comments and questions and feedback by e-mail to moneyline@cnn.com. 

 All right, Willow, where are you going tomorrow? 

 BAY: Stuart, right now, we`re going to get on a plane. We`re headed to Beaverton, Oregon. 

 Now, it may not be a tech high-flyer, but innovation and technology have been at the heart of Nike (URL: http://www.nike.com/) since its humble beginnings nearly three decades ago. So, how will the world`s best-known sneaker brand reenergize its swoosh in the new millennium? We`ll find out in a live interview with its founder, CEO Phil Knight. 

 That`s tomorrow on MONEYLINE at 6:30 Eastern. 

 That is MONEYLINE for this Thursday. I`m Willow Bay in Woodside, California. 

 VARNEY: And I`m Stuart Varney. Good night from New York. 

 "CROSSFIRE" is next.

THE MARKETS: Market Place
 Business/Financial Desk; Section C 
 A Soft Landing With More Growth Than Usual  

 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER  
1,166 words
6 September 2000
The New York Times
NYTF
Page 1, Column 2

 c. 2000 New York Times Company  

 As the summer ends, the corporate earnings outlook is being undermined by signs that the economy is slowing. And some stock market analysts are warning that while profit growth will remain strong, the current projections for the last quarter of this year and the first of next year are too optimistic.  

 The employment data released on Friday reinforced the belief that the economy was cooling after six rate increases by the Federal Reserve. In August, nonfarm payroll jobs, excluding census workers and strikers, rose just 140,000, well below the 222,000 average for the first seven months of the year. Manufacturing jobs actually declined, and manufacturing activity shrank after 18 months of growth, according to a purchasing managers' index. The big automakers are cutting production. Home appliance manufacturers, like Whirlpool, say slowing demand will cut into their profits the rest of the year. Department stores, already beleaguered, are warning of a weak end to the year.  

 Furthermore, surges in the prices of crude oil and home heating oil for this winter will cut into consumers' ability to spend. Crude oil is now $33.83 a barrel, near a 10-year high and up 32.1 percent since the end of last year. Home heating oil is also near a 10-year high, at 97.97 cents a gallon, and already 41.2 percent above the average price of last fall and winter.  

 While these factors suggest slower economic growth, the good news is that a slowdown does not have to be as sharp as in the past to be successful in curbing inflation. Put another way, the soft landing that the Federal Reserve desires can come at a higher growth rate than in the past.  

 This means that the economy could be growing at a pretty brisk pace of 3.5 percent or 4 percent when the soft landing arrives and that the Fed could be finished with interest rate increases.  

 ''That's a fair point,'' said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc America Securities. ''The economy may not slow down that much.'' Even though he has one of the more bearish earnings forecasts, he still thinks the weakest quarters for corporate profits in the near future will be a 7.5 percent increase in operating earnings in the fourth quarter of this year and no increase in the first quarter of 2001. Then he expects earnings to begin growing again, with an 8 percent jump in the second quarter of next year and a 10 percent rise in the third quarter.  

 According to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that third-quarter operating earnings, which exclude one-time charges and other nonrecurring items, will be 17.3 percent higher than a year earlier for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. While that estimate has been trimmed from the 18.1 percent forecast in April, it is still very strong. For the fourth quarter, the growth forecast is 15.8 percent. The expectations of 17 percent and 15 percent gains follow a very strong first half, in which earnings surged 23.6 percent in the first quarter and 21.6 percent in the second quarter.  

 One reason an economic slowdown has not showed up strongly in the numbers collected by First Call/ Thomson Financial is that it has been offset in part by the surging expectations for companies in the oil industry.  

 The earnings prospects for the energy sector, including companies like Exxon Mobil and Texaco, have more than doubled with the rise in oil prices. Earnings are now expected to surge 77 percent in the third quarter, up from a 29 percent growth expectation in April and 62 percent in July. Excluding the energy sector, the earnings growth forecast for the S.& P. 500 would be 14.7 percent, instead of 17.3 percent, Mr. Hill said.  

 But after breaking down the averages, there are signs that Wall Street analysts are beginning to factor in an economic slowdown. For consumer cyclical companies, including Caterpillar, Dow Chemical and International Paper, analysts have reduced their earnings growth estimates to 6 percent for the third quarter, from 14 percent on April 1 and 12 percent on July 1.  

 Earnings estimates for companies making consumer staples, including General Mills and Kellogg, are also falling. The current forecast is for growth of 7 percent in the third quarter, down from 15 percent in April and 12 percent in July.  

 Another drag on earnings, though it is difficult to calculate, is the impact on the Ford Motor Company from the tire recall by Firestone. Because Ford recently went through a recapitalization, measuring the decline in earnings estimates cannot be easily done, said Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call. ''Clearly, analysts are lowering estimates,'' he noted, ''because Ford is cutting back production because of the Firestone issue.''  

 Technology earnings estimates have held up, despite warnings of a weak second half from several companies, including Lucent Technologies, Xerox and Unisys. The current forecast is for growth of 35 percent in the third quarter, compared with expectations of 33 percent in April and 36 percent in July. Generally, as the quarter approaches, analysts trim their estimates as they get more information from companies.  

 The suggestion that the economy need slow only modestly to curb inflationary pressures is a result of the surprising increase in worker productivity over the last couple of years. Because productivity has grown, the potential noninflationary growth rate of the economy has risen, a fact that has been acknowledged by Federal Reserve policy makers.  

 When productivity gains were running at 1.5 percent to 2 percent, the noninflationary growth rate of the economy was thought to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The total allowed for about a percentage point from the normal annual growth in the country's labor supply. So to get a soft landing, economic growth would have to be slowed to about 2.5 percent, or less, to take the pressure off wages and prices.  

 Now, Federal Reserve officials seem to agree that the noninflationary growth rate for the economy is as high as 4.5 percent because the trend line for worker productivity is approaching 3.5 percent. And Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, indicated that he was confident that the economy could continue growing at a high, noninflationary pace when he said in August that it was ''still difficult to find credible evidence in the United States that the rate of structural productivity growth has stopped increasing.''  

 James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, sees beauty in a modest slowdown. ''Corporate earnings don't have to slow down so much,'' he said, ''if achieving a soft landing today means slowing growth to 4 percent instead of 2.5 percent.''

 Procter & Gamble Co. 

 CINCINNATI - Procter & Gamble Co., which replaced its chief executive two months ago, said fiscal fourth- quarter earnings fell 2.8 percent and warned that first-quarter profit will be unchanged as the cost of raw materials surged.

 Sales rose 2.2 percent to $9.66 billion from $9.45 billion.

 Techs extend rally with rates on hold: Dow gains hurt by Coca-Cola, 3M, Kodak, Home Depot

 Technology stocks continued their recent rally last week, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index neared its March high amid rising hopes that the Federal Reserve is finished raising interest rates. 

 The Nasdaq rose 191 points to 4234, a 4.7% gain, on strength in such stocks as Oracle Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc. and Juniper Networks Inc., all of which hit record highs in Friday's session. The Nasdaq had a good August, rising 11.7% in the month, and extending its rally into Friday, the first day of September, when it gained 28 points. The tech-heavy index now is up 4% this year. 

 "What has become clear is that the economy is slowing and the Fed probably isn't going to tighten again. That has made investors more comfortable," says Byron Wien, chief domestic strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 

 There was more evidence of moderating economic growth on Friday, when the U.S. government reported that payroll employment fell 105,000 in August, partly reflecting the layoff of census workers, while the jobless rate rose to 4.1% from 4%. Auto sales also declined in August. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was up just 46 points, or 0.4%, in the week to 11,238, held back by declines in such blue chips as Coca-Cola Co., Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., Eastman Kodak Co., Home Depot Inc. and Philip Morris Companies Inc. 

 The S&P 500 added 14 points, or 0.9%, to 1520, ending shy of its March high of 1527. The Dow, which rose 6.8% in August, now is down 2.3% for 2000, while the S&P is up 3.5% this year. It advanced 6.2% in August. 

 The renewed preference for technology stocks lately reflects a move out of sectors that once attracted growth-oriented investors, who now dominate the market. 

 Growth investors, for instance, used to like certain big retailers, but another profit warning last week from Gap Inc. and bad news from formerly dependable Target Corp. underscored that even the strongest retailers are having a tough time in what has been a summer of woe for the industry. 

 Gap (GPS/NYSE) fell US$3 to US$23.50, less than half its 52-week high of US$54, while Target declined US$2.50 to US$24.63. 

 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc., the two dominant U.S. retailers, also have disappointed Wall Street in the past month, and their stocks stand considerably below their peaks. 

 The major consumer stocks also are struggling, including Coca-Cola (KO/NYSE) which was down US$1.75 to US$54.25 last week. Bill Pecoriello, the bullish Coke analyst at Sanford Bernstein, cut his 2001 profit estimate to US$1.75 a share from US$1.79 partly because of the weak euro. 

 Coke's North American soda volume this quarter is expected to fall short of early-summer projections because of cool weather in the eastern U.S. and the impact of price increases. Formerly strong stocks such as PepsiCo, Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive, have also lost momentum. 

 Some of the major drug stocks have been under pressure, partly reflecting the rising standing in the polls of Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, who now is viewed as industry-unfriendly after his attack on drug companies in his acceptance speech last month. 

 Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK/NYSE) was off US$3.75 last week to US$69.19; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY/NYSE) fell US$3.25 to US$53.25 and Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY/NYSE) dropped US$2.88 to US$72.69. Some fear the drugs could be under a cloud until after the November elections. 

 Many growth investors apparently see little alternative to technology stocks, and they are paying ever-higher prices for the likes of Sun, EMC Corp., and Nortel Networks Corp. that possess high earnings "visibility," meaning the Street is highly confident of their profit outlooks. 

 Oracle (ORCL/NASDAQ) rose US$8 to US$92.63 last week; Sun (SUNW/NASDAQ) added US$4 to US$128.63; EMC (EMC/NYSE) gained US$6.25 to US$97.38, and Juniper (JNPR/NASDAQ) surged US$30.50 to US$221.63, helped by its addition to the Nasdaq 100 index. As noted in this space earlier this summer, Juniper could get an added boost from a potential addition to the S&P 500. With a US$65-billion market value, it's now one of the largest companies outside the index. 

 The valuations on the tech trophy stocks are stunning, given their huge market values. Nortel, EMC, Sun and Oracle each have capitalizations topping US$200 billion. Nortel fetches 114 times projected 2000 profits; EMC trades at 127 times projected earnings, and Oracle commands 102 times estimated profits in its fiscal year ending in May. This means that US$200-billion companies are supported by just about US$2-billion in profits. 

 Juniper, a hot provider of high-end routers, now trades at more than 700 times its projected earnings of US30 cents this year. Byron Wien says he's suspicious that high-multiple tech stocks continue to advance while old economy stocks labour, but investors seem happy to stick with the winners.

 UPDATE 1-Avis, Dollar comfortable despite Hertz warning.

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Car rental chains Avis Group Holdings Inc. and Dollar Thrifty said on Friday they were comfortable with their earnings projections, in contrast with a profit warning from industry leader Hertz Corp. . 

 On Thursday Hertz, the world's largest car rental company, forecast that second-half earnings would fall short of Wall Street forecasts. It blamed a labour dispute at United Airlines and bad weather. 

 Hertz shares were hammered on Friday, falling $4-13/16 to close at a new 52-week low of $25-13/16. 

 Dollar Thrifty shares were also hit, falling $2-15/16 to close at $19-11/16, while Avis shares lost 9/16 to close at $30-3/16. 

 Shares of Budget Group Inc. , which owns Budget Rent a Car Corp., closed off 9/16 at $3-15/16. 

 Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis said it was still comfortable with its third-and fourth-quarter earnings projections. It also said it stood behind upwardly revised earnings projections of $3.13 per share for 2000 and $3.98 for 2001, based on the strength of its businesses, which include fleet management and leasing and a fuel card operation. 

 "All of our businesses continue to be consistently strong and we remain confident with the financial projections we have provided the investment community for the remainder of this calendar year and into 2001," A. Barry Rand, Avis chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "All of our most current data strongly support this position." 

 Tulsa, Okla.-based Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. said it backs Wall Street projections, compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial, that it will earn $1.33 per share in the third quarter and $3.09 for the full year. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston's Henry Diamond downgraded Hertz to a buy from a hold rating. 

 "Hertz's guidance had been aggressive in terms of its volume growth, when you compare it to the guidance having been given by Avis, and all of those factors kind of came together to make the impact on Hertz much more material than on the other companies," Diamond said. 

 "We think overall the fundamentals for most of the companies are going to remain strong, particularly for Dollar Thrifty," Diamond said. Avis is going to do "very, very well" and Budget "will do well as a result of its efforts to cut costs," he said. Long term, Diamond sees Hertz as "a very solid company." 

 ABN Amro's Robert Napoli said demand for the industry is very good. "The outlook over the next 10 years is for four to five percent industry growth per year. That's healthy growth for that industry." 

 Napoli said Avis' other segments - its fleet management and fuel card management businesses - are helping it despite pricing pressures throughout the industry. 

 "The fuel card business in particular is doing extremely well," Napoli said, referring to Avis' unit that manages credit cards for corporations that have large fleets. Napoli said that unit is growing rapidly with high margins. 

 Dollar Thrifty's pricing is "doing OK", where Hertz is having greater pressures, Napoli said. 

 Hertz's outlook differs from the others due to pressure in two business segments that Avis and Dollar Thrifty do not have, Napoli said, referring to Hertz's equipment rental business and its international segment. "Neither Avis nor Dollar Thrifty have an international business of any significance," compared to Hertz, he said. 

 Earlier on Friday Park Ridge, N.J.-based Hertz said it expects disappointing third-and fourth-quarter results because of lower demand, due in part to the dispute between UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and its pilots. The dispute led to widespread flight delays and cancellations this summer. Hertz also said airport disruptions caused by bad weather had hurt its volume growth. 

 Hertz said it now sees net earnings of $1.30 per share in the third quarter, 13 cents below analysts' estimates as compiled by First Call, and 51 cents per share in the fourth quarter, 12 cents below analysts' estimates. 

 It said net earnings for 2000 and 2001 will still be at record highs, but 2001 first-quarter earnings will be down from a year earlier. 

 "The United Airlines problem we don't look at as a big issue, because it was really just this quarter, it's a short term issue," Diamond said. 

 Diamond said Hertz's equipment rental business, which the other car rental companies don't have, is part of its problem. 

 Hertz is also faced with growing competition from value-priced competitors, as people become less willing to pay a premium for amenities such as nice buses and waiting areas. 

 "As more people are shopping on the Internet for car rentals, that's a huge benefit to the value priced players too," as Web consumers tend to look for the best deals, Diamond said. "Dollar does about 30 percent of their business on the Internet and Hertz does less than ten percent." 

 Hertz said it would trim its North American car and equipment rental fleets, temporarily slow suburban car rental and equipment rental expansion plans, and rationalise staff levels to reflect current market conditions. 

 "Over the long term, we believe there is strong growth potential in our businesses and opportunities to further reduce our cost base," President and Chief Executive Craig Koch said in a statement.

 NEW YORK, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers said on Friday analyst Karl Keirstead cut his investment rating of Scient Corp. to outperform from buy, and also cut his 12-month price target for the e-commerce consulting and technology firm to $35 from $45. 

 - Keirstead said the cuts were in response to rival Internet consultant Viant's August 31 profit warning, which cited a dotcom drought. 

 - "Scient is exposed to the .com start-up customer base and to the market to carve-out and launch e-business start-ups within large enterprises. These sources of demand appear to be softening," Keirstead said in a research note. 

 - Shares of Scient closed at $27-1/16 in Nasdaq trading on Thursday. The stock has a 52-week range of $133-3/4 and $25-1/2.

 NEW YORK - Shares of Gap Inc. (GPS/NYSE) hit a 52-week low yesterday, falling 17% as analysts downgraded the youth-oriented retailer after it reported a sharp drop in August sales. 

 Shares of the San Francisco-based retail giant led a decline in high-profile retail stocks. It dropped as low as US$21 1/8, well below the previous year low of US$25 1/16, making it the second-largest percentage loser and third-largest net loser on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The stock closed the day at US$22 7/16. 

 Gap closed on Wednesday at US$25 7/16 and fell in after-hours trading after it issued a business outlook warning and reported disappointing sales. 

 Gap cited poor performance at Old Navy stores, marketing problems and "less momentum in back-to-school sales." 

 One analyst said Gap's problems were "predominantly Gap-specific" and not industry wide. 

 "While Gap cited reduced traffic and slower consumer spending as reasons for its disappointment, we are not convinced that these conditions pervade the entire specialty retail industry," said Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Richard Baum in a note. 

 Yesterday investors digested mixed August sales figures. Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF/NYSE) and Target Corp. (TGT/NYSE) were delayed in opening trading. When Abercrombie opened it fell US$3 to US$22 1/4, after reporting a 3% decrease in August sales. It closed at US$23 3/16. Target dropped US$3 3/16 to US$22 1/8, on a profit warning. It closed at US$23 1/4. 

 Speigel Group Inc. (SPGLA/NASDAQ), which sells clothes and furnishing through catalogues and its Eddie Bauer stores, slipped in opening trading after reporting a 20% fall in August sales. It closed at US$6 13/16. 

 Gap said its same-store sales fell 14% in August from last year amid "uncertainties" in apparel retailing, adding that it faced "risks and challenges" in the third and fourth quarters. This was the second time this month the company had warned about a difficult business environment. 

 Gap's Old Navy stores performed worse than its other brands in August with same-store sales dropping by an amount in the mid-20% range. 

 Gap was also hit by analyst downgrades from Credit Suisse First Boston, Banc of America and Salomon Smith Barney. 

 CSFB's Richard Baum downgraded Gap to a "hold" from "buy," and cut earnings estimates for fiscal 2000 to US$1.25 from US$1.35, and reduced fiscal 2001 estimates to US$1.60 from US$1.70. 

 Mr. Baum said Gap merchandise was not marketed well, and the retailer experienced particular weakness in denim. "When Gap does not succeed at the basics, they do not typically produce positive overall results," he said. 

 Banc of America also downgraded Gap to "market perform" from "buy" and Salomon Smith Barney cut Gap to "neutral" from "buy." 

 Merrill Lynch cut earnings estimates for fiscal 2000 by US9 cents, to US$1.28. 

 "We believe the stock will be challenged to outperform until there are sign of revitalization within Old Navy and therefore are maintaining immediate term rating of 'neutral,' " Merrill Lynch analysts said in a note.

 DaimlerChrysler postpones analyst meeting, fuels speculation of Mitsubishi shake up

 FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - DaimlerChrysler's last-minute postponement of a meeting with analysts fueled speculation Friday that the German-American auto giant was preparing for a management shake up at its troubled partner Mitsubishi Motors. 

 The cancellation of the meeting, which is traditionally used by DaimlerChrysler to showcase business strategy and impress analysts, was a new blow to DaimlerChrysler's reputation as it struggles to quell a scandal at Mitsubishi and prop up a stock price trading just a hair above its 52-week low. 

 The meeting was originally scheduled for Sept. 6-8 in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The company called it off with an e-mail message dated Aug. 30 that caught auto analysts around the world by surprise. 

 "Many of the board members involved in the meetings are now required to attend to other duties which could not have been foreseen at the time we sent out the invitations," the brief message said, adding that no new date had been set. 

 The company gave no further details, but analysts suspected the unprecedented move meant something was amiss - perhaps a management shuffle at Mitsubishi or at DaimlerChrysler's Stuttgart headquarters, perhaps an earnings warning for its underperforming U.S. operations. 

 Shares in the company immediately dropped, only to recover and trade even at 58 euros (dlrs 51.62) Friday, slightly above a one-year low of 54.61 euros (dlrs 48.60). It trailed an overall up Frankfurt market, which was ahead nearly 2 percent. 

 "I can't blame them for canceling if something's happening at Mitsubishi that needs the board members' attention," said Christian Breitsprecher, a Deutsche Bank auto analyst who was told to postpone travel plans to Detroit. 

 "It's just one of those situations when you don't look good," he added. 

 Jack Ferry, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman in Auburn Hills, denied the meeting was postponed because of recent problems at Mitsubishi or to assess a management change in the DaimlerChrysler board. He also said there were no concerns about an earnings warning. 

 "If we want to have the right people make presentations at the meeting and they can't make it, we're going to reschedule and do it right," Ferry said. 

 DaimlerChrysler is reeling with embarrassment after a coverup scandal recently shook Mitsubishi, the Japanese automaker it took a 34 percent stake in earlier this year. 

 Mitsubishi President Katsuhiko Kawasoe is under pressure to resign after his company admitted illegally covering up customer complaints for 30 years. The scandal broke just shortly after invitations for the analyst meeting were put in the mail. 

 Analysts suggested the DaimlerChrysler is discovering more dirty laundry than it expected at loss-making Mitsubishi and may be now be scrambling to tighten its control on the company's board, where it currently has three seats. 

 DaimlerChrysler also has problems in the United States. 

 Germany's Commerzbank downgraded its rating for DaimlerChrysler on Friday because of the company's U.S.-based Chrysler unit, which has seen profit margins shrink due to cut-throat competition in its home market. 

 Analysts downplayed the possibility that DaimlerChrysler had a profitwarning in the works, noting that the company had already issued one just last month during the company's second-quarter report.

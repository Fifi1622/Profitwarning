Abreast of the Market

 NEW YORK -- Market averages fell sharply in thin trading, as worries about both profits and rates took casualties in the financial sector. 

 Shares of Progressive lost 16 1/4 to end at 102 3/4, after the Ohio insurance concern warned its third-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street expectations. 

 Those worries contaminated other insurance issues, with Cigna falling 2 1/4 to 90 1/8, and American International losing 4 1/4 to 92 3/4. 

 The warning exacerbated some lingering worries about the strength of third-quarter profits for the broader financial category, which has been stung this month with a succession of profit warnings. 

 State Street shares lost 4 1/8 to 59 3/8, Bank One fell 1 to 41 and First Union dropped 1 1/4 to 41 9/16. These companies previously owned up to weaker earnings expectations. 

 Rate worries persisted, contributing to the pessimism in the session, as the yield on the long bond again crossed over 6%. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average, reeling for a third straight session, fell 176.04, a slide of 1.59%, to finish at 10914.13, effectively giving up all the gains built early last week, when optimism about earnings reigned. 

 Experts said thin trading left the market vulnerable to skittishness. Share volume on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to only 595.5 million shares, above the 553.1 million shares that changed hands Friday, in what proved the lightest trading day of 1999. Yesterday's total was the fourth-weakest this year. 

 "Today is what I call a triple `A' day," Michael LaTronica, director of research at HCFP/Brenner Securities, said. "Anxiety amplified by apathy." 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index finished 24.25 points lower, a drop of 1.80%, to end at 1324.02. 

 Fundamentally, the pessimism proved so consuming that investors greeted virtually all news developments with skepticism. AT&T shares lost ground, falling 1 1/2 to 46, even though the telecommunications giant expressed some confidence about its earnings outlook. AT&T said it expects to live up to analysts' profit goals this year. It also unveiled a new cut-rate residential pricing plan. 

 Other telecommunications stocks wavered in the session, including MCI WorldCom, which lost 2 7/16 to 76 1/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Sprint, which fell 2 3/8 to 44 3/4. Those companies introduced cut-rate residential cost plans earlier this month. 

 The selloff also torched a broad crosssection of stocks in the blue-chip ranks. Shares of consumer cyclicals declined on worries that consumer spending could slow if the Federal Reserve takes further action to constrict the economy's expansion. 

 General Motors fell 1 to 64 15/16, Maytag lost 1 9/16 to 65 3/16 and Centex declined 1 3/16 to 27 5/8. The loss by Centex, a Dallas home builder, occurred even though economic data released by the Commerce Department ahead of the session revealed new home sales in July rose to near-historic levels. The rise reflected strength in a sector of the market that economists thought would be weakened by rising interest rates. 

 The continued economic expansion rattled some consumer names, as shares of General Mills fell 1 1/8 to 84 3/4, Coca-Cola lost 1 3/16 to 60 7/8 and Clorox declined 1 1/2 to 43 5/8. The group tends to thrive when economic expansion contracts, and suffer in times of growth. 

 The interest-rate jitters also set back growth stocks. Shares of General Electric lost 2 5/16 to 114 1/4, Lucent Technologies fell 1 9/16 to 64 5/16 and Wal-Mart Stores declined 1 3/16 to 45 1/2. 

 Technology issues proved especially vulnerable to the concerns that higher rates will hurt valuations of growth stocks. Shares of Apple Computer, which had rallied impressively Friday despite a broad-market setback, gave up all those gains, falling 2 11/16 to 62 1/16. Cisco Systems lost 1 3/4 to 66 3/4. Exodus Communications fell 6 5/8 to 76 1/8. Adobe Systems lost 1 9/16 to 97 5/16, all on Nasdaq. 

 Most of the Internet sector finished weaker. America Online declined 5 7/8 to 93 1/4, Amazon.com dropped 9 1/4 to 119 1/4 on Nasdaq and eBay retreated 7 13/16 to 119 7/16, also on Nasdaq. Even some of last week's failsafe names, like Net2Phone, which declined 2 3/16 to 72 5/8, and Red Hat, which lost 4 1/4 to 75 9/16, lost ground on Nasdaq. 

 But some Internet names managed to escape the selloff. Shares of some companies that provide electronic-commerce services to businesses fared well. Shares of Scient climbed 11 11/16 to 63 11/16, after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the San Francisco company, which helps corporate clients build Internet sites. 

 Internet Capital Group, a Wayne, Pa., investor in Internet businesses, rose 5 3/8 to 58 7/8 on Nasdaq, reaching a 52-week high, after some of its underwriters, including Merrill Lynch, started coverage of the stock. 

 Network Associates moved up 1 5/8 to 17 3/16 on Nasdaq. SG Cowen raised its rating on the Santa Clara, Calif., provider of network securities services and software, saying the company's business recovery remains on track. Meanwhile, security-software developer VeriSign increased 3 to 105 3/8 on Nasdaq. 

 But worries about the earnings outlook for financial stocks dominated the session, as banking stocks tumbled, and pulled brokerage and consumer lenders down. 

 J.P. Morgan lost 3 to 130 3/4, Bank of America declined 3 11/16 to 60 1/16 and Citigroup lost 2 1/4 to 44 3/4. 

 "The interest-rate increase we got last week has been a factor, but the weaker fundamental conditions in the group were already present," Michael Mayo, the bank industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston who has been skeptical of the sector for several months, said. 

 Mr. Mayo said questions about asset quality at some banking names could prove troubling, and that capital-market activity faces challenges. 

 Brokerage names such as Merrill Lynch, which lost 4 3/4 to 74 7/8, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which declined 5 1/16 to 87 9/16, turned weaker, while American Express eased 4 15/16 to 139 11/16. 

 Fair Isaac fell 3 5/16 to 26 9/16. US Bancorp Piper Jaffray cut its rating on the stock of the San Rafael, Calif., company, which provides credit-screening services to consumer lenders. The analyst at Piper Jaffray cited concerns credit-card issuers could reduce their marketing efforts, which would hurt Fair Isaac's business. 

 Consumer lenders declined sharply amid the run-up in interest rates. Capital One Financial lost 2 11/16 to 36 13/16. Providian Financial declined 2 3/4 to 81. 

 AlliedSignal fell 2 7/16 to 61 13/16, while Honeywell lost 5 1/8 to 114 1/4. The European Union said it launched an indepth probe of the two U.S. manufacturers' plans to merge; the investigation could take up to four months to complete. But the companies said their planned merger is on track for completion by autumn. 

 Thomas & Betts advanced 2 to 44 13/16. The Memphis maker of electrical components said AFC Cable Systems, a Providence, R.I., maker of electrical and communications products, terminated the companies' merger agreement to accept an alternative proposal. AFC, a small-cap stock that added 5 3/8 to 40 7/8 on Nasdaq, said the offer valued the company at $45 a share, which it called "superior" to the agreement reached with Thomas & Betts in January. AFC didn't identify the maker of the alternative proposal. 

 H&R Block declined 15/16 to 55. Barrington Research cut its rating on the Kansas City, Mo., tax-preparation services provider. 

 Rockwell lost 1 5/8 to 59 13/16. Schroder lowered its rating on the Costa Mesa, Calif., avionics and communications-systems maker.

 Office Depot  Profit Warning  Hurts Rival Superstores >ODP

 PALO ALTO, Calif. (Dow Jones)--Shares of office superstores slid Tuesday as Office Depot Inc.'s (ODP) disappointing earnings outlook sparked a wave of selling in the sector. 

 Office Depot said Monday it would post second-half operating earnings of 38 cents to 40 cents a share, falling short of analysts' estimates by 12 cents to 14 cents a share. The Delray Beach, Fla., retailer said troubles from rising inventories of technology-related goods would weigh on results in the last two quarter of 1999. 

 Investors took Office Depot's troubles as an indication of weakness in the sector that includes OfficeMax Inc. (OMX) and Staples Inc. (SPLS), analysts said. 

 "This is mostly a company-specific issue," said Christopher Vroom, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco, who maintains a strong buy rating on Office Depot. 

 Vroom expects Office Depot to repair its problems and sees strong earnings growth in the next 12 to 18 months. 

 Office Depot said it would take charges of $62.5 million, or about 16 cents a share, in the third quarter. That includes a $28.3 million charge to speed up relocations and closures of underperforming stores, and a $34.2 million write-down on glutted inventory of office-technology products hurt by new technology. 

 Aram Rubinson, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York said that while Office Depot struggles with its inventory problems, Staples "continues to execute its business well." Rubinson cut his rating on Office Depot Tuesday to neutral from attractive. 

 One analyst that spoke on the condition of anonymity said Staples does a better job than its competitors of managing its inventory of personal computers. 

 "PC inventory carries huge risks because prices are perpetually declining," the analyst said. "Staples got burned in this earlier in the decade and is now much more careful with how they control inventory." 

 The analyst said Office Depot and OfficeMax are improving their inventory management of PCs, but lag Staples. 

 Thomas Weisel's Vroom said OfficeMax is also neglecting small businesses - a key group of customers that tend to spend more on higher-margin products and that are less fickle about products. 

 Though Office Depot's problems are isolated now, analysts say the competition is heating as superstores rush to open new locations. 

 "It would be myopic to think that as Office Depot accelerates its growth plan, the industry wouldn't be impacted," said Rubinson. 

 An analyst that asked to be unnamed said that while there aren't signs of decreased demand for office products, the sector is getting saturated with new-store openings at 300 to 400 a year. 

 "And they face competition from several other retailers and many other places sell this stuff," the analyst said. 

 Shares of OfficeMax were down 6.9%, or 9/16, to 7 9/16 on heavy volume of 3.2 million shares compared with a daily average of 565,543 shares. The stock is off its 52-week high of 12 1/2 on Jan. 4 and above its low of 6 5/8 on Oct. 8, 1998. 

 Staples stock was off 0.9%, or 3/16, to 21 3/4 on heavy volume of 31.4 million shares compared with daily average volume of 4.3 million shares. Staple's shares fell as low as 18 5/8 Tuesday. The stock was off its 52-week high of 35 15/16 on April 12 and above is low of 17 on Sept. 4, 1998. 


In recent composite trading, Office Depot shares were off 0.6%, or
1/16, to 10 7/16. Volume was heavy at 28.9 million shares, about 10
times average daily volume. The stock lost 26.6% on Monday, hitting a
52-week low of 10; the year high, set Jan. 6., is 26.

 Republic shares plunge after lowering profit view.

 MIAMI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Shares of Republic Services Inc.  lost a third of their value on Monday after the garbage hauler said it expected earnings growth for the year to be lower than previously forecast, joining the list of waste-management companies that have recently issued bad news. 

 Republic had said on Sunday it expected its 1999 diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time charges, to be between $1.17 and $1.19, below the $1.25 analysts had been expecting. 

 Wall Street's reaction was swift and powerful, sending the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company's stock down $5.25 to $11.25, its lowest since it was spun off last year from Republic Industries, the predecessor company to AutoNation Inc. . AutoNation was itself off $1.25 to $12.9375. 

 Republic's trading volume was 15,488,700 shares, making the issue the most active on the New York Stock Exchange Monday. 

 "It's a bad day at black rock," said Doug Augenthaler, an analyst at CIBC World Markets Corp. 

 BT Alex Brown cut its rating of the stock to buy from strong buy. Salomon Smith Barney lowered earnings estimates. 

 Republic Chief Financial Officer Tod Holmes said he was surprised by the market's reaction. 

 "We're surprised to see the reaction when what we're seeing is earnings growth in the range of 17 to 19 percent... We felt that we were already at a pretty low value," he told Reuters in an interview. 

 Republic also said in its announcement it was taking longer than anticipated to bring some acquisitions up to its performance standards. 

 It also said its $600 million fixed-rate public debt offering in the second quarter of 1999 further cut its earnings growth because the public debt was more expensive than borrowing under its floating-rate credit facility. 

 "Maybe we were a little overly optimistic about the extent of synergies that we would be able to achieve and also the timing - how quick that we would be able to get them out of the businesses that we were acquiring," Holmes said. 

 But he stressed that Republic's core business was still performing in line with its expectations, with internal growth on target to be between 6 and 8 percent for the year. 

 And he said the company had seen price increases of about 2 percent. 

 Analysts said Republic's stock was also hit because of a run of bad news among waste companies. 

 Waste Management Inc. , the nation's No. 1 trash hauler, in mid-August fired top officers, including President Rodney Proto, who had sold shares just before the company issued a profit warning. 

 Last week, U.S. Liquids Inc. said the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency were conducting an investigation after an unidentified employee alleged its Detroit waste treatment facility was illegally dumping hazardous material. 

 And also last week, Capital Environmental Resource Inc.  said it was having trouble getting credit in the wake of the Waste Management announcement. 

 "We now have a consensus that roughly half the industry isn't going to make the numbers," Augenthaler said.

 SANTA CRUZ, Calif., Aug 26 (Reuters) - Headset maker Plantronics Inc said on Thursday it sees its second quarter and year-end profits lower than consensus estimates because of a revised revenue outlook. 

 The Santa Cruz, California-based company said it expects to post earnings for fiscal year ending April 1, 2000 between $3.55 and $3.70 a share. 

 Wall Street had seen the company earning $3.79 a share, consensus estimates as tracked by First Call/Thomson Financial showed. 

 Plantronics said the low end of this range is seven percent lower than the highest current analyst estimate and the high end of the range is equal to the lowest analyst estimate. 

 The company said it now sees its second quarter earnings at "slightly less" than the $0.85 earned in the first quarter of fiscal 2000. First Call/Thomson Financial was expecting the company to post second quarter per share earnings of $0.89. 

 Plantronics said it sees revenues for the fiscal year in the $300 million to $305 million range, up from fiscal 1999 revenues of $286.3 million. 

 For the second fiscal quarter, Plantronics expects revenues of about $72 million, above the $71.2 million in revenues reported for the second quarter of fiscal 1999. 

 The company blamed the slower-than-expected revenue growth on a decline in demand from call centres and other factors.

 SANTA CRUZ, Calif., Aug 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Plantronics Inc. plunged by nearly a quarter on Friday after the maker of communications headsets warned profits for its fiscal year would fall short of Wall Street expectations. 

 Plantronics, based in Santa Cruz, Calif., fell as much as 25 percent to $53 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange before inching back to $54.38 in afternoon trading, for a loss of about 24 percent. 

 The drop came after the company late Thursday revised its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending April 2000, saying it expected to earn between $3.55 to $3.70 per share. 

 It said the high end of that range was equal to the lowest analyst estimate, and that the low end was 7 percent short of the highest current estimate. 

 Plantronics forecast earnings for the second quarter ending Sept. 25 would come in higher than the 74 cents in the year-ago period but below the 85 cents in its first quarter, when it posted net income of $15.4 million. 

 The revised outlook put revenues at $300 million to $305 million for the fiscal year, though the company did not say what previous estimates were. It said it expected revenues of $72 million for the second quarter, higher than the year-ago period but lower than the first quarter of the current year. 

 It blamed the lower profits on declining revenues, saying concerns over the year 2000 computer problem had caused customers to delay installation of new calling systems until next year. 

 "We believe that advance and contingency planning for the Year 2000 by call-centre managers and corporations worldwide is beginning to affect the current level of demand for our products," Plantronics Chief Executive Ken Kannappan said in a statement. 

 "This may intensify in the upcoming third quarter and continue through at least March 2000," Kannappan said. "While we have attempted to take these issues into account in our forecasts, the impact of the Year 2000 issues on our sales is new and uncertain." 

 Plantronics also said revenues were also hit in part by an inventory reduction plan by its biggest OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customer that would cut revenues by $7 million over the next six months, a bigger-than-expected impact. It did not identify the customer.

 Dave & Buster's stock drops after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Dave & Buster's Inc.  stock plunged more than 45 percent and analysts lowered ratings on the company on Friday, a day after the restaurant chain said its second-quarter profits would fall well below Wall Street expectations. 

 Dave & Buster's said mild early-summer weather - which leads to more outdoor activities and fewer restaurant visits - and weak performance at its West Coast stores would result in second-quarter earnings of 14 to 16 cents a share, down from 21 cents a year earlier. 

 Analysts had expected the company to earn 28 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks estimates. 

 Dave & Buster's also said same-store sales were down 2.2 percent in the second quarter, ended Aug. 1. 

 Dave & Buster's stock was down $11.19 at midday Friday to $13.69, a new low since the shares moved to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq stock market in May. The previous low was $23.25, reached just last week. 

 Andrew Barish, a restaurant analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens, lowered his rating on Dave & Buster's to "long-term attractive" from "buy." He cut his 1999 earnings per share estimate to $1.10 from $1.34 and his 2000 estimate to $1.55 from $1.75. 

 "It appears as if there were management issues with the southern California locations that have led to weaker results in those units, particularly considering the competing breadth of entertainment/attraction alternatives in that marketplace," Barish said in a research report. 

 Allan Hickok, a restaurant analyst at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, also lowered his rating on the stock, to "buy" from "strong buy." Hickok cut his 1999 earnings estimate to $1.10 per share from $1.33, and his 2000 estimate to $1.55 from $1.72. 

 The company said Thursday it had identified the "operational issues" that led to the West Coast shortfall. Barish said three general managers and the regional manager had been replaced. 

 "While we anticipate there will be some carry-over into the third quarter, our expectation is that our fourth-quarter results will be back to what we in the company and our shareholders expect," said Dave Corriveau, co-founder of Dave & Buster's Inc. ((-New York Newsdesk 212 859-1700)).

 Petrochemical profit estimate drops

 HOUSTON - After a warning from Houston-based Lyondell Chemical Co., financial analysts have lowered their third-quarter earnings estimates for many petrochemical companies by as much as one-half. 

 Analysts are concerned about the impact of sharply rising prices for feedstocks derived from crude oil and natural gas. 

 The companies use feedstocks such as naphtha and ethane to make plastics, chemicals and products such as antifreeze. 

 Prices for polyethylene and other products of the companies have risen, but not as quickly as the price of feedstocks, analyst Paul Leming of ING Barings in New York told the Houston Chronicle. 

 The feedstock ethane, derived from natural gas, rose from 17 cents a gallon during the third quarter of last year to an average of 32 cents this quarter, trading as high as 411/2 cents, according to industry sources. 

 Naphtha has increased from about 30 cents a year ago to about 50 cents per gallon now. 

 Meanwhile, the price of polyethylene that the companies sell rose by about 50 percent during the first half of the year, Leming said. 

 Chemical companies typically can't raise prices right away to reflect higher costs, said Lyondell spokeswoman Jackie Wilson. 

 On Tuesday, Lyondell Chief Operating Officer Morris Gelb warned analysts in New York that earnings estimates weren't factoring in rising feedstock costs. Lyondell didn't make any precise forecasts. 

 As a result of the warning, Leming cut Lyondell's third-quarter profit estimate from 20 cents per share to 10 cents. 

 By late Wednesday, First Call Corp. had counted three downward revisions by analysts - from 25 cents to 10 cents, 5 cents to break-even, and 20 cents profit to a loss of 15 cents per share, said Chris Maher of First Call. 

 Lyondell's stock price dropped Wednesday by $1, or about 6 percent, to close at $15.50. 

 Other chemical companies saw their shares lose value as well, including Dow Chemical, Union Carbide and Millennium Chemicals.

 In Aug. 25 item headlined "CA shareholders reject executive compensation curb," please read in 6th paragraph ... Chief Executive Charles Wang received stock then valued at $645 million ... (Eliminates erroneous reference to Wang's position on Forbes magazine list.) 

 A corrected repetition follows: 

 ISLANDIA, N.Y., Aug 25 (Reuters) - Computer Associates International Inc. shareholders on Wednesday rejected a proposal to limit the stock compensation of some of the software company's top executives. 

 Nearly 96 percent of shareholders voted against or abstained on a proposal to limit the extent to which the company could reward its top executives with stock. The motion gave some support to management after a year of a steep share price slide and its results hurt by weakness in Asia and year 2000 computer concerns. 

 Computer Associates, the No. 3 U.S. software supplier, became a focal point in the debate over excessive executive compensation last year. A shareholder-approved plan linked to the company's share price performance rewarded its three top executives stock then valued at more than $1.1 billion. 

 "A billion dollars is out of control," said Roger Rath, a shareholder submitted the proposal, suggesting compensation be "expressed as a multiple of pay of the lowest-paid worker at CA." 

 "To take that much from the assets of the company affects the health of the company," said Rath, who owns 200 shares, in a telephone interview. 

 Chief Executive Charles Wang received stock then valued at $645 million. He is among the highest paid executives in the high-tech industry. 

 About two months after the bonus, the company warned that its corporate clients would be curbing spending due to year 2000 fixes and troubles in Asia. Soon after the profit warning, the company's share price lost 30 percent of its value and CA was hit with a shareholder lawsuit that is still pending in federal court. 

 Outside the shareholder meeting here at which the vote was taken, shareholders who voted against the compensation measure said the stock had largely recovered from that decline. 

 "I'm hoping they will be able to maintain their line," said Billy Star-Librizzi, one of those who voted against the measure. "It seems the company is able to attract some talent (by using stock)." 

 The vote may alleviate some of the pressure Computer Associates has felt from disgruntled shareholders, said Brown Brothers Harriman analyst Dawn Simon. 

 "This executive-compensation issue is a last remaining sore spot," Simon said. 

 Issues facing Computer Associates now include whopping debt after the company's acquisition of rival Platinum Technology Inc. in a fiscally aggressive style which is not new to Comuter Associates. 

 Forbes last year quoted Wang, who in 1976 was trading computer services for free rent in Manhattan while he started the company, as saying "When we ran out of money we ran out and got a new credit card." 

 In June 1999, the company replaced its two revolving credit agreeements totalling $2.6 billion with three new agreements totalling $4.5 billion in order to pay for costs related to the tender offer for Platinum's outstanding shares. 

 Last month, Standard & Poor's lowered its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on CA to triple-'B'-plus from single - A'-minus, the downgrade reflecting the company's weakened financial profule and management's aggressive financial policy. 

 "It's unusual for a technology company to be that highly leveraged," said Simon.

 Bank One Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank, warned that its 1999 earnings are likely to be as much as 8% below Wall Street expectations because of slower-than-expected growth in its credit card unit. Bank One said its operating earnings per share probably would be between $3.60 and $3.65. Wall Street had been expecting 1999 profit of about $3.92 a share. Bank One, based in Chicago, said an unexpectedly high number of First USA customers were switching to other credit card issuers as they offer more attractive rates. That, in turn, has forced First USA to cut its interest rates on some new accounts and lower expectations for the second half of the year. Bank One shares fell 44 cents to close at $55.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. It issued its profit warning after U.S. markets closed.

 Analysts  Cut  3Q Views On Lyondell's  Profit Warning  >LYO

 DALLAS (Dow Jones)--Analysts slashed their third-quarter earnings estimates for Lyondell Chemical Co. (LYO) after the company warned them that rising feed-stock costs were squeezing profits more than expected. 

 "We have seen a pretty significant run-up in feed-stock costs," said Morris Gelb, chief operating officer for Lyondell, in an interview. "There was a view the run-up would abate going into the third quarter, but in fact it's continued." Company executives met with analysts on Tuesday in New York. 

 Chemical companies began to feel the squeeze from rising oil prices at the end of the second quarter - but it's hitting them hardest now. Generally it takes up to two months for price increases to be passed along to customers. 

 The profit squeeze isn't just Lyondell's problem. All petrochemical companies should see earnings suffer in the quarter - a disappointment since many had hoped prices would stabilize and lead to improved profits in the second half of the year. Analysts are taking a second look at their estimates for companies including Union Carbide Corp.(UK), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Millennium Chemicals Inc. (MCH). 

 Estimates for Lyondell's third quarter already had ranged widely, from 25 cents to 5 cents a share, as analysts grappled with a number of fluid factors, including rising ethylene prices, plant shutdowns, increasing demand and a rebound in the energy business. The consensus estimate was as high as 20 cents in the quarter, but quickly dropped as analysts began trimming their numbers. 

 Merrill Lynch & Co.'s John Roberts took his estimate down to break even from 20 cents a share following Lyondell's comments. ING Barings analyst Paul Leming dropped his estimate to 10 cents a share from 20 cents, saying rising feed-stock costs have more than offset the product price increases that have been realized throughout the ethylene chain this year. 

 P.J. Juvekar of Salomon Smith Barney also dropped his estimate to 10 cents from 20 cents. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. analyst Don Carson retained his estimate, already at the low end, at 5 cents a share. 


   Propylene Prices Also Rise



In a research note, Carson observed that not only was Lyondell getting
squeezed with higher feed stocks in its ethylene business, but that the
propylene oxide business it acquired through its purchase of Arco
Chemical also was suffering from rising propylene prices. While upticks
in ethylene prices should help margins in that business, propylene oxide
margins are expected to suffer from the addition of new capacity in
Europe later this year, he noted.



The news wasn't all bad from Lyondell, though: "Basic business
conditions continue to be good," said Gelb. "Demand is strong, volumes
are strong and we are having success in raising prices in most of our
product lines." He said Lyondell should feel some relief from the profit
squeeze as product prices catch up "over the next quarter or two."



Gelb also laid out Lyondell's priorities to raise cash and pay off
debt, as the Houston-based company remains one of the highest leveraged
in the industry.



Gelb said Lyondell is looking for opportunities to sell assets,
including some of the Arco businesses. "The Lyondell enterprise was put
together in a relatively short period of time, and we're still in the
process of evaluating our business portfolio and looking at various
options for adjusting that portfolio," he said.



Gelb confirmed that Lyondell is interested in acquiring Millennium's
29.5% stake in its Equistar ethylene joint venture, but said it is not a
top priority. Lyondell owns a 41% stake in Equistar, with Millennium and
Occidenial Petroleum Corp. (OXY) owning 29.5% each. Millennium has said
it wants to sell its share, but "we feel no urgency or need to change
that configuration," said Gelb.

 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street was paring losses in mid-afternoon trading Wednesday after a profit warning at Bank One Corp. sent financial stocks lower. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) was down 2 points, or 0.02 percent, at 11,281. But the Nasdaq composite .IXIC) was up 38 points, or 1.39 percent, to 2,790. The Standard & Poor 500 index .SPX) was up 9 points at 1,373. 

 "The market just has a very favourable tone. The Fed's gotten out of the way and the market can focus on earnings," said Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management in Garden City, N.Y. 

 He said third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 stocks are expected 20 percent higher than a year ago. "It looks like the S&P wants to go to 1,400 near term," he said. 

 However, decliners edged out advancers on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,393 stocks moving ahead compared with 1,514 in decline. 

 "Breadth is still not that great," Truicko said. "It looks like the money is all in the technology stocks. It's a narrow rally." 

 TheStreet.com's Internet index .DOT) was up 13 points, or 2.4 percent, at 577. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up 30/32, lowering the yield to 5.86 percent. 

 "There is a continued rally in the bond market. That's very positive for equities, very positive for the growth sector of the market," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc. "Growth stocks should start to take leadership again." 

 Bank One Corp. shares were down 13, or 23 percent, at 42-13/16 after the nation's largest credit card issuer said it expects 1999 operating earnings to fall short of analysts' estimates as a result of competition in the credit card market and some internal missteps. 

 Among the Dow's financial components, American Express was down 3-13/16 at 144-1/16; J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. was down 2-12/16 at 137-9/16; and Citigroup Inc. was down 1-1/8 at 47-3/4. 

 "I think the weakness in the financials is directly related to Bank One," Hyman said. "The sector is slowing, according to the chairman of Bank One." 

 On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee raised the federal funds rate and discount rate as well as adopted a neutral stance regarding rates for the near term. 

 "There's still enough enthusiasm from the Fed rate hike that this is likely to be the last hike for the calendar year," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co.

 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were mixed at midday on Wednesday as Wall Street's optimism on interest rates was tempered by a profit warning from the nation's largest credit card issuer, Bank One Corp. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 59 points, or 0.53 percent, at 11,224. But the Nasdaq composite rose 11 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,763. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up 23/32, lowering the yield to 5.88 percent. 

 "There is a continued rally in the bond market. That's very positive for equities, very positive for the growth sector of the market," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc. "Growth stocks should start to take leadership again." 

 Bank One Corp. shares were down 12-13/16, or 23 percent, at 43 after it said it expects 1999 operating earnings to fall short of analysts' estimates as a result of competition in the credit card market and some internal missteps. 

 Among the Dow's financial components, American Express was down 4-1/2 at 143-3/8; J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. was down 3-8/16 at 136-13/16; and Citigroup Inc. was down 1-3/4 at 47-1/8. 

 "I think the weakness in the financials is directly related to Bank One," Hyman said. "The sector is slowing, according to the chairman of Bank One." 

 The Dow likely would continue to see-saw as it did after the Fed news Tuesday, said Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. But the Nasdaq stocks should outperform, based on the outlook for interest rates, he said. 

 On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, raised the federal funds rate and adopted a neutral stance regarding rates for the near term. Tuesday's increase raises the rate for overnight loans between banks to 5.25 percent from 5.0 percent. The Fed also increased the discount rate to 4.75 percent from 4.5 percent. 

 "There's still enough enthusiasm from the Fed rate hike that this is likely to be the last hike for the calendar year," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. 

 "But the critical point for me is to see what happens this afternoon," Coolidge said. "What's going to be the next catalyst to push the market higher? I just don't see what that is. We're still in a higher interest rate period." 

 Hyman said that while he is pleased to see the revival in drug and pharmaceutical companies, the media sector looked like it may be headed for trouble. 

 "It had a great three-year run," Hyman said. "But they didn't perform as well in the last two rallies." 

 Also troubling, he said, was the hit Time Warner Inc. took Tuesday after Merrill Lynch's analyst cut her earnings estimates for the media giant. The stock was trading as low as 60 Tuesday, compared with its close Monday at 66-3/16. At midday Wednesday, the stock was trading at 60-15/16. 

 The technology sector was also making gains on Wednesday, with TheStreet.com's Internet index up 5 points, or 0.96 percent, at 569. Amazon.com Inc. was up 4-7/16 at 124-1/2; eBay Inc. was up 4-5/8 at 123-1/2 and Inktomi Corp. was up 5-9/16 at 115-13/16.

 ISLANDIA, N.Y., Aug 25 (Reuters) - Computer Associates International Inc. shareholders on Wednesday rejected a proposal to limit the compensation of some of the big software company's top executives. 

 In a motion supporting management after a year that saw Computer Associates's share price slide and its results hurt by weakness in Asia and year 2000 computer concerns, 95.8 percent of shareholders voted against or abstained on a proposal to limit the extent to which the company could reward its top executives with stock. 

 Last year Computer Associates, the No. 3 U.S. software supplier, became a focal point in the debate over executive compensation after its three top executives received stock then valued at more than $1.1 billion in a shareholder-approved plan linked to the company's share price performance. 

 But just two months later, the shares had fallen more than 30 percent after the company warned that its corporate clients would be curbing spending due to year 2000 fixes and troubles in Asia. Soon after the profit warning, the company was hit with a shareholder lawsuit that is still pending in federal court.

 NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Bank One Corp., the biggest U.S. credit card issuer, sank in early trade Tuesday, hit by a profit warning that dragged down other credit card stocks. 

 In a wave of downgrades, analysts cut their ratings on Bank One stock and shares of other leading credit card issuers. 

 Bank One resumed trading about 10:14 a.m. (1414 GMT) after an earlier order-imbalance delay on the New York Stock Exchange. It was down 13-13/16 at 42 in composite trade. 

 Bank One, the No. 5 U.S. bank in terms of assets and the biggest issuer of credit cards through its First USA unit, warned Tuesday that 1999 operating earnings would be between $3.60 and $3.65 a share, short of Wall Street forecasts of $3.92 a share. 

 Bank One blamed strong competition in the credit card market and some internal missteps for the expected shortfall. 


Among other credit card shares, American Express Co. , part of the Dow Jones industrial average	 , fell 4-11/16 to 143-3/16. American Express was among volume leaders on the New York Stock Exchange.

 HOUSTON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Waste Management Inc.  said Tuesday that Donald Chappel will serve as chief financial officer of the beleagured company, replacing Earl DeFrates who resigned in July. 

 Chappel, 47, was vice president and acting chief financial officer of Waste Management from October 1997 until its merger with USA Waste Services Inc. in July 1998. He will now serve as executive vice president as well as CFO. 

 In mid-August, Waste Management fired top officers including President Rodney Proto, who had sold shares just before the company issued a profit warning. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting a formal investigation of Waste Management's financial statements and accounting policies. The New York Stock Exchange is reviewing trading in the stock prior to the profit warning. 

 The nation's No. 1 trash hauler has had to restate results for the first half of the year and lowered its target for second quarter earnings. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's cut their ratings on the company last week. 

 "I am very pleased that Don has agreed to step in during this critical time," said Ralph Whitworth, chairman of Waste Management, in a statement. 

 Shares of Waste Management slid 11/16 on the New York Stock Exchange to 22-3/4 in the early morning, well below their one-year high of 60 and just above their one-year low of 21-1/2.

 SAAB Reports 

 60% Increase 

 In Operating Profit 

 LINKOEPING, Sweden -- Saab AB said it posted a 60% rise in first-half operating profit and that it expects a rise in operating profit for the full year as well. 

 Pretax profit rose by 52% to 721 million kronor (82.2 million euros) from 475 million kronor, the Swedish military aircraft maker said. 

 One reason for the improvement is progress on cost restructuring, the company said. The shutdown of the company's regional aircraft production also has been less costly than expected, resulting in a reduction in the reserves set aside to cover the costs, Saab said. 

 A more accurate cost estimate could be made once regional production had ceased, allowing a 174 million kronor cash infusion in second-quarter results. 

 Saab noted that it has received formal requests from Chile and the Czech Republic, both potential buyers, for further information about its fighter aircraft JAS 39 Gripen. In addition, final negotiations are continuing with South Africa regarding the purchase of 28 Gripen aircraft, it said. 

 In 1998, Saab had operating profit of 875 million kronor, and so far this year it has already reached 549 million kronor. 

 Operating profit improved within all business areas apart from the largest military aerospace division, which includes Gripen. That division saw operating profit fall to 237 million kronor from 286 million kronor mainly due to higher development costs for the export version of Gripen. Sales increased 27% to 2.88 billion kronor, however. Military aerospace makes up 60% of Saab's total sales. 

 FTi to Buy 155 Travel Agencies 

 LONDON -- Britain's Airtours PLC said its associate, Frosch Touristik GmbH, had agreed to buy 155 travel agencies operating under the Allkauf brand in Germany for some GBP 9.4 million (14.2 million euros). 

 FTi is buying the business from Real Group, which is itself part of Metro AG, Europe's largest retail group. 

 Airtours owns some 36% of FTi and has an option for a full takeover in 2002. Germany is one of the key markets in Europe's consolidating package-holiday market. Metro operates Germany's largest hypermarkets through Real Group, and FTi will have the right to open travel agencies in new and refurbished Real stores. 

 Rolls-Royce Buys Cooper Unit 

 LONDON -- Aerospace, defense and energy group Rolls-Royce PLC said it has acquired the rotating-compression-equipment unit of Cooper Energy Services for $180 million (168.8 million euros). 

 Cooper Energy Services is part of Cooper Cameron Corp., Mount Vernon, Ohio. Roll-Royce said it will take full control of the joint-venture company, Cooper Rolls, and the Cooper Bessemer trade name for compression systems. The company will also acquire the EnTronic division, which makes control systems for compression-and reciprocating-equipment packages. 

 Rolls-Royce said it will control manufacturing sites in Mount Vernon, Ohio, Hengelo in the Netherlands, and Liverpool in the U.K., among others. The deal is subject to regulatory approval. 

 Brown & Jackson to Pay Dividend 

 LONDON -- U.K. discount retailer Brown & Jackson PLC announced a dividend for the first time in six years Friday after reporting a massive rise in profit for the year ended June 26. 

 The group, the owner of store chains Poundstretcher, Your More Store and What Everyone Wants, also said it still hasn't received due-diligence information from potential bid target Allied Carpets PLC, having made an initial offer approach more than a month ago. 

 Shareholders will receive a final payout of 2.5 pence a share and Brown & Jackson said it intends to continue paying one dividend per year in the future. 

 Pretax profit surged to GBP 22.2 million before exceptional items from GBP 8.8 million the year before, well above forecasts of around GBP 19 million.

 Sears, Wal-Mart Face FAA Fines 

 CHICAGO -- The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is proposing fines against the nation's two largest retailers for allegedly violating hazardous materials regulations. 

 Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are accused of shipping hazardous materials without using the proper packaging and inadequately labeling them. 

 The FAA increased its number of hazardous material inspectors after 110 people were killed in the May 1996 crash in the Everglades of a ValuJet airliner, spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said. The crash was attributed to mislabeled oxygen canisters, which caused a fire. 

 The FAA alleges Bensonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart on May 11, 1998, improperly offered a shipment containing dry chemical fire extinguishers for transport by Airborne Express from a facility in Hermiston, Oregon, to Seymour, Indiana. 

 Wal-Mart spokesman John Bisio said the company is examining its shipping procedures."We safely ship thousands of cases of merchandise every day. We take this matter very seriously and are cooperating with the FAA fully on this," he said. 

 The FAA is accusing Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears of giving a garden tractor battery that contained corrosive materials and explosive gases to Airborne Express on Oct. 1. The package was shipped to Airborne's sorting facility in Wilmington, Ohio, where the ground crew noticed acid stains on the container's exterior. 

 Dillard's Net Income Falls by 25% 

 Dillard's Inc. said poor performance at stores acquired last year resulted in an unexpected 25% drop in fiscal second-quarter net income. It also warned the trend could follow it into the third quarter. 

 The Little Rock, Arkansas, department-store chain said net income for the quarter ended July 31 fell to $36 million (33.8 million euros), or 34 U.S. cents a diluted share, from $48 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 26% to $1.96 billion, while net sales gained 26% to $1.89 billion. 

 Wall Street analysts had expected net income of 48 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Dillard's blamed the drop on 65 new stores it gained from the $2.9 billion acquisition of Mercantile Stores Co. The company said sales declined initially last year and said it expected a somewhat smaller decline this year as it moved the new stores away from their traditional promotional markdowns. With that in mind, Dillard's staffed and stocked the stores beyond levels supported by their sales.

 Maruti Issues Profit Warning

 NEW DELHI -- Indian car maker Maruti Udyog Ltd. may see a further drop in its profit for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, newly appointed Managing Director Jagdish Khattar said Friday. 

 "Profitability will be less this year because of the absorption of the impact of the price cut," Mr. Khattar said in his first public comments since he took charge as managing director last Tuesday. Maruti is a 50-50 joint venture between the Indian government and Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. 

 In the second half of last fiscal year, Maruti upgraded three of its top selling models -- the 800cc mini car, Omni, a mini van, and Esteem, a 1300cc luxury car -- without passing on the cost to customers. Mr. Khattar said the impact of the indirect price cut will be fully felt in this fiscal year as it was introduced only in the second half of last year. 

 For the year ended March 31, Maruti's net profit fell 20% to 5.22 billion rupees (112.3 million euros) from 6.52 billion rupees in the previous fiscal year. 

 Mr. Khattar didn't make any forecast for the net profit this fiscal year but said he expects sales to be around 90 billion rupees, compared with 81.18 billion rupees last year. 

 Jakarta Sets Pertamina Deadline 

 JAKARTA -- Legislators and the government agreed to give state-owned oil company Pertamina two years to become an independent company, the minister of mines and energy said. 

 Kuntoro Mangkusubroto added that after two years as a private company, Pertamina will be given preference to handle a certain working zone for a transition period of up to five years. During the period, Pertamina will need a business license to manage the zone. 

 "If after five years Pertamina is proven to be unable to handle the zone, the license to manage the working zone will then be tendered by the government," Mr. Kuntoro said. 

 The deal on Pertamina was part of a draft law for the natural gas and oil industry, which Parliament is expected to pass in the plenary session Sept. 6.

 Dun & Bradstreet Issues Gloomy Outlook

 NEW YORK -- Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s disclosure that it won't meet third-quarter or full-year earnings expectations sent its shares sliding 17% and raised concerns among analysts about the health of the company's U.S. credit-information business. 

 The financial information and credit-rating company said the results stemmed from an "aberration" -- a weaker-than-expected July performance at its U.S. Dun & Bradstreet Operating Co. unit. 

 But analysts said they aren't sure how deep the unit's problems go -- or whether the company even knows. The profit warning followed softer-than-expected revenue growth for the unit in the second quarter. 

 One fear: that corporate customers are simply getting information elsewhere and dropping the service. "Are they using the product?" asked James Dougherty, a Prudential Securities analyst. "That is really the issue, and I think it's a little bit scary." 

 Dun & Bradstreet shares closed Friday at $25.50 (23.92 euros), down $5.1875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company made its announcement Thursday after the close of markets. 

 The Murray Hill, New Jersey, company said it won't meet third-quarter targets of 40 cents to 41 cents a share and will post full-year earnings of between $1.62 and $1.65 a diluted share, at least 5% below analysts' expectations of $1.75, according to a First Call/Thomson Financial survey. The company said revenue will be flat with 1998 revenue of $1.93 billion. 

 The company said July revenue for the U.S. segment of the D&B operating unit was down 13%, leading to an 8% revenue decline for the unit overall. The company said its Moody's Investors Service unit, which provides credit ratings and debt analysis, exceeded expectations in July. 

 Mr. Dougherty said the company in recent years shifted to a sales format based in part on customer usage, from one based mainly on annual contracts -- a move that may haunt the company if its information services are increasingly deemed less relevant. 

 The company said it is reorganizing its sales force in the U.S. operating company unit as part of its effort to improve performance. A company spokesman said he "wouldn't disagree" with an analyst's suggestion that the reorganization may have distracted the sales force. The spokesman declined to elaborate further on the company's earnings announcement. 

 Analysts remain upbeat about the company's long-term prospects, particularly because of its huge corporate database and powerhouse brands. Still, Merrill Lynch analyst Lauren Rich Fine, in a report released Friday, said the company's ability to deliver consistent double-digit earnings growth "has officially been shaken."

 Dun & Bradstreet's  Profit Warning  Disappoints Investors

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)-Investors Friday showed their disappointment with Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s announcement a day earlier that it anticipated an earnings shortfall for the third quarter and the full year, though at least one analyst said the warning shouldn't have come as such a surprise. 

 After the market closed Thursday, the Murray Hill, N.J.-based financial-services and publishing company said it didn't expect to meet analysts' earnings estimates of 40 cents to 41 cents a share for the third quarter and $1.73 to $1.75 a share for 1999. 

 At the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) were down $5.188, or 17%, at $25.50 in active trading. 

 Dun & Bradstreet said Thursday that July revenue and operating income for the U.S. unit of its Dun & Bradstreet operating company were substantially below expectations and year-ago levels. The U.S. unit's 13% decline in July revenue from the previous year led to an 8% revenue decline for the entire unit. 

 Dun & Bradstreet Corp. consists of the Dun & Bradstreet operating company - a leading provider of business-to-business credit, marketing and purchasing information and receivables and management services - and Moody's Investors Service, a debt-rating service and provider of analytical and financial information for capital-market investors. 

 Following the company's warning, Prudential Securities Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. downgraded their ratings on Dun & Bradstreet. 

 Prudential analyst James Dougherty said the anticipated miss surprised Wall Street but shouldn't have, because it is an extension of Dun & Bradstreet's second-quarter problems. "They are getting worse," he said. 

 When it posted second-quarter earnings last month, D&B said revenue growth at the operating company was softer than expected and that the unit's revenue growth would likely fall below the prior target range of 4% to 6%, possibly resulting in a revenue growth shortfall for the entire company. 

 According to a research note by Merrill Lynch analyst Lauren Rich Fine, "confidence was not high to begin with after the second-quarter revenue shortfall, yet credibility of consistent double-digit EPS growth had been established." 

 Dun & Bradstreet hasn't offered a credible explanation, according to Dougherty. 

 On Thursday, D&B Chief Executive called July's revenue and operating-income performance of the operating company's U.S. unit an "aberration" in the core credit-services business. 

 However, Prudential's Dougherty believes Dun & Bradstreet's aberration indicates a more fundamental change in the importance of commercial-credit ratings to American businesses. To him, D&B's latest warning demonstrates "customers are not using something they already contracted to pay for." 

 Seventy percent of the operating company's business is contracted on an annual basis, but customers are billed and revenue is recognized when customers use the services. At the end of the year, if the contracted-for services aren't used, D&B and its customers negotiate a new contract where usually the unused services are held over to the following year. 

 "What it really means is a contract of less value results," according to Dougherty, because often the amount of new business is reduced, if contracted for at all. 

 The more pressing question is "why renew the service if you don't use it," Dougherty questioned. The Prudential analyst lowered his earnings estimates to $1.63 a share from $1.75 a share for fiscal 1999, and to $1.77 a share from $1.92 a share for fiscal 2000. 

 Merrill's Fine found the operating company's July decline "unfathomable" because the amount of contractual business "would have provided some visibility to better growth later in the year." 

 For the time being, Fine believes the "near-term operating performance and the overall negative D&B persona lead (her) to believe that the share performance will be more muted near term than (she) had originally expected. The ability to deliver consistent double-digit EPS growth has officially been shaken, and the ability to drive top line growth remains to be seen."

 NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks held onto most of their gains at midday Friday following a week of volatility in typically thin, summertime trading. 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  was up 62 points, or 0.57 percent, at 11,026. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 14 points, or 0.54 percent, at 2,635.


 The U.S. Treasury 30-year bond rose 14/32 with the yield sliding to 6.01 percent from 6.03 percent Thursday. 

 "It's the kind of market we've been having: two steps forward, two steps back," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y. "Since May, we haven't gone very far." 

 Overall, the market has been in a state of change since the fourth quarter of last year, Johnson said, with the economy moving into a period of rising inflation and higher interest rates. 

 He expects the stock market's returns to drop from 20 percent per year down to 8 percent to 10 percent. 

 "Things are getting more normal. The days of wine and roses are over," Johnson said. "It takes people time to wake up to that fact." 

 On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy setting committee, meets to decide whether to raise interest rates. Most analysts expect a 25 basis points increase in short-term interest rates. 

 But Johnson said he would give 30 percent odds the Fed will not raise rates on Tuesday, but merely change its bias to tightening, indicating it may raise rates in the future. 

 If that happens, bonds and stocks would rally on the surprise, Johnson predicted. 

 Friday's "double witching" expiration of stock options and futures added to volatility. 

 "I think the double witch is the key to it," said Arnie Owen, managing director of capital markets at Cruttenden Roth in Newport Beach, Calif. 

 In the news, copper producers Asarco Inc.  and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. , said Phelps Dodge Corp.  made an unsolicited bid to buy both companies in a stock deal. Asarco was up 2-9/16 at 21, Cyprus was up 1-15/16 at 16-7/17, and Phelps Dodge rose 1-15/16 to 60-1/2. 


There were big gainers among stocks that made their Wall Street debut, with Agile Software Inc.	   , Mypoints.com	    and Looksmart Ltd  in the top three spots on the Nasdaq percentage-gain leaders board.



Agile was up 27, or 130 percent, at 48. Mypoints was up 7-5/16, or 90 percent, at 15-5/16. Looksmart was up 8, or 66 percent, at 20.



Telecommunications stocks were lower after Lehman Brothers cut its rating on the long-distance phone company Sprint Corp.  due to competitive pressures in the industry.



Sprint was down 4-1/8 at 44-7/8; AT&T Corp. , a component of the Dow 30, was down 1-3/16 at 47, and MCI WorldCom  fell 1-7/16 to 74-5/16.



Other active stocks included Ditech Communications, , up 17-1/2 at 51 after the telecommunications equipment maker reported an increase in first-quarter earnings and predicted an unexpected order would increase sales as much as $15 million.



Business information company Dun & Bradstreet Corp.  fell 4-1/8 to 26-9/16 after the company issued a profit warning on Thursday.



Quest Software Inc.  was up 7-1/4 at 43-1/2. The Newport Beach, Calif.-based software products company held its initial public offering Aug. 13, priced at $14.



Department store chain Dillard's Inc.  lost 6-7/16 at 23-1/8 after reporting a 25 percent drop in quarterly profits.

 NEW YORK, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks forged ahead in late morning trading Friday with blue chips getting a lift on double witching day. 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  was up 73 points, or 0.674 percent, at 11,037. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 14 points, or 0.54 percent, at 2,635.

 "Today is one of those starts instead of stops. Not that that means much, though," he said. 

 The "double witching" expiration of stock options and futures added to volatility as traders close out positions. 

 "I think the double witch is the key to it," said Arnie Owen, managing director of capital markets at Cruttenden Roth in Newport Beach, Calif. 

 On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy setting committee, meets to decide whether to raise interest rates. Analyst expect a 25 basis points increase in short-term interest rate, which they assume the market has already taken into account. 

 "The market is waiting for a catalyst to move it forward and it expects that catalyst to be the (Federal Reserve) meeting Tuesday," said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 

 In the news, copper producers Asarco Inc.  and Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. , said Phelps Dodge Corp.  made an unsolicited bid to buy both companies in a stock deal. Asarco was up 1/16 at 18-1/2, Cyprus was down 1/4 at 14-1/4, and Phelps Dodge rose 2/16 to 58-11/16.

 Retailer Saks punished for over-aggressive targets.

 CHICAGO, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Investors severely punished Saks Inc. on Wednesday, a day after the department store operator said its sales and earnings targets for 1999 were over-aggressive and would not be met. 

 By afternoon, shares of the Birmingham, Alabama-based company were down 23 percent, dropping 5-5/16 to 18-1/16 in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading. It was among the five biggest percentage losers on the Big Board. 

 Late Tuesday, Saks, which is best known for its Saks Fifth Avenue luxury department stores, said its second quarter profits before special items more than doubled to $26.6 million as sales rose 11 percent, but it warned that its profits for the full year would fall short of expectations. 

 The company, which also owns a number of regional department store chains like Younkers, Parisian and Carson Pirie Scott, said it expected to earn $1.80 a share for the year - well shy of the $2.10 to $2.25 a share range that Wall Street analysts had expected. 

 "We were likely too aggressive in our prior expectations of EPS (earnings per share) growth rate of 29 to 38 percent during a year in which we simultaneously attempted to integrate Saks Fifth Avenue, integrate the Mercantile stores and a host of other strategic initiatives," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R. Brad Martin said on a conference call Wednesday. 

 "We are making a lot of progress, but we are not making progress fast enough to achieve an earnings growth rate of 30 to 40 percent," he said. He added that even at $1.80 a share EPS for this year, the company would be generating about 10 percent profit growth, a level he called a solid achievement. 

 The company, formerly known as Proffitt's Inc. until it acquired Saks Holdings Inc. last September, blamed the lowered earnings guidance on lower-than-expected gross margins at Saks Fifth Avenue and weaker-than-planned performance from the 15 Mercantile Stores it acquired late last year. 

 It also cited a lower-than-planned contribution from its credit card business and increased spending on its Internet initiative. 

 Martin said he was not prepared to issue formal earnings guidance for next year. 

 But he said a 15 percent growth rate from 1999 levels could be reached by using a model based on the company's earnings forecast for this year and a 3.0 percent comparable-store sales increase. 

 Such a model also assumes the addition of one million square feet of retail space; modest improvements in merchandise margins and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs; and the completion of synergies from last year's merger. 

 The profit warning led to a string of downward earnings revisions and reduced investment ratings by Wall Street firms including PaineWebber, Goldman Sachs, ING Barings, Merrill Lynch and Banc of America Securities. 

 ING Barings analyst Kimberly Walin said in a report she lowered her 1999 EPS estimate to $1.80 from $2.20 and cut her rating to hold from strong buy. 

 "While we believe there is value here - this brand franchise is too cheap at these levels - the Street focus on earnings momentum limits upside and confidence needs to be regained," Walin said in a report. 

 She said the company's plan to repurchase up to five million shares, or about 3.5 percent of the company's outstanding common stock - also announced Tuesday - was not significant enough to make a difference in the stock's performance on Wednesday.

 Teldafax Shares Drop 

 As Weak Second Quarter 

 Cuts Full-Year Forecast 

 FRANKFURT -- Telecoms network operator Teldafax AG fell victim to fierce competition in the German market, reporting second-quarter sales and profits well down on the first quarter. 

 Shares in the long distance specialist fell 8.4% on the results, and after its chief financial officer slashed the company's forecast for full-year earnings. The shares closed at 22.90 euros, down 2.10 euros -- above the record low of 20 euros set Aug. 10, but down 19% on the year. 

 Quarter-on-quarter, sales fell 18% to 138 million marks (71 million euros) and net profit plunged 77% to five million marks as it cut prices to maintain its market share. Second-quarter earnings dropped to seven pfennigs per share from 31 pfennigs in the first quarter. 

 "The sharp price reductions of the second quarter put pressure on margins," Chief Executive Gerhard Lentz said at a news conference. "The fall in prices could not be compensated for by a growth in call volume." 

 Chief Financial Officer Henning Klose predicted the third and fourth quarters would not be as difficult as the second, but he lowered his expectations for the full year. "We said after the first quarter that one billion marks in sales was possible. Prices dropped about 20% in the second quarter so 750 million is more likely," Mr. Klose said. He forecast pretax profit of 10% to 11% of sales-or between 75 million marks and 82 million marks. 

 Thanks to its strong first quarter, Teldafax was able to present solid results for the first half. Sales, based on U.S.-GAAP accounting methods, totaled 307 million marks, up 400% on a year ago. The first-half pretax profit was 25 million marks, up sixfold from the same period last year. 

 B&O's Pretax Profit Rises 2.4% 

 COPENHAGEN -- Upscale Danish stereo and television maker Bang & Olufsen Holding AS said Tuesday that fiscal 1999 pretax profit rose 2.4% on sales growth of 8%, in line with the company's July profit warning. 

 In July, B&O said pretax profit would fall 25 million Danish kroner (3.4 million euros) short of earlier predictions, due to problems implementing new information technology. 

 Pretax profit rose to 348 million kroner from 340 million kroner a year ago. Sales increased to 3.38 billion kroner from 3.117 billion kroner. 

 The company is targeting 10% annual growth in sales over the next four years to revenues of more than five billion kroner, and 15% annual growth in earnings per share over three years. 

 Concerning B&O's problems with new technology, the company said its systems are still neither strong or efficient enough. The implementation of new technology caused disruption in product deliveries and unclear financial reporting during the year, and were blamed for B&O's profitwarning in July. 

 London Bridge Profit Soars 77% 

 LONDON -- London Bridge Software Holdings PLC reported a 77% jump in half-year adjusted profit and said it was in the last stage of buying a U.S. software company. 

 The company said it bought 97.1% of RSI Group Inc.'s shares and expected to acquire the balance soon. The acquisition of the U.S. private company helps London Bridge boost its position as a provider of credit-management systems world-wide. London Bridge is buying RSI for $24 million (22.7 million euros). 

 Adjusted pretax profit for the period ended June 30 rose to GBP 5.5 million (8.3 million euros) from GBP 3.1 million. The interim dividend is being raised to 1.75 pence from 1.5 pence. The adjustments include a bonus and goodwill amortization. Pretax profit rose 30% to GBP 3.5 million from GBP 2.7 million. 

 Netcom Misses Profit Estimates 

 STOCKHOLM -- Netcom Systems AB said first-half pretax profit more than a doubled from a year earlier but fell short of analysts' expectations. 

 The Swedish telecommunications operator's pretax profit rose to 288 million kronor (32.9 million euros) from 122 million kronor, missing the 334 million kronor estimated by industry observers. 

 Sales grew 32% to 3.67 billion kronor and the number of call minutes surged 90% to 6.03 billion. 

 Mobile operator Comviq's subscribers at June 30 increased 41% from a year earlier to 1,504,000, and revenue per customer, excluding cash cards, rose 13% to 391 kronor per month per customer. 

 The fixed-line operation, Tele2, increased its subscribers by 55% to 826,000. In Norway the increase was 94% to 275,000 subscribers. 

 World Access to Buy FaciliCom 

 World Access Inc. said it has agreed to acquire phone company FaciliCom International Inc. for $436 million (412 million euros) in stock. 

 The transaction gives Atlanta-based World Access a presence in Europe, where FaciliCom operates a network. FaciliCom, based in Washington, also operates in the U.S. and owns interests in trans-Atlantic cable systems. 

 World Access largely has focused on the wholesale long-distance business, which in recent months has faced pricing pressure. A raft of new construction projects have increased the supply of long-distance capacity in the U.S.

 WRAPUP-Waste Management ousts execs, sheds assets.

 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Waste Management Inc. on Monday dumped its top management including President Rodney Proto, who had sold shares before a profit warning, and said it was shedding all international and some domestic businesses. 

 The Houston-based company, the nation's No 1. trash hauler, said the SEC was conducting a "formal investigation" of financial statements and accounting policies and an "informal inquiry" into stock sales by officers and directors of the company. The NYSE also is reviewing trading in the stock prior to the profit warning. 

 The shedding of international assets was among the factors that led Moody's to cut its ratings of the company's debt saying that "The outlook is negative pending the company's ability to successfully refocus its operations in the North American market, improve its operating systems and controls and enhance fiscal responsibility in its acquisition program". 

 Waste Management said John Drury had resigned as chairman and chief executive, but remains a director, and Proto, who had been running the company while Drury was undergoing medical treatment, stepped down. 

 The company named Robert Miller, former chairman and CEO of Waste Management prior to its USA Waste merger, as president and chief executive officer, but hired executive recruiting firm Korn/Ferry International to search for a permanent CEO, as well as a chief financial officer. Miller has been involved in a number of corporate turnarounds. 

 Waste Management named Ralph Whitworth, an outside director who has been acting chairman since July 13, as Chairman. 

 Whitworth said the company intended to pay down debt, buy back shares, and bring more discipline and accountability to the business. It will sell some or all of its international assets, substantially all if its non-core assets, and up to 10 percent of its North American solid waste assets, he said. 

 The sale of underperforming assets should generate several billion dollars in proceeds, according to Stewart Scharf, an analyst at S&P Equity Group. 

 "But I think there are still a lot of problems they have to work out before the company can gain credibility with investors," Scharf said. "I think they have to prove they can more accurately manage operations and project earnings in light of the recent downward revisions." 

 Melville Cody, an analyst at Sanders Morris Mundy, said cash from the asset sales will be used to trim debt and buy back shares. Although Waste Management did not disclose any interested parties during its conference call with analysts, Cody said French companies, some of which have been on a buying spree of late, may be interested in its overseas operations. 

 "I think the company is moving in the right direction," Cody said, adding that Waste Management began its bumpy ride after acquiring too many companies in a short period of time. 

 "I think they have too many balls in the air and set the bar too high and got themselves in a position where they really had to stretch to meet expectations," he said. 

 Several Waste Management executives, including Proto, have been accused, in a shareholder lawsuit, of selling stock in the company while making positive statements that drove the stock price higher. The suit was filed immediately after the July 6 profit warning. 

 Shares of the company, which last year merged with USA Waste Inc. in a $13.5 billion deal forming the nation's largest trash hauler, plunged more than 50 percent since the beginning of July. Waste Management has posted disappointing earnings, made inaccurate forecasts and revealed accounting problems that have forced it to restate first-half results. 

 Shares closed down 7/16 at 23-1/8 from Friday's close on the New York Stock Exchange placing the company high on the NYSE most active list with more than 7 million shares traded. 

 Waste Management said for the six months ending Dec. 31, it expects adjusted diluted earnings per share of 90 cents a share to $1.00 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. 

 "That is a question mark," Cody said. "They didn't answer sufficiently why there is decline in the third quarter versus the second quarter. It looks that they could drop to 50 cents and that is an unusual decline." 

 The company cautioned that uncertainty of waste volumes, the adequacy of reserves for bad debt and higher borrowing costs could cut estimates further. 

 On August 3, Waste Management said the company and its independent auditors were reviewing about $95 million of pre-tax earnings recorded as operating income for the first quarter ended March 31 to determine whether such earnings should be restated or identified as nonrecurring. 

 Waste Management said it completed that financial review and revised its first half results, determining that it had incorrectly reported $30.2 million as first quarter pretax income, which instead should be reflected over the life of certain landfill assets. 

 Including charges, earning for the three months ended March 31 were revised to $346.7 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, compared to $364.3 million, or 58 cents as previously reported. The company also said that second-quarter results have been slightly modified.

 CLOROX STOCK IS HURT ON THE STREET: Once Wall Street decides that an executive has the golden touch, the perception can quickly change from a blessing to a curse. 

 The tables turned in a wicked fashion Thursday for Clorox Co. Chairman G. Craig Sullivan, who committed the sin of not living up to the investment community's high expectations. 

 Sullivan worked financial wonders with a series of acquisitions during the 1990s, but Clorox officials on Thursday acknowledged that the company's recent takeover of First Brands will diminish the Oakland-based company's profits during the final half of 1999. 

 To say investors were disappointed with Sullivan would be an understatement. 

 After Clorox executives broke the news in a conference call with securities analysts, investors pummeled the company's stock, despite a 6 percent increase in Clorox's profit for its latest fiscal quarter ending June 30. By the time the beating was finished, Clorox's stock had fallen by 16 percent, losing $16.81 to close at $86.44. By comparison, Clorox's stock dropped by only 9 percent when the stock market crashed on Oct. 19, 1987. Thursday's plunge wiped out $2 billion of shareholder wealth. 

 It seemed a rather harsh punishment, given that the problems depressing Clorox's short-term profits probably won't have a long-term effect on the business. 

 Nevertheless, shareholders reacted angrily, partly because they had been spoiled by Sullivan, who has invigorated Clorox's once-sleepy stock by sprucing up the business with one deft acquisition after another. Since Sullivan took over as Clorox's chief executive officer in May 1992, Clorox's stock had quadrupled in value, adjusting for splits, before Thursday's bloodbath. 

 Investors expected Sullivan to deliver an even bigger bang after spending $2 billion in January to buy First Brands -- the company behind such well-known household brands as Glad trash bags and STP oil. 

 What shareholders didn't understand -- and Clorox apparently didn't do a very good job of communicating until Thursday -- was that Sullivan inherited a pricing problem from First Brands' previous management. 

 Prior to the acquisition, First Brands provided retailers with money for promotions, a practice that doesn't fit with Clorox's more straightforward pricing strategy. As First Brands changes its pricing format to adhere to Clorox's, retailers are curtailing their orders as a sort of backlash, said William Steele, an analyst with Banc of America Securities in San Francisco. Retailers can afford to curtail their orders for First Brands' products because discounting by previous management left stores with a surplus inventory estimated at $125 million. 

 In its warning Thursday, Clorox advised that its earnings for its fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30 will decline by at least 10 percent compared with the previous year while its fiscal second-quarter profit will increase by a lower percentage than analysts had projected. 

 While some analysts slashed their ratings on Clorox Thursday, Steele predicted that it won't take Sullivan long to regain favor with investors. "This is a bit of an overreaction," the analyst said. "I absolutely believe that buying First Brands will prove to be the right move for Clorox." 

 V.I.P. TREATMENT: You've got to hand it to him: Craig Conway is a shrewd negotiator. 

 He may not have landed the CEO title at PeopleSoft right off the bat, but Conway made sure his compensation package would make his tenure at the company well worth his while. 

 Even Conway probably had to catch his breath at the prospect of this particular windfall: In a restricted stock purchase agreement, he picked up 500,000 shares of PeopleSoft stock for a penny a share. What a sweet deal. We're talking shares worth a cool $6.7 million as of Thursday. 

 The shares vest over four years, the majority vesting in the last year. If Conway leaves the company before the stock vests, PeopleSoft can repurchase the shares at a penny a share. We asked PeopleSoft how much vests when and what would happen to the shares if PeopleSoft is acquired by Siebel or another company, but we got the brush-off. 

 The good news is we won't have to wait much longer to find out just how sweet a deal Conway negotiated. All will be Baccarat crystal clear when Conway's employment agreement becomes public in PeopleSoft's next quarterly report due out by Monday. 

 We already know that more than a few PeopleSoft insiders are ticked off that Conway's stock "reward" is not directly tied to PeopleSoft's performance. PeopleSoft prides itself on its egalitarian culture, but Conway is getting a far better deal than the rank-and-file. When the company repriced 13 million stock options last December, PeopleSoft set the exercise price at $17 per share. PeopleSoft closed Thursday at $13.38, making those options worthless. 

 "You've got a company that's not doing too well right now and the person in charge's stock purchase agreement doesn't incentivize him to make the company do any better," commented one disgruntled insider. "It would be one thing if they gave him a million options at the current price. But they didn't. He has a better deal than all the people who work for him." 

 WHAT'S IN A NAME? WE HAD NO IDEA: Agilent Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s scientific instrument spin-off, is -- er --bigger than we thought. 

 We were under the impression that the name coupled the root word "agile" meaning responsive with "ent," a suffix that's hot with high-tech companies these days. 

 How responsive we had no idea until one of our sources let us in on the joke. It turns out Agilent is in fact an anagram for another word. (You scramble the letters, this is a family newspaper.) 

 Once we got the hint, it wasn't too hard to figure out what all the Web chatter and chuckles were all about. Commented one Yahoo! finance chatterer: "I suppose this means they will be privately held?" Another suggested putting "Fl" in front of the name. "I know it's an odorous, excuse me, odious task, but someone has to do the job." 

 We don't know about the name, but we'd sure to get our hands on some of this company's offerings. 

 IT COULD BE A GROOVY INVESTMENT, BABY: Much has been written about how aging baby boomers are fueling the stock market's rise as they stow away more money in their 401(k) funds. Now, Walnut Creek's SIFE Trust Fund may take the phenomenon one step further by tailoring a mutual fund that invests in baby boomers' favorite companies. 

 The 37-year-old SIFE recently sent a questionnaire out to its customers inquiring whether they might be interested in investing in a "Golden Age" fund made up of companies that cater to the baby boomers, loosely defined as people between the ages of 35 and 53. In the same questionnaire, SIFE is also soliciting customers' thoughts on a possible "Golden State" fund confined to investments in California-based companies and a "Global Financial" fund specializing in banks and financial services firms around the world. 

 SIFE is floating the trial balloon because the firm wants to expand its offering from a single fund that invests in U.S. financial institutions. With $1 billion in assets, SIFE has emerged as a marvelous success story since it started in 1962, but management realizes that it needs to diversify, particularly in times like these when bank stocks are out of favor. 

 Through Wednesday, SIFE's fund was down 4.7 percent for the year. The current slump, following a modest 5.1 percent return in 1998, contrasts sharply with some of the spectacular returns of recent years -- SIFE posted a 44.8 percent return in 1997, a 27.4 percent return in 1996 and 49.9 percent return in 1995. 

 "We want to bring our investors more options, either by adding more funds on our own or merging with another company," said Bruce Woods, SIFE's CEO and a baby boomer himself at the age of 45.

Red Hat bucks trend, raises price of IPO

Red Hat Software Inc., going against the trend, raised the expected price range for its initial public offering, lead underwriter Goldman Sachs said Tuesday.

Durham-based Red Hat, the biggest distributor of the alternative Linux operating system, is slated to offer 6 million shares later this week. The new price range is $12-$14 per share, up from $10-$12.

Several IPOs are being postponed or cut in size and terms amid the recent downturn in the broad market and investor hesitation toward Internet and technology IPOs. But analysts have been enthusiastic about Red Hat.

   Oakwood stops production at several plants

   Oakwood Homes Corp., the largest U.S. retailer of manufactured housing,


said it has reduced its work force by 695 workers this summer due to slumping demand.

The company closed its factory in Ennis, Texas, and production has ceased at its Richfield, N.C., and Moultrie, Ga., plants. Those sites employed 545. Earlier, the company cut 150 jobs at its Greensboro headquarters and at factories in Fort Morgan, Colo., and Albany, Ore.

Oakwood was forced to close the plants because sales dropped and competition increased in the manufactured-housing market. Last month, Oakwood reported a fiscal third-quarter profit of 17 cents a share, after warning in June it would fall short of analysts' forecasts of 55 cents. Oakwood and other manufactured-housing makers are shutting plants because of a glut of inventory, analysts say.

 U.S. stocks mixed at midday.

 NEW YORK, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Stocks were mixed at midday Friday, indecisive after the latest economic data added to the emerging consensus that the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates to head off inflation. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 52 points, or 0.50 percent, at 10,737. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index was up 10 points, or 0.40 percent, at 2,576. Both stock gauges made positive and negative swings through the morning. 

 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury also reversed early gains and fell 33/32 and the yield rose to 6.13 percent from 6.04 percent on Thursday. 

 "The markets look more like the Indianapolis Speedway than a stock market. There's a thrill a minute. The mood changes in milliseconds," said Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. "We're in a vulnerable and volatile market." 

 The key data was the U.S. Labour Department's report of the July payrolls and wages, which rose more than expected. 

 Nonfarm payrolls increased 310,000 in July, soundly topping expectations of a 199,400 gain, according to a Reuters' poll of economists. 

 Average hourly wages climbed 0.45 percent, compared with forecasts of a 0.3 percent rise. The unemployment rate matched expectations, holding steady at 4.3 percent. 

 The bond market is already assuming the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points when its policy-setting group meets Aug. 24, said Dick Stein, vice president and chief technical analyst at Boca Raton-based Noble International Investments. 

 An increase of only that amount would be viewed with a sigh of relief, he said. 

 The Internet, technology, financial and pharmaceutical sectors, which lifted the market higher in recent months are now leading the trend down. But balancing those declines have been better showings from paper, oil, chemical and commodities companies, Stein said. 

 "What we're seeing here is something that is overdue," Stein said of the market's recent declines. "I don't think this is negative. This is the first time the market's trying to establish a base." 

 Given the heavier trading volumes Thursday that likely flushed out a lot of the margin players, the worst may be over, said Richard Driehaus, president and chief executive officer of Driehaus Capital Management, which manages $2 billion in small and middle cap companies. 

 "I think the market may have hit bottom yesterday," Driehaus said. "If we're not at the bottom, we're approaching the bottom." 

 Among stocks in the news, Boston Scientific Corp.,  was down 6-1/16, or 16 percent, at 30-7/16 after saying it was recalling two if its products that cut away at plaque in blood vessel walls. 

 The interest-rate sensitive financial stocks in the Dow component were not doing well. Citigroup Inc.  was down 1-3/86 at 42-5/8; American Express Co.  fell 2 at 125-1/8 and JP Morgan & Co.  was down 2-1/8 at 123-3/8. 

 Sterling Commerce Inc.  was down 2-5/16 at 21-7/8. The company issued a profit warning late Thursday and on Friday, analysts at JP Morgan Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston lowered their ratings for the Internet e-commerce company. 

 Yahoo! Inc.  was up 5-5/8 at 134 after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the Internet portal company.

 OVERNIGHT-U.S. stocks end up as bears end Internet beating.

 NEW YORK, Aug. 5 (Reuters) - Stocks closed higher on Thursday as bearish traders called a halt to the battering that had sent Internet stocks into a bone-jarring drop. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 119.05 points, or 1.12 percent, at 10,793.82 after shaking off a loss of more than 100 points. 

 The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology stocks, was up 25.81 points, or 1.02 percent, at 2,565.81 after an early slide of more than 65 points. 

 It was the first higher close for the Nasdaq after five straight sessions of losses totalling 166 points. The index remains in what Wall Street considers a "correction" after pulling back more than 10 percent from its mid-July high of 2,864.48. 

 In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,817 to 1,192 on active volume of 854 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 


TheStreet.com's Internet index of stocks	  was up 23.64 points, or 4.83 percent, at 513.55. Earlier in the day, it had been as low as 452.90.



Even Wall Street's worries about the outlook for higher interest rates seemed to have taken a day off. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 25/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.04 percent from Wednesday's 6.10 percent. On Tuesday, the yield was at a 21-month high of 6.17 percent.



"That's a pretty good rally in the bond market. I would say stocks are getting encouragement from that," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston.



Earlier in the day, financial markets were rattled by news that U.S. workers' pay increases far outstripped productivity gains in the second quarter of the year, reviving speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again soon to dampen inflation pressures.



The Labour Department said productivity growth rose only 1.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a revised gain of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. A rise of 1.8 percent was expected by economists.



"We just got to the point, especially with the Internet stocks, that the market was oversold," said Charles Payne, head analyst at Wall Street Securities. "The thinking is that stocks have gotten hit so hard that you have huge upside potential. There is some positioning for the employment data Friday."



Wall Street was awaiting July payrolls figures, due out Friday, for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will jack up interest rates again soon to head off inflation.



"If the data isn't too inflationary, we could get a pretty good reversal" of the recent market declines, Payne said.



In the Internet sector, online media company Yahoo! Inc. , jumped 7-3/8 to 128-3/8, Internet venture capital firm CMGI Inc. , added 3-15/16 at 79-15/16, retailer Amazon.com Inc.  gained 8-13/16 at 97-1/4 and online auction site eBay Inc.  surged 17-1/8 at 92-7/8.



But the Internet service providers were pounded down after The Wall Street Journal reported that software giant Microsoft Corp.  plans to challenge heavyweight America Online Inc.'s   dominance by offering cut-rate or even free Internet access.



AOL fell 3-15/16 to 83-1/2 while Microsoft edged up 13/16 at 85-3/4.



"It's going to threaten profit margins, especially at America Online and that has investors worried," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. "It's hard to compete against free."



Prodigy Communications Corp.  was down 1-1/4 at 17, Earthlink Network Inc.  slipped 3-5/16 to 37-1/16. Another competitor, MindSpring Enterprises Inc.,  was down 3/4 at 26.

 NEW YORK, Aug. 6 (Reuters) - Stocks fell Friday amid the hysteria in the bond market after news that the booming U.S. economy created a surprisingly large number of new jobs last month. 

 The big worry is that the Federal Reserve may need to raise interest rates again soon to head off inflation. 

 "It's bloodied, bruised and battered," said Doug Myers, the vice president of equity trading at Interstate/Johnson Lane. "It's just an unpleasant place to be." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 79.79 points, or 0.74 percent, at 10,714.03, after bouncing off a loss of more than 140 points. For the week, the Dow rose 58.88 points. 

 In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,969 to 966 on moderate volume of 696 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The Nasdaq Composite index was off 17.86 points, or 0.70 percent, at 2,547.97. 

 The U.S. Labour Department reported that the jobless rate was steady at 4.3 percent in July, but the total number of new jobs added to nonfarm payrolls in July was 310,000 - outstripping Wall Street economists' forecasts for a gain of 199,400. Also, average hourly wages climbed 0.45 percent, compared with forecasts of a 0.30 percent rise. 

 The Fed's interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Aug. 24. And Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that the central bank will act "promptly and forcefully" if there are signs the economy may generate inflation. The central bank raised the key fed funds rate a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, in June. 

 In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond plunged 1-21/32, propelling its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, to a new 21-month high of 6.18 percent from 6.04 percent Thursday. 

 The bond market is already assuming the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points, said Dick Stein, vice president and chief technical analyst at Boca Raton-based Noble International Investments. 

 "The stock market is building in the next rate rise," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "I see this as continued malaise as the market comes to grips with higher interest rates." 

 Michael Farr, president of investment managers Farr, Miller & Washington, said he anticipates a continued modest decline in stock prices over the balance of the summer. 

 "Most of the earnings season is over," he said. "The earnings were good but it's kind of 'yesterday's news'." That leaves the stock market without any impetus to move higher. But he said a modest pullback is no surprise after a sharp rise from late 1998 into the first half of 1999. 

 American Home Products Corp. plummeted 6-1/16 to 44-7/8 after a jury in Texas found for the plaintiff in a lawsuit filed over the phen-fen diet drug. 

 The jury found American Home Products acted negligently by marketing the drug fenfluramine, one of the two drugs used in the phen-fen combination. The plaintiff was awarded $23.3 million. 

 Boston Scientific Corp. tumbled 6-1/2 to 30. The company said it was recalling its Rotablator RotaLink Advancer and RotaLink Plus products. The devices are used to remove plaque from inside the walls of blood vessels. 

 America Online Inc. rose 1-3/8 to 84-7/8. The company said it reached agreements with EarthLink Network Inc. and MindSpring Enterprises Inc. on instant messaging services. EarthLink Network rose 4-1/2 to 41-9/16 and MindSpring gained 2-13/16 at 28-13/16. 

 Sterling Commerce Inc. fell 2-1/4 to 21-15/16 after the e-commerce company late Thursday issued a profit warning. J.P. Morgan Securities and Credit Suisse First Boston lowered ratings on the stock. 

 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 13.42 points to 1,300.29. The American Stock Exchange was up 1.83 at 777.92. 

 The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks fell 6.35 to 611.04. The average share was down 44 cents. 

 The Wilshire Associates Equity Index - the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues - was 11,842.771, down 108.141 or 0.90 percent.

 Sterling Commerce to  Cut  Staff, Sell XcelleNet Business.

 Sterling Commerce announced Thursday that it will cut 200 jobs and sell its XcelleNet business in the wake of a poor third- quarter performance. The Columbus, Ohio-based electronic commerce software and services company reported disappointing results in line with an earlier warning, with net income up 18.4% at $37m on revenue up 24.6% at $152.2m. Earnings per share came in at $0.38 but, excluding a one-time $2.5m gain, amounted to $0.36 - $0.02 below revised expectations and $0.05 short of the initial First Call consensus before last month's profit warning. 

 The company said revenue for the quarter was impacted by delays in closing several large quarter-end product transactions and lower-than-expected sales growth for more traditional EDI and file transfer products, due in part to customers' internal Y2K issues and the maturity of the market segments. Another major problem, Sterling said, was lower-than-expected revenue growth from the recently-acquired XcelleNet business as a result of unforeseen integration difficulties and a lack of expected synergies. 

 Consequently, the company is restructuring its business in accordance with expected future revenues. In addition to the 200 staff being laid off, 450 employees will be reassigned during the fourth quarter to what Sterling sees as its growth areas - extranet management, business process integration, community management, EC infrastructure and outsourcing. During fiscal 200, a further 300 employees will be reassigned and the company will invest an additional $75m to $100m in those initiatives. 

 As for XcelleNet, which it only acquired one year ago for $200m, Sterling says it simply hasn't seen the expected benefits from the deal and has determined that the unit lacks sufficient strategic fit with its other businesses. Thus, it has enlisted the help of Broadview Associates to find a buyer. 

 Sterling said it will take one-time restructuring charges of $25m to $30m in the fourth quarter to cover employee severance, facilities scale-down, and other expenses. The company now expects revenues for the quarter to be $150m to $155m and earnings per share to be roughly $0.40 to $0.42, excluding expected results from XcelleNet and charges. Likewise, for the full fiscal year, revenues should now come in at between $550m and $555m and earnings per share will be $1.42 to $1.44. Sterling is projecting total revenue growth for next year of 17% to 20% and EPS growth of 21% - 23%, excluding historical and expected results from XcelleNet and one-time items. 

 In the third quarter, revenues from products and product support saw year-over-year growth of 13% and 48% to $53.8m and $36.6m, respectively. For the nine months, revenues from product and product support increased 30% and 50%, respectively. Services revenue, meanwhile, increased 24% to $61.8m in the quarter and 23% for the nine months to $178.2m. For the nine-month period, net income rose 26.3% to $104.1m on revenue up 31.3% at $445.6m, while EPS rose to $1.06 from $0.87.

 Teleglobe stock tumbles on analysts' profit concern.

 MONTREAL, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Teleglobe Inc.  shares fell more than 8 percent on Thursday on analysts' concerns about its ability to meet its recently lowered profit forecast for the year. 

 Shares of Montreal-based Teleglobe, which owns the world's third-largest international telecommunications network, fell C$2.70 at C$29.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and were off $1.75 at $19.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The price decline continued a painful slump in Teleglobe shares over the past seven months. The stock has lost just more than half its value from a January high of C$62 in Toronto and $40.94 in New York as profits have failed to meet street expectations. 

 Analysts said Teleglobe shares slid further on Thursday in part because management appeared less firm during a conference call on Wednesday about its July 28 forecast that 1999 net income would be 70 to 80 cents a share. That forecast was already a downward revision of the $1 a share figure the company had offered during the first quarter. 

 "(They) just highlighted some of the risks surrounding the ability of the company to achieve those earnings estimates, whereas prior to the call last week they referred to those earnings estimates as being conservative," said John Henderson, analyst at Scotia Capital Markets. 

 During the Wednesday conference call, Teleglobe management appeared to suggest that its forecast for 1999 profit per share was oriented more toward 70 cents than 80 cents. 

 "I think that 70 cents is still something that we can achieve," Chief Financial Officer Claude Seguin said. 

 Charles Sirois, chairman and chief executive of Teleglobe, said that to "get to the 70 cents range" the company needed to meet certain major revenue benchmarks. 

 He said the company's Excel Communications unit, the fourth-largest U.S. long distance telephone services provider, needed to grow the "pre-subscribed" business generated by its independent sales representatives in the United States and Canada. 

 "If we have a delay in the growth of independent reps and things like that, it can have an impact on the target," he said. 

 Excel, which recently began operations in Canada and plans to expand to Europe, uses a network of independent sales representatives through a concept known as "multi-level marketing." Most of the representatives work out of their homes and are an inexpensive way for a company to build a large sales team without hiring permanent employees. 

 Sirois said Teleglobe's profit forecast was also based on expectations of strong growth at Teleglobe Communications Corp.'s (TCC) non-minute-based revenues. Pricing pressure in TCC's business, wholesale international telecommunications via a vast network of undersea cables and satellites, crimped Teleglobe's profit margins in the second quarter. 

 "Based on current negotiations that we have with different companies, we believe we will have strong growth in that. If there is delay there, because these contracts are bigger by nature than other ones, that can have impact also on the (profit) target," Sirois said. 

 On Wednesday, Teleglobe reported a second-quarter net profit of $13.7 million, or 5 cents a share, down from a profit of $56.1 million, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 The results were in line with Teleglobe's July 28 warning that its second-quarter profit, excluding non-core operations, would be 10 cents a share instead of the 15 cents a share it forecast earlier. Net profit in the year earlier quarter, excluding non-core operations, was 24 cents a share. 

 Teleglobe second-quarter revenues fell almost 20 percent to $710 million from $882 million. The company said intense pricing pressure in its key wholesale telecom services business eroded margins and reduced traffic growth.

 U.S. stocks end up as bears end Internet beating.

 NEW YORK, Aug. 5 (Reuters) - Stocks closed higher on Thursday as bearish traders called a halt to the battering that had sent Internet stocks into a bone-jarring drop. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 119.05 points, or 1.12 percent, at 10,793.82 after shaking off a loss of more than 100 points. 

 The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology stocks, was up 25.81 points, or 1.02 percent, at 2,565.81 after an early slide of more than 65 points. 

 It was the first higher close for the Nasdaq after five straight sessions of losses totalling 166 points. The index remains in what Wall Street considers a "correction" after pulling back more than 10 percent from its mid-July high of 2,864.48. 

 In the broader market, declining issues led advances 1,817 to 1,192 on active volume of 854 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 


TheStreet.com's Internet index of stocks	  was up 23.64 points, or 4.83 percent, at 513.55. Earlier in the day, it had been as low as 452.90.



Even Wall Street's worries about the outlook for higher interest rates seemed to have taken a day off. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 25/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.04 percent from Wednesday's 6.10 percent. On Tuesday, the yield was at a 21-month high of 6.17 percent.



"That's a pretty good rally in the bond market. I would say stocks are getting encouragement from that," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at BankBoston.



Earlier in the day, financial markets were rattled by news that U.S. workers' pay increases far outstripped productivity gains in the second quarter of the year, reviving speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again soon to dampen inflation pressures.



The Labour Department said productivity growth rose only 1.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a revised gain of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. A rise of 1.8 percent was expected by economists.



"We just got to the point, especially with the Internet stocks, that the market was oversold," said Charles Payne, head analyst at Wall Street Securities. "The thinking is that stocks have gotten hit so hard that you have huge upside potential. There is some positioning for the employment data Friday."



Wall Street was awaiting July payrolls figures, due out Friday, for clues on whether the Federal Reserve will jack up interest rates again soon to head off inflation.



"If the data isn't too inflationary, we could get a pretty good reversal" of the recent market declines, Payne said.



In the Internet sector, online media company Yahoo! Inc. , jumped 7-3/8 to 128-3/8, Internet venture capital firm CMGI Inc. , added 3-15/16 at 79-15/16, retailer Amazon.com Inc.  gained 8-13/16 at 97-1/4 and online auction site eBay Inc.  surged 17-1/8 at 92-7/8.



But the Internet service providers were pounded down after The Wall Street Journal reported that software giant Microsoft Corp.  plans to challenge heavyweight America Online Inc.'s   dominance by offering cut-rate or even free Internet access.



AOL fell 3-15/16 to 83-1/2 while Microsoft edged up 13/16 at 85-3/4.



"It's going to threaten profit margins, especially at America Online and that has investors worried," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. "It's hard to compete against free."



Prodigy Communications Corp.  was down 1-1/4 at 17, Earthlink Network Inc.  slipped 3-5/16 to 37-1/16. Another competitor, MindSpring Enterprises Inc.,  was down 3/4 at 26.



Three companies that made their Wall Street debut closed higher.



Venture firm Internet Capital Group Inc.	    was up 12-7/16 at 24-7/16. Real estate Web site operator HomeStore.com's finished up 2-3/4 at 22-3/4. And Mission Critical Software Inc.  was up 9-7/16 at 25-7/16.



In other news, U.S. retailers reported solid sales for July as the ever-confident shoppers continued to spend money on everything from home appliances to clothes.



But despite the good news on retailers' sales, the stock of teen apparel retailer Buckle Inc.  dropped 10-3/16 to 18 after it issued a profit warning for its second quarter.



Gap Inc.  was down 3-7/16 at 39-7/8 after the ubiquitous retailer reported a modest same-store sales increase that fell short of expectations.



The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 8.38 points to 1,313.71. The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.87 to 776.09.



The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.93 to 617.39. The average share was up 20 cents.



The Wilshire Associates Equity Index - the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues - was 11,950.912, up 68.299 or 0.57 percent.

 EUROPE/MIDEAST 

 EU, Belgium Fail 

 To Agree on Terms 

 For Meat Exports 

 The Belgian government and the European Commission failed to agree on terms that would allow Belgium to resume exporting meat tested and found to be free of dioxin, further complicating the country's three-month food scare. Discussions are set to resume today. At issue is the chemical threshold above which Belgian pork is considered contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin, and whether the one-month moratorium Belgium declared last week on meat exports applies to beef in addition to pork and poultry. The two sides have agreed on thresholds beyond which milk, poultry and eggs are deemed contaminated. 

 The commission is pushing for the Belgian government to err toward safety by including beef in the moratorium. Belgium's position is that beef is safe enough to export and its inclusion on the list of banned exports would deal another blow to the country's beleaguered farmers. 

 KLM's Profit Falls Sharply in Quarter 

 KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said fiscal first-quarter net income, excluding a one-time gain, declined 64% from a year earlier to 77 million guilders ($37.3 million), and it expects full-year operating earnings to fall "well below" 1998 levels. The dramatic slump in earnings had been widely expected, and analysts called the outlook a profit warning in disguise. KLM said the earnings have to be seen against the "background of deteriorating financial results in the airline industry" resulting from strong competition and excess capacity. Analysts called the results dramatic but managed to see a bright spot, such as  lower-than-expected fuel costs. 

 Russian Debt Restructuring Discussed 

 The structure for rescheduling as much as $32 billion of Russia's commercial-bank debt inherited from the Soviet Union began to unfold, as a delegation led by Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov met with the London Club of commercial creditors in Frankfurt. The London Club's advisory committee agreed, on the first day of what is expected to be two days of talks, to discuss in more detail Russia's proposals for rescheduling the debt at its next meeting in mid-September, according to a statement yesterday. Russia will give the London Club a choice between a debt-restructuring option that covers only payments for the next two years and one that seeks a comprehensive agreement, the Prime-Tass news agency of Russia reported. "Everything depends on the position of the London Club negotiators," said Russia's envoy to international financial institutions, according to Tass. 

 Berlin Airport Bids to Be Re-Examined 

 Plans to construct Berlin's new international airport, scheduled to open in 2007, were sidetracked after a German state court ruled that the 6 billion mark ($3.3 billion) contract to a consortium led by German construction giant Hochtief was awarded unfairly. The IVG Holding consortium, which includes the operator of the Vienna airport and Deutsche Bank, challenged the deal. The court ordered Brandenburg state officials to re-examine the two bids. No appeal is possible. 

 Cemex Bid for Egypt's Assiut Accepted 

 Mexico's Cemex confirmed that Egypt's government-run holding company Metallurgical Industries has accepted its bid for a majority stake in Egypt's state-owned Assiut Cement. Cemex said it would acquire as much as 90% of Assiut at 44 Egyptian pounds ($12.89) a share, or as much as 1.28 billion Egyptian pounds ($375 million). Cemex is one of the world's top three cement producers. 

 BRIEFLY: 

 -- France's stock-market watchdog  gave the green light to Elf Aquitaine's 50 billion euro ($53.5 billion) stock-and-cash bid for rival oil company TotalFina. Elf's offer is in response to TotalFina's 42 billion euro, all-stock bid for Elf. Elf's offer will run for at least 25 trading days once it is launched and is conditional upon 67% acceptance by TotalFina shareholders. 

 -- France's transport minister said thatt Airbus Industrie will submit a draft plan to turn the four-company aerospace consortium into a joint-stock company to the French, German, Spanish and British governments in mid-September. 

 -- EFG Eurobank's tender offer for control of Ergobank, Greece's fifth-largest bank, expires today. Eurobank, a unit of Consolidated Eurofinance Holdings of Switzerland, is expected to succeed in its attempt to control a 50.1% stake in Ergobank and become the No. 3 Greek bank. 

 -- MOL Hungarian Oil & Gas and Croatia's INA-Industrija Nafte said they plan to enter into exclusive talks on a merger. People close to the companies said the discussions were at a preliminary stage.

 ASIA/PACIFIC 

 HSBC May Relocate Back-Office Tasks 

 HSBC Holdings is considering moving more of its back-office operations to India and China, said John Bond, the bank's chairman. He said HSBC, the British parent of Hongkong & Shanghai Bank and Hang Seng Bank, was continuing to consolidate its data centers, which the bank hopes to cut to less than 25 from 50 currently to reduce costs and free up more staff to provide front-office services to customers. He said the bank's sizable Hong Kong operations already had transferred much of their back-office work to Guangzhou, in southern China near Hong Kong. 

 Asia Executives Focus on Governance 

 Asia's resurgent markets have investors worried that the commitment to economic reform in the region will recede, but a new group hopes to keep Asian executives focused on improving their corporate-governance standards. The Asian Corporate Governance Association, composed of a small group of Asian executives and lawyers, will advise companies in the region on how to manage their corporate affairs at world-class levels, members said after their first meeting yesterday in Hong Kong. "Companies that have bad corporate governance will find it very difficult to raise money and find strategic partners," said Kiattisak Jelatianranat, an association member and director of internal audit services for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Bangkok. 

 Nissan to Merge Two of Its Affiliates 

 Nissan Motor of Japan said it plans to merge its affiliates TransTechnology and Jatco on Oct. 1. The merged company, which will be called Jatco TransTechnology, will be capitalized at 29.9 billion yen ($261.4 million). The present TransTechnology will be the surviving entity. Jatco TransTechnology will develop, manufacture and sell transmission and automobile components and will employ about 6,500 workers. Also yesterday, Nissan said it bought Mazda Motor's 34.7% stake in Jatco, raising Nissan's stake to 99.1% from 64.4%.

 Colombia Slowdown May Boost Deficit 

 Colombia's central bank governor, Miguel Urrutia, said slow second-quarter growth could mean the country's consolidated budget deficit will exceed its target of 3% of gross domestic product. The official second-quarter growth figure hasn't been released. Meanwhile, rising oil prices are saving Colombia from severe balance-of-payments problems and bolstering the economy, the country's mines and energy minister said Monday. Oil prices have risen to around $20 a barrel from $10.50 in January, which will earn Colombia an additional $800 million this year if oil prices remain at the higher level through December. 

 Mexico Urged to Expand Beef Tariffs 

 Mexican cattlemen said they will step up efforts to expand tariffs on U.S. beef imports, particularly for four U.S. meatpackers that were largely exempted from antidumping tariffs of as much as 214% announced this week by the government. Cattlemen's representatives said the decision will lead to monopolistic practices by Excel, IBP, Farmland National Beef Packing and ConAgra of the U.S.; Mexico's Commerce Ministry exempted or applied lower tariffs in several product categories for the four firms, based on evidence that their prices were closer to the market norm. Although the trade groups welcomed the ministry's antidumping ruling, they said additional measures are needed to avoid product reclassifying.  The groups said the four meatpackers control 80% of the meat stock in the U.S.

The company already has the concession to provide rolls to 150 McDonald's restaurants in Mexico.

 MONTREAL, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Pricing pressures pinched second-quarter results at Teleglobe Inc. , with Canada's biggest overseas long-distance carrier reporting a profit of 5 cents a share on Wednesday. 

 Montreal-based Teleglobe reported a profit of $13.7 million on sales of $709.9 million, compared with a profit of $56.1 million, 22 cents a share, on sales of $882 million last year. 

 The results fell in line with a July 28 warning issued by Teleglobe in which it said it expected profit of 10 cents a share, excluding non-core operations, against an earlier forecast of 15 cents. 

 At that time, Teleglobe also lowered its outlook for net income for the year to 70 to 80 cents a share instead of the $1 a share predicted earlier. 

 The dramatic second-quarter decline - a drop of 19.5 percent in sales - is tied to intense competition from U.S. long-distance service firms and losses on the conversion of foreign currencies, Teleglobe said. 

 The company has faced major challenges as it expands into retail and wholesale long-distance markets in Europe and the United States. 

 For the first six months of the year, Teleglobe recorded net income of $40.2 million, 15 cents a share, compared with $133.2 million, or 52 cents a share last year. 

 The firm's stock fell C$1.10 to to close at C$32 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday before the results were released.

 AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) Tuesday said first-quarter net profit plunged 64% and it expects full-year operating earnings to fall well below 1998 levels. 

 The dramatic slump in earnings had been widely expected and although analysts called the outlook a profit-warning in disguise, the damage to KLM's shares was limited. 

 At 1417 GMT, KLM was down 70 cents, or 2.8%, at EUR23.95. The AEX benchmark meanwhile was down 0.8% at 539.84 points. 

 KLM said the earnings have to be seen against the "background of deteriorating financial results in the airline industry in general." 

 The carrier said there is strong competition and excess capacity within the industry. 

 KLM said the operating environment in the sector is more difficult than it has been in a long time. It said the excess capacity on the North Atlantic routes plays an important part in the continuous pressure on the overall yield. 

 Competition is especially harsh on the North Atlantic routes after the financial crisis in Asia prompted airlines to divert capacity to this area, causing prices to fall. 

 "The recovery in Asia can't compensate the price pressures on the North Atlantic routes," said analyst Richard Brakenhoff with Kempen & Co. 

 Analysts called the results dramatic but managed to see a bright spot, such as the lower-than-expected fuel costs, which fell 12% to NLG35 million. 

 But these were offset by a decline in unit revenues, down 6% on the year, while unit costs increased by 2% and margins fell to 3.3 from 9.2. 

 "They need to control costs. As long as they can't control costs they will muddle along," Brakenhoff said. 

 KLM said it would continue to focus on "managing financial performance through autonomous cost reductions." 

 One of the means to reduce costs is cooperation with other alliances. KLM, which already has an alliance with Northwest Airlines (NWAC) of the U.S., announced a far-reaching joint venture with Italy's Alitalia Friday. This should help reduce costs, but analysts noted it will take a few years before synergies will become apparent. 

 In the meantime, the carrier expects operating income in fiscal 2000 ending March 31 to fall "well below" the NLG425 million posted in fiscal 1999. 

 Pushing aside the first-quarter earnings, some market watchers instead pointed to the July load factor, which KLM released earlier in the day. 

 Although passenger traffic decreased on the North Atlantic routes, the overall load factor rose to 77.8% from 75.1% in July 1998 on rising traffic to Asia Pacific and higher cargo volumes. 

 "The July figures were hopeful," said Marco Schram, analyst with Delta Lloyd bank.

 Avon's Stock Declines 27% After  Warning  About  Profit

 Avon Products Inc. yesterday became the latest multinational consumer products company to be pummeled by investors after management announced a surprise warning that it expected to report disappointing financial results. 

 Avon shares fell $9.875, or 27.6 percent, to close at $25.8125 after the company said it was suffering from weak economies abroad, currency volatility and stiff domestic competition. The announcement came a day after the Gillette Company made a similar announcement. 

 Avon, the door-to-door cosmetics seller, said it would meet expectations of earning 34 cents a share in the third quarter, which ends today, but would probably be short of analysts' estimates for the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected profit of 63 cents a share in the fourth quarter, but Avon said yesterday that it expected profits to be even with or only slightly higher than the 56 cents earned in the period a year ago. 

 Avon, which is based in New York, gets two-thirds of its profits from outside the United States but is being hit by domestic woes as well. 

 Largely because of a currency devaluation in Brazil and increased competition and heavy sales discounts in Mexico, ''results are not expected to reach the level previously anticipated'' in Latin America, said Charles R. Perrin, chairman and chief executive. 

 ''In addition, in the U.S., trends in beauty sales in the fourth quarter are expected to improve significantly over third quarter, but we are seeing weakness in early sales of holiday gifts, causing us to revise the sales outlook in the U.S.,'' Mr. Perrin said. Avon had expected domestic revenue to increase by 5 percent but now says it will not meet that target. 

 For the year, Avon expects to report a double-digit increase in profit over last year's $1.48 a share. Analysts polled by First Call had expected the company to earn $1.71 but revised the number yesterday to $1.64. Some also downgraded the stock, despite Avon's assurances that it was adopting a growth strategy and expected sales growth to pick up next year. 

 In the United States market, the company is facing an image problem as it tries to further broaden its appeal beyond customers loyal to the Avon Lady, analysts said. ''I've never seen a successful attempt to take a brand that is on one level and try to take it up market,'' said Melissa Grant, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read L.L.C. LIke such formidable competing brands as Revlon and Cover Girl, Avon is a well-known franchise but suffers from a low-brow image that has long ''had a certain stigma attached to it,'' Ms. Grant said. 

 Yet while investors were clearly caught off guard by the weakness on Avon's home turf, they were reacting in large part to the troubles abroad. ''The problem with the stock today is that there is a lot of confusion over what is going to happen next year and whether Latin America is going to be a lingering problem,'' said Robert Izmirlian, an analyst with S&P Equity Group. 

 Avon's warning came a day after Gillette, the Boston-based maker of razors and blades, similarly stunned investors by forecasting bad news. Gillette said after the market closed on Tuesday that results in its third quarter would not meet forecasts because of weak economies abroad, currency translation issues and weakness in its Braun and stationery businesses. Investors sent the stock to a three-year low yesterday at $33.4375, down $3.5625, or 9.6 percent. Shares of other consumer giants that have recently had trouble abroad, including the Procter & Gamble Company, also declined yesterday. P.& G.'s stock closed at $95.8125, down $3.125, or 3.2 percent. 

 ''I think this is the kind of thing we need to expect more in the future,'' Mr. Izmirlian said. In times of economic turmoil abroad, ''it's not always easy to assess the magnitude of the effect on a company,'' he said. ''In the past, these companies really had some steep multiples; going forward, investors need to be a little more cautious.''

 Teleglobe shares fall after another  profit warning .

 MONTREAL, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Teleglobe Inc. shares sank to a 52-week low on Thursday after the owner of the world's third-largest international telecommunications network cut its earnings forecasts for 1999 yet again and warned of a shortfall in its quarter. 

 The stock slid to a 52-week low of C$20.10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange before clawing back to close C$2.30, or 9 percent, lower at C$22.70 on turnover of 2.5 million shares. On Wall Street, Teleglobe closed off $1-10/16 at $15-7/16 after hitting a 52-week nadir of $14-13/16 earlier. 

 Montreal-based Teleglobe said late on Wednesday it expected its earnings per share from core operations to be 48 cents to 50 cents in 1999, down from an earnings warning issued in July that pegged the year's per-share profit at 70 to 80 cents. The July revision was itself a downward move from the previous forecast of $1 a share. 

 Teleglobe stock has lost some two-thirds of its value since hitting a high of C$62 in January on the Toronto exchange and $40.94 in New York. 

 Early profit disappointments stemmed from revenue and profit declines at Dallas-based Excel Communications Inc., the fourth-largest U.S. long distance services provider, which merged with Teleglobe last year. But in recent months, Teleglobe has revealed a profit margin squeeze in its main wholesale long-distance call business. 

 Those developments and the company's repeated failure to dial the right numbers on its own profit forecasts have combined to pull down the widely-traded stock, analysts said. 

 "A lot of people own it. It's a very, very expensive stock on a price-to-earnings basis," said Irwin Michael, a portfolio manager with ABC Funds. 

 "Isn't it interesting they do it at the last day of the month and the last day of the quarter. That's something people don't like," he added. 

 Teleglobe spokeswoman Michele Beaubien said this should be the company's last estimate cut. "We're very confident that we're on the conservative side," she said. 

 Teleglobe said its lower earnings forecast was related to three main areas. 

 Higher expenses at Excel that stemmed from the implementation of new information systems and advance work for its international expansion. Excel recently began operations in Canada and has plans to expand its network of independent sales representatives and "multi-level marketing" concept into Europe's major industrialised countries. 

 Teleglobe also said revenue and profit fell at its Teleglobe Business Solutions unit, which service business clients and is being restructured. Also, reductions in Teleglobe's international voice profit margins per minute were not entirely offset by data and transmission revenues. 

 In its Wednesday statement, the company said earnings per share for the third quarter will be 4 to 5 cents a share while the fourth quarter should produce a profit of 19 to 21 cents a share. 

 "Teleglobe expects EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the year to reach between $415 million and $425 million, providing the company with significant liquidity to pursue its expansion projects," Teleglobe said.

 LONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - News and information company Reuters Group Plc said on Thursday it will allow the media to listen in on its analysts' meetings but said the move was not a response to criticism after briefings last week in New York. 

 Reuters, which has seen its share price plunge after analysts cut their forecasts for the company following the U.S. briefings, said it would let journalists listen to analysts' meetings and conference calls in a bid for greater transparency. 

 Reuters said it had been considering the move for some time, having sounded out the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for feedback earlier this year. 

 "It's the company's view that opening conference calls to the media and through them, to a wider audience, creates a level playing field for all participants," a Reuters spokesman said. 

 The move is relatively unusual in Britain, where most companies hold separate briefings for analysts and the media. 

 Reuters shares have dropped roughly 22 percent in the past week after analysts cut their forecasts to reflect concerns about volumes and competition at Instinet, its lucrative electronic broking unit. 

 The analysts reduced their forecasts following briefings with Instinet executives in New York. 

 The stock was up 1.87 percent at 679 pence at 1235 GMT. 

 Reuters responded to last week's drop by insisting that it had not issued a profit warning nor released any price-sensitive information during the analysts' briefings. 

 "Nothing was said at the briefing that could be construed as a profits forecast or a profits warning, and there is no price sensitive information which it should announce," Reuters said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange. 

 The LSE has launched a routine inquiry into the share drop. 

 Reuters said journalists would be able to listen to conference calls with analysts on October 21, when it releases its third-quarter revenue figures. 

 "We will be inviting journalists to participate on a listen-only basis to regular meetings and conference calls which the company holds for its investors and analysts," Reuters said. 

 "Reuters has been deliberating for some time the issue of analysts' conference calls as a mechanism for disseminating corporate information."

     COPENHAGEN, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Danish blue-chip shares fell 

 in unusually thin trade on Thursday with a surprise 

profit-warning by windmill turbine maker NEG Micon, a  mid-cap 

 stock, providing some excitement on a dull day, dealers said. 

     The KFX top-20 index fell 0.6 percent to 216.00 points in 

 661 million crown ($94 million) turnover. The all-share index 

 dropped 0.5 percent to 676.91 points with falling stocks leading 

 risers by almost two to one. 

     In the top-20 league, telecoms operator Tele Danmark traded 

 sideways, ending one crown up at 416. 

     Pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group Novo Nordisk 

 shed 10 crowns to 830. Dealers attributed the decline mainly to 

 the weaker dollar. 

     Another dollar-earner, shipping and oil group A.P. Moeller, 

 also saw its shares fall. 

     Biggest bank Den Danske sank further, closing five crowns 

 down at a four-week low 795 crowns, still weighed down by 

 uncertainty about the outcome of expected compensation claims 

 against it over failed insurer Hafnia`s share issue in the early 

 1990s. 

 Rival Unidanmark gained one crown to 473. 

 Among industrials, engineering group FLS climbed five crowns 

 to 185 on news it won a major U.S. order for a cement production 

 line. 

     Dealers saw scope for further gains in the share, especially 

 if FLS would begin to win orders in Asia. 

     NEG Micon plunged 205 crowns, or 73 percent, in late 

 afternoon trading to end at 75 crowns after announcing it saw a 

 risk of losing the company`s equity. 

     Lacking further information, analysts were unwilling to draw 

 any conclusions from the terse statement. 

     NEG Micon was transferred to the bourse`s observation list, 

 a signal to investors that exceptional circumstances might 

 affect the pricing of the company`s shares. 

     Competing windmill maker Vestas, seen by analysts as a 

 strong candidate to join the KFX index next year, rose 20 crowns 

 to 970 in lively 58 million crown trade.

 Coke Staff Cuts in Russia Spark Analysts' Fears of a Write-Down

 ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. set cuts in its Moscow staff following a huge drop in sales in Russia during the past year, promoting concerns among analysts about a possible write-down of some of its large investment in that country. 

 The soft-drink company's sales volumes in Russia have fallen about 60% since August 1998, according to people close to the company, when the crash of the ruble depleted Russian consumers' savings. 

 Coke said in February that based on its own assessment and discussions with auditors, it didn't believe it would need to write down its Russian assets "at this point in time." 

 But news of the job cuts prompted already jittery analysts to ask whether Coke, which has already issued a profit warning for the third quarter, might take a write-down for Russia, where it has invested $750 million since 1991. 

 Some analysts said they think a write-down for Russia is possible despite Coke's earlier assertion. 

 "It's certainly possible that a year into this crisis, Coke, on further analysis, could decide that indeed there is some impairment," said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Goldman Sachs & Co. 

 Yesterday, a Coke spokesman in Atlanta declined to comment on whether the company plans to take a write-down due to reduced operations in Russia. 

 Coke's shares closed down $1.875 to $48.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, well off the 52-week high of $75.4375. The stock last closed below $50 on Dec. 20, 1996, when it fell to $47.87. 

 The drop came amid warnings from Avon Products Inc. and Gillette Co. of sales weakness in several markets, including some overseas. Analysts said the warnings worried Coke investors by providing another reminder that economic problems internationally are cutting into U.S. corporations' earnings. 

 In Moscow, Coke spokesman Alexander Chernov said that 39 out of about 130 employees, from secretaries to managers, would lose their jobs in the company's Moscow head office, as the past year's drop in sales has forced the company to cut costs. He said that about half of those let go would probably be picked up by a company-owned bottler that has opened an administrative office in Moscow. 

 The downsizing isn't the first for Coke in Russia, where the company and its bottlers employ about 6,000 people. Its Moscow bottler sacked about a third of its staff of 900 last year after the ruble fell, and bottlers in the regions also were forced to let some workers go. "We are making adjustments to adapt our business to the economic environment," Mr. Chernov said. "We have to create cost-effectiveness and eliminate redundancies between our new bottling center and regional office." 

 The cutbacks in Moscow and worries over a possible charge represent only the latest bad news for Coke. Investors had been looking for an upturn in earnings in the second half of this year, after turmoil in overseas economies and a huge product recall in Europe caused poor returns and a drop in world-wide unit case volume, a central measure of the industry, in the first two quarters of the year. 

 But a profit warning earlier this month dashed those hopes. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of 32 cents a diluted share, well below a consensus a month ago of 36 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Standard & Poor's also recently placed Coke and two of its bottlers on credit watch for a possible downgrade, citing a rise in the level of debt following acquisitions.

 At least seven chemical companies have warned that third-quarter earnings will not meet analysts expectations. The companies, most of which are basic chemical producers, cite rising feedstock costs. 

 They include Eastman Chemical, FMC, Lyondell Chemical, Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, Sterling Chemicals,  and Wellman (table). BFGoodrich is the only specialty chemical maker to warn of lower profits (p.13). 

 A few basic chemical makers are expected to beat last year's third- quarter results, including DuPont and Union Carbide. Union Carbide's earnings are estimated at 56 cts/share, up 56% from last year, says First Call (Boston). DuPont's earnings are expected to rise 9%, to 58 cts/share. 

 Rohm and Haas's third-quarter earnings are forecast at 36 cts/share, down 28% from last year; Millennium Chemicals' profits are expected to tumble 40%, to 25 cts/share. Dow Chemical's are projected to remain flat, at about $1.32/share, according to First Call's consensus estimate. 

 Mississippi Chemical has reduced its quarterly cash dividend of 10 cts/share to 3 cts/share due to poor fertilizer markets. The dividend reduction will save the company $1.8 million/quarter. 

 Analysts expect Terra Industries, Agrium, and IMC-Agrico to report lower third-quarter results (CW, Sept. 22, p. 20).

 Profit Warning  Sends Shares Of Avon Products Into A Nosedive

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Investors slammed shares of Avon Products Inc. Wednesday after the cosmetics company warned it that sluggish early sales of holiday gifts and weakness in Mexico and Brazil will cause it to miss fourth-quarter earnings projections. The company said its results for the third quarter will live up to expectations, but Wall Street clearly was focused on the bad news. 

 Shares of Avon (AVP) fell $9.875, or 28%, to close at $25.813. Heavy volume of 16 million shares made it one of the most actively traded issues on the New York Stock Exchange trading. Average daily turnover is around one million shares. 

 Avon said it expects fourth quarter earnings to be "even to up slightly" from last year's fourth-quarter net income of 56 cents a share. That would be shy of the mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by First Call for a profit of 63 cents a share. 

 The New York-based direct seller of beauty products said it is revising its fourth-quarter sales outlook in the U.S. to the "low single digits." Avon previously projected sales growth of around 5%. 

 In addition to weaker-than-expected preholiday sales in the U.S., the company said it doesn't expect results from Mexico and Brazil to reach the levels it previously anticipated, in large part because of economic pressure and currency volatility in Latin America. 

 Avon said it expects third-quarter earnings to climb 13% rise to 34 cents a share. That would match the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 In the year-ago third quarter, Avon reported net income of $41.5 million, or 16 cents a diluted share, a 40% decline from a year earlier. However, excluding a one-time expense related to a reduction in product lines and staff, the company said earnings would have been $80.1 million, or 30 cents a share. Revenue in the 1998 third quarter came to $1.23 billion. 

 For all of 1999, Avon said its current outlook would indicate double-digit earnings growth over 1998 earnings of $1.48 per share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial is for full-year earnings of $1.71 a share. 

 Meanwhile, Avon said it plans to "significantly accelerate" its share repurchase program this year and in 2000. The company said it has more than $700 million remaining in its current authorization and plans to be a "much more active buyer" of its stock at those levels. 

 Avon's problems reflect a trend amond multinational companies in general: they are finding that they can't rebound from weak market conditions as they used to. Earlier this decade, economic deterioration typically hit isolated regions or countries one at a time. But in recent years the economic weakness has been global in nature, happening all at once. From Japan to Latin America and China to Russia, the world has been in a sort of economic funk. 

 And that has led to a shrinking, not expanding, middle class in emerging markets, which are supposed to be the source of future growth for multinational companies. For consumer non-durable companies like Avon that makes a difficult environment: with less disposable income, consumers in emerging markets aren't likely to buy lipstick and top-of-the-line shaving systems. 

 Avon's business plans call for revenue gains of 8% to 10% and earnings per share growth of 15% to 16%, but it appears the company won't do that this year. Latin America is improving, but not strong enough. Worsening matters are potentially weak holiday sales in the U.S.

 Safeco Corp. shares fall after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Insurer Safeco Corp.'s  stock fell 9 percent to a year low of $27 on Wednesday following Tuesday's third-quarter profits warning. 

 Safeco said after the close on Tuesday it expected a profit of 5 to 15 cents a share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, well down on analysts' consensus estimate of 49 cents. 

 Safeco shares dropped as low as 26-3/8 in early Wednesday trade after closing at 29-11/16 on Tuesday, but recovered some ground to 27 by early afternoon. 

 Safeco blamed the shortfall on $10 million of Hurricane Floyd claims and intense price competition in commercial and personal insurance units. 

 Bear Stearns insurance analyst Michael A. Smith, said in a research note on Wednesday that investors would be disappointed that only $10 million, or 5 cents per share after taxes, of the shortfall was being attributed to Hurricane Floyd, with the rest attributed simply to competitive markets. 

 Smith cut his third-quarter earnings estimate to 10 cents per share from 45 cents and estimated full-year earnings per share excluding investment gains of $1.45 per share for the year, down from the previous estimate of $2.00. 

 Safeco was meeting analysts on Wednesday night and Thursday, and reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 25.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were up ever so slightly at midday on Wednesday in volatile, leaderless trading with analysts touting bargains to gun-shy buyers. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.48 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,279.01. The Nasdaq composite was up 2.67 point, or 0.10 percent, to 2,758.92. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was up 0.47 point or 0.04 percent to 1,282.67. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 18/32 with a yield of 6.127 percent. The dollar was at 106.77 against the yen. 

 "I think in the very short term, the market's very oversold," said Richard Cripps, the chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. 

 He said the plunge of the Dow by as much as 222 points on Tuesday could have set a short-term bottom level. 

 "This is more of a testing process of the downside," Cripps said. "You're not seeing the confidence that would mean we hit bottom, there's no capitulation in the technology stocks." 


Technology shares showed some gains at midday, with TheStreet.com's volatile Internet index	  trading up 12.33 points, or 1.95 percent, at 643.63



Among the winners was online bookseller Amazon.com Inc. , which was up 12-1/2 at 78-3/8 after it said it would add three new features this month that would allow it to expand its merchandise offerings, improve its product search and upgrade its payment system.



The market's two new technology initial public offerings were also trading higher. Atlanta-based business software company Telemate.Net Software Inc.  was up 1-5/8 to 15-11/16, up from its offering at 14.



The Seattle-based Internet shopping service Shopnow.com Inc.  was up 4 points, or 32 percent, to 16, after its offering at $12.



But among the Dow components, both Hewlett-Packard Co.  and International Business Machines Corp.  were trading lower. HP was down 3-7/16 at 91-11/16 after agreeing to a data storage pact with Qwest Communications International Inc.. IBM was down 1-13/16 at 122 after Merrill Lynch removed it from its Top 10 technology list.



Oil continued its eight-month boom, with dealers saying the U.S. petroleum inventories at three-year lows prove that OPEC supply curbs were cutting deep ahead of winter.



The American Stock Exchange's index of oil and gas stocks	  was up 9.74 points, or 1.98 percent at 502.55. Among the Dow components, Chevron Corp.  was up 1-1/4 at 88-7/8 and Exxon Corp.  was up 1-7/16 at 76-1/8.
Gold remained volatile after European central banks on Sunday said it would restrict its sales for the next five years. The S&P gold and precious metals index	     was down 6.32 points, or 3.84 percent, at 158.14.



Strong demand for new cars and aircraft drove up orders for durable goods more than expected, the U.S. Commerce Department reported an hour before the markets opened. The value of total new orders rose by 0.9 percent - contrary to expectations for a decline of 0.9 percent, according to the forecasts of economists polled by Reuters.



The market, however, is more likely to focus on Tuesday's meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers, third-quarter earnings expectations and profit warnings, said George Rodriguez, senior vice president, Guzman & Co. in Jersey City, N.J..



Cosmetics company Avon Products Inc.  saw its stock drop 9-5/16 points, or about 25 percent, to 26-3/8 in active trading after it warned its fourth-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations. PaineWebber also cut its rating on the stock to "neutral" from "attractive."



Gillette Co.  stock also fell after issuing a profit warning and receiving ratings cuts from Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney. The stock, which was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange at midday, was down 3-3/4 at 33-5/16.

 NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were higher in late-morning trading on Wednesday as Wall Street tried to forget the Tuesday roller coaster ride a day earlier that left it to worry about interest rates and corporate earnings. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 46.54 points, or 0.45 percent, at 10,322.07. The Nasdaq composite was up 7.79 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,764.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was up 4.71 points or 0.37 percent to 1,285.40. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 3/32 with a yield of 6.09 percent. The dollar was at 106.6 against the yen. 

 Technology shares were doing well, with TheStreet.com's Internet index .DOT) trading up 16 points, or 2.60 percent at 647. 

 Among the winners was online bookseller Amazon.com Inc.., which was up 9-3/8 at 75-1/4 after it said it would add three new features this month that would allow it to expand its merchandise offerings, improve its product search and upgrade its payment system. 

 But among the Dow components, both Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines Corp. were trading lower. HP was down 2-5/16 at 92-13/16 and IBM was down 2-1/2 at 121-5/16. 

 Strong demand for new cars and aircraft drove up orders for durable goods more than expected, the U.S. Commerce Department reported an hour before the markets opened. The value of total new orders rose by 0.9 percent, compared to the 0.9 percent decline forecast by economists polled by Reuters. 

 "There wasn't a large variance from what was expected so participants should be looking more at fundamentals for the day," George Rodriguez, senior vice president, Guzman & Co. in Jersey City, N.J. 

 The market is more likely to focus on Tuesday's upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, third-quarter earnings expectations and profit warnings, he said. 

 Cosmetics company Avon Products Inc. saw its stock drop 8-3/4 points, or 24 percent, to 26-15/16 in active trading after it warned its fourth-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations. PaineWebber also cut its rating on the stock to neutral from attractive. 

 Gillette Co. was also down after issuing a profit warning and receiving ratings cuts from Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney. The stock was down 3-10/16, or 9 percent, at 33-7/16. 

 The Dow industrials on Tuesday closed 27 points lower, or 0.27 percent, at 10,275 after cutting losses that mounted to as much as 222 points. 

 "Now that we've been on the roller coaster, who wants to go on the bumper cars?" said Bryan Piskorowski, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "We're in for some choppiness here."

 Mutual Risk tumbles 32 percent on  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Shares in Mutual Risk Management Ltd. slid 32 percent to a new 52-week low on Monday after the Hamilton, Bermuda, speciality insurer warned that its third-quarter profits will miss analysts' consensus due to pricing pressure and bleak fee income growth. 

 Mutual Risk Management - which sets up and manages alternative insurance arrangements for corporations and groups - sees third quarter profits in the range of 33-38 cents per share, versus the Street consensus of 44 cents tallied by market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. It earned 37 cents in the same quarter last year. 

 On the heels of the profit warning, shares of Mutual Risk tumbled to $12-7/8, down $6-1/16, on the New York Stock Exchange. Over three million shares changed hands, up sharply from the average daily trading volume of 340,595. 

 Dragging its bottom line down will be its programme business segment, which is insurance or reinsurance provided to pools of similar companies, often involving non-standard or high-risk business, analysts said. 

 The segment generated about half the company's fee-based income last year, said William Blair & Co.'s analyst Mark Lane, who cut his stock rating to hold from a long-term buy after the company warned of a profit shortfall before markets opened on Monday. 

 Mutual Risk also blamed its underwriting management unit, Small Business Underwriters, which provides workers' compensation coverage. The unit is facing increased competition and lower workers' compensation rates, especially in Massachusetts - a fairly important business region for the unit. 

 Further, it has failed to renew small a number of programmes due to competition from cheap reinsurance deals. It made a provision of about $8 million, which translates to 16 cents a share, partly for costs of exiting these programmes. 

 "The commercial insurance market is in turmoil; we continue to expect an upward movement in pricing, especially in the worker's compensation market," said Chief Executive Robert Mulderig during a conference call. 

 "Despite the lower level of earnings expected in the quarter, we still expect to record an operating profit...We continue to experience lower levels of fees from the reduced pace of programme business for the remainder of 1999 and into 2000. We believe, however, that the pricing will firm and then our corporate risk management business segment will grow as a result," Mulderig added.

 Federal-Mogul to sell lighting, wiper and fuel units.

 DETROIT, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Auto parts manufacturer Federal-Mogul Corp.  said on Monday it planned to sell its $700 million lighting, wiper blade and fuel units so it could focus on core operations. 

 Federal-Mogul executives also told analysts they have temporarily put the company's aggressive acquisition plans on hold while they deal with a series of internal forecasting and management issues that led to earnings warnings and a shake-up of executive ranks two weeks ago. 

 "For the next several months, we will not pursue additional acquisitions," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dick Snell. "Our time will be spent getting our company back to fighting form to gain your esteem and confidence." 

 The Southfield, Mich.-based company, one of the world's largest makers of sealings, engine parts and brake components, said it hired an investment bank to help sell the wiper, light and fuel units, which employ about 5,400 people at 14 manufacturing facilities. 

 The operations make and sell Wagner, Blazer, Zanxx and Signal-Stat lighting products, as well as Anco wiper blades and Carter fuel system components. 

 Snell said the company was considering a "modest" share buyback to offset any dilution that could occur from the company's strategy of selling non-core businesses. 

 Chief Financial Officer Tom Ryan said the company remained "comfortable" with its revised full-year earnings expectations of $4.20-$4.30 a share, first disclosed September 13. Federal-Mogul earned $2.69 for all of 1998. Analysts had expected the company to earn $4.73 in 1999 before the profit warning. 

 Federal-Mogul blamed its earnings shortfall on start-up problems with its camshaft business, weak global aftermarket sales and overly optimistic projections about new business. Several executives, including President and Chief Operating Officer Gordon Ulsh, resigned earlier this month. 

 The revenue forecast shortfall was mostly from brake and chassis product lines as part the $1.9 billion acquisition of Cooper Automotive unit of Cooper Industries Inc. , Ryan said. Instead of generating $0.35 a share in earnings for 1999, Ryan said the acquisition will have a $0.10 a share dilutive effect this year and generate $0.20 in 2000. 

 But the executives said they see no charges for asset impairments from the Cooper purchase, adding that the rate of return for the deal, estimated at slightly more than 11 percent, was still above the company's 10.5 percent cost of capital. 

 Snell promised analysts there were "no more cockroaches" in the forecasts, adding the situation, "was the absolute worst thing I've ever gone through in my business career. 

 "This was an isolated event completely associated with poor forecasting in our aftermarket business. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with our company or the markets we compete in," he said. 

 Merrill Lynch analyst John Casesa said in a research note that, although executives were straightforward, investors will likely wait until fourth quarter results are released next year to see if the problems have really been fixed. 

 The fact Federal-Mogul is out of the acquisition market suggests it may drop out of the bidding for TRW Inc.'s  valvetrain business, Casesa said. That means Dana Corp.  may have a better chance of buying the unit, he said. 

 Federal-Mogul's stock, which has fallen more than 30 percent since September 13 when the news was announced, was up 43 cents to $24.875 on Monday.

 Cotelligent Inc. said it expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to fall below Wall Street's expectations, sending its shares down 18%. For the quarter ending Thursday, the San Francisco provider of information-technology-consulting and outsourcing services said it expects to break even or report net income of one cent to two cents a diluted share. A year earlier, the company earned 27 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial forecast earnings of eight cents a share. The company blamed declining demand from its corporate customers for services on information-technology infrastructures. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Cotelligent fell 87.5 cents to $4.

 U.S. stocks off - bonds, dollar up, in week Dow falls.

 NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks settled modestly lower on Friday, while bonds and the dollar edged higher in a week when the Dow Jones industrial average fell a record 524.30 points. 

 In the commodities markets, gold rose and oil fell. 

 The Dow's big drop this week followed investor flight to quality to bonds from stocks. For most, the exit from stocks was driven by worries about the yen's surge against the dollar, a record U.S. trade deficit and fear the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again on Oct. 5. 

 "What bothered me was this really extreme flight to quality," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. 

 But the big sell-off in stocks could persuade the Fed to hold off on a rate increase next month, some analysts said. "The correction in the stock market certainly would make the Fed more cautious about taking any tightening action at the Oct. 5 meeting," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston. 

 On Friday, the Dow dropped 39.26 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 10,279.33. Earlier Friday, the index was down about 130 points. 

 The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology stocks, lost 9.42 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,740.41. And the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index slipped 3.05 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,277.36. 

 Broader market measures remained weak. Falling stocks outnumbered gains by a three-to-two margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was about 866 million shares. 

 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury rose by 9/32, or $2.8125 on a $1,000 bond, pushing its yield down to 5.97 percent from 5.99 percent late Thursday. 

 Selling pressure appeared to abate Friday, helped by a somewhat calmer tone in currency markets ahead of a weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations. 

 On Thursday, the Dow lost 205.48 points to end at 10,318.59 and the Nasdaq posted its fourth-biggest point loss ever of 108.33 to 2,749.83. The Standard & Poor's 500 broke through key support levels to fall 30.10 points to close at 1,280.41. 

 Some analysts attributed Thursday's big stock sell-off to comments from Microsoft Corp. President Steve Ballmer's remarks to journalists in Seattle that technology stocks, including Microsoft's, were overvalued. 

 On Tuesday, the Dow skidded 225.43 points to settle at 10,598.47 after the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap widened to a record $25.18 billion in July, surpassing June's record of $24.60 billion. The yield on the long bond shot up to 6.09 percent and the dollar tumbled against the yen. 

 Among the Dow's biggest declines Friday was chemicals company Union Carbide Corp., which issued a warning about a profit shortfall. 

 Union Carbide slipped 2-5/16 to 52-11/16. 

 America Online Inc. went against the trend, surging 10-1/4 to 97-1/2 after news Microsoft's competing MSN online network was raising prices - a move viewed as lifting the risk of an Internet service price war. 

 On Friday, Microsoft stock slipped 1/4 to 90-15/16. 

 In late U.S. trading, the dollar stood at 104.17 yen, little more than a yen above 3-1/2 year lows hit last week. Late on Thursday, the dollar traded at 103.87 yen. 

 The dollar inched higher against the euro. In late U.S. trading, the euro stood at $1.04425, compared with $1.04985 late on Thursday. 

 COMEX December gold rose to $272.40 a troy ounce, its highest price since June 7 and then settled at $269.80, up $2.50 from Thursday's close. The market, traders said, was still in a buoyant mood after the Bank of England's sale Tuesday of 25 metric tons of gold reserves was met with surprisingly strong demand. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for November delivery ended at $24.76 a barrel, down 11 cents. The contract shot up to $24.96 a barrel after news that the Department of Energy was not considering the sale of oil from the nation's strategic reserves. On Thursday, November crude hit a 32-month high of $24.99. 

 In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 stock index slid 32.1 points, or 0.54 percent, to close at 5,937.6. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average settled at 16,871.73 - its first close below 17,000 since June 9 - and a drop of 454.03 points, or 2.62 percent, from Thursday.

 ((Updates to midday)) 

 NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks traded lower at midday on Friday, as traders searched to find new support a day after the market burst through the bottom of key trading ranges. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average at midday was down 38 points, or 0.37 percent, at 10,280 on active volume. Earlier, the market had seesawed, rising onto positive ground and then falling as much as 127 points in late morning trade. 

 The Nasdaq composite index was down 28.82 points, or 1.05 percent, at 2,721.01. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index was down 5.64 points at 1,274.77. 

 On Thursday, the Dow ended down 205.48 points and the Nasdaq recorded its fourth-largest point loss of 108.33. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was up 1/32 with a yield of 5.99 percent. 

 Analysts said the market was searching for a new bottom to the trading range and had further to decline. 

 "At a bottom, there's a sense of futility, a sense there's no place to hide," said Stephen Shobin, a technical analyst at Lehman Brothers. 

 Once traders take out even the favoured technology and biotechnology stocks, then the bulls will return, Shobin said. 

 "The quicker we endure the pain, the quicker we'll enjoy the next bull market," he said. 

 On Thursday, the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index broke through key technical support levels near midday and even the technology sector turned negative after Microsoft Corp. President Steve Ballmer said computer and computer-related stocks were overvalued, including Microsoft's. 

 Doug Myers, vice president of equity trading at Wachovia Securities in Atlanta, predicted the downtrend would not last, but that the Dow would find a new support level in the high 9,000s and bounce up from there. 

 "Think of pigeons in the park: When one alights, where do the rest of them go? People are looking for somewhere to land," Myers said. 

 Factors pushing the markets down include the dollar's weakness against the yen, the record trade gap, concern about third-quarter corporate earnings and nervousness about whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Oct. 5. 

 The markets also were anxiously awaiting the outcome of the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised nations and whether it acts to influence the economy. 

 One of the key issues has been the rising strength of the Japanese economy and its currency, the yen, which has been near three-year highs against the dollar. On Friday, the dollar was at 104.1 against the yen. 

 In economic news Friday, the National Association of Realtors reported August existing home sales slipped by 2.8 percent to 5.25 million units. 

 Stocks in the mews included Sprint Corp., which was trading 2-3/8 higher at 53-7/16 after sources said it was in merger talks with MCI WorldCom Inc. MCI shares were down 3-1/8 at 75-3/8. 

 Insurer Allstate Corp. saw its shares slip 4-15/16 to 26-15/16 after it issued a profit warning, due in part to losses from Hurricane Floyd. 

 Among initial public offerings, Alteon WebSystems was up sharply after its debut at $19 per share. Alteon, which helps improve the efficiency of Internet servers to facilitate sales on the Web, was selling at 34 a share on Nasdaq at midday.

 NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Spreads on bonds of Rite Aid Corp.  have ballooned out by as much as 200 basis points this week after Florida sued the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain for allegedly deceptive trade practices, market players said. 

 "Those bonds fell out of bed this week, they're trading about 200 basis points wider since news of the lawsuit," one high-grade trader said. 

 On Wednesday, the Forida Attorney General's office filed suit against Rite Aid alleging deceptive trade practices, civil theft and racketeering. 

 Camp HIll, Pa.-based Rite Aid denied engaging in any impromper practices. 

 The bonds barely flinched on Friday, after Rite Aid announed it was cutting 330 jobs in a corporate downsizing. The company said it was hoping to generate after-tax savings of $20 million a year. 

 Market players said just a couple of weeks ago the firm's debt due 2007 traded around 200 basis points over Treausries but later widened out to about 220 basis points following a delay in its second quarter earnings call to analysts. The bonds continued to widen further and were seen trading in the 275 basis points area before news of the Florida suit, traders said. 

 "The company has consistenly put off analysts meetings that it had scheduled to give earnings guidance for the year, in addition, they've been trying to sell assets," said Mark Husson, senior food and drug analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., 

 "These factors tend to show that the company's earnings are weaker than expected, and that there may be a cash crunch looming in November," Husson said. 

 Dave Novosel, director of fixed-income research at Banc One Capital Markets, Inc. said this week's lawsuit triggered the most substantial widening in the firms bonds. 

 "The real bombshell came Wednesday, bonds really widend out to between 400 and 500 basis points over," Novosel said. 

 Meanwhile, traders and analysts said spreads on the firm's 30-year bonds drifted out to a spread of between 500 to 600 basis points. 

 "Without the lawsuit these things are clearly overdone," said Novosel. "The problem with lawsuits is they tend not to get settled very quickly and in the mean time you don't know what the final or ultimate cost will be to Rite Aid." 

 "If people want to invest at 400-500 (basis points) over they can go to other credits that don't have this kind of legal overhang ... to a double-B type name where the credit quality isn't as good but there's a better idea of where things will be in a year," Novosel said. 

 Rite Aid bonds, currently rated Baa1/BBB, remain under review by both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. 

 "The spreads indicate junk status. My estimate is that they get downgraded but remain investment-grade; however, the worst case would be a split rating, one investment-grade and one high-yield," Novosel said. 

 Rite Aid shares, which reached a high of more than $50 in January dropped substantially when the company issued a profit warning in March, which cut its market value nearly in half. Its shares have now fallen to levels not seen since 1995. On Friday, the drugstore chain's shares closed down 11/16 to 11. 

 Turning to the broader sector, secondary bond ended a bit softer in very quiet trade, players said. 

 Spreads were quoted about a basis point wider while high-yield prices ended unchanged to a tad mixed, with some issues closing up 1/4 to down 1/4, traders said. 

 "Clearly, it was the new issue calendar that was being followed this week," said one high-yield trader. 

 "The secondary market really hasn't had a whole lot of steam coming out of the summer. Once the calendar clears we should be able to pick up some secondary flow," the trader said. 

 In other markets, the benchmark 30-year bond closed up 9/32 at 102-4/32, remaining below the key 6.0 percent level to yield 5.97 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 39.26 at 10,279.33.

 CHICAGO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Allstate Corp.  fell sharply on Friday after the insurance company said its third-and fourth-quarter profits would fall below both year-ago levels and Wall Street expectations. 

 At around midday, Allstate was down $5.19, or 16.3 percent, at $26.69 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of 6.5 million shares. 

 The news from Allstate pulled down the shares of other insurers with similar business. 

 Progressive Corp. , which issued its own third-quarter profit warning a month ago, was down $6.375 to $85.50, and American International Group Inc. , better known as AIG, fell $3.125 to $87.25. 

 Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate, the No. 2 U.S. insurer of homes and autos, said its third-quarter operating profit, which excludes special items, would be 50 to 55 cents per share, well shy of analysts' consensus estimate of 78 cents, compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Allstate said its fourth-quarter operating profit should be 65 and 73 cents per share, compared with the consensus forecast of 81 cents. 

 Insurance industry analyst Michael Lewis of Warburg Dillon Read said he had lowered his investment rating on Allstate to "hold" from "strong buy." 

 He said he cut his rating because he does not see the intense competition in personal lines insurance, particularly the auto insurance business, improving in the near term. 

 With no near-term catalyst to bolster the stock, Allstate is likely to trade at $25 to $30 until the company's fundamentals improve, Lewis said. ((-Chicago equities news, 312 408 8787, chicago.equities.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 U.S. stocks limp lower, Dow's weekly loss a record.

 NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks wound up one of their worst weeks in history, limping lower on Friday as profit worries helped push already skittish investors out of stocks and into bonds for a second straight session. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.26 points, or 0.38 percent, to 10,279.33, bringing the weekly loss to 524.30 points, eclipsing the record 481.97-point slide in the last week of August 1998, when markets were in the throes of a global financial crisis. 

 Chemicals company Union Carbide Corp. was among the Dow's biggest decliners after warning of a profit shortfall. And insurer Allstate Corp., which also issued an earnings warning, ended with sharp losses as well. 

 Selling pressure appeared to abate, helped by a somewhat stabler tone in currency markets ahead of a weekend meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G7) nations. 

 Even so, analysts said the activity, which saw yields on the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury fall as low as 5.97 percent as its price rose by 9/32, showed clearly a defensive tone was still dominant. 

 "What bothered me was this really extreme flight to quality," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. 

 Broader market measures remained weak. Falling stocks outnumbered gainers by a three-to-two margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was about 866 million shares. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 9.42 points to 2,740.41 and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index dipped 3.05 points to 1,277.36, less than a point away from a level that would represent a 10 percent "correction" decline from its record high of 1418.78, set on July 16. 

 Even at that level, technical analysts, who try to predict trends based on historical patterns of market behaviour, said they saw no sign the market was about to bounce. 

 "The likelihood of any rally that starts around here (these stock levels) having any chance of success is between none and zero," said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James and Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. 

 Intel Corp. fell 1-53/64 to 75-43/64 after BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Dan Niles told investors weaker PC demand in the third quarter and the after-effects of the recent earthquake in Taiwan on the semiconductor market would likely pressure the chip maker's shares near-term. 

 America Online Inc. bucked the trend, surging 10-1/4 to 97-1/2 after news that Microsoft Corp.'s competing MSN online network was raising prices, a move viewed as lifting the risk of an Internet service price war. 

 Microsoft shares eased 1/4 to 90-15/16. 

 Union Carbide fell 2-5/16 to 52-11/16 after warning late Thursday that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of estimates because of high raw materials costs. The company was the third Dow component - after Coca-Cola Co. and Sears Roebuck & Co. - to issue a warning for the quarter. 

 Allstate fell 3-3/4 to 28-1/8 after warning its profits for the rest of the year would fall short of expectations because of higher catastrophe losses, including the impact of Hurricane Floyd and pricing pressures.

 CHICAGO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Insurer Allstate Corp. on Friday said its profits for the rest of the year would fall from year-ago levels and not meet expectations because of higher catastrophe losses, including from Hurricane Floyd, and pricing pressures. 

 The announcement sent shares of Allstate and other insurers tumbling. 

 The No. 2 U.S. home and car insurer said its third quarter operating profit, which excludes special items, will be in the range of 50 cents to 55 cents per share, well shy of the the First Call/Thomson Financial market expectation of 78 cents. 

 It said its fourth quarter operating profit should range between 65 cents and 73 cents per share compared to the consensus forecast of 81 cents. 

 "Intense competition in the personal lines industry coupled with a rise in the cost of doing business is putting pressure on our near term earnings," Allstate Chief Executive Edward Liddy said in a statement. 

 Around midday, Allstate shares were down 5-1/16, or about 15.8 percent, at 26-13/16 after posting a new 52-week low of 25-3/4. The sell-off knocked nearly $2.2 billion off the company's market capitalisation, based on the 810.5 million diluted shares outstanding at the end of the second quarter. 

 The news from Allstate took shares of other insurers with similar business down as well. 

 Ohio-based Progressive Corp., which issued its own third quarter profit warning a month ago, fell 6-7/8 to 85 and New York-based American International Group Inc., better known as AIG, lost 3-1/4 to 87-1/8. 

 Including income from investments but excluding acquisition-related charges, Allstate said its net income will come in between 70 cents and 75 cents a share for the third quarter, down from 86 cents last year. Fourth quarter net income, meanwhile, could fall to 76 cents to 84 cents per share from 93 cents in 1998. 

 Michael Lewis, insurance industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, said he lowered his investment rating on Allstate to hold from strong buy because of the intense competition in the auto insurance business and the fact that he does not expect the environment to improve anytime soon. 

 "There still appears to be a game going on for market share" in the auto insurance business, he said. "When they ease up, no one knows." 

 Allstate spokesman Peter Debreceny said the company is seeing signs that an ongoing trend of rate reductions appeared to be slowing. 

 "Some stability might be coming back into pricing," he said in a telephone interview. "Nonetheless, we are aware that Allstate will need to continue to be competitively priced." 

 In addition to catastrophe loss issues such as Floyd, Allstate said higher technology spending, a costly advertising campaign, additional reserves for asbestos-related losses and a decline in average premiums contributed to the lower profit forecast. 

 An insurance industry group on Friday estimated insured damage from Floyd, which struck virtually the entire East Coast, at $1.3 billion. 

 Debreceny said Allstate increased its marketing spending this year by $40 million to $50 million, for a total of roughly $140 million. 

 "We are determined to improve our growth opportunities organically," he said. "We're going to be investing significantly more in advertising to protect and reinforce our brand awareness." 

 The company is reviewing its core business, including its cost structure, current business model, and pricing competitiveness. The review would close in the fourth quarter after which Allstate will report actions it expects to take to boost its financial performance. 

 When asked whether job cuts would be considered as part of the review, Debreceny said "everything's on the table." 

 Allstate said its growth opportunities have been broadened by its alliance with Putnam Investments to sell variable annuity products, struck in March, and its acquisitions of CNA Financial Corp.'s personal lines business and American Heritage Life Investment Corp..

Dow Dives As Yen March Continues

Another setback for the US dollar, compounded by the ballooning US trade deficit, rattled bonds and helped send share prices tumbling on Wall Street on Tuesday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 225.43 points, or 2.1 per cent its third-largest one-day points loss this year.

The decline extended the blue-chip index's slide from its record high almost a month ago to 727.57 points, or 6.4 per cent.

The Nasdaq Composite index nosedived 65.05 points, or 2.3 per cent, while the S&P 500 index dropped 2.1 per cent.

Outside the indices, which are dominated by the big stocks, the broader market was savaged, with declines outnumbering rises by almost four to one on the New York Stock Exchange.

The first flashpoint for financial markets was a renewed slide in the US dollar/yen exchange rate to YEN104.78 after the Bank of Japan's policy-setting meeting failed to produce measures to ease monetary conditions and the central bank made no move to intervene on foreign exchange markets to halt the yen's surge.

Then came news of the record US trade deficit for July.

Economists had forecast a deficit around $US22.3 billion but it turned out to be $US25.18 billion ($38.7 billion).

In addition, June's deficit was revised to $US24.6 billion also a record.

The nation's trade imbalance has climbed to new highs for four successive months, pushing the gap between imports and exports to an annual rate of $US247 billion, far above last year's record $US164.3 billion.

Bond prices were not hit as hard as share prices.

The day's 1 per cent fall by the US dollar against the yen a week after the greenback fell to a 31/2-year low versus the Japanese currency resulted in a price fall for the benchmark 30-year bond that lifted its yield to 6.09 per cent from 6.06 per cent on Monday.

But the combination of events sparked renewed worries about the likelihood of another interest rate rise by the US Federal Reserve, as well as the prospect of increased selling of US equities and bonds by Japanese investors.

For the sharemarket, the gloom was further deepened by a surprise profit warning from Apple Computer the previous evening.

That stunned investors in technology stocks whose price gains have helped send the indices to record highs this year even as most of the market has sunk.

Apple's share price dropped more than 12 per cent on Tuesday after the company blamed a shortage of G4 chips to power its new line of Power Mac computers for a shortfall in fourth-quarter earnings.

Shares in Motorola, which manufactures the G4 chip, fell more than 3 per cent while the share prices of other computer makers such as IBM, Dell, Gateway and Hewlett-Packard fell as much as 6 per cent.

Economists, meanwhile, were debating the likely impact of the stronger yen on the world's two largest economies.

Most believe it will slow Japan's economic recovery and contribute to a rise in import prices for the US, increasing inflation risks and the chances of another interest rate rise by the Fed.

Many also worry that further yen gains could lead to a sell-off of US Treasury bonds by foreigners repatriating funds, which in turn could force a rise of more than 1 per cent in bond yields.

That would be expected to see the sharemarket come under further selling pressure.

 NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq market tumbled Thursday as gains in Internet shares could not offset losses posted by technology heavyweights and the broader market's late day sell-off. 

 Traders were unsure if Wall Street could recover in Friday's trade. Some analysts expected the market to extend its losses, with the Nasdaq slipping but resisting a huge tumble. 

 The Nasdaq composite index fell an unofficial 107.67 points, or 3.77 percent, to 2750.50 - the fourth largest point decline in Nasdaq history. Declining issues swamped advancers by 2,629 to 1,227 on volume of 1.15 billion as 111 stocks made new lows against 84 new highs. 

 "It was holding up the best by far and it is just succumbing with pressure that's been prevalent in the rest of the market," said Robert Dickey, an analyst at Dain Rauscher, about the Nasdaq. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 205.48 points to close at 10318.59 while the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell below the 1300 support level, closing down 30.11 at 1280.40. 

 "We broke under that 10,500 level with gusto today and I think that means we will follow through. Investors should not trust an up opening," he said. "On a relative basis, the big caps and the Nasdaq will hold up better than other indices." 

 Nasdaq's bellwethers topped the most active stocks list. Intel Corp. , Dell Computer Corp. , and Microsoft Corp. , respectively had the most shares trading hands and each lost at least three points. 

 Microsoft said it would spin off its Web travel service, raising an estimated $75 million. The software giant plans to keep hold of a majority stake in the service. Shares closed down 4-7/8 at 91-3/16. 

 Intel said Thursday it would buy the telecom component products unit of Stanford Telecommunications Inc.  as part of plans to expand its communication chip business. It closed down 5-5/16 at 77-1/2. Stanford shares rose 2-9/16 to 32 - a new high. 

 Internet service provider MindSpring Enterprises Inc.  dropped 5-1/2 to 27-3/8 after agreeing to merge with EarthLink Network Inc.  in a $1.6 billion deal. EarthLink shares also slipped, falling 1-1/8 to 42-3/8. 

 The deal would create the No. 2 Internet access provider, lagging far behind America Online Inc. , which fell 4-1/8 to 87-1/4. Analysts said this deal characterised the type of consolidation beginning to heat up in the ISP market. 

 ASI Solutions Inc. , the market's leading percentage loser, closed down 2-13/32 at 4-23/32, a new 52-week low. The company, a provider of human resource services, issued a profit warning based on slack revenues. 

 Bucking the broad downtrend, some Internet stocks gained ground on upbeat analyst comments and strong performance in several IPO although major Internet indexes also retreated 4 percent. 

 Initial public offerings led Nasdaq's percentage gainers, a day after IPOs buoyed the technology-heavy market Wednesday. 


eGain Communications Inc.	   , which supplies customer service infrastructure for electronic-commerce companies closed up 11 at 23 after pricing its offering at $12 a share.
Interactive Intelligence Inc.	    jumped 11-1/16 to 24-1/16 after a $13 a share offering at their debut.



Shares of Global Crossing Ltd.  closed up 11/16 at 25-1/16. The stock rocketed in pre-market and early morning trade as high as 27-13/16 after Standard & Poor's said it would add the company to its highly watched S&P 500 stock index.

 NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp.  shares on Thursday fell to lows not seen since 1995 after Florida sued the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain for allegedly deceptive trade practices. 

 Rite Aid shares were down nearly 25 percent, off $3.875 to $11.875. The stock was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Warburg Dillon Read analyst Steven Valiquette said the stock could trade flat for the remainder of the year following the bad news. 

 Valiquette, who has a "neutral" rating on the stock, said it could be a good value for investors willing to hold the shares for two to three years, since the company generates a large amount of cash and has good assets. 

 "There are a lot of underlying strengths to the Rite Aid story," Gary Giblen, Banc of America Securities analyst, said. He noted the retailer's purchase of drug benefits manager PCS, a venture with General Nutrition Cos. Inc. and its 22 percent stake in Drugstore.com Inc.  as recent positives overshadowed by bad news. 

 Giblen had suspended coverage of Rite Aid stock when the company postponed revealing a national strategy to analysts for the past three months. 

 Giblen said he is not familiar with the facts of the Florida Attorney General's case, but Rite Aid has a good track record against lawsuits. Giblen speculates that the Attorney General is taking advantage of the company's damaged reputation. 

 Rite Aid, however will have to overcome a "credibility gap" after the latest allegations, Giblen said. 

 Brokers Raymond James analyst John Ransom cut his investment rating on Rite Aid to "accumulate" from "buy." Ransom cited the Florida lawsuit, which he said may spread to other states; a possible debt-rating downgrade by Standard & Poor's Corp.; and a "lack of earnings visibility." 

 On Wednesday the Florida Attorney General's Office filed suit against Rite Aid alleging deceptive trade practices, civil theft and racketeering. 

 Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid denied engaging in any improper practices. 

 "Not one customer was deceived or defrauded," the company said in a statement. "We would not and will not pay tribute or otherwise be intimidated to avoid publicity." 

 Rite Aid operates some 3,800 stores in 30 states and owns PCS Health Systems Inc., which serves as a middleman to negotiate discounts between drugmakers and health plans. 

 Rite Aid shares reached a high of more than $50 in January, but the company issued a profit warning in March that cut its market value nearly in half. 

 The company has been saddled with underperforming stores and after it announced the sale of 38 California drugstores on Sept. 15, analysts said it was expected to unload more assets to pump up its flagging stock price.

 LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - News and financial information company Reuters Group Plc, reacting to a more than 13 percent fall in its share price on Thursday, said it did not make a profit warning during U.S. meetings with analysts. 

 The company, which saw its shares hit as analysts cut their forecasts after the meeting, also said it did not release any price-sensitive information during the briefings with British and U.S. analysts in New York on Wednesday. 

 "The background briefings were on subjects including Internet strategy, the plans of our Instinet electronic broker, and the progress of the joint venture with Dow Jones ," Reuters said in a statement. 

 "Nothing was said at the briefing that could be construed as a profits forecast or a profits warning, and there is no price sensitive information which it should announce," it added. 

 Reuters said it would update the market when it announces third-quarter revenues on October 21. 

 The statement came hours after Reuters shares sank as low as 705 pence, their lowest since January, making them the top percentage loser on London's FTSE 100 blue chip index, which was stronger overall. 

 Dealers said analysts cut their earnings forecasts after a meeting with company executives in New York. 

 The lower earnings forecasts reflected worries about Reuters' Instinet electronic broking unit due to disappointing volumes on the U.S. Nasdaq exchange, dealers said. 

 They added that the Instinet concerns were coupled with fears of lower-than-expected revenues in Reuters' transaction products operation.

 Bottomline Technology Shares Plunge With  Profit Warning , Y2K Fears

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Bottomline Technologies Inc. Wednesday took a hit following the Internet-business software company's warning of a fiscal first-quarter loss due to slower sales associated with the year 2000 problem. BancBoston downgraded the stock after the announcement. 

 The Portsmouth, N.H.-based company's (EPAY) stock tumbled $8.50, or 34%, to $16.50 on volume of 4.3 million shares, compared with a daily average of 169,600. 

 Bottomline's expected loss for the quarter ending Sept. 30 ignited fears that it wasn't coming out of a slump as are many business-software companies seeing prospective customers wrapping up their Y2K remediation. 

 "We now expect the Y2K issue to impact both the September and December quarter-end revenues and earnings," Dan McGurl, president and chief executive, said in a statement late Tuesday. 

 "Financial institutions and large corporate entities are being very cautious at this time about adding new applications that interact with mission-critical payment operations," McGurl said. 

 Bottomline, which provides software that enables electronic commerce transactions, expects a loss of no more than 10 cents a share, excluding a charge for research and development in conjunction with an ongoing acquisition effort. First-quarter revenue will be lower-than-expected at $8.2 million to $8.5 million, the company said. 

 BancBoston downgraded the stock after the company's warning because analysts had been expecting a profit. Its shares fell as much as 50% to a new low of $12.625, past the previous floor of $14 set Feb. 12, when the stock debuted. 

 Bottomline said it is excited and optimistic about its core business once the Y2K uncertainty passes.

 Managers & Managing: Whither Fruit of the Loom as Output Falters? ---  Profit Warning , Changing of the Guard Mask Strengths

 CHICAGO -- Fruit of the Loom Ltd. is having trouble making enough underpants. 

 Last month, Fruit said second-half results would fall "significantly below" expectations because of "production and customer-service difficulties." And its longtime chief executive, William Farley, relinquished operating control. 

 Since undergarments aren't as complex as, say, microchips, Fruit's critics and investors are wondering why it can't iron out the wrinkles in its operation. 

 Dennis Bookshester, an outside director named acting CEO, says Fruit's computer system is to blame for some of the problems. "I don't know online every day what we own and what we're shipping," Mr. Bookshester says. 

 Now, he has computer consultants trying to fix the problem. A former retailing executive, Mr. Bookshester is in charge until Fruit can find a permanent successor to Mr. Farley. 

 The production problems are particularly galling because Fruit controls almost one-third of the U.S. market for men's and boys' underwear. Its estimated 32% market share is second to Sara Lee Corp.'s Hanes, which holds about a 37% share. 

 Making clothes "isn't rocket science," says Donald Yacktman, whose Yacktman Asset Management Co., based in Chicago, holds several hundred thousand Fruit shares. It is "Business 101," he says. 

 For its underwear-making and other travails, Fruit has taken a beating on Wall Street. Fourteen months ago, its market capitalization stood at more than $2.5 billion (2.4 billion euros). Since then, the price of its shares has plunged about 90%, to $3.625 Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange, and the apparel maker is valued at some $235 million. 

 Meanwhile, Fruit expects to be in violation of some of its debt covenants by Sept. 30, and is negotiating with its banks for a waiver. "I expect to have the votes to get that" waiver, said Brian J. Hanigan, vice president and treasurer. He says Fruit has enough cash to meet obligations through the end of the year, including a $45 million debt payment in October. After that, Fruit will need to sell noncore assets, or get an infusion of capital, to finance itself, Mr. Hanigan says. 

 Through the first six months of 1999, Fruit had a loss of $11.3 million, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $960.4 million. Analysts expect the company to post a full-year loss of perhaps $30 million. 

 "I went to a `no estimate' for next year," says Merrill Lynch analyst Pamela Singleton of Fruit's earnings outlook, "because I do think one needs to know who's running the company and what is the strategy." 

 The next CEO will have much to work with. Fruit remains a powerful brand name, and so are the company's other brands, such as BVD and Gitano. Although the markets it serves are relatively mature, and despite competitive pressure from designer underwear brands that rivals make under license from Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, the company enjoys solid long-term relationships with the mass merchants that sell its T-shirts, underwear, jeans and activewear. 

 Its vertically integrated organization, in which it makes the cloth that other workers cut and sew into garments, historically has made Fruit one of the lowest-cost producers in its industry. 

 The change of guard at the top gives hope to some observers. A financier by training, Mr. Farley, 56 years old, took control of Fruit's predecessor company through a leveraged transaction in the mid-1980s, but trouble ensued. Financing difficulties forced him to unload vast portions of his once substantial empire of apparel industry holdings. As part of that retrenchment, his controlling stake in Fruit has fallen to a 31% voting position. 

 But through it all, Mr. Farley maintained his hold on the CEO position, and some observers say that has been a big part of the problem. "Under his leadership, the company has performed poorly for a number of years," Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Dennis Rosenberg says. 

 Adds Mr. Yacktman, the Fruit investor: "It would appear that he (Mr. Farley) would have been better off leaving the operating side to someone else." 

 Mr. Farley couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Farley isn't involved in day-to-day decisions, Mr. Bookshester says. "He is a nonexecutive chairman. He will be there when I need him." 

 Where did Mr. Farley go wrong? By shipping much of Fruit's production overseas in recent years, he cut thousands of jobs from the domestic work force and succeeded in reducing its cost structure. But the offshore strategy generated quality-control problems and complicated Fruit's production and inventory-control processes, critics say, at a time when the company's internal operations-management talent pool was thin. 

 Mr. Farley responded to weakening demand last year by sharply cutting back his company's mainly Caribbean work force. Later, the company conceded it had misread the market: With demand surging, Fruit struggled to locate workers and restart its facilities, and margins suffered because Fruit was forced to outsource some production. Mr. Bookshester said the computer problems contributed to that miscue. 

 The good news is that there was strong demand for Fruit's products, Mr. Bookshester says. Now, the company needs to work out its delivery problems. "I'm very very optimistic," he says. 

 Fruit's problems involve "basic business" procedures, fund manager Mr. Yacktman says. But "they're very fixable." 

 The 60-year-old Mr. Bookshester, a respected retail veteran, says Fruit is in the process of devising a new business plan and conducting a massive inventory review. Earlier this week, Fruit also named new manufacturing, distribution and sourcing executives.

 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks slumped at midday on Tuesday as the market heeded a slew of bad news, including a record U.S. trade deficit, a strong Japanese yen, and a profit warning from Apple Computer Corp. . 


The Dow Jones Industrial Average	  was down 171 points, or 1.59 percent, to 10,652. The Nasdaq composite index	   fell 32 points, or 1.14 percent, to 2,853.


 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 11/32 with the yield rising to 6.09 percent from 6.07 percent on Monday. 

 "It's the weakening in the dollar, the disaster in Taiwan, it's Apple Computer, it's a record trade deficit. It's a lot of things," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. "It's just uncertainty and not knowing the situation that has the market jittery." 


But money was flowing toward gold, as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's gold and silver index	  rose 3 points, or 5 percent, at 67.5. In Britain, a government auction of gold reserves was eight times oversubscribed as demand soared.



Gold was up $3.90 to $258.90 an ounce on the New York market.



"This is just a temporarily thing," Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc., said of the stock market's slide.



Concerns about corporate earnings warnings and a potential interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve in October will dissipate soon enough and be replaced by strong third quarter earnings to send the market higher, he predicted.



The U.S. trade deficit, unexpectedly widened to a record high in July at $25.18 billion, surpassing the previous month's record of $24.60 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the trade gap to shrink slightly to $23.8 billion.



"The gap widened to a record $25.18 billion, but the focus seems to remain on the dollar and the yen, and that doesn't seem to be any better," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "The dollar's going down like free beer. It's taking the focus off the trade number."



Overnight, the Bank of Japan declined to intervene in currency markets, a move that triggered a drop in the dollar against the yen, pushing down to 104.7 yen from 106.2 on Monday.



"In short, they completely punctured market hopes for easier money in Japan," Jose Rasco, of Hoenig & Co. said in a note to investors. "Within moments, the yen soared, the Nikkei futures plunged, the Japanese and U.S. bond yields jumped."



Last week, the dollar hit a three-and-a-half-year low of 103.1 against the yen, as Japan's economic recovery showed promise.



"Combined with Apple's surprise announcement after the close, we'll probably see some money come out of the market," said Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald,



Apple said its fourth-quarter income will not meet Wall Street expectations because Motorola Inc.  could not make enough of the chips that power Apple PowerMac G4 computers. Apple dropped 7-11/16 at 71-3/8 and Motorola was down 2-3/8 at 89-3/8.



Among the 30 Dow components, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.  was down 4-3/4, nearly 10 percent, at 47-3/16 after JP Morgan cut its rating on the stock.



International Business Machines Corp.  fell 2-7/8 at 128, a day after it shuffled management at its computer services division.



Meanwhile, traders watched the semiconductor industry to see how severely it would be impacted by the deadly earthquake that shook Taiwan, which accounts for 5 percent of the world's DRAM chip-memory market. The quake, which measured 7.6 on the Richter scale, killed more than 1,650 people, according to early estimates.



Goldman Sachs Groups Inc.  reported quarterly earnings that beat expectations, yet its stock was off 3/16 at 60-3/8.



Cabletron Systems Inc.  was down 1-7/8 at 17-1/8, despite the fact that it beat analysts' earnings estimates by a penny and got a boost in its rating from BancBoston Robertson Stephens.

 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Computer Inc.  plunged on Tuesday, extending losses that began in after-hours trading a day earlier after the computer maker said fourth-quarter results would fall well below Wall Street targets. 

 Analysts saw the price slide as a chance to buy. 

 "We would see a pullback in Apple's share price as a buying opportunity," said Charlie Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. 

 Apple shares were down $8 at $71.06 and touched a low of $70.625 in morning trade on the Nasdaq stock market as the overall market pushed lower. 

 The stock fell as much as $12 after the bell on Monday following the company's earnings warning. The stock's 52-week high is $80.125. 

 "Today's a buying opportunity, especially for Apple," said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. "They're just paying the price because their supplier couldn't meet their need." 

 Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple said its earnings would not meet Wall Street estimates due to low shipments of a new computer, the G4. Apple said Motorola Inc.  could not make enough of the chips that power the computer. 

 Motorola shares also slipped, dropping $2.375 to $89.375, off a 52-week high of $101.19. 

 "Apple's only mistake was to introduce the G4 before it had a clearer sense of Motorola's ability to ramp up production of the G4 processor," Wolf said. 

 "If anything, the demand for the G4 is likely to prove stronger than we had anticipated because of the product's superior price (and) performance," he said. 

 Both Banc of America Securities and Warburg Dillon Read cut their earnings targets on Apple for fiscal 1999. ((-Kristin Roberts, Wall Street Desk, 212-859-1730)).

 NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Latin American ADRs, or American Depositary Receipts, dipped Tuesday, but losses were modest compared to the decline in U.S. stocks. 

 The Bank of New York index of leading Latin American ADRs fell 0.18 percent to 88.89 even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 200 points to 10,623. 

 The Dow was pressured by a record U.S. trade deficit, continued strength in the Japanese yen and a profit warning from Apple Computer Inc. 

 "There are no sellers around," said one head of an emerging markets trading desk about Latin American markets. "And that's mighty surprising given that the U.S. market is getting whacked. There's a sense that (the region) could be worth at least a look for a quick trade." 

 Brazil's Bovespa stock exchange dipped 0.52 percent to 11,526. The market was expecting a rate cut at Wednesday's COPOM meeting, ADR traders said. 

 Deutsche Bank said in a research note that Brazil's announcement that it had a primary surplus for the consolidated public sector was a positive surprise. 

 Argentine truckers agreed to lift an eight-day anti-tax strike that had paralysed highways and resulted in food and fuel shortages. 


The Merval stock index	   fell 0.73 percent to 517.11.



Deutsche Bank, in a research note, said part of the improvement in Venezuela seen recently has been a result of the moderate stance taken by President Hugo Chavez, who appears to be taking a more centrist stance amid pressure from investors.



However, the firm said significant and sustainable further improvement in assets is not yet justifiable.



Venezuela's IBC stock index	  dipped 1.63 percent to 5,292.86 ahead of Wednesday's OPEC meeting.



Lehman Brothers said in a research note that the uncertainty and the country risk premium should decrease as Alliance presidential candidate Fernando de la Rua looks more assured of a victory in the first round of elections in October. The firm said in the tone that the medium outlook depends heavily on international developments, including Brazil stability, commodity prices and the value of the dollar.



In the note, the investment firm said its overall view was that likely political scenarios suggest improving market sentiment through early 2000.



"Those who have bet on Argentina have done so negatively and are short the market so we could see a short squeeze higher," one ADR trader added.

 Dole Foods Warns 3rd-Quarter Results Will Be Worse Than Expected

 WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Dole Food Co. Monday warned that lower banana prices and last year's citrus freeze will drag the company's third-quarter results below Wall Street's already reduced targets and possibly into the red. 

 The warning is the second in three months for the Westlake Village, Calif.-based fruit and flower grower. 

 Dole's shares (DOL) tumbled after the announcement $2.75, or about 12%, to close Monday at $21.25. 

 In July, Dole reported a 42% drop in second-quarter net income and warned that third-quarter earnings would fall below year-ago results. In the year-ago third quarter, Dole earned $15.6 million, or 26 cents a diluted share. 

 Now, the company said, it expects to break even or record a "slight" loss from continuing operations during the period. 

 The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial is for Dole to earn 13 cents a share in the third quarter. Before Dole's July warning, analysts had been looking for earnings of 39 cents a share. 

 Dole blamed trade conditions in the European Union and continued softness in eastern Europe and Russia for its troubles. 

 Dole President David DeLorenzo said the banana industry has been under pressure since last year and that the latest profit warning was due to increased allocation of banana licenses in the European Union. 

 DeLorenzo also said that the company is experiencing continued softness in eastern Europe and Russia, which has created an oversupply of bananas and lower pricing throughout Europe. Europe represents roughly one-third of Dole's sales and profits. 

 Dole isn't the first banana producer to run into pricing problems this year. In May, Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB) said that it was experiencing "significantly lower" banana pricing in its second quarter compared to a year earlier. As a result, Chiquita reported a 92% decline in quarterly earnings. 

 Dole and some other companies that market Latin American bananas have been pressuring the U.S. to fight the European Union's banana-import system. 

 EU rules governing the banana trade favor imports from Africa and Caribbean nations - Europe's former colonies - over less-expensive Latin American bananas. Earlier this year, the World Trade Organization ruled that the EU's banana-import system is illegal. The WTO has authorized the U.S. to apply punitive tariffs on $191.4 million of EU imports. 

 Besides continued weak banana pricing, Dole faces increased interest expenses due to last year's acquisition of several flower growers and a majority interest in Swedish produce distributor Saba Trading AB. In addition, last January's California freeze reduced Dole's available citrus crop for the third quarter. 

 Still, the company said, third-quarter earnings from other core businesses are in line with previous estimates. 

 Despite the continuing soft market for bananas, Dole expects its future results to show improvement as costs decline.

 Local Managers Take Up Challenge of Remaking Sears

 The battle to reinvent Sears, Roebuck and Co. was supposed to have been won several years ago. Under the generalship of Chief Executive Arthur Martinez, the nation's second-largest retailer spiffed up its stores, ramped up its credit-card business and pumped up growth with new off-the-mall specialty businesses. 

 But just when it looked like full-fledged victory was in sight, Sears stumbled. Credit losses soared in 1997. Several of its off-the-mall concepts failed to turn a profit and were sold off in 1998. And sales at its 850 department stores have been disappointing since the middle of last year, while specialized retailers and discounters were racking up big gains. 

 So it was back to the war room for Martinez, who declared in January: "It's time for the Second Revolution." 

 Since then, the need for profound change at the Hoffman Estates-based retailer has become more urgent. Earlier this month, Sears announced it would not meet profit projections for the rest of 1999 -- the third straight year it has failed to meet its targets. The warning was accompanied by a management shakeup that left merchandising guru Robert Mettler out of a job. Shareholders vented their disappointment, driving down Sears stock by more than 10 percent. 

 Clearly, new tactics were needed. This time around, Martinez has declared, the battle plan is focused on Sears' department stores. Apparel assortments are being pared down. Categories are being added. Prices on commodity items are being cut. 

 But the Second Revolution also is attacking Sears' deeply ingrained bureaucracy. Executives are trying to shift power to the stores, and store managers are being asked to function more like old-fashioned merchants, who listen to what customers want and then deliver it. 

 And all this is supposed to occur without burdening employees with heaps of additional work and new initiatives. Sears, in fact, is committed to helping its 300,000 employees do a better job of balancing work and family demands. 

 Industry experts aren't sure whether Sears can reinvent itself and retake ground in an increasingly competitive retail battlefield. 

 Yet if the company can, it will be because of the efforts of corporate foot soldiers and platoon leaders whose names aren't known outside their immediate circles. To better understand the dynamics of the Second Revolution, here's a look at three managers on the front lines. 

 If there is any part of Sears that doesn't appear to need fixing, it would seem to be its hard-lines businesses. 

 Kenmore appliances, Craftsman tools and DieHard batteries -- all brands that Sears created -- have consistently racked up big sales gains while the softer side of Sears has struggled to keep up. 

 But Steve Titus, Sears' vice president of sales for hard lines, isn't sitting on the sidelines as Sears attempts to reinvent itself. 

 The 31-year Sears veteran is on a Second Revolution mission too: to push authority down to the men and women who manage the hard-lines departments at Sears stores. That means increasing their say about what their departments will carry -- or not. 

 Sounds simple, perhaps. But in a giant, tightly centralized operation like Sears, where everything from sales plans to merchandise displays are determined at its sprawling headquarters, it's a seismic shift. 

 Still, it's something CEO Martinez believes must be done. 

 "I'm asking the home office to trust our stores more," says Titus, who started at Sears loading shrubs and manure into customers' cars in Milwaukee and has relocated his family 10 times for the company. 

 "They know what they should carry. The customers tell them." 

 Sears is 20 years behind the curve on this one, however, says James E. Schrager, professor of entrepreneurship and strategy at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. 

 "If we want to see the outcome of central planning, we just have to look at the Soviet government," he says. "Maybe this will finally be the year that Sears arrives in the mid-1980s." 

 In the past, executives at Sears' headquarters would base sales projections on the retailer's extensive database of what sold last year and then add on a few percentage points. 

 Now, the retailer is asking its district merchants how many of certain key items they expect to sell and using that information to craft sales plans. The change is already making itself felt. 

 "Some item numbers are being doubled. We're much closer to a market focus than ever before," Titus says. 

 In order to free up his subordinates to focus on what customers want, Titus is liberating them from a major hassle: dealing with e-mail and requests for information from upstairs. 

 Titus has labeled a file "Dumb." He has asked the more than 120 people reporting to him to forward any messages that fit that description. Then Titus himself deals with the requests. 

 "My job is to eliminate as much static as possible," he says. "When we put too much on your plate, you take your eye off the ball." 

 In any battle, there are grunts and generals. And behind the scenes making everything happen are support personnel who never get much credit. In Sears' Second Revolution, Rick Burbee is one of these unknown soldiers. Call him Sears' chief visual strategist. 

 As creative design director, Burbee is supposed to banish cluttered racks of clothes from stores and replace them with in-store boutiques that highlight national brands, such as Vanity Fair lingerie and Benetton apparel, and Sears' in-house brands, including Canyon River Blues denim and Circle of Beauty cosmetics. 

 When Martinez recently said he wanted a more tightly focused apparel assortment, it was a clarion call for Burbee and his six-person team to lead the charge. 

 The visual design team at Sears is definitely taking its work to a new level. Burbee recently signed up Victor Skrebneski, one of the country's top fashion photographers, to create a new shop for its Crossroads women's casual apparel collection. 

 Skrebneski, a Chicagoan better known for photographing supermodels, has created visuals for Crossroads that emphasize smiling, happy faces of people shoppers can relate to. 

 Not that Burbee is trying to be subtle. 

 "We really wanted the shops to be intentionally intrusive -- to stop a customer in her tracks so she would realize we had something different going on," says Burbee, who has spent 27 of his 51 years at Sears. 

 At the Sears store in Schaumburg's Woodfield mall, the effect was almost immediate. After installing the new Crossroads shop, sales soared the next day, even though the merchandise was exactly the same. 

 The new Skrebneski look is still being rolled out, Burbee says. About 300 Sears stores now have it. Eventually, all 850 of the full-line stores will. 

 Marketing Sears from a lifestyle perspective is a smart move, says Gwen Morrison, vice president of Frankel Brand Environments, a Chicago-based team that creates brand-building marketing campaigns for retailers. 

 "Look at the success of Pottery Barn. They put merchandise together based on a certain level of taste and quality. If you can establish the relationship with the customer, you can cross-merchandise," or sell shoppers related items they weren't looking for. 

 Although it's a fun job to create lots of little shops within a big store like Sears, Burbee and his team have to be careful not to make shopping more difficult, retail experts say. 

 Customers like seeing entire outfits put together for them -- something in-store shops do well -- but they don't want to be forced to wander from place to place shopping for a single item. 

 So Burbee has to take an almost Zen-like approach to his job. While he is creating groupings of apparel or other products, he is also making sure they flow into related items. His next project: Creating special shops to set off Nike athletic footwear, which is headed to the stores in January. 

 If the Second Revolution is to succeed, the decisive battle will be at Sears' department stores. 

 And few face a stiffer challenge than Melinda George, the manager of the Sears store in Oakbrook Center. There, amid the outdoor mall's attractive park-like setting, George's Sears store must compete with the likes of Nordstrom, Marshall Field, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. 

 But George, a 39-year-old retail veteran, is genuinely excited by the challenge. And she believes Sears can succeed in winning over middle-class customers if it does a couple of things right -- get trendy merchandise on the floor when it's hot and push customer service up another notch. 

 Take the case of black Capri pants. Women around the country couldn't get enough of the calf-length pants this summer, and Sears rode the wave, along with the likes of Gap and Banana Republic, thanks to prominent aisle displays. 

 "We sold hundreds every weekend. There's a heightened sense of urgency with trends," George says. "Before, we had the merchandise, but we weren't getting the message out." 

 For fall, George's store is highlighting other trendy items such as "skants" (skirt/pant combinations popular with teens); "club wear," such as gray polyester pants with lots of zippers, and "hands-free" nylon handbags that are worn slung across the chest. 

 Being next door to higher-end retailers benefits Sears, George believes. "They go to Nordstrom and see a fabulous pair of shoes for $80. Then they come here and see them for $30," she says. 

 Of course, George is doing her best to make her Sears store fit in with its upscale surroundings. The store is well-appointed, clean and brightly lit. It also has something that once was the preserve of high-priced retailers: its own personal shopper. 

 Linda Petrovich sits at a desk in front of escalators with a sign that identifies her as a personal shopping assistant -- no appointment necessary. 

 The program is so popular, George hopes to expand it to nights and weekends. Customers who use the service are spending an average of $250 on apparel, nice-sized sales for Sears. 

 It's all about getting closer to customers, George says. And as part of that, she is driving home a new message to her sales associates: Make eye contact and greet every customer you see, whether or not she needs assistance. 

 Leonard Berry, marketing professor at Texas A&M University and author of "The Soul of Service," says what George is doing is pretty basic. But, he adds, "They are short steps by themselves, but taken together, they're starting to tell a different story to the customers of that store." 

 There's no question that George's job in Oak Brook won't get any easier now that Sears has chosen to go head-to-head with discount competitors such as Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target chain and Kohl's Corp. 

 But George, who has worked for May Department Store Co. and Elder-Beerman Stores Corp., wouldn't be hanging around if she didn't think victory was possible. 

 "If you had asked me five years ago if I would be a store manager for Sears, I would have said, `No way.'" 

 Today, she says, "I really do think they're headed in the right direction. Everyone wants to be with a winner."

 Ogden Issues 3rd-Quarter  Profit Warning , Backtracks On Restructuring

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Ogden Corp. on Friday warned that third-quarter earnings will fall far short of analysts' expectations. The conglomerate also announced that its chairman and chief executive has resigned and said it now plans to sell its entertainment and aviation businesses instead of spinning them off into a separate, publicly traded company. 

 The company's shares plunged on the news of the earnings warning. At the close of trading, Ogden shares (OG) were off $6.75, or 35%, at $12.75. 

 New York-based Ogden (OG), a conglomerate with interests in entertainment, aviation and energy, said its third-quarter results will fall well shy of analysts' forecasts. It didn't provide specific figures or specify which estimates it was using. The mean estimate of two analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial is for earnings of 64 cents a share in the third quarter. 

 For the 1998 third quarter, the company reported net income of $28.2 million, or 55 cents a diluted share, up 14% from the third quarter of 1997. Revenue in last year's third quarter came to $441.1 million, a 4% decline from the year-earlier period. 

 In the first and second quarters, Ogden's earnings fell below those of the year-ago periods. 

 Also Friday, Ogden said it has canceled its quarterly dividend and dropped plans to split into two different companies. Instead, it said it will pursue a "sale or other disposition" of its entertainment and aviation businesses, while retaining its energy operations. 

 The company said the elimination of its dividend will help its cash flow and financial flexibility as well as enhance the growth prospects of its energy business. 

 Separately, the company named Scott G. Mackin chief executive, president and a director of the company, replacing Richard Ablon, who resigned as chairman and chief executive. Ogden also named George L. Farr, currently an Ogden director, to the post of nonexecutive chairman. Farr was vice chairman of American Express Co. 

 Ogden's entertainment group has interests in theme parks, food and beverage concessions, management of venues, theatres, concert promotions, artist management and recordings. 

 The aviation group provides support services to airlines such as ground and cargo handling, passenger services, fueling, and airport management. 

 The energy group owns and operates independent power facilities and provides related infrastructure services.

Sun Cities/Surprise Community
HOA BOARD MEMBER RESIGNS AUDET CITES DIRECTION OF PROPOSED RESTRICTIONS

Less than a year ago, Jim Audet was tossing his name in the ring for the Sun City Home Owners Association board.  

He couldn't lose. He ran in the Dec. 8 election as one of six candidates for one of six open seats.  

The top four vote getters snagged three-year terms, with one-year terms going to the other two candidates. Audet received the fewest number of votes and was handed a term due to expire Jan. 1. But Audet decided to cut his term short. A few days ago, he abruptly resigned, citing his displeasure with the path the HOA was taking in reviewing its deed restrictions.  

For the past several months, the HOA has been sending out ballots to Sun City homeowners living in single-family residences, asking for their say in how the neighborhoods should look and who should enforce those rules.  

The HOA - a non-profit volunteer organization - has been limited in power, only authorized to send out warning letters if residents violated the deeds for such things as having a chronic messy yard.  

Under proposed deed restrictions, the association could be empowered to seek a lien on an offender's property if other measures fail. But Audet fears that the HOA board wants to inflate its authority.  

''They said they could start fining people,'' he said. ''I don't think it's proper. . . . There is a lot of poor people in this town. There's some with money and there's some without. I felt sorry for them, and I didn't think it was right'' to impose fines.  

But Jerry Swintek, an association vice president who serves on the HOA land-use committee, said the proposed changes didn't include handing out fines to residents.  

''We have no intention of fining anybody in Sun City,'' he said. ''I don't think the structure of the community warrants that.''  

However, Swintek said there might be an occasion to consider imposing a fine. In a situation where the HOA notifies a violator, offers him or her an opportunity to meet before the committee to voice an appeal and the violator doesn't take any action, the HOA then might want to go to court and seek a judgment.  

No one in the HOA is out to get any resident, Swintek stressed. ''Everything is done by written communication. We won't just be calling somebody on the phone.''  

Audet, who also served on the land-use committee, said the HOA board talked about monetary penalties such as the court judgment. ''If that's not fines, you tell me what is,'' he said.  

Questioning the changes in policy wouldn't have worked, Audet said: ''I couldn't get up and complain at the meeting because I would just be voted down. I just figured that it was 'just let me out of there.' ''  

Audet, who worked in the printing business, isn't a stranger to homeowners associations. He was president of a condominium association in Australia.  

Swintek said Audet's term won't be filled immediately. Instead, the HOA will wait for the upcoming HOA board elections in December.

 Geac Computer Corp posted net income of $38.3m in its first quarter ended July 31 on revenue that rose to $202.5m from $173.5m in the year ago period. Canadian Geac an international provider of hardware and ERP software for corporations, financial institutions and libraries, reported earnings before income and taxes of $51.7m compared to $46.8m last year. But it was hit by a tax rate hiked to 24% from 15% in 1998 and net income per share stood at $0.63 - the same as last year. 

 Geac has been in acquisition mode this year and in the summer swooped for troubled UK-based ERP vendor, JBA Holdings Plc to double its size to an expected annualized revenue of $1.3bn. Geac struck with JBA's stock price standing at 227.5 pence (around $3.67) - depressed by a slowdown in sales of ERP software. But the Markham, Ontario-based outfit saw its own stock market value cut by a third in February after issuing a profitwarning on its third-quarter results for fiscal 1999. 

 As well as assimilating JBA into its organization Geac will have to find a place for three other purchases closed in the last two quarters. The firm acquired publishing systems firms, Cybergraphics Solutions from Australia and UK-based Matrix Systems in the first quarter. In addition, JBA took on board financial and human resources systems from Atlanta-based Clarus Corp this quarter. Geac said it would spend the next few months valuing the goodwill or premium paid for JBA above its asset worth, and assess the time period over which this extra cost should be amortized.

 FDX Posts Lower-Than-Expected  Profit , Issues  Warning  For Year

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of FDX Corp., the parent of air-freight company Federal Express, fell Thursday after it reported weaker-than-expected earnings for its fiscal first quarter and warned that domestic weakness and higher higher fuel prices will hurt earnings for the rest of the year. 

 In afternoon trading, shares of FDX (FDX) were off $5.688, or 13%, at $38 on volume of 9.25 million shares. 

 Memphis, Tenn.-based FDX said net income for the period ended Aug. 31 rose 6.7% to $159 million, or 52 cents a fully diluted share, compared with $149 million, or 50 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago period. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 54 cents a share in the latest quarter. 

 Revenue rose 5.8% to $4.32 billion from $4.08 billion in the year-ago period. 

 FDX said higher fuel costs cut operating income by $27 million in the quarter, adding that declining sales of aircraft noise-reduction kits was another factor. The company said it has enacted stringent cost controls to offset slowing U.S. package volume and the high fuel prices. However, if current trends continue, fuel prices could shave $150 million off fiscal 2000 operating income. 

 If lower U.S. domestic growth continues, FDX said earnings for the second-quarter and fiscal year might fall short of expectations. 

 FDX said operating income in the first quarter totaled $284 million, little changed from the year-ago period. Domestic average daily package volume grew 3% for FDX's Federal Express Corp. unit and 4% in its RPS Inc. unit in the latest first quarter. U.S. domestic revenue per package rose 2% for FedEx and 5% for RPS. 

 FedEx's operating income totaled $209 million in the latest first quarter, up from $219 million last year. RPS posted operating income of $51 million, compared with $49 million a year ago. 

 FDX was seeing improvement in the number of packages being delivered to customers but then Hurricane Floyd came along. FDX expects a shortfall of about 1.25 million packages because of the hurricane, said Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf. 

 The hurricane has been making its way up the East Coast. FDX has temporarily closed FedEx offices in some cities and can't operate in those states where a state of emergency has been declared. "We will lose packages to the hurricane and we probably won't get those packages back," Graf said, referring to the lost business. 

 Graf said the company could see a surge in shipping as the holiday season approaches. And, he added, many customers are trying to ship packages before the year ends to ensure they arrive at the start of 2000.

 FOCUS-Morrison serves up record profits.

 LONDON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc on Thursday unveiled record first half profits and a nine percent rise in underlying sales, outstripping many of its main rivals. 

 The regional supermarket group, whose stores are largely in northern and central England, boosted pre-tax profits for the 26 weeks to August 1 1999 to 76.2 million pounds ($123.4 million) from 68.3 million. Total sales were up 17.9 percent to 1.43 billion pounds. 

 Morrison, celebrating its centenary this year, has carved out a profitable regional niche in Britain's increasingly cut-throat food retail industry. It has 100 stores, after opening three new sites in the past few weeks. 

 Chairman Ken Morrison said the results illustrated the group was continuing to make progress. "I believe the like-for-like increase of 8.6 percent (in the first half) is one of the best in the industry." 

 Its shares rose nearly six percent to 159-1/2 pence. 

 "They were a cracking set of results," said Clive Black at Charterhouse Securities, who said the business had lots more growth to come as it was immature relative to the country's food retail majors. 

 The retailer prides itself on keen prices, with its slogan - "It is pounds not points that count" - highlighting its policy of passing savings on to shoppers. It does not have a loyalty card like rivals, such as Tesco Plc and J Sainsbury Plc 

 NORTHERN VALUES GOING DOWN WELL IN THE SOUTH 

 The firm, based in Bradford in West Yorkshire, has been expanding southwards. Ken Morrison told Reuters the group was trading successfully in the south. "People seem to appreciate the northern values or Yorkshire values, whatever you want to call them." 

 Margins were tighter and staff and overhead costs went up faster than sales in the first half. Morrison said the firm was concerned about increased costs, but this reflected in part longer opening hours and improved service. 

 He said the UK food retail market had become more competitive this year, but there was no real impact so far from Wal-Mart Stores Inc's takeover of ASDA, the number three supermarket group. 

 He predicted that Wal-Mart's pricing muscle would be felt most in clothing, textiles and household goods because of its buying strength in south east Asia. 

 But Morrison was not worried. 

 "We're very much used to living next to ASDA because we're only eight miles away," he said referring to ASDA's head office in Leeds, also in West Yorkshire. 

 The retailer would like to expand at the rate of 10 new stores a year, but is only opening seven next year because planning constraints make sites difficult to obtain. 

 Morrison said it was hard to judge if the UK government would soften planning laws to allow retailers to open more and bigger stores. The planning laws have been blamed for stifling growth for UK food stores and increasing prices for shoppers. 

 FOOD RETAILERS FACING PROBLEMS 

 The chairman said the UK food retail sector in general seemed to have a few problems. Earlier this week the fifth largest chain Somerfield issued a profit warning, and Sainsbury and Safeway have been struggling to drive sales. 

 "One or two of the majors seem to be just experiencing a degree of difficulty." 

 These problems, plus Wal-Mart's arrival, have prompted speculation of another predator moving into the UK as Europe's retail sector consolidates. Morrison said there was always a chance of someone coming in, although the current state of the industry might make it unattractive. "I think most people want to buy into strength really." 

 Morrison itself wants to stay independent. 

 "We'd like to (remain independent). I don't see why not, really, as long as we keep performing." 

 Earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 14 percent to 3.02 pence from 2.65 pence. The dividend was increased by 20 percent to 0.27 pence a share from 0.225 pence.

 FRANKFURT, Sept 16 (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG shares fell more than two percent on Thursday after it said savings of $1.4 billion from merger synergies in 1999 would be eroded by cost pressures at Chrysler and losses at its Smart unit, analysts said. 

 DaimlerChrysler shares fell 2.75 percent to 68.90 euros by 0950 GMT. The DAX was down 0.94 percent at 5,336.66. 

 The company's shares took a hit after Chief Financial Officer Manfred Gentz told analysts at a meeting on Wednesday its merger synergy savings would be reduced by unexpected costs, BHF Bank auto analyst Rolla Kautz-Pan said. 

 The cost of providing sales incentives for Chrysler cars in the United States and covering losses at its MCC Smart car unit would soak up some of the company's synergy savings, Gentz told analysts. 

 "He (Gentz) said that of course the synergy effects through the merger would be maintained at 1.3 billion euros ($1.35 billion) but also that special costs - which were initially not expected - would partially offset synergy effects," Kautz Pan said. 

 "This was taken very seriously by analysts as a profit warning," she added. 

 DaimlerChrysler has said it expects $1.4 billion merger savings following last year's transatlantic merger between Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp of the United States. 

 The company could not be reached for immediate comment. 

 "This (the share price decline) is due to the fact that Gentz said that $1.4 billion synergies will effectively be used up because of cost pressures on the Chrysler brand and losses at Smart," a HypoVereinsbank auto analyst said.

 FOCUS-PPD shares slump after news of key retirement.

 NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Shares of PPD Inc.  fell sharply Wednesday after the drug-testing company said its president and chief operating officer, Thomas D'Alonzo, would retire next month and it had no immediate plans to replace him. 

 Shares of the company, which has its headquarters in an Atlantic Coast city in the path of Hurricane Floyd, were off 4-3/16 to 14-11/16, or 22 percent, in afternoon trade. That made PPD the percentage loss leader on the Nasdaq. 

 John Kreger, a drug analyst for William Blair & Co., said he believed shares of PPD had been "oversold," attributing the decline in price to a combination of factors - including the simultaneous news of D'Alonzo's retirement and the approach of Hurricane Floyd. 

 The Wilmington, N.C., company said D'Alonzo would also retire from his position as a director of the company effective Oct. 5, but would "continue to perform limited consulting services for PPD after his retirement." 

 "Tom D'Alonzo has played a very important role during his tenure as president and COO of the company," said Chief Executive Fred Eshelman, who added that D'Alonzo's duties would be absorbed by other members of senior management. 

 PPD provides contract and consulting research and development services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. As a so-called contract research organisation (CRO), it performs clinical trials of experimental drugs for larger drug companies. 

 Operations at PPD are not expected to be disrupted by the powerful storm, PPD spokeswoman Nancy Zeleniak told Reuters, adding that drug trials by PPD's CRO subsidiary, PPD Development Inc., were conducted all over the world and data from the trials are protected. 

 "It's a global company and operations will continue" despite Floyd, she said, although company headquarters in Wilmington and Research Triangle Park near Chapel Hill, N.C., had been closed amid the largest evacuation from a hurricane in U.S. history. 

 Zeleniak said PPD's share prices have fallen significantly on previous occasions when hurricanes were headed towards storm-prone Wilmington. 

 William Blair's John Kreger said investors have been seeking more details and reassurance from PPD about its plans after the D'Alonzo news, but have been unable to reach PPD officials. 

 "We're in an information vacuum because PPD has closed its offices in Wilmington and Research Triangle Park," Kreger said. 

 Complicating matters, Kreger said PPD executives were unable to fly out of North Carolina to attend a Bear, Stearns health-care conference being held this week in New York. 

 Kreger said PPD shares were apparently also being hurt by a profit warning issued last week by Covance Inc. , a rival CRO. Covance said on Sept. 7 that it expected third-quarter and full 1999 earnings to be below analyst estimates because of revenue shortfalls. 

 To be sure, Kreger said he believed PPD would match Wall Street earnings expectations of 29 cents per diluted share in the third quarter. He said he believed the company would deliver full-year 1999 earnings of $1.12 per share, one cent below the consensus forecast of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Zeleniak said D'Alonzo was hired by PPD in 1996 and had been instrumental in helping build the company into an operation with 45 offices in 19 countries. 

 D'Alonzo's hiring coincided with PPD's 1996 acquisition of Applied Bioscience International and that company's subsidiary Pharmaco Intl, a CRO, she said. 

 She said D'Alonzo was "in his fifties," and had been planning his retirement for some time "in order to do some very different things."

 Maytag saw business softening before warning.

 CHICAGO, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Appliance maker Maytag Corp. saw signs its business was softening earlier this quarter, but tried to make corrections to meet analysts estimates rather than guide estimates lower, chairman and chief executive officer Lloyd Ward told analysts Wednesday. 

 Only after it became clear the company would not meet estimates did Maytag decide to issue a profit warning last Friday. 

 "We are not reporters and journalists who just report the score," Ward said during a conference call with financial analysts. "We are leaders and managers who try to change the score." 

 Maytag has come under fire because it chose not to comment on stock movement as its shares fell last Wednesday and Thursday. Ward said it was not until late Thursday that the company had determined how much earnings fell below estimates. It then issued a warning Friday saying that it expected earnings to be near the $0.84 a share of the 1998 third quarter. 

 Newton, Iowa-based Maytag also said fourth-quarter earnings would be in line with the $0.75 a share reported a year ago. But Ward said on Wednesday that the company was trying to beat that amount. 

 "We have pointed to a $0.75 fourth quarter," Ward said. "That's the floor as I see it and, based on the understanding of the business at this point .... We will take action to drive upside to that $0.75." 

 Ward also said the maker of Maytag-brand appliances, Hoover vacuum cleaners and other home and commercial appliances was planning to cut $100 million in costs over the next two years. The cost cuts will come, in part, from leaner manufacturing processes and lower costs associated with a business realignment. 

 Ward also noted the company has been slow in changing inventory levels to meet the sales of new products and that it needed to determine more quickly how well those products were selling. 

 In the earnings warning on Friday, Maytag said it was seeing lower sales in low-to-moderately priced home appliances. Ward said Wednesday that, while the company was gaining market share in premium refrigerator brands, it was losing almost equal share in lower-priced "value" brands. 

 Maytag shares were up 1-6/16 at 39-5/16 Wednesday.

 Federal-Mogul's Stock Price Sinks On  Profit Warning

 DETROIT -- Shares of Federal-Mogul Corp. plunged 23% following the automotive supplier's warning Monday that it wouldn't meet earnings expectations and that a management shakeup was underway. 

 "To date they had more or less been delivering. But they pulled the rug from underneath everybody with the announcement," said Eric Goldstein, an auto-parts analyst with Bear Stearns. 

 Shortly after the markets closed Monday, Federal-Mogul said third-quarter operating earnings are expected to be $1 to $1.05 a diluted share, below the First Call/Thomson Financial estimate of $1.25 a share. Operating earnings for the year are expected to be $4.20 to $4.30 a share, down from estimates of $4.73 a share. 

 In a conference call Monday, Richard Snell, Federal-Mogul's chairman, blamed the lowered expectations on a slowdown in the market for replacement auto parts and production problems. 

 Federal-Mogul's chief financial officer, Thomas Ryan, also said during the conference call that the company may take a charge related to the restructuring. 

 Mr. Snell said the company missed its goal of selling more replacement parts than original ones. Replacement parts are twice as profitable as originals and account for 65% of the company's profit. In the call, Mr. Snell blamed at least some of the sales weakness on the failure of a marketing program. But some analysts said the company still has more explaining to do before the stock regains ground. 

 Mr. Goldstein of Bear Stearns said company officials have yet to put their fingers on exactly what caused the slowdown for replacement parts. "It seems like this problem is particular to Federal-Mogul as other {replacement-parts suppliers} aren't seeing the same slowdown," Mr. Goldstein said. 

 But Ron Tadross, an auto-parts analyst with Prudential Securities, said he saw evidence of an overall slowdown that would affect other replacement-parts suppliers. That calls for Federal-Mogul to be even more conservative about profit goals, he said. 

 Kimberly Welch, a Federal-Mogul spokeswoman, said, "We were as forthcoming as we could be and answered all the questions that analysts asked." Ms. Welch wouldn't comment on yesterday's stock-price drop. 

 In the Monday call, Mr. Snell also said he would take over for Gordon Ulsh, who was named president and chief operating officer in February. He said Mr. Ulsh might stay on in another role. 

 To address all the company's problems, Mr. Snell said he is working on a reorganization plan that he will present to FederalMogul's board next week. 

 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Federal-Mogul stock fell $9 to close at $30.375.

 FOCUS-Hershey issues new  profit warning  for 1999.

 PHILADELPHIA, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Leading U.S. chocolate maker Hershey Foods Corp. sounded another sour note about earnings on Monday, warning Wall Street that 1999 results would be 8-10 percent below stated expectations of $2.40 a share. 

 The company, best known for Hershey chocolate bars and Reese's peanut butter cups, blamed the impending shortfall on shipment disruptions caused by the trouble-plagued startup of new business information systems in customer service, warehousing and order fulfilment. 

 "We are going through a very challenging period in providing the order fulfilment and customer service levels which customers have come to expect from Hershey," Hershey Chief Executive Ken Wolfe said. 

 "While order patterns have remained strong, we have been unable to fill them completely, in a timely fashion." 

 The latest in a series of earnings disappointments from Hershey, the announcement raised immediate concerns about the potential for new trouble in 2000, when Hershey was expected to earn $2.59 a share and open a 1.1 million square-foot distribution centre near its headquarters in Hershey, Pa. 

 Hershey executives assured food industry analysts during a conference call that the problem would not affect next year's performance, saying a newly implemented "action plan" would address an order backlog and have the company back on track by the end of October. 

 The stock rallied nearly $1.25 to trade at $53 a share on the New York Stock Exchange after the conference call. 

 But some analysts were not convinced by the company's assurances and warned investors that fresh trouble could lie ahead if Hershey's trade customers began demanding price discounts for 2000, or if shipment problems forced retailers to alter their product mix by adding rival brands. 

 "My experience is that when food stocks have an earnings decline, that typically establishes a new base. It's not something they typically bounce back from - especially with Mars (Inc.) and Nestle (SA) a lot more aggressive in the marketplace," said David Nelson of Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 After some 18 months of Hershey profit warnings, attributed to factors such as soft domestic confectionary sales and high prices for milk and cocoa, analysts trimmed their 1999 earnings expectations to as low as $2.10 a share, versus $2.34 for 1998. Initially, Hershey had been expected to earn more than $2.60 a share in 1999. 

 The company said most of the damage would show up in results for the third quarter ending October 3, when Hershey gears up for demand from the back-to-school, Halloween and Christmas sales seasons. Third-quarter earnings had been expected at 78 cents a share before the profit warning, down from 74 cents a year ago, First Call/Thomson Financial said. Earnings were due to be released on October 25. 

 Monday's announcement came at a time when food companies generally have put in lackluster performances, stirring speculation about possible consolidation in the industry. But analysts cautioned against expectations for a feeding frenzy of food mergers, saying the stocks of many U.S. foodmakers are overpriced and unlikely to command any takeover premiums. 

 "I think it is reasonable to expect that as a consequence of retail consolidation, some manufacturers will conclude that they will get more respect from trade customers if they are a more important supplier," said David Rabinowitz, food analyst at Schroder & Co. 

 "To that end, we could see mergers of equals with a view to building overall scale. What this suggests, though, is that we're not going to see 80s-style bear-hug deals where some huge corporate entity decides that it must own some smaller company and pay a 25 or 30 percent premium."

 HealthSouth Corp. watched its stock price drop 28% one day after the company said its profit picture for the rest of the year is going to be weakened and that it would postpone a spinoff of its in-patient hospitals into a separate publicly traded company. Chief Executive Richard Scrushy's announcement Thursday that he would personally buy $25 million in HealthSouth stock didn't appear to appease investors. In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, shares in the rehabilitation-services company fell $2.1875 to $5.6875, a 52-week low. More than 56 million shares traded hands, a 16-fold increase from normal trading volume. Several brokerage firms cut their ratings on HealthSouth stock Friday and Standard & Poor's placed it on CreditWatch with negative implications. The Birmingham, Ala., company didn't return calls for comment Friday.

 Labor Ready Share Rating Downgraded By Stephens Inc

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stephens Inc. downgraded shares of Labor Ready Inc. (LRW) Friday after the company issued a profit warning. 

 Late Thursday, Labor Ready said revenue and earnings for the second half of 1999 will be lower than previously expected, but it didn't provide specific numbers. 

 Stephens analyst John Schneller reduced his Labor Ready earnings estimates for the second time in just over a week. On Sept. 2, he had trimmed his bottom- and top-line targets for the rest of 1999, citing insufficient sales manpower at the company to handle demand for its services. 

 This time around, Schneller cut his third-quarter view to 22 cents a share from 29 cents, down from his original estimate, before Sept. 2, of 34 cents. He lowered his fourth quarter view to 20 cents from 23 cents and said revenue and earnings estimates for fiscal 2000 and 2001 will remain unchanged. 

 Schneller also cut his 12-month price target to $12 from $24 and his rating from "buy" to "neutral." 

 Although Labor Ready didn't offer any specific reasons for the shortfall in its prepared statement Thursday, Schneller blamed the shortfall on lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. 


Gross margins were squeezed during the quarter by store managers
offering discounted rates to attract new business, Schneller said in the
note. The higher selling and administrative expenses, meanwhile, stemmed
from the company's "aggressive" efforts to hire more salespeople.

 NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were mixed at midday Thursday, with the technology sector holding onto most of its gains as Wall Street was unfazed by the dollar's new three-year low against the yen. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average, which has see-sawed between positive and negative territory since the open, was down 15 points, or 0.14 percent, at 11,021. The Nasdaq composite index was up 15 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,824 on strength in tech stocks. 

 The dollar slipped to 107.7 against the yen after a stronger than expected Japanese gross domestic product. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 11/32 points, with a yield of 6.09 percent. 

 Although the dollar's weakness against the yen didn't initially stir Wall Street, it could become a factor when the Federal Reserve decides whether to raise interest rates. 

 "The Fed is watching events like this carefully," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock and Co. 'They are carefully watching the extent of prosperity in the United States, the turn of the political wheel and the weakness of the U.S. dollar." 

 The market is hard to read, said Larry Rice at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, given its tight trading range, poor breadth, lack of leadership, growing list of stocks at new lows and the same companies surging or gaining on rating changes from analysts. 

 "I think we're stuck that way," Rice said. 

 Technology stocks were up after several analysts changed ratings on leading Internet companies and on hopes that a rise in international computer memory-chip prices indicated a higher demand for personal computers. 

 CIBC World Markets started coverage of three Internet companies with strong buy ratings: Yahoo! Inc., eBay Inc. and America Online Inc.. Amazon.com Inc. was started at buy. 

 Lehman Brothers raised its rating on Internet portal Yahoo! to outperform from neutral. And Morgan Stanley started coverage of Drugstore.com at market outperform. 

 Yahoo was up 6-1/16 at 159-1/2, eBay was up 5-1/8 at 139-7/8, AOL was up 5/8 at 94-5/8, Amazon was up 1-11/16 at 63-1/8 and Drugstore.com was up 1-13/16 at 54-1/2. 

 TheStreet.com's Internet index was up 7 points, or 1.25 percent, at 602. 

 Among Dow components, Hewlett-Packard Co. was up 2-5/16 at 111-15/16 while International Business Machines Corp. was up 4-1/8 at 134-7/8. Their gains tempered losses among the Dow's financial components. 

 In economic news, The U.S. Labour Department reported 286,000 initial jobless claims for the week ending Sept. 4, compared with the 294,000 expected by economists polled by Reuters. 

 On Friday, the important August producer price index will be released. Any unexpected change in the PPI is expected to rattle markets. 

 "Volatility is here to stay," Ackerman said. "Any disappointing number is sure to bring volatility, vulnerability and vexation. 

 "We're basically back on Fed Watch," said Bryan Piskorowski, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. 

 Other active stocks included software company Avant Corp., which was up 8-5/16 at 23-1/16 after the company said a federal judge that a trade secret claim from rival Cadence Design Systems Inc. will be barred in an upcoming trail between the two California firms. Cadence was down 1/8 at 14. 

 American Home Products Corp. was down 3-1/2 at 39 following a report in the Wall Street Journal that the pharmaceutical company faces questions from the FBI over the approval process for its diet drug Redux, now possibly linked to heart valve problems. 

 Shares in Hershey Food Corp. dipped 1-13/16 to 49-15/16 after Lehman Brothers lowered its earnings estimates for the chocolate maker because of troubles with a new software system. 

 Superior Telecom Inc. shares were down 31 percent after Merrill Lynch and ING Barings cut ratings on the copper wire and cable maker after a Wednesday profit warning. Shares were down 7-7/8 to 17-7/8.

 Profit Warning  Sends Shares Of Drug Research Firm Covance Tumbling

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of biotechnology company Covance Inc. plummeted Wednesday after the company said its third-quarter earnings will fall short of analysts' estimates, in part because of the cancellation of a major contract and "significant" reduction in the scope of another project. 

 Shares of Covance fell $4.875, or 31%, to $10.625 on New York Stock Exchange volume of 3.5 million, compared with the daily average of 221,000. Earlier in the day, the shares hit $10.188, a new 52-week low. 

 Princeton, N.J.-based Covance's problems have added to the lingering doubt among many investors about the future of contract research organizations, or CROs, which have seen their shares fall sharply over the past nine months amid various missteps. 

 Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPDI) shares dropped $3.375, or 15%, to $19.688 on volume of 1.9 million, compared with average daily turnover of 352,600. Quintiles (QTRN) fell $1.00, or 2.9%, to $33.875 as 4.3 million shares changed hands, compared with the daily average of about two million. 

 Late Tuesday, Covance said third-quarter operating earnings will likely be 21 cents a share, excluding a restructuring charge. That would be well below the mean estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial for earnings, excluding charges, of about 26 cents a share. Covance reported net income of 22 cents a share in the year-ago third-quarter. 

 The company also said it plans to cut 150 jobs by the end of the year as part of efforts to reduce costs. 

 Covance also cautioned that 1999 operating earnings will likely be between 91 cents and 93 cents a share, excluding charges. That would be significantly below the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial for about $1 a share, excluding charges, but higher than Covance's 1998 per-share earnings of 83 cents. 

 Covance said its revised outlook was prompted by shortfalls in its clinical trials management and central laboratory services, stemming in part from the cancellation of a major contract and a scale-back of another large program. 

 Charles Duncan, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull, said that while those issues affected the outlook, the problems stem from a lack of new business deals in clinical trials management. Combined, the issues led Covance to target net growth in the low teens for fiscal 2000, a significant reduction from its historical growth rates. 

 Market watchers fear slower revenue growth will hit all CROs, which manage clinical trials for pharmaceutical firms and are extremely vulnerable to any industry-wide problems that force these drug firms to pull business from CROs. 

 For example, investors worry about the impact that a Medicare prescription-drug plan would have on cash flow at pharmaceutical companies. One of the first areas drug firms often cut during lean times is research and development, which nearly guarantees a reduction in business contracted out to firms like Covance. 

 Still, some analysts say they aren't alarmed. 

 "I don't think it signals anything about the core growth in the sector, but we are conducting diligence on that," said Tucker Anthony's Duncan, who lowered his rating on Covance Wednesday to "attractive" from "strong buy." 

 The news does, however, "re-establish one of the primary risk factors that investors must consider when investing in this group," he said - namely, that they are service providers that rely heavily on a particular client base. A lost or scaled-back contract, or a lack of new business, can quickly hurt the bottom line and send shares of the companies spiraling downward. 

 Analysts also wonder if Covance dropped the ball when it chose not to go through with its planned acquisition earlier this year of rival CRO Parexel International Corp. (PRXL), which lost nearly half its market value last October after suffering a profit shortfall. Covance abandoned the deal after determining it was more likely to maintain 20% earnings growth on its own. 

 But that scenario has faded fast. With a projected $50 million in lost revenue over the next six months, the company's low-teens growth outlook for fiscal 2000 hardly comes close to 20%. 

 Vivek Khanna, a Warburg Dillon Read analyst who rates the company a "hold," lowered his per-share earnings estimate for 1999 to 92 cents from $1 and cut his 2000 estimate to $1.04 a share from $1.20. 

 "They're guiding pretty low, and sentiment is not going to improve on this stock anytime soon," said Duncan, who now considers Covance a "value stock." He said his stock price target is under review.

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Shares of Covance Inc.  tumbled on Wednesday after the No. 2 drug development services firm warned of lower earnings, pulling down its peers as investors feared slowing growth in the sector. 

 In afternoon trading, Princeton, N.J.-based Covance was down about 32 percent at $10-1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the top percentage loser of the day. 

 Late Tuesday, Covance said it anticipates third quarter and full 1999 earnings to be below analyst estimates because of revenue shortfalls in its business that carries out Phase III clinical trials for drug makers and in its central laboratory. 

 The company further explained on Wednesday that it lost clinical trial contracts not because of an industry wide decline in demand but because it managed its services through separate units instead of one unit, as its competitors do. 

 The company said it is revamping its operations into one unified structure, as preferred by customers. 

 Investors, however, read the profit warning as a potentially industry wide ailment, and sold shares of Covance as well as others in the sector, said analysts. 

 In afternoon trade, shares of Quintiles Transnational Corp , the largest U.S. firm which runs clinical trials and other research services for pharmaceutical firms, were down $1 at $33 on Wednesday, and since Tuesday have shed about 10 percent of their value. 

 "Investors have concluded that (Covance's profit warning) suggests a potential shift away from outsourcing," said Edward Keaney, managing director at Volpe Brown Whelan & Co. 

 "The Covance announcement doesn't portend an earnings disaster," Keaney added. 

 Shares of Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc. , the third largest outsourcing firm, were also down on Wednesday, about 15 percent, or 3-9/16, at 19-1/2 in heavy volume. 

 "It is not our belief that industry fundamentals have suddenly collapsed," Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD) Chief Executive Fred Eshelman told Reuters. 

 "We are comfortable with analyst estimates for the 1999 third quarter," he added. Wilmington, N.C.-based PPD is expected to earn $0.29 for the third quarter, according to First Call Corp. 

 In its announcement Tuesday, Covance said it anticipates earning about $0.21 per share for the third quarter - five cents shy of analysts' consensus. For the full year it expects to earn between $0.91 to $0.93 per share, missing Wall Street estimates of $1.00.

 Hilton, Promus stocks hit new lows on acquisition.

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Shares of Hilton Hotels Corp.  touched fresh lows on Wednesday as Wall Street questioned the hefty $3.04 billion price tag that Hilton agreed to pay for Promus Hotel Corp. . 

 Analysts said the deal, announced Tuesday, not only hurts Hilton's earnings but places a lofty value on Promus, a company that touched off a slide in lodging stocks in the spring when it was the first hotel concern to issue a profit warning on soft revenues. 

 In Wednesday trading, Hilton's stock fell as low as 10-3/4, a new all-time low. In late afternoon trading it was down 3/16 at 10-7/8, and it is now down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of 22-13/16. The stock lost 6 percent of its value on Tuesday. 

 Shares of Promus also slipped, dropping 7/16 to 34-3/8, off a 52-week high of 38-1/2. Promus rose 11 percent after the deal's announcement on Tuesday. 

 "We believe Hilton paid a full price for a company with many challenges," Denise Warren, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, said in a research report. 

 "We believe Hilton will have difficulty reaching its targeted 20 percent plus earnings growth and we are unclear on who will be the key operators of the combined company," she said. 

 Merrill cut its rating on Hilton to a long-term accumulate from buy on Wednesday. Analysts from Credit Lyonnaise, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Prudential Securities cut Promus. 

 Under terms set Tuesday, Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton will pay $38.50 a share in cash for 55 percent of Promus shares and $38.50 in stock for the remaining 45 percent. The deal also includes $1 billion in debt and transaction costs. 

 Hilton said the deal would lower its earnings by about 6 percent in the first year after closing. 

 But once completed, Hilton will be a giant with 1,700 hotels in almost every hotel class ranging from New York's Waldorf-Astoria to lower priced Doubletree and Embassy suites. 

 Still, the price on Promus, protected in the deal by a collar clause, is steep, analysts said. And despite the long-term advantages, investors will reject the transaction more immediately, Lehman Brothers' Joyce Minor said. 

 "While we are surprised by the high price paid for Promus by Hilton, we continue to find the longer term strategic rationale for the transaction compelling," she said. "However, we expect that nearer term investors will focus on the EPS dilution" in part. 

 Minor said she thinks the acquisition will cut earnings by more than the 6 percent expected by Hilton. 

 David Anders, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said the deal makes sense for Hilton but that Wall Street is taking a wait-and-see approach. 

 "Even though the company has entered into an agreement that will strengthen its competitive position in the lodging industry, we believe investors may be slow to reward the company for these accomplishments," he said.

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Shares of Covance Inc. lost a third of their value Wednesday after the provider of drug development services said it expects third quarter and 1999 earnings to be below analysts' forecasts and that it will cut about 150 jobs. 

 Covance common was down $5.25 to $10.25 in mid-day trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "I think their business is going to be quite sluggish for the next four to six quarters," said Edward Keaney an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan, who rates the stock neutral. 

 "The problem appears to be that two things happened at the same time," Keaney said, referring to slowdowns in both Covance's central laboratory and clinical development businesses. 

 On Tuesday, after the market closed, Covance said that it expected third quarter earnings before a one-time restructuring charge to be about $0.21 a share, compared to $0.22 a share the year before. 

 The company said that revenue shortfalls in its Phase III clinical business was a result of a slowdown in winning drug development contracts. It said that revenue growth in its central laboratory business leveled off after a strong performance in previous periods. 

 According to Keaney, Covance said in a conference call this morning that it felt it had lost bids in its clinical trial business, which is organised into three independent geographical regions, to competitors that were bidding with a unified global proposal. 

 "Customers didn't like piecing the proposals together," he explained, noting that the company said that it is "well along the process of revamping" its clinical operations. 

 Meanwhile, a slowdown in revenue growth in the company's central laboratory business prevented that unit from offsetting weakness in the clinical trials management area. 

 "The central lab business is a very profitable and historically very successful element," Keaney said. 

 "They felt the issues there were to some degree market saturation. They had just captured a large amount of market share and there wasn't that much left to capture," he said. 

 Specific information on Covance's market share was not immediately available. 

 Covance said that it is seeking to introduce new products in order to capture additional share of the clinical testing market.

 NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Shares of IMRglobal Corp. fell 30 percent to a new all-time low in Wednesday morning trade on news that the technology services company would miss Wall Street's third quarter targets. 

 IMRglobal dropped as low 11, off Tuesday's closing price of 16-7/16 and a 52-week high of 32-5/8. Its prior low was 12-15/16. The stock was Nasdaq's biggest percentage loser in morning trade. 

 On Tuesday after the markets closed, the Florida-based company said it would post third quarter profits between 12 and 16 cents a share, down from 18 cents a share reported a year ago. Analysts had pegged IMRglobal at 25 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The earnings shortfall was due in part to a faster-than-expected decline in central lab operations and sluggish new business wins at a time of significant project cancellations and adjustments, analysts said. 

 Wall Street analysts responded to the announcement Thursday morning by cutting their earnings targets and ratings on IMRglobal. 

 Lehman Brothers downgraded the company to an outperform from a buy and cut its earnings estimate for 1999 to 69 cents a share from 94 cents. The firm also cut its price target on IMRglobal shares to $20 from $28. 

 "In our view, the EPS shortfall stems from internal execution challenges and not from a Y2K-induced demand slowdown," Lehman Brothers said in its research note. 

 Raymond James & Associates downgraded IMRglobal to a neutral rating from a buy. ((-Kristin Roberts, Wall Street Desk, 212-859-1730)).

 After  Profit Warning , Newell Sees 3rd-Quarter Sales Up 1%-2%

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Newell Rubbermaid Inc., which late last week lowered its third-quarter and full-year earnings estimates because of sluggish demand, said Tuesday that it expects internal third-quarter sales growth to increase by 1% to 2% despite sales running below plans for the period. 

 The consumer-products maker said the sales growth will be driven by its Mirro and Calphalon cookware operations and its Sanford writing-instruments division. 

 "Because of the autonomous manner in which our divisions operate, they have been able to react quickly and specifically to the first signs of softer sales, cutting discretionary spending and developing plans to drive sales volume in order to minimize the negative impact of the sales trends," the Freeport, Ill.-based company said. 

 Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) also said it continues to expect the acquisitions of Rotring Group, a German maker and supplier of writing and drawing instruments, and Newell Window Fashions Europe to add to earnings in the second half of the year. 

 Newell Rubbermaid, formerly known as Newell Co., said the integration of the former Rubbermaid Inc. is on schedule. Newell acquired Rubbermaid in March for about $5 billion, and its integration has been a source of concern for investors. 

 On Friday, Newell Rubbermaid lowered its earnings estimate for the third quarter to a range of 43 cents to 47 cents a share and cut its estimate for fiscal 1999 to $1.56 to $1.75 a share. The company cited sluggishness in retail demand across all business segments. 

 The mean estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 51 cents a share for the third quarter and $1.78 a share for the year. 

 Newell's shares dropped $8.4375 Friday to close at a 52-week low of $32.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Volume was heavy at about nine million shares; the sell-off trimmed Newell's market capitalization by $2.38 billion. 

 Last week's profit warning wasn't the first from the newly expanded company. In the second quarter, the company said difficulties related to the Rubbermaid acquisition would reduce quarterly and full-year profit. 

 When Rubbermaid was first purchased, investors were concerned that the price was too high. But Newell attempted to offset that worry by announcing the merger would mean substantial cost savings. 

 However, the savings goal hasn't yet been met. Some observers have speculated that the acquisition may still dilute earnings in 2001, far beyond analysts' original projections.

 Coke's Prospects Go From Fizzy to Fizzle On Foreign-Growth Woes, Europe Recall

 ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co.'s latest warning that it will fall short of profit forecasts dashed hopes that the company would soon recover from a prolonged slump. 

 Coke said Friday that earnings per diluted share for the third quarter are expected to be 31 cents to 33 cents, including the effects of a huge product recall in Europe. Analysts had been expecting earnings of about 36 cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 In the year-earlier third quarter, CocaCola had net income of $888 million on revenue of $4.75 billion. 

 The current quarter is the fifth in a row in which analysts have had to lower their earnings estimates for Coke. The company was once known for meeting its earnings targets like clockwork, analysts say. But economic turmoil in some overseas countries and the lingering impact of a contaminated-drinks scare in Europe in June mean they are once again adjusting their figures. 

 "The global environment has unquestionably impaired the predictability of their . . . business," said Andrew Conway, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 

 Coke's stock dropped 3.6% in an otherwise rising market to close at $57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Coke said it expects world-wide unit case volume, which fell 1% in the first quarter and 2% in the second quarter, to increase "in the low single-digit range" in the current quarter. It added that the acquisition of brands from Cadbury Schweppes in 156 countries is expected to add a percentage point of growth to world-wide unit case volume in the current quarter. 

 For 2000, Coke said it is "comfortable with the current range" of analysts' expectations for earnings. Those forecasts are generally between $1.50 and $1.60 a share. But Friday's news caused some analysts to cut their estimates for both the short term and next year. Caroline Levy, an analyst with Schroder & Co., lowered her forecast for 2000 to $1.48 a share from $1.52. She downgraded her estimate for this year's fourth quarter to 29 cents from 32 cents a share, and her 1999 full-year estimate to $1.28 from $1.34. "How can they be comfortable with 2000 when even the next quarter is hard to predict?" Ms. Levy asked. 

 Coke had been expected to turn in a stronger performance in the second half of this year, with the product recall behind it and easier earnings comparisons than in the first half. But the company said economic conditions remain "very challenging" in some of its South American markets as well as Eastern Europe and Russia. 

 In addition, Coke faces lingering troubles in parts of Europe in the wake of the product recall. The company is investing heavily to restore its image and sales, spending as much as two to three cents a share for the current quarter, according to Mr. Conway. 

 Although sales have rebounded in some European countries, other key markets remain troubled. 

 Volumes are improving in Germany, which accounts for an estimated 5% to 10% of Coke's world-wide profit, but "there is still an impact there," a Coke spokesman said. Executives from Coca-Cola Beverages PLC, which bottles Coke products in Eastern Europe, Italy and several other countries, said last week that the recall and "negative publicity" following the contamination scare had hurt sales even in countries where no recalls were necessary. 

 Mr. Conway said Coke is feeling added pressure on its shipments of concentrate, used to produce soft drinks, because bottlers outside the U.S. are reducing their inventories to free up cash for marketing programs and other needs. 

 In North America, however, the company said unit case volume is expected to increase 2% to 3% this quarter. Volume in North America had dropped 1% in the second quarter, after Coke bottlers aggressively raised prices in an effort to improve thin operating margins. But this summer bottlers for archrival PepsiCo Inc. took the lead, raising prices by an average of some 5% to 6% between mid-June and mid-July, well above Coke's 4% rise, analysts say. Pepsi said last week that its shipments of concentrate declined about 4% in North America in the fiscal third quarter ended Saturday as a result of those higher prices. 

 Even so, Pepsi forecast an increase in earnings for the quarter and announced a faster-than-expected pace of stock repurchases. On Friday, Pepsi rose $1.0625 to close at $34.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

 Dark Fiber Accounting Change To Lower Williams's Earnings.

 With the list of natural gas companies and utilities building fiber optic networks growing, there are lessons to be learned from Williams Companies Inc.'s grim profit warning last week. 

 The most significant lesson is the impact that a recently issued accounting standard can have on profits from the sale of so-called "dark fiber," or unused pieces of telecommunications networks. 

 Williams was hit hard by the accounting change. The Tulsa, Okla.-based company said that third-quarter profits would fall "substantially below" Wall Street expectations because of it, also blaming a weather-related drop in sales from its electricity marketing operation in southern California. 

 Williams, which operates the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system by volume in the United States and has aggressively built up a 21,500-mile fiber optic network in recent years, was expected to earn 20 cents/share in the third quarter, according to consensus estimates from First Call Corp. 

 Williams did not say publicly how badly it would miss the mark, but profit warnings generally mean actual earnings are not even close to Wall Street estimates. Prudential Securities Inc. analyst M. Carol Coale, for instance, promptly dropped her estimate by 50% to 10 cents/share. PaineWebber Inc.'s Ronald J. Barone dropped his to 6 cents from 17 cents/share. 

 Analysts said they were prepared for the accounting change - Williams said it was on the horizon during the second quarter - but were surprised at how dramatically it would reduce the company's profits. 

 "I knew it was coming, but I didn't expect such a hit to earnings," said Coale. 

 Starting in the third quarter, Williams switched its accounting method for transactions involving dark fiber to comply with recent guidelines set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private sector organization in charge of establishing U.S. standards on financial accounting and reporting. 

 Dark fiber sales will now be treated as operating leases, which defer revenues by spreading them over the life of the contract. Barone notes that the amortization period for such capacity sales can often be more than 20 years. The old method treated dark fiber sales as financial leases, which allowed Williams to recognize revenues from agreements up front. 

 The accounting switch issue has menaced Williams all year. It forced the company to delay an initial public offering (IPO) of a minority stake in its communications unit, originally scheduled for June. Last week, Williams said it now expects the IPO to happen in early October. It aims to raise some $680 million through the sale of 29.6 million shares. It also has commitments to raise at least an additional $725 million in private placements to Intel Corp., SBC Communications Inc., and Telefonos de Mexico S.A. 

 Barone currently values Williams communications assets at about $9.5-billion, or about $22/share, slightly more than its energy assets, which he appraises at $21/share. The profit warning dropped Williams stock by nearly $2/share on the day of the announcement. But Barone said it is now trading "right about where it should be," and thinks further downside potential should be eased by Williams upcoming roadshow to drum up support for the IPO. 

 Still, as the number of energy companies developing fiber optic networks grows - now including Enron Corp., Columbia Energy Group, Duke Energy Corp., and Montana Power Co. among others - analysts do not want to get burned by the dark fiber issue again. 

 "[Analysts] will have to live and learn about how gas companies book their fiber optic sales so this doesn't happen again," said Coale. 

 Columbia Energy, for one, has already said it will book dark fiber sales through operating leases. Analysts say the size and structure of dark fiber deals will determine how others account for them under new FASB standards. 

 Keith E. Bailey, Williams's chairman, president and CEO, tried to downplay the impact of the accounting, saying it would result in lower operating profit from dark fiber deals in 1999, "but should not diminish the ultimate financial benefit of the agreements." 

 Still, analysts were not happy to realize that their earnings models were so wrong, even when they knew the accounting change was coming. Coale, for instance, cut Williams's earnings-per-share estimate for 2000 by 20 cents, immediately after the announcement, while Barone slashed his by 35 cents/share.

COCA-COLA  PROFIT CUT  BY RECALL IN EUROPE EARNINGS  WARNING  LATEST IN BAD NEWS

- Coca-Cola Co. warned Friday that a $75 million recall in Europe, higher marketing costs and sluggish sales in Latin America, China and Russia will result in its fourth straight quarter of lower earnings.

The world's largest soft-drink maker forecast third-quarter profit of 33 cents a share or less, including the cost of the recall, down from 35 cents a year ago. It was expected to earn 36 cents, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call Corp. Fourth-quarter profit will be reduced as well.

Coca-Cola fell 2 to 57 1/2. The warning adds to a string of bad news this year, including the recall and bans of its drinks, problems completing purchases, continued slow sales abroad and a racial suit in the United States. It also dashes hopes for a quick turnaround, after Chairman Douglas Ivester's assurance in June that "the worst is behind us."

"Here's another problem," said Bill Cottrell of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, owner of 2.9 million shares. "The last quarter, Coke said the worst was behind them."

Coca-Cola had among the biggest declines among the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, both of which rose more than 2 percent Friday.

Shares of the Atlanta-based company have dropped about 4 percent since Ivester was named CEO almost two years ago, trailing the S&P 500's 38 percent rise.

Even so, Cottrell said, the Ohio fund is holding its shares. "Coke is going to come back; it's just a matter of when," he said. "I suspect a year from now the stock price will be higher than it is today."

Illnesses among 250 Belgian and French consumers in June forced Coca-Cola to suspend sales and recall its drinks as several nations banned its beverages. Coca-Cola's stock has fallen 18 percent since early June, when the first reports of illnesses appeared.

The recall cost about 2 cents to 3 cents a share in the third quarter. The company said the withdrawal of its drinks in Europe will also hurt fourth-quarter profit, though it didn't give specifics.

 National Discount falls on lower forecast.

 NEW YORK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Shares in National Discount Brokers Group Inc. fell more than 17 percent on Friday after the small online brokerage firm said its quarterly results would fall short of Wall Street estimates amid a slight decline in trading. 

 National Discount shares were down 5-5/8 at 27-5/8 and were the second-biggest percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 National Discount's profit warning came after analysts cut earnings estimates for other online brokers amid a slowdown in share trading volume. 

 Investor worries about the industry's slowing growth rate have caused most online broker shares to fall more than 50 percent from their April highs. 

 National Discount is the first U.S. online broker to make a formal announcement about how weaker trading volumes would hurt its profits, said Hambrecht & Quist analyst Greg Smith. 

 "Trading volume was down, but new account growth was still pretty good," he said. 

 Late Thursday, National Discount said it expected a revenue shortfall of about 4 percent from analysts' estimates of $55 million for the fiscal first quarter, ended Aug. 31. 

 It said net income from continuing operations would range between a profit of 2 cents per share and a loss of one cent. Previously it forecast a profit of 21 cents a share. It blamed higher costs for the lower estimates. 

 In an overall strong market, the National Discount news did not depress the share prices of other online brokers, especially the two biggest. Charles Schwab Corp.  was up 2-1/16 at 41-1/8, while TD Waterhouse Group Inc.  edged 1/16 higher at 15. 

 National Discount Chief Financial Officer Matthew Stadler told Reuters the company's online brokerage business was responsible for the revenue shortfall even though it contributed only a about a third of total revenues. 

 Stadler blamed a decline of some 4 percent in average daily trading. Volume was seen totalling about 8,200 trades per day, compared with a projected 8,600, he said. 

 "June and July were strong and according to plan, but we saw a decline in August - as was the norm for industry," he said, referring to the late summer doldrums. 

 Most analysts, including Bill Burnham of Credit Suisse First Boston, had expected a decline in trading this summer. In an Aug. 3 report, Burnham foresaw the first sequential decline in online trading volumes in the July-September quarter. 

 "This is clearly a short-term negative for the group," Burnham said. "We don't expect a recovery until late September or mid-October." 

 In the past, volumes soared quarter over quarter as a growing number of individual investors, encouraged by the strong bull market, began trading stocks over the Internet. 

 National Discount said retail accounts at its brokerage business, NDB.com, totalled 159,000 on Aug. 31, up about 13 percent from 141,000 on May 31. 

 Stadler saw no reason to revise earnings estimates for the rest of the calendar year. "As of today, we are not thinking about being uncomfortable with projections," he said.

 Williams' Move to  Cut  Profit Expectations Prompts Re-Evaluation of Fiber-Optics Sales.

 In what may amount to a lesson for the energy companies now developing fiber-optic networks, Williams Cos. Inc. said Thursday that third-quarter profits will fall "substantially below" Wall Street expectations due to a change in the way it accounts for sales at its telecommunications business and to a weather-related drop in sales from electricity marketing in Southern California. 

 The Tulsa, Okla.-based company, which operates the largest natural gas transportation system in the United States and was one of the first to expand into fiber-optic networks, was expected to earn 20 cents/share in the third quarter, according First Call Corp. 

 Though the company did not publicly say how badly it would miss the mark, profit warnings generally mean earnings are not even close to Wall Street estimates. Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale, for instance, promptly dropped her estimate by 50% to 10 cents/share. 

 Analysts said they were prepared for the accounting change - Williams said it was on the horizon last quarter - but were surprised at how much of an impact it would have on the company's profits. 

 Starting in the third quarter, Williams said it will change its accounting method for transactions involving "dark fiber," or the unused portions of its telecommunications network, resulting in lower operating profit. The change is compliant with bookkeeping guidelines set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the private-sector organization in charge of establishing U.S. standards of financial accounting and reporting. 

 Dark fiber sales will now be treated as operating leases, which defer revenues, allowing them to be recognized over the life of the contract. The old method treated them as financial leases, which allowed Williams to recognize revenues from agreements up front. 

 The accounting switch issue has menaced Williams all year. It forced the company to delay an initial public offering (IPO) of a minority stake in its telecommunications unit, originally scheduled for June. 

 On Thursday, Williams said it now expects the IPO to happen in early October, with some $680 million to be raised through the sale of 29.6 million shares. The company has commitments to raise at least an additional $725 million in private placements to Intel Corp., SBC Communications Inc. and Telefonos de Mexico S.A. 

 With the list of energy companies developing fiber-optic networks growing - it now includes Enron Corp., Columbia Energy Group, Duke Energy Corp. and Montana Power Co. among others - analysts say there are lessons to be learned from Williams' profit warning. 

 "We [analysts] will have to live and learn about how gas companies book their fiber-optic sales so this doesn't happen again," Coale said. 

 Keith Bailey, chairman, president and chief executive of Williams, said the accounting switch will result in lower operating profit from dark fiber deals in 1999, "but should not diminish the ultimate financial benefit of the agreements." 

 Still, analysts have been forced to revise their short-term earnings models. Coale has also cut Williams' earnings-per-share estimate for next year by 20 cents as a result of the announcement. 

 Separately, Williams said cooler-than-normal weather in the Los Angeles area has been reducing demand for power in the region, contributing to lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings. 

 Williams shares fell $1.94, or 4.53%, to $40.88 on Thursday.

 Glaxo Wellcome has been forced to back down from its promise to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 1999. This is because of worse-than-expected results for 1H 1999. Turnover increased only 4% at constant exchange rates (CER) to #4106 M and pretax profits were up 6% to #1373 M. The company blamed the setback on the weak sales of its migraine drug, Imitrex, and its smoking cessation product Zyban. Both of these drugs have faced stiff competition in the US and markets have not grown as expected. The company expects sales growth in 2H 1999 to be higher than that in 1H. Relenza, which was recently approved in the US for the treatment of influenza, will be available in Europe in autumn 1999. Seretide, the combined Serevent and Flixotide asthma treatment, is to be rolled out in the rest of Europe (it is already available in nine European countries) and the US over the next two years. 

  Zeffix, for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, is scheduled for launch in China, by far its largest potential market, in 3Q 1999, and Glaxo Wellcome expects to launch Lotronex, a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, in Europe and the US in 2000. Meanwhile, products for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (GI98745), stroke (GV150526) and diabetes (GI262570) are in late-stage development. The company's selling, general and administrative costs increased 34% to #1398 M in 1H 1999, because of investment in recently-launched products. This cost is expected to increase further in 2H 1999. In the UK, Glaxo Wellcome's turnover for 1H 1999 fell 3% to #235 M, because of the continued decline in the sales of Zantac and the increased impact of cheap imports from spain. Glaxo Wellcome stated that it is continuing to take every measure possible to reduce parallel imports.

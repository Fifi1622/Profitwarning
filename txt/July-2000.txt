 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 In a Disappointing Week, Nasdaq Drops 10%, Dow 2%

 The formerly invincible technology sector took on a more sickly cast last week after a profit warning from Finnish wireless-phone heavyweight Nokia and an unimpressive profit report from Amazon.com helped prompt the sharpest selloff in the group since April. 

 Reflecting the tech rout, the Nasdaq fell 431 points, or 10.5%, in the five sessions, ending at 3663, making for its worst weekly showing since a 25% loss in the five days ended April 14. The Nasdaq declined in four of last week's five sessions, capped by a loss of 179 points on Friday, when stocks like Cisco Systems, Intel and Sun Microsystems, which had held up well earlier in the week, declined sharply. 

 The selloff intensified Friday on news that the nation's economy expanded at a 5.2% rate in the second quarter, up from the 3.5% rate that had been forecast. Strong economic growth, of course, increases the likelihood that the Fed will raise interest rates again to cool the economy. 

 Amid the gloom, some technicians were encouraged that the Nasdaq now has given back more than half the gain it had managed to achieve between its May 24 low of 3164 and its July 17 high of 4274. This could signal that the Nasdaq will soon bottom out and begin to move back up, they argue. The Nasdaq is down 10% so far this year. 

 While the Nasdaq plunged, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined a more modest 2.1%, some 222 points, to 10,511, as tech-heavy investors rotated into drug stocks like Merck, consumer issues such as Coca-Cola and big energy companies like ExxonMobil. Merck, which rose 9 to 72 13/16, was the top performer in the Dow, powered by its strong second-quarter profit report and an upbeat outlook for the rest of 2000. The pattern of weakness in tech issues prompting strength in drug, consumer and energy stocks has been pretty consistent this year. 

 The news from Nokia and Amazon last week followed earnings warnings from Microsoft, Lucent Technologies, Agilent Technologies and Computer Associates. So far this year, several major areas of the tech sector have come unglued. First it was Internet retailers like Amazon, then the business-to-business stocks like Internet Capital Group and outfits like Priceline.com. Then came mainframe-oriented software companies like Computer Associates. 

 More recently, Lucent and Agilent cracked. Microsoft warned of slower profit growth, and then Nokia, the bellwether wireless company whose market value of $250 billion prior to this week was the largest in Europe, said last Thursday that its profits for the third quarter would be below second-quarter levels. 

 Nokia was off nearly 10 points to 43 3/4 on the week, stinging the country's hottest mutual-fund complex, Janus, whose largest single holding has been Nokia. As of April 30, the Finnish wireless giant was the No. 1 holding in several Janus funds, including Janus Twenty and Janus Worldwide. 

 The major technology issues still left standing include Internet infrastructure plays Cisco, Sun and Oracle, as well as the major optical networking companies, including Nortel Networks, Corning and JDS Uniphase. 

 It was ironic that Deutsche Telekom reached a deal to buy VoiceStream Wireless for a stunning price of $50 billion last week when telecommunications stocks like WorldCom, AT&T and Verizon Communcations (the merged Bell Atlantic and GTE) have been battered. Deutsche Telekom is paying about 50 times projected 2000 revenues and about $20,000 per subscriber for VoiceStream, whose network was cobbled together at far lower prices. 

 AT&T Wireless, the tracking stock for AT&T's cellular business, has a market value of $68 billion, but it has more than four times the subscriber base of VoiceStream and eight times the revenues. Deutsche Telekom's ADRs fell 9, to 42 5/8, just above their 52-week low of 39 and way below the March peak of 100. VoiceStream was off 24 3/8, to 125 3/8, ending markedly beneath the current value of the Deutsche Telekom offer of $165 per share. There is concern that the deal will be blocked in Washington. The German phone giant can pay such an outlandish price because its own shares have commanded a lofty valuation, trading for about double the cash flow multiple of the U.S. Baby Bells. But Deutsche Telekom's acquisition appetite could be curbed, given the latest drop in its stock. 

 Cable TV stocks fell Friday after Cox Communications posted disappointing second-quarter cash flow and warned of rising marketing expenses and competition from phone companies. The Cox situation was more bad news for beleaguered AT&T, which dropped 3 5/8 to 30 3/4 last week. AT&T has made the biggest bet in Corporate America on cable, paying over $100 billion for cable operators TCI and MediaOne. Cox Communications fell 7 7/8 to 36 Friday, while Comcast was off 3 3/8 to 31 1/16. 

 -- Amazon plunged 11 1/8 to 30, its lowest level since late 1998, after posting mildly disappointing second-quarter revenues of $578 million and a loss of 33 cents a share. Wall Street clearly is losing patience with what longtime Amazon bull Mary Meeker, the Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has called the company's ongoing high-wire act. 

 Holly Becker, a Lehman Brothers Internet analyst, summed it up best last week: "To justify its current valuation, Amazon must expand beyond books, and to date the company's new businesses have demonstrated a lack of traction." In downgrading Amazon to Neutral from Buy, she wrote that Amazon's book business is worth a "best-case" $5 billion, or $14 a share. Its current market value is $10.5 billion. 

 Becker added that unlike books, which are the perfect product for the 'Net, other goods sold by Amazon, including toys and electronics, "suffer from lower gross margins, negative working capital and higher fulfillment costs." It's worth noting that a profitable conventional bookseller, Barnes & Noble, which also owns a big stake in barnesandnoble.com, has a market value of $1.3 billion. Its shares stand at 20 5/8, roughly 12 times projected 2000 profits. 

 3Com began trading as a separate company Friday following the spinoff of its big stake in Palm. 3Com ended Friday at 12 7/8, unchanged from its when-issued price a week earlier. 

 -- Most chief executives like to plug their stocks at every opportunity. But Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson did his best to restrain the enthusiasm of some investors at a New York road show last Thursday for Goldman's offer of 40 million shares that's due to be priced this week. 

 The environment for the Goldman deal, its first equity offering since the former Wall Street partnership went public last May at $53 a share, worsened somewhat last week with the Nasdaq's big decline. Goldman shares fell 5 3/4 to 98 1/2. 

 When one questioner told Paulson that Goldman's stock was inexpensive, trading at 16 times projected 2000 profits of $6 a share, Paulson replied that the environment for Goldman has been very favorable in the past year. Goldman's return on equity has been a potentially unsustainable 30%, above the company's minimum target of 20% over a cycle. Paulson said Goldman needs to show it can generate good returns in tough times. 

 The Goldman chief executive also said one of the firm's biggest initiatives is attracting the assets of the very wealthy on a global basis. Goldman views its "sweet spot" as those individuals with assets of $25 million to $200 million. 

 It would have been tough for Paulson to argue that Goldman stock was deeply undervalued considering that all of the 40 million shares are being sold by former partners and other current holders. 

 One of the biggest individual sellers in the deal is former Goldman chief Jon Corzine, who's parting with 411,000 shares, worth around $40 million. Corzine has some big bills from his campaign to become U.S. senator from New Jersey, which cost him $36.7 million during the Democratic primary alone. Corzine will spend millions more in his bid to beat the Republican nominee, Bob Franks, in November. One investor suggested that Corzine, instead of monetizing Goldman stock to pay for his campaign expenses, ought to simply give away the shares to Jersey voters to cement their support. Corzine will still own four million shares after the offering. 

 -- Irwin Jacobs, the former corporate raider who owns 5% of Conseco, took out a big ad in The Wall Street Journal on Friday, blasting what he views as the pernicious influence of short sellers on stock of the troubled insurer, whose shares have fallen 54% to this year to 8 1/8 as the company's woes have intensified. 

 Jacobs said he was "appalled by the barrage of disparaging rumors and dire predictions of doom that have circulated about Conseco." He pointed his finger at short sellers as the source of those "misleading negative rumors." Short interest in Conseco totals 64 million shares, a sizable chunk of the company's 332 million shares outstanding. 

 But judging from Conseco's weak second-quarter profit report, released Thursday, Conseco's problems have little to do with the shorts and everything to do with its own financial performance. 

 The company had an operating loss of nine cents a share, compared with a profit of 84 cents in the second quarter of 1999, and consensus estimates of 28 cents a share. 

 Here are some other tidbits from the report. Conseco suffered $38 million in after-tax losses from selling its sub-prime auto-loan and credit-card businesses. The company's finance division, the former Green Tree Acceptance, which lends against trailers and manufactured housing, suffered higher loan delinquencies. Conseco's debt outstanding rose sharply in the first six months of the year as net worth declined. 

 While 2,000 workers at Conseco's finance unit will lose their jobs in the next few months in a cost-cutting move, the company doled out $47 million after taxes in the second quarter to former chief executive Steve Hilbert and others, and another $45 million as a signing bonus to lure Gary Wendt, the former boss of GE Capital, to become Conseco's chief executive. 

 Among the $352 million in after-tax charges and special items in the quarter was an eyebrow-raising expense of $76.6 million for what Conseco called "advisory fees and warrant paids to investment banks." That's a huge number, given that the advisers didn't accomplish much for Conseco. The company's top adviser has been Lehman Brothers. 

 But Lehman insurance analyst Eric Berg didn't help Conseco's cause Friday when he slashed his 2000 profit estimate to 92 cents from $1.61 a share and cut his 2001 projection to $1.16 from $2.89 a share. He also admitted that predicting the company's future profits with any precision is "impossible." Berg said Conseco's holding company is "bloated, indebted and badly distracted by peripheral businesses." 

 Berg cited "many unknowables" at this point regarding the company. "Will the company be able to raise enough cash through asset sales in the next couple of months to meet maturing debt obligations and thereby avert a bankruptcy?" he asks. "We believe so -- but we can't be definitive." Wendt did express confidence about the company's ability to meet debt maturities. 

 Conseco shares fell 1 1/8 Friday in the wake of the earnings news and the Berg action. Rather than blame short sellers, Jacobs might want to place a call to Lehman. 

 -- Bulls on Ford Motor are betting that the company's complex $10 billion cash distribution plan will boost Ford's flagging stock, which declined 1 1/4 to 46 1/8 last week and is off 10% this year. 

 Under the plan, Ford holders have the option of getting a $20 cash payment per share or an equivalent amount of newly issued Ford stock. Holders effectively have until late Tuesday to make their election. The actual distribution is scheduled for August 8. 

 David Bradley, the auto analyst at J.P. Morgan, says the distribution, if fully completed, will result in appreciably higher profits per Ford share of about 16%, because Ford's shares outstanding will shrink by about that amount while profits will fall only slightly. Ford is expected to earn $6 a share this year. 

 Bradley says the distribution amounts to the combination of a stock split and share buyback. Most analysts are advising holders to take the stock election because of the profit accretion from the deal. 

 Because Ford isn't offering investors any incentive to take the cash option, there are expectations that the full $10 billion may not be distributed. But even if just $5 billion gets done, it's expected that Ford will monetize the full $10 billion with a subsequent stock buyback plan. 

 Here's an interesting wrinkle on the distribution. The amount of Ford stock that will be received by holders electing the stock option was based on Ford's average price last week of roughly $46.75 a share. This means a change in Ford stock by the election deadline Tuesday will affect the allure of the cash and stock options. Simply put, if Ford is appreciably below $46.75 on Tuesday, the cash option looks better, and if Ford stock is above that $46.75, the stock option gets more attractive.

  In A Disappointing Week, Nasdaq Drops 10%, Dow 2%
  By Andrew Bary



The formerly invincible technology sector took on a more sickly cast
last week after a profit warning from Finnish wireless-phone heavyweight
Nokia and an unimpressive profit report from Amazon.com helped prompt
the sharpest selloff in the group since April.


 Reflecting the tech rout, the Nasdaq fell 431 points, or 10.5%, in the five sessions, ending at 3663, making for its worst weekly showing since a 25% loss in the five days ended April 14.

 The major technology issues still left standing include Internet infrastructure plays Cisco, Sun and Oracle, as well as the major optical networking companies, including Nortel Networks, Corning and JDS Uniphase. 

 It was ironic that Deutsche Telekom reached a deal to buy VoiceStream Wireless for a stunning price of $50 billion last week when telecommunications stocks like WorldCom, AT&T and Verizon Communcations (the merged Bell Atlantic and GTE) have been battered. Deutsche Telekom is paying about 50 times projected 2000 revenues and about $20,000 per subscriber for VoiceStream, whose network was cobbled together at far lower prices. 

 AT&T Wireless, the tracking stock for AT&T's cellular business, has a market value of $68 billion, but it has more than four times the subscriber base of VoiceStream and eight times the revenues. Deutsche Telekom's ADRs fell 9, to 42 5/8, just above their 52-week low of 39 and way below the March peak of 100. VoiceStream was off 24 3/8, to 125 3/8, ending markedly beneath the current value of the Deutsche Telekom offer of $165 per share. There is concern that the deal will be blocked in Washington. The German phone giant can pay such an outlandish price because its own shares have commanded a lofty valuation, trading for about double the cash flow multiple of the U.S. Baby Bells. But Deutsche Telekom's acquisition appetite could be curbed, given the latest drop in its stock. 

 Cable TV stocks fell Friday after Cox Communications posted disappointing second-quarter cash flow and warned of rising marketing expenses and competition from phone companies. The Cox situation was more bad news for beleaguered AT&T, which dropped 3 5/8 to 30 3/4 last week. AT&T has made the biggest bet in Corporate America on cable, paying over $100 billion for cable operators TCI and MediaOne. Cox Communications fell 7 7/8 to 36 Friday, while Comcast was off 3 3/8 to 31 1/16. 

 -- Amazon plunged 11 1/8 to 30, its lowest level since late 1998, after posting mildly disappointing second-quarter revenues of $578 million and a loss of 33 cents a share. Wall Street clearly is losing patience with what longtime Amazon bull Mary Meeker, the Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, has called the company's ongoing high-wire act. 

 Holly Becker, a Lehman Brothers Internet analyst, summed it up best last week: "To justify its current valuation, Amazon must expand beyond books, and to date the company's new businesses have demonstrated a lack of traction." In downgrading Amazon to Neutral from Buy, she wrote that Amazon's book business is worth a "best-case" $5 billion, or $14 a share. Its current market value is $10.5 billion. 

 Becker added that unlike books, which are the perfect product for the 'Net, other goods sold by Amazon, including toys and electronics, "suffer from lower gross margins, negative working capital and higher fulfillment costs." It's worth noting that a profitable conventional bookseller, Barnes & Noble, which also owns a big stake in barnesandnoble.com, has a market value of $1.3 billion. Its shares stand at 20 5/8, roughly 12 times projected 2000 profits. 

 3Com began trading as a separate company Friday following the spinoff of its big stake in Palm. 3Com ended Friday at 12 7/8, unchanged from its when-issued price a week earlier. 

 -- Most chief executives like to plug their stocks at every opportunity. But Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson did his best to restrain the enthusiasm of some investors at a New York road show last Thursday for Goldman's offer of 40 million shares that's due to be priced this week. 

 The environment for the Goldman deal, its first equity offering since the former Wall Street partnership went public last May at $53 a share, worsened somewhat last week with the Nasdaq's big decline. Goldman shares fell 5 3/4 to 98 1/2. 

 When one questioner told Paulson that Goldman's stock was inexpensive, trading at 16 times projected 2000 profits of $6 a share, Paulson replied that the environment for Goldman has been very favorable in the past year. Goldman's return on equity has been a potentially unsustainable 30%, above the company's minimum target of 20% over a cycle. Paulson said Goldman needs to show it can generate good returns in tough times. 

 The Goldman chief executive also said one of the firm's biggest initiatives is attracting the assets of the very wealthy on a global basis. Goldman views its "sweet spot" as those individuals with assets of $25 million to $200 million. 

 It would have been tough for Paulson to argue that Goldman stock was deeply undervalued considering that all of the 40 million shares are being sold by former partners and other current holders. 

 One of the biggest individual sellers in the deal is former Goldman chief Jon Corzine, who's parting with 411,000 shares, worth around $40 million. Corzine has some big bills from his campaign to become U.S. senator from New Jersey, which cost him $36.7 million during the Democratic primary alone. Corzine will spend millions more in his bid to beat the Republican nominee, Bob Franks, in November. One investor suggested that Corzine, instead of monetizing Goldman stock to pay for his campaign expenses, ought to simply give away the shares to Jersey voters to cement their support. Corzine will still own four million shares after the offering. 

 -- Irwin Jacobs, the former corporate raider who owns 5% of Conseco, took out a big ad in The Wall Street Journal on Friday, blasting what he views as the pernicious influence of short sellers on stock of the troubled insurer, whose shares have fallen 54% to this year to 8 1/8 as the company's woes have intensified. 

 Jacobs said he was "appalled by the barrage of disparaging rumors and dire predictions of doom that have circulated about Conseco." He pointed his finger at short sellers as the source of those "misleading negative rumors." Short interest in Conseco totals 64 million shares, a sizable chunk of the company's 332 million shares outstanding. 

 But judging from Conseco's weak second-quarter profit report, released Thursday, Conseco's problems have little to do with the shorts and everything to do with its own financial performance. 

 The company had an operating loss of nine cents a share, compared with a profit of 84 cents in the second quarter of 1999, and consensus estimates of 28 cents a share. 

 Here are some other tidbits from the report. Conseco suffered $38 million in after-tax losses from selling its sub-prime auto-loan and credit-card businesses. The company's finance division, the former Green Tree Acceptance, which lends against trailers and manufactured housing, suffered higher loan delinquencies. Conseco's debt outstanding rose sharply in the first six months of the year as net worth declined. 

 While 2,000 workers at Conseco's finance unit will lose their jobs in the next few months in a cost-cutting move, the company doled out $47 million after taxes in the second quarter to former chief executive Steve Hilbert and others, and another $45 million as a signing bonus to lure Gary Wendt, the former boss of GE Capital, to become Conseco's chief executive. 

 Among the $352 million in after-tax charges and special items in the quarter was an eyebrow-raising expense of $76.6 million for what Conseco called "advisory fees and warrant paids to investment banks." That's a huge number, given that the advisers didn't accomplish much for Conseco. The company's top adviser has been Lehman Brothers. 

 But Lehman insurance analyst Eric Berg didn't help Conseco's cause Friday when he slashed his 2000 profit estimate to 92 cents from $1.61 a share and cut his 2001 projection to $1.16 from $2.89 a share. He also admitted that predicting the company's future profits with any precision is "impossible." Berg said Conseco's holding company is "bloated, indebted and badly distracted by peripheral businesses." 

 Berg cited "many unknowables" at this point regarding the company. "Will the company be able to raise enough cash through asset sales in the next couple of months to meet maturing debt obligations and thereby avert a bankruptcy?" he asks. "We believe so -- but we can't be definitive." Wendt did express confidence about the company's ability to meet debt maturities. 

 Conseco shares fell 1 1/8 Friday in the wake of the earnings news and the Berg action. Rather than blame short sellers, Jacobs might want to place a call to Lehman. 

 -- Bulls on Ford Motor are betting that the company's complex $10 billion cash distribution plan will boost Ford's flagging stock, which declined 1 1/4 to 46 1/8 last week and is off 10% this year. 

 Under the plan, Ford holders have the option of getting a $20 cash payment per share or an equivalent amount of newly issued Ford stock. Holders effectively have until late Tuesday to make their election. The actual distribution is scheduled for August 8. 

 David Bradley, the auto analyst at J.P. Morgan, says the distribution, if fully completed, will result in appreciably higher profits per Ford share of about 16%, because Ford's shares outstanding will shrink by about that amount while profits will fall only slightly. Ford is expected to earn $6 a share this year. 

 Bradley says the distribution amounts to the combination of a stock split and share buyback. Most analysts are advising holders to take the stock election because of the profit accretion from the deal. 

 Because Ford isn't offering investors any incentive to take the cash option, there are expectations that the full $10 billion may not be distributed. But even if just $5 billion gets done, it's expected that Ford will monetize the full $10 billion with a subsequent stock buyback plan. 

 Here's an interesting wrinkle on the distribution. The amount of Ford stock that will be received by holders electing the stock option was based on Ford's average price last week of roughly $46.75 a share. This means a change in Ford stock by the election deadline Tuesday will affect the allure of the cash and stock options. Simply put, if Ford is appreciably below $46.75 on Tuesday, the cash option looks better, and if Ford stock is above that $46.75, the stock option gets more attractive.

 . . . . IN THE REGION . . . . 

 The head of Lucent Technologies 

 Inc.'s optical networking business will retire Tuesday, the company said Friday. Harry Bosco decided months ago to retire when he reached his 35th service anniversary, said Lucent spokesman Bill Price. Bosco reached that milestone last week. The Murray Hill, N.J.- based telecommunications equipment maker will announce his replacement next week, Price said. The announcement, which was made to staffers Thursday, comes on the heels of last week's profitwarning and a decision by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard McGinn to shift some of Lucent's top managers in the next two weeks. `Contrary to speculation in the media, this was Harry's decision,` Price said. 

 Patriot Bank Corp. of Pottstown on Friday announced a second- quarter dividend of 9.25 cents per share, payable Aug. 24 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 11. Patriot, a $1.25 billion financial institution, has operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. 

 . . . . INDICATORS . . . . 

 The supercharged U.S. economy did not cool off as expected in the spring but instead grew at an even faster 5.2 percent rate, propelled by strong business investment and government spending, the government reported Friday. Revised figures showed the GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the first three months of this year and economists were forecasting that pace would slow to around 3.7 percent in the April-June quarter. 

 . . AMONG COMPANIES . . 

 Bank of America Corp. said Friday it would cut as many as 10,000 jobs as it changes its focus from growing through mergers to becoming more efficient and profitable through the use of technology. 

 Bank of America, the nation's second-largest bank in terms of assets behind Citigroup, employed 150,854 people as of June 30, more than 11,000 fewer than a year earlier. 

 . . . . IN THE COURTS . . . . 

 The United States served notice Friday that it will file a trade complaint against Mexico before the World Trade Organization following the failure of talks aimed at lowering barriers to competition by U.S. telecommunication companies. The administration said it will file in the next several days a request for consultations with Mexico before the WTO in Geneva. That request will trigger a 60-day period for the two nations to resolve their differences. If an agreement is not reached, the United States would be cleared to file a WTO case against Mexico.

 Nordstrom Shares Plunge 18% on 2nd-Quarter  Profit Warning  Retail: Company says lower sales and a weak demand for clothing will push earnings 12 cents to 16 cents below analysts' estimates.

 SEATTLE -- Nordstrom Inc. shares fell 18% after the retailer said that fiscal second-quarter profit will miss forecasts and that it will take a charge for the declining value of an investment in an online grocer. 

 The stock dropped $4.06 to close at $18.13 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling to a 52-week low of $16.56, and several analysts cut their ratings on the shares. 

 The company said profit in the quarter ending Monday will be 12 cents to 16 cents below the 55-cent average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Recent semiannual clearance sales and first-week totals at Nordstrom's anniversary sale were below expectations, Nordstrom said. The chain was hurt last year by fashion missteps and inventory problems and has been trying to stock more popular styles this year. 

 "Nordstrom has been struggling to build merchandise and reconfigure the way it does business," analyst Michael Exstein of Credit Suisse First Boston wrote in a report. "Clearly, this has become a much more difficult process than either the company or we realized." Exstein lowered his rating on the stock to "buy" from "strong buy." 

 Nordstrom also was hurt in the quarter by generally weak demand for apparel, which has resulted in lower-than-expected sales at many clothing retailers in recent months, analysts said. 

 Nordstrom Chairman and Chief Executive John Whitacre said he is "guardedly optimistic concerning our performance over the second half of this year." 

 Nordstrom said it will take a charge of 4 cents to 5 cents a share to reflect the decline of its $33-million investment in Streamline.com Inc., which delivers groceries ordered over the Internet. The investment, made in 1998, may continue to decline in value, Nordstrom said. 

 Streamline.com rose 6 cents to close at $3.25 on Nasdaq. The Westwood, Mass.-based company sold 4.5 million shares at $10 in a June 1999 initial public offering. 

 Nordstrom is expected to release second-quarter results Aug. 16.

 ADR Report - U.S.-traded overseas stocks end week lower.

 NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed overseas shares, led by Latin American issues, ended the week on a dour note amid a sell-off on Wall Street triggered by fears of fresh interest raise hikes to cool the growing U.S. economy. 

 A rebound in Finnish telecommunications titan Nokia Corp - its sell-off Thursday was deemed overdone - did little to stem the slide of European American Depository Receipts. 

 European telecommunications issues led continental bourses lower, and the decline of their U.S.-traded ADRs helped send the Bank of America's index of European ADRs down to 154.42 for a loss of 1.30 percent on the day. 

 The bank's index of Asian ADRs was off 1.29 percent at 141.02, while its Latin American ADR index posted the heftiest decline, off 2.36 percent at 103.03. 

 All three regional indices were sharply off week-on-week, as U.S.-traded foreign issues sank in line with wobbly local shares from Tokyo to Mexico City. 

 Meanwhile, U.S. stocks fell Friday after the latest economic data showed the economy expanded at a rapid pace in the second quarter. The data renewed concern that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again, atop six hikes since last summer. 

 Among Latin American ADRs, Mexico's bellwether Telefonos de Mexico was off 2-9/16 to 51-1/16, with traders pegging the decline to the U.S. government's initiation of a World Trade Organisation case alleging that Mexico has failed to open up its $12 billion telecommunications market to foreign competition. 

 In an earnings-related decline, Chile's local benchmark Telefonica CTC Chile fell 15/16 to 15-3/8 in New York. 

 "There are certain select stories around today. Telmex is down because of this World Trade Organisation situation, CTC is off because of their bad second-quarter numbers," said a Latin American ADRs trader based in New York. 

 "Mexico in general is off although second-quarter numbers came in in line; people were expecting that and had factored that into prices already," the trader added. 

 Brazil Telecom fell 2-1/2 to 70-1/4 in New York, adding to Thursday's losses, despite a recommendation by Deutsche Bank to investors to buy the stock, which it said was cheap in terms of its long-term fundamentals. 

 Another Brazilian telecom concern, Telemig Celular , shed 1-1/4 to 64 despite favourable views from Morgan Stanley, which said Telemig had posted exceptional second-quarter results. 

 "The Brazil telecoms have had a decent run-up with some global money coming into them, so I don't see any real reason why they would be coming down," the ADRs trader said. 

 "Maybe it is some profit-taking...and they may be coming off with the Nasdaq," he added. 

 The only strength seen among Latin American ADRs was in consumer plays such as banks and retailers. Among the former, Brazil's Unibanco rose 5/16 to 30-1/2. 

 Merrill Lynch, in a research note Friday that seconded other analysts' views, was favourable on Brazil. It said investors would increasingly look outside the United States for growth, adding that Brazil was its "favorite growth story" in the global portfolio. 

 "GDP in Brazil continues to accelerate despite slowing global growth and is the world's ninth-largest economy. Brazil should also have faster growth next year than this year," Merrill Lynch added. 

 But Mexico, it said, had been the worst-performing regional market recently, as it continued to suffer from unsupportive corporate results and strong links to the U.S. market. 

 On the European front, Nokia's ADRs rose 3-5/16 to 44-5/16, regaining part of Thursday's hefty drop, which followed a company warning that third-quarter profit would fall sequentially. 

 Other European telecoms were hit hard, including France Telecom , off 8 at 123, and Telecom Italia , off 5-1/16 at 125-15/16. 

 German telecom giant Deutsche Telekom saw a second consecutive day of losses as well, off 2-1/8 at 43-3/8, weighed down by results issued Thursday which showed a 26 percent decline in first-half net profit, on a comparable basis. 

 Among Asian issues, Japan's Kyocera Corp. continued its heavy losing streak, shedding 5-5/16 to 140-5/8, while electronics maker Sony Corp. stood at 90-7/8 for a loss of 3-3/38. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index fell to 15,838, its first close below the key 16,000 level in over a year. 

 Following heavy losses on the Seoul bourse, South Korean ADRs fell, led by SK Telecom Co. , down 3-1/4 at 29-13/16.

 Telecom Stocks Slide Again

 It's the golden age of telecommunications, with carriers feasting on fortunes from wireless plans and equipment makers trading fiber-optic gear for truckloads of cash. Right? 

 You wouldn't know it from recent forecasts in the phone sector. Already bruised, telecommunications stocks took another beating yesterday on news from around the globe. 

 Deutsche Telekom AG and British Telecommunications Plc each reported lower profits on increased international spending to hold off competitors. DT, for example, recently bid $53 billion for VoiceStream, a Washington startup with just 2.3 million subscribers -- less than a tenth the base of U.S. leader Verizon Wireless. DT's shares were down 3.2 percent yesterday, and are off 30 percent from the start of 2000. 

 Nokia, the Finnish cellular phone maker, forecast a third-quarter earnings decline, as customers delay orders until new Internet-ready models are available. Nokia's stock plunged 25 percent, despite a 64 percent gain in second-quarter profit. 

 Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom Inc.'s shares fell 12 percent after signaling weaker sales for the year. The decline came even as the nation's second-largest long distance carrier reported a 52 percent gain in second-quarter profit. 

 Then there's the going-nowhere price of AT&T Wireless Group, the tracking stock issued by AT&T Corp. in April to reflect its cellular business. The wireless group stock slipped 75 cents to $28, still below its debut price of $29.60. AT&T itself is down 42 percent in the past 12 months after warning earlier this year that profit wouldn't meet expectations. 

 Even before yesterday's market reaction, global telecom shares was pulling back. The sector was down 18.8 percent this year through Wednesday, according to Dow Jones. In that time, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite was off by 2 percent. 

 The sector was pulled down by traditional telephone service providers, which posted a 21.5 percent drop. Wireless companies, by contrast, were up 4.4 percent for the year. 

 Get used to it, analysts said. With a race on to add spectrum --the invisible wires of the airwaves -- and interest rates inching up as a result of the Federal Reserve's continued brake-tapping, telecom players are facing huge outlays, they said. 

 Analysts expect bidders in the U.S. to spend billions at September auctions for so-called third- generation radio frequencies, which are capable of carrying the data- heavy material of the Internet by phone. Across Europe -- in Germany, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland -- governments are also finalizing plans for airwaves auctions by the end of the year. 

 "A lot of people have to reload on spectrum, and clearly you have to think about the cost of capital," said Greg Gorbatenko, an analyst at Loop Capital Markets in Chicago. "What you'll continue to see is solid revenue growth. Earnings are a different story." 

 Some of the tempered earnings forecasts also reflect expectations of general economic slowdowns, said Rick Black of Blaylock & Partners in New York. 

 "Companies are forecasting ahead and saying in this environment, we're not going to see that kind of growth" in earnings, Black said. 

 Nokia's American shares fell $13.94 to $41. Each American depositary receipt represents one regular share of Nokia. WorldCom dropped $5.44 to $39.31. 

 Still, Black said, with a fundamental transformation in communications underway, the long view is bright. 

 "The growth going on, especially in the wireless arena, is phenomenal," he said. "I wouldn't say the sky is falling."

By midnight tonight, the online song-sharing service of Napster Inc. was to be shut down per a preliminary federal injunction. In San Francisco Wednesday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel granted the order at the request of the Recording Industry Association of America, which sued Napster in December to resolve a landmark battle over Internet technology and copyright. An estimated 20 million Napster users will be affected by the injunction, which the judge said she issued because Napster hadn't policed the unauthorized trade of copyrighted music through its system. Users were flooding the online service to download as much as possible before the shutdown. 

Seven Internet retailers, including Web sites for Macy's department store and Toys "R" Us, will pay a total of $1.5 million to settle charges they didn't treat customers fairly when shipping delays occurred during the past holiday season, the Federal Trade Commission announced. It alleged that the companies failed to give buyers an opportunity to cancel orders, and, in many cases, didn't even send delay notices. Online retail sales soared at the end of last year, but there were numerous reports of logistical difficulties in processing orders. 

In what is being billed as a first in the nation, prosecutors in southern California plan to offer free DNA tests to some inmates, USA Today reported. It said that San Diego County prosecutors have been reviewing the cases of about 560 prisoners to determine whether DNA tests developed since their convictions - all prior to 1992 - could be used to establish innocence or guilt. The tests would cost about $5,000 each, the newspaper said, adding that similar initiatives are being considered in Illinois and Texas. 

Seven Western states that tap the Colorado River for water were set to present a compromise to federal officials in which southern California will cut back its consumption over the next decade and a half. For years, that region has exceeded its allotment, which was determined by a 1922 agreement. The overuse has become a more critical issue as Arizona and Nevada have grown closer to using their entire shares because of population growth. 

An advocacy group filed a lawsuit against the nation's largest not- for-profit health maintenance organization on grounds it provides inferior care to disabled Californians. The case involving Kaiser Permanente was timed for the 10th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act. A spokesman for Disability Rights Advocates said it should be "a warning to all HMOs," because complaints also have been received about other organizations. Kaiser said it wanted to cooperate to resolve the dispute, which centered on hospitals allegedly failing to offer accessible facilities, scales, and other medical devices for wheelchair users. 

Federal agents seized more than a half ton of the hallucinogen Ecstasy at Los Angeles International Airport. It was valued at $40 million - the largest haul of the substance to date, officials said. Three men were arrested in connection with the operation; authorities still were searching for a fourth. The drug is popular among dance- club patrons. (c) Copyright 2000.

 Nokia  Profit Warning  Roils Tech Shares --- Mobile-Phone Giant Sees Market Capitalization  Decline  by 25% in Day

 A flurry of worries that the world's mobile-telephone market may encounter complications knocked cellular-phone giant Nokia Corp. off its stock-market pedestal and sent a new shiver through Wall Street's skittish technology sector.   

 Shares of the Finnish telecommunications-equipment maker fell 25% as investors dumped Nokia's shares following a warning about third-quarter results. In all, about $64.3 billion of market capitalization was erased from its previously soaring market value. Nokia started the day with a market cap of about $257.2 billion and finished at about $192.9 billion in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   

 The company's forecast came as it released second-quarter earnings that edged past analysts' consensus estimate but fell short of the exceptional results the market has come to expect of the world's No. 1 maker of mobile-phone handsets.   

 Nokia reported second-quarter pretax profit of 1.42 billion euros ($1.32 billion), up 62% from a year ago and better than official market estimates of 1.4 billion euros. Still, that was short of unofficial expectations of about 1.5 billion euros. Revenue rose 55% to 6.98 billion euros and earnings per share were 20 european cents, up 54%.   

 The company cautioned that its earnings are likely to drop during the third quarter because of the cost and timing of several new product introductions. But Nokia's chairman, Jorma Ollila, said the company expects earnings per share for the third quarter to at least equal year-ago levels of 13.5 european cents, and that it remains on track to meet full-year forecasts. "Overall growth prospects for Nokia in the later part of the year, as well as for the long term, remain unchanged, stimulated by the strong mobile communications market," he said.   

 Many investors took Nokia's announcements as a signal to sell. "The company performed only slightly better than expected, which in Nokia's case means worse than expected," said Mika Paloranta, a telecom analyst at Aros Securities in Helsinki, Finland.   

 Nokia shares fell 21% in Helsinki to 45 euros, then continued their slide in New York. They dragged down other tech-related stocks as well: Texas Instruments Inc., one of Nokia's largest suppliers, dropped $7.4375, or 12%, to $56.875 in 4 p.m. Big Board composite trading despite reporting robust second-quarter earnings. The selling also pulled down Nokia's main rivals, Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson and Motorola Inc., which like Nokia benefited early this year when investors fled battered Internet stocks and bought mobile-telecom shares in the hope of catching tech's next wave.   

 Now, analysts aren't so sure that is the place to be. They worry that the huge fees phone-network operators around the world are paying for so-called third-generation cellular licenses, which will allow them to offer mobile data-communications services, may cut into the funds available for developing and marketing such services. European countries already have started auctioning off those licenses -- drawing tens of billions of dollars of bids -- and the U.S. will join the process in September.   

 Sales at equipment makers such as Nokia, the logic goes, could suffer if third-generation networks are delayed due to a funds shortage after the auctions. "Will operators have money left to invest in building 3G networks?" asks Lars Waagstein, an analyst with Jupiter Communications in Stockholm.   

 For now, Nokia insists, handset sales are on track. The company saw second-quarter handset sales grow 67% compared with a year ago, while Motorola, of Schaumburg, Ill., the world's second-largest handset maker, reported an increase of 20% for the quarter and Sweden's Ericsson, the third-largest, saw a rise of 57% for the quarter.   

 Some big-name investors had a rough ride on Nokia's slide yesterday. According to Bigdough.com, Janus Capital Corp., the large Denver fund firm, owned 5.7% of the company's shares outstanding as of the end of the first quarter. If its ownership stake remains the same, Janus would have had nearly $4 billion of paper losses from yesterday's trading. According to Morningstar, the Chicago mutual-fund tracker, at least three Janus mutual funds counted Nokia as their largest holding as of the most recent disclosure: Janus Twenty Fund, Janus Olympus Fund and Janus Mercury Fund. Five more count the European wireless giant among their top five holdings.   

 Janus took the Nokia developments in stride, mindful that it has made billions of dollars in gains on the stock. Indeed, five Janus funds held shares in the wireless company as early as 1995. "While we don't comment on intraday trading, we take a long-term view of Nokia as we do with all of our holdings," a spokeswoman said. The move in Nokia sent Janus funds reeling: Janus Twenty and Janus Mercury Fund both dropped 4.5%, Janus Global Technology Fund fell 5.3% and Janus Olympus Fund was down 3.75%, according to fund tracker Lipper Inc.   

 The Philadelphia Wireless Telecom Index fell 12.50, or 5.4%, to 220.48. At 4 p.m., Motorola fell $3.375, or 9.2%, to $33.50 in Big Board trading and Ericsson's American depositary receipts fell $1.875, or 9.2%, to $18.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

 Ethyl Corp.'s Net Income Fell 30% Despite Modest Sales Growth

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Ethyl Corp., which issued a profit warning last month because of its concerns about the rising costs of oil-based raw materials, posted a 30% decline in second-quarter net income amid modest sales growth. 

 Citing the declining earnings and an "aggressive" commitment to reducing its debt, Ethyl (EY) also said it will suspend its quarterly dividend. The last regular dividend was paid July 1 at 6.25 cents a share. 

 The Richmond, Va., chemical concern said net income came to $9.3 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $13.2 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

 The latest results included $2.6 million in income from the demutualization of MetLife Inc., and a gain of $1.4 million, or five cents a share. Excluding those items, the company said it would have reported earnings of $5.3 million, or six cents a share. 

 Earnings for the latest quarter beat the diminished mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial by a penny. 

 Before the earnings warnings in June, analysts had expected the company to earn about 14 cents a share for the latest quarter. At that time, the company also had cited the weakening of the euro and lower demand of tetraethyl lead for the weak outlook. 

 Sales rose 4.1% to $214.6 million from $206.2 million. 

 "We are extremely dissatisfied with our results, said Ethyl Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bruce C. Gottwald. "Industry conditions over the past several years have had an adverse impact on our earnings. Consequently, we have not achieved the aggressive repayment plan we set for ourselves to reduce the additional debt incurred in 1997 at the time of the stock repurchase." 

 Meanwhile, the company said shipments of petroleum products were basically flat compared with year-earlier figures. While average selling prices rose slightly, increases in raw material costs offset the benefit of higher prices by reducing gross profit margins. 

 Earnings from petroleum additives dropped 43% to $11.5 million from $20.2 million, despite a 2.2% increase in segment revenue to $204.9 million. 

 Ethyl, which develops, manufactures, blends and markets petroleum additives, said it is looking at ways to recover the rising cost of raw materials in the marketplace. The company also said its goal is to "substantially" reduce debt and improve its balance sheet over the next 12 months.

 Nokia Stuns With Rare  Profit Warning ,Shares Plunge

 STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- This time around, Nokia Corp. (NOK) only managed to meet expectations. 

 And for good measure, the Finnish telecommunications equipment giant issued its first profit warning in recent memory. 


For investors spoiled by several consecutive quarters of strong
earnings growth that usually beat forecasts and bullish company
projections, Thursday's second-quarter results weren't quite what they
had in mind. Nokia shares
plunged, at one point dropping nearly 20%.   Nokia reported a 62% jump
in its second quarter pretax profit to EUR1.42 billion, squarely in
line with the consensus estimate from analysts surveyed by Swedish
forecasting firm SIX Market Estimates.



However, investors and analysts were left shell-shocked by Nokia's
revelation that earnings per share for the third and current quarter
would come in below the second quarter's 20 cents.It was hardly
comforting that, by Nokia's estimates, the third quarter EPS would at
least exceed the year-earlier 13.50 centsa share.



Nokia's surprise "doesn't mean it's a bad company, but nobody likes to
pull forecasts back," said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Angela
Dean ahead of a likely slew of earnings forecast downgrades from
industry watchers.



Nokia Chairman and Chief Executive Jorma Ollila in a statement
attributed the outlook to "the timing of the new product introductions
in Nokia Mobile Phones, as well as seasonality."



The warning sparked a steep fall in its shares on the Helsinki Stock
Exchange. At 1344 GMT, the shares were quoted at EUR48.30, down EUR8.85,
or 15.5% after having traded as low as EUR46.20 after the report's
release.



"The third quarter outlook is something of a stunner to the market,
considering that they've in the past introduced new models quite
smoothly in that quarter," observed Jan Ihrfeldt, an analyst with
Swedbank Markets in Stockholm.



   Follows Ericsson Letdown



Nokia's forecast that fourth quarter EPS would bounce back to above
the second quarter level inspired little confidence. The forecast
follows last week's disclosure by Swedish rival LM Ericsson that its
mobile phones business would operate in the red for the next year after
a second-quarter operating loss of SEK2.23 billion.



Nokia was "very vague in their projections for the fourth quarter. It
gives no guidance on what to expect. We really need to see how many
phones they expect to deliver in the fourth quarter," Ihrfeldt said.



Some analysts were a bit disheartened by slightly weaker-than-expected
sales of EUR4.88 billion for the latest quarter at Nokia's key mobile
phone division, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the
company's overall sales.



Still, Nokia managed to improve already high margins in the handset
business, analysts said.



"Top-line sales were a bit below expectations, but margins were
clearly better than forecast," said Johann Brostroem of Hagstroemer &
Qviberg stockbrokers in Stockholm.



In the mobile phone division the operating margin rose to 24.5% for
the first half compared with 23.5% for the same period last year.



On the whole Nokia has managed the difficult balancing act of grabbing
mobile phone market share, while keeping margins high, analysts said.
With an estimated 30% share of the handset market, Nokia is clearly the
industry's dominant player. The company puts the overall mobile phone
market volume at over 400 million units this year.



"Overall growth prospects for Nokia in the later part of the year, as
well as for the long term, remain unchanged, stimulated by the strong
mobile communications market," Ollila said. But "we expect competition
to remain fierce," he added.



Williams de Broe analyst Douglas Gross believes that the consensus
estimate for Nokia's full-year diluted EPS will be cut "by almost 10% -
certainly in our case, it will be about 10%."



Williams de Broe currently has a 2000 EPS projection of 84 cents,
diluted, a bit above the consensus forecast of 81 cents.



"They seem to have ruffled some feathers with this outlook for Q3,"
Gross said.



However, if Nokia can reassure investors that the company's results
will be back on track in the fourth quarter and beyond, "I would say
it's a good buying opportunity," he said.

 DaimlerChrysler Earnings Up 18% in 2nd Quarter Autos: But results for the year are expected to drop. The company plans job cuts and other efforts to boost its share price.

 DETROIT -- DaimlerChrysler reported Wednesday that second-quarter earnings rose 18% but warned that operating profit for the year would drop because fierce competition in the U.S. market would require larger sales incentives and increased spending to introduce new models. 

 Chairman Juergen Schrempp also said he would carve out $5.6 billion in costs and cut 25% of administrative costs by 2003. He pledged to improve the company's weak stock price. 

 The company earned $1.67 billion on sales of $41.7 billion in the second quarter, up from $1.41 billion on sales of $35.6 billion last year. The earnings of $1.66 per share beat the $1.52 expected by analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The company said it expects significant revenue growth to continue in the second half thanks largely to a positive outlook in almost all divisions. New American products, including the car that's generating the most industry buzz these days, the hot-selling Chrysler PT Cruiser, are expected to strengthen its market position. 

 "But expenses related to those launches plus aggressive new marketing activities will depress its operating profit in the second half, especially in the third quarter 2000," the company said in a statement. 

 Schrempp has been under pressure to improve DaimlerChrysler's performance since the 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler Corp. because of the lackluster stock and steady departure of U.S. executives from the auto maker's Chrysler arm. 

 Achieving the cost reductions will mean job cuts, Schrempp said at a news conference in Stuttgart, Germany, but he would not say how many jobs would be cut. 

 Nor did he give details on other streamlining measures. Company officials said earlier this month that they were exploring ways to cut costs in Stuttgart and in the North American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., just north of Detroit. 

 Schrempp also pledged to boost DaimlerChrysler's shares, which have plummeted more than 30% from less than a year ago. Investors seemed unfazed by Wednesday's profit warning, however, sending shares up $1.31 to end at $53.56. That still left the company with a price-to-earnings ratio of just under 10. 

 DaimlerChrysler's operating profit this year is likely to miss last year's performance by a considerable margin, said John Lawson, managing director of equity research at Salomon Smith Barney in London and an auto industry specialist. 

 "I would venture to suggest, in terms of marketing costs or whatever, it could easily be $400-$500 million less than a year ago," he said. 

 Competing products are also likely to pinch DaimlerChrysler's profit, Lawson said in a telephone interview from London. "They say it's down to the changeover [of models] and extra costs incurred there," he said. "Most of us have a suspicion that there's a fairly serious competitive set of issues as well, in terms of some pretty decent product from the likes of Honda etc., who are going to eat a bit of their lunch." 

 Honda's Odyssey minivan has received rave reviews since it was introduced last year, and its sales have soared about 150% in the January-to-June period over last year, while Chrysler and Dodge vans have dipped 6.8%. 

 The world's fifth-largest auto maker has had trouble boosting sales of its Chrysler division--Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles--in the U.S., its big profit center, because of an aging lineup of minivans, sport-utility vehicles and mid-size cars. 

 Production on a new generation of minivans began Monday, and a new line of mid-size cars is being introduced soon, but the current generation of those vehicles along with some SUVs carry incentives of up to $2,000 each. 

 "We're at a time when the incentive wars are escalating just tremendously fast, and are incredibly expensive," said Thomas R. Marinelli, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for the Chrysler/Jeep division. 

 Schrempp was optimistic of the company's prospects in the rest of its vehicle business. "The recently announced acquisition of Western Star and Detroit Diesel, as well as the major steps taken in Asia with Mitsubishi Motors and Hyundai Motor, underline our strategy to focus on the automotive business," he said. 

 Last week DaimlerChrysler bought the rest of engine maker Detroit Diesel Corp. that it doesn't already own for about $423 million and agreed to buy Canada's Western Star Trucks for $454 million. It also has recently acquired stakes in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. of South Korea. 

 Although operating profit will decline this year, Schrempp said he expected that one-time gains including DaimlerChrysler's sale of its Dasa aerospace unit to anchor a new European space consortium and the sale of half its computer services unit to Deutsche Telekom will fuel a further increase in net income and earnings per share for the year. 

 Operating profit at Mercedes-Benz rose 22% to $719 million on revenue of $10.9 billion, up 18%, driven by stronger sales of Mercedes luxury cars and the two-seat Smart mini-car it manufactures and sells in Europe.

Abreast of the Market
 LSI Logic Plunges, Xerox Falls, As Results, Warning Show Effect

 NEW YORK -- An uneven earnings performance cost technology stocks more ground and left market averages lower again.   

 LSI Logic slumped sharply after Wall Street pilloried the Milpitas, Calif., semiconductor supplier's second-quarter profit statement. Released late Tuesday, the report showed the company matched Wall Street's profit target for the quarter, but posted revenue that fell short of forecasts, prompting a host of analysts to turn critical of the stock.   

 LSI fell 14 1/2 to 32 1/2 in 4 p.m. composite trading.   

 Rambus (Nasdaq) declined 9 1/2 to 75 1/2, after Intel indicated it planned to use other memory technology in its upcoming Pentium 4 processor, rather than rely on Rambus as the sole technology provider. That put more pressure on the vulnerable semiconductor sector.   

 Internet stocks also struggled, with Amazon.com (Nasdaq) down 1 9/16 to 36 1/16, near its 52-week low of 32 15/32 set June 23, after Lehman Brothers lowered its rating to neutral from buy ahead of the release of the online retailer's second-quarter profits, due out after regular trading hours. The firm said the company is exposed to near-term execution risks.   

 Meanwhile, Xerox scattered more bad news around the computer-hardware sector after the printer maker issued another earnings warning. The stock fell 3 3/16 to 15. Hardware names such as HewlettPackard, which fell 5 3/8 to 110, and International Business Machines, which lost 1 7/8 to 109 7/8, posted sharp losses, though Compaq Computer managed to ride its own upbeat profit news, and upbeat comments from PaineWebber, to a gain on the day, up 1 9/16 at 29.   

 In fact, there was enough good news floating around the technology sector that it kept the Nasdaq Composite Index's loss to relatively tame 41.85 points, or 1.04%, at 3987.72.   

 The index got some measure of support from the rush to trade JDS Uniphase (Nasdaq) before the optical-components maker's entry into the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, which was to occur as regular trading ended. The stock was 5 3/4 higher at 135 15/16, after about 147 million shares changed hands. The singleissue one-day volume record, though -- the 171 million shares of Oracle that traded in December 1997 -- wasn't bested.   

 Index funds also sold some of the biggest blue-chip names in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index to accommodate the addition of JDS Uniphase. The optics maker had a market cap of approximately $103 billion, as of Tuesday's close; it replaced Rite Aid, with a market cap of about $1.6 billion.   

 The selling pressure affecting blue-chip prices on the close of the session showed up in the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which finished on its low of the session, down 183.49, or 1.71%, at 10516.48.   

 Anticipation of today's release of an important piece of inflation data, the quarterly employment-cost index reading covering the second quarter, made investors anxious about some rate-sensitive growth and financial stocks.   

 Just a week earlier, investors had rallied the market on relief from the interestrate overhang, as Wall Street adopted an upbeat interpretation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to a Senate committee on July 20.   

 "The market has bumped into some valuation concerns, as investors decide that, over the short term, we have already seen all the good news we're going to see," Robert Harrington, head of listed equity trading at PaineWebber.   

 J.P. Morgan, lofted recently by speculation about the possibility it could be caught in the financial sector's consolidation wave, gave up 5 to 131 3/16. Merrill Lynch declined 4 1/16 to 127 3/4. Chase Manhattan lost 1 7/8 to 49 3/8.   

 Traditional growth names, such as General Electric, down 1 1/4 at 52 1/2, AT&T, which bumped 2% higher Tuesday following a better-than-expected profit performance, fell 1 7/16 to 32 3/8, a loss of 4%, while Lucent Technologies, which has struggled recently, trading at its 52-week low, lost 1 1/16 to 48 1/4.   

 Insurance stocks rose sharply, amid signs the pricing environment for the sector has improved, after an extended period of weakness. Aon, the Chicago insurance provider, gained 2 15/16 to 35 7/16 after Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns boosted ratings on the stock.   

 Hartford Financial, which paced a rally of its own Tuesday, gained 3 1/16 to 64 1/2, breaking to a 52-week high. Likewise, Chubb reached a 52-week high, up 2 7/16 to 74 5/16, while St. Paul gained 2 1/8 to 42 1/2, and its own high for the year, helped by an upgrade by Salomon Smith Barney.   

 Marsh & McLennan gained 5/8 to 115 9/16. The New York insurance and financial-services concern reported second-quarter results that matched forecasts. The stock traded at a 52-week high.   

 Nova fell 7 7/16 to 11 13/16. The Atlanta provider of credit-card transaction services warned that second-quarter revenue won't be as strong as analysts anticipated, blaming, in part, what the company described as a disappointing performance from two large portfolios it acquired.   

 Allergan gained 11/16 to 70 1/2, after a big intraday spike carried shares to 74 3/4. The Irvine, Calif., maker of eye- and skin-care products reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's projections. Separately, the company said it formed an alliance with the Vistakon division of Johnson & Johnson to expand products and services in the contact-lens market. Johnson & Johnson eased 3 1/4 to 90 1/4.   

 Energy stocks struggled in a tough session for blue-chip names. Exxon Mobil gained 1/2 to 75 7/8, after J.P. Morgan raised its rating on the stock to strong buy from outperform. J.P. Morgan also boosted its rating on Chevron, which ended unchanged at 77 5/16.   

 Triton Energy climbed 3 1/8 to 38 1/2. Dain Rauscher raised its rating on the Dallas energy exploration and production concern, which said Tuesday that its fifth well in a field off the coast of Equatorial Guinea could prove to be the most important in the field.   

 McDonald's, trading near a 52-week low, withstood some pessimistic comments from Wall Street. Lehman Brothers adopting what it called a more conservative stance on the fast-food operator, lowered its 2000 earnings estimates for the company. Merrill Lynch also cut its earnings estimates. Still, the stock, which rose 3.5% Tuesday after the company posted weak second-quarter profits, gained 1 11/16 to 33.   

 Circuit City continued to decline, off 2 at 24 1/8, after Tuesday's 20% loss; it slipped to another 52-week low. The Richmond, Va., consumer-electronics retailer Tuesday said it would stop selling appliances and would overhaul its stores.   

 Oxford Health (Nasdaq) gained 2 15/16 to 24 5/8. The Trumbull, Conn., health-careplan sponsor reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, prompting PaineWebber to boost its rating and its target price on the stock.   

 Kimberly-Clark gained 2 11/16 to 59 3/4. The Dallas consumer-products maker posted results that topped forecasts.   

 Nortel moved after a strong second-quarter performance. After the close of trading Tuesday, the Canadian telecommunications-equipment maker reported operating profit that topped forecasts, and increased its growth projections for this year.

 Electronic Arts (Nasdaq) gained 9 13/16 to 86 5/8. The Redwood City, Calif., entertainment-software developer reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss Tuesday.   

 Fairchild Semiconductor acquitted itself fairly well, on a relative-performance basis. The South Portland, Maine, chip maker limited its decline to 3/8, ending at 37 5/8, in a session where most semiconductor stocks suffered steeper declines. Credit Suisse First Boston boosted its rating on Fairchild, adding it to its Focus List, after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results late Tuesday.   

 Keane (Amex) gained 3 3/16 to 22 3/4. The Boston computer-consulting firm ended a string of six quarters of revenue declines, as its second-quarter results showed a slight improvement over firstquarter totals.   

 Vignette (Nasdaq) fell 4 7/8 to 38 3/4. The Austin, Texas, provider of electronic-commerce applications lost ground after its second-quarter results, issued late Tuesday, beat forecasts, but its balance sheet showed a sharp increase in collectibles.   

 New Focus (Nasdaq) fell 29 5/8 to 124 7/16. The Santa Clara, Calif., maker of fiber-optics products, which has had a volatile trading pattern recently amid an increased appetite for fiber-optics stocks by investors, reported a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss after regular trading Tuesday. The company also said it planned to offer 3.5 million common shares in a public offering.

 Nasdaq Ends Down 145; Dow Gains 70 

 NEW YORK (AP) - Investors went on the defensive today, selling shaky technology stocks and loading up on steadier pharmaceutical, utility and oil concerns that do better in a slowing economy. The latest wave of tech-selling was spurred by disappointing earnings reports from Amazon.com, WorldCom and Nokia. The Dow Jone industrial closed up 69.65 at 10,586.13 while the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 145.46 to 3,842.26. Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. said the stocks doing well were those that tend to post good earnings regardless of what happens to the economy. 

 Factory Orders Jump 10 Percent 

 WASHINGTON (AP) - Orders to U.S. factories in June rose by the largest amount in nine years, fueling fresh doubts that the long-awaited economic cooling off has arrived. Analysts said the 10 percent jump in orders for durable goods plus other reports showing tight labor markets and wage pressures will keep the Federal Reserve on high inflation alert. The Fed next meets Aug. 22 and some analysts said today's batch of data will make a seventh rate increase since early last summer a virtual certainty. The economic strength revealed in the new reports caught analysts by surprise. Many had expected only a tiny 0.2 percent rise in factory orders following May's strong showing, which was revised upward to a gain of 7 percent in today's report. 

 Wages and Benefits Jump 4.4 Percent 

 WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. workers' wages and benefits rose by 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in June, the government said today. It was the biggest increase in nine years. The government also said the 12-month rise in its employment Cost Index was up from a 4.3 percent increase for the 12 months ending in March of this year. While only a slight upward tick, the 4.4 percent increase was the biggest gain in wages and salaries since a 4.6 percent rise in June 1991. For the three months ending in June, the increase in wages and benefits was 1 percent, down slightly from a 1.4 percent advance in the first quarter. 

 FTC Backs Internet Privacy Deal 

 WASHINGTON (AP) - The government today approved a plan by Internet advertisers to regulate the secret gathering of information used to profile Web customers. The Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously to endorse the self-regulatory plan submitted by the Network Advertising Initiative, a consortium of major Internet advertising companies. The plan, which will take effect immediately, will require Web advertising companies to notify consumers of their Internet profiling activities and give customers the chance to choose whether information about their Web surfing can be gathered anonymously. 

 Amazon Shares Fall Sharply 

 SEATTLE (AP) - Shares of Amazon.com fell about 13 percent today as Wall Street, disappointed with the online retailer's latest earnings report, considered the company dot-combustible. Three separate investment houses - Prudential Securities, SG Cowan Securities and Merrill Lynch - downgraded Amazon.com's stock today. Lehman Brothers downgraded it yesterday. Despite beating Wall Street's estimates for overall losses by two cents per share, the company disappointed analysts yesterday with lower-than-expected sales. And while the company's book, video and music divisions were profitable, growth was lower than expected as well. Amazon stock was down $4.688 at $31.375. 

 Judge Orders Injunction Vs. Napster 

 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - It didn't take long for the first howls of dissent to be heard over a federal court order that will likely shut down Napster Inc.'s wildly popular online song-sharing service at midnight Friday. "What's next ... shut down the free Internet?" one music fan wrote in a Napster chat room. Another, with the user name UnrEvil, criticized the heavy metal band Metallica, which sued to stop fans from trading their music on Napster. "I'm never going to buy or listen to their music," the fan said. Chief U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel granted the preliminary injunction yesterday at the request of the Recording Industry Association of America, which sued Napster in December for copyright infringement. 

 J.C. Penney Names Questrom CEO 

 DALLAS (AP) - Allen Questrom - an executive with a history of turning around troubled retailers - has been named chairman and chief executive of J.C. Penney Co., officials said today. The news was cheered on Wall Street as J.C. Penney shares jumped more than 16 percent, and analysts expressed optimism Questrom could mend the struggling retailer. Questrom, who is credited with leading upscale retailer Barneys New York and industry giant Federated Department Stores out of bankruptcy, will take over the Plano-Texas-based retailer Sept. 15. 

 Sprint Agrees to Automatic Refunds 

 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Sprint Corp., the nation's third-largest long distance company and Florida's third-largest local phone company, has agreed to automatically issue refunds to state customers for extended outages. The phone company also will provide refunds on customers' bills when installation is delayed under the agreement with the state Public Counsel's office. The Public Service Commission, which regulates phone service in Florida, has been looking into the customer service performances of the three largest providers in the state: BellSouth, GTE and Sprint. 

 Kellogg Earnings Meet Expectations 

 BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) - Strong U.S. cereal sales helped Kellogg Co. second-quarter profits meet Wall Street expectations. For the three months ended June 30, Kellogg earned $150.9 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $154.2 million, or 38 cents per share, in the year-ago period, the company said today. Excluding restructuring charges, the Battle Creek-based company said it earned $165.6 million, or 41 cents per share. Analysts had predicted earnings of 41 cents per share for the quarter. Net sales rose 0.9 percent to $1.8 billion. 

 First Data To Cut 2,000 Jobs 

 TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - First Data Corp.'s teleservices division will close its Tucson operation by year's end, part of a cost-cutting plan that will lead to the elimination of nearly 2,000 jobs. The Tucson call center, where 1,100 jobs will be cut, will phase down operations while workers "transition to other opportunities with First Data or to other careers," company spokeswoman Antonette DeLauro said yesterday. She said said a phone center in Pensacola, Fla., offering similar services will also close, eliminating 800 jobs. 

 European Stocks Lower 

 LONDON (AP) - A sharp drop in technology and telecommunications shares pulled European stocks lower today. A profit warning from Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia and concern over British Telecommunications' debt levels pushed European indexes lower. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell 2.05 points, to 386.60. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index was down 3.11 points to 431.67. In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 0.6 percent to 6,352.10, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 1.6 percent to 7,183.44, the Paris CAC-40 Index was up 0.3 percent at 6,511.53, and Milan's MIBtel Index was down 1.7 percent to 46,430.0.

 PAUL KANGAS, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: The chips are down on Wall Street-chip-making stocks, that is-and they lead the way to a sell-off in other sectors. The Dow falls 183 points, the NASDAQ loses 41. Good evening. I`m Paul Kangas. 

 LINDA O`BRYON, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT ANCHOR: And I`m Linda O`Bryon. Susie Gharib is off tonight. Investors dump shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) in after-hours trading on continuing concern over when, or if, the Web retailer will ever turn a profit. Then, maxi inventories of mini-vans are causing problems for DaimlerChrysler (DCX). We`ll have the details. 

 Good evening, everyone. Some disappointing earnings reports and earnings fears for the future sent the major averages headed southward on Wall Street today. The Dow plunged 183 points and the NASDAQ lost 41. Sparking the sell-off: big losses in the technology sector, especially in the chip stocks. Erika Miller reports. 

 ERIKA MILLER, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: The final number hardly tells the tale at the NASDAQ today. Jittery investors bailed out of technology stocks on concerns about the sector`s profit growth. One of the biggest decliners was LSI Logic (LSI), which fell about 33 percent. The world`s biggest maker of custom semiconductor chips reported second-quarter earnings of $0.29 a share, right on target with estimates. But revenues came in about $20 million under forecasts. The company blames the weakness on a parts shortage, as well as shipment delays. Concerns about LSI spread to other chip stocks. The SOX, or Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, plunged more than 6 percent today to its lowest level in almost two months. But analyst Vincent Benedetti says the sector remains attractive. 

 VINCENT BENEDETTI, SEMICONDUCTOR ANALYST, GRUNTAL & CO.: Once the momentum of this selling starts to slow itself down, and once we start to really get through the seasonal slowness of the summertime, I would start to look for selected names in the group that are proven leaders. 

 MILLER: Weakness in technology stocks has been weighing down the NASDAQ. It is now down more than 20 percent from its March high. Much of decline has been on worries about slowing profit growth in the future, as a result of rising interest rates. But analysts say a supply/demand imbalance is also plaguing the NASDAQ. 

 BRIAN FINNERTY, CHIEF TRADER, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: Inflows into mutual funds have started to slacken. I think that`s a seasonal thing, but it does create less demand for stocks in the short term, and I also think in the short term that supply has increased, because the IPO calendar and the secondary calendar is building up again. Deals are starting to come out, so that`s increasing the supply. 

 MILLER: Right now the NASDAQ is in the red for the year, down 2 percent, and analysts don`t see much immediate upside from here. They say most of the positive news on the earnings front has been already factored into stock prices. Erika Miller, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, New York. 

 KANGAS: Investor disappointment over LSI Logic`s revenues and earnings warnings from BMS (BMCS). software and Xerox (XRX) triggered an opening sell-off in technology stocks on Wall Street today, and that soon undermined the general market as the Dow Industrial Average stair-stepped its way to an 80-point loss by 11:00 a.m., when the NASDAQ Index was down 105 points. Sizable losses in Intel (INTC), Hewlett-Packard (HWP), and J.P. Morgan (JPM) kept the Dow moving lower as morning trading continued, but bargain hunters took some of the downside pressure away from the tech sector. As a result, at 1:00 p.m., the Dow was down 144 points, while the NASDAQ Index trimmed its loss to 91 points. Continuing buying support in some of the recently hard-hit tech stocks helped NASDAQ improve slightly in afternoon trading, but the blue chips were hurt by nervousness ahead of tomorrow`s Employment Cost Index report. The Dow Industrial Average tumbled to a closing loss of 183.49 points-that`s 1.7 percent-now stands at 10,516.48. In today`s 176-point trading range, the Dow closed down 176 points from the best level of the session right at the low. The NASDAQ Composite finished with a loss of  41.85, at 3,987.72. In its 96-point trading range, the Composite settled only 15 points below its best level of the day, up 81 points from the low. So little recovery there. 

 Trading volume on the big board volume moved over i.1 billion shares, well up from yesterday, and about a 7 to 4 ratio of down volume over up volume. 

 The Dow Transports Index down nearly 9 points. 

 Utilities fell almost 5 points. 

 And the Closing Tick, however, was a feasibly bullish +168. 

 Standard & Poor`s 500 down just over 22. 

 11 1/4-point drop in the 100. 

 The MidCap 400 off 1.41. 

 The Bridge Futures Price Index edged up 0.21. 

 New York Stock Exchange Composite down exactly 7 3/4 points. 

 The Value Line Index down 1 7/8. 

 And the Russell2000 fell just over 1/2 point. 

 The Wilshire 5000 dropping 173 1/3 points. 

 It was a quiet day for the bond market, but prices held their own quite well, despite plenty of caution prior that release of the second-quarter Employment Cost Index tomorrow, which is closely watched, by the way, by the Federal Reserve. Also causing hesitation, Friday`s estimate of second-quarter gross domestic product. The main positive for bonds appeared to be flight-to-safety buying in reaction to the broad sell-off in stocks. 

 Tax-free and corporate issues ended mostly unchanged, but the Treasury market managed to post small gains. 

 The 5-year notes rising 2/32. 

 The 10-year notes up 1/32. 

 And the 30-year bond gained 1/32 as well. 

 And the Lehman Brothers Long Treasury Bond Index actually fell a little bit, down 0.21. 

 I`ll be back shortly to show you where the action was on Wall Street today. Linda? 

 O`BRYON: Well, Paul, shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) fell sharply late today after the company posted after the bell earnings numbers showing more red ink. The Internet giant lost $0.33 a share in the second quarter. That was better than analysts` forecasts of a $0.35 loss, but worse than the year ago number. Amazon`s stock has been on a roller coaster on investor concerns about profitability and an analyst report last month that cast doubt on its creditworthiness. The company says that claim was "hogwash." Meanwhile, Amazon closed the regular session at 36 1/16, but after hours shares traded as low as $0.32. 

 KANGAS: Meanwhile, trading higher today, the shares of DaimlerChrysler (DAJ). The nation`s number three auto maker beat the Street in the second quarter with earnings nearly 20 percent better than last year. But the company also cautioned things are expected to stall in the near future. 

 Diane Eastabrook reports. 

 DIANE EASTABROOK, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: Mercedes Benz was the primary driver of DaimlerChrysler`s profits in the second quarter. The company earned $1.66 a share, $0.14 better than Wall Street projected. As expected, DaimlerChrysler issued a profit warning for the second half of the year. But analysts say the warning was old news to investors, who sent the stock price higher today based on the company`s second quarter performance. 

 JOHN CASESA, AUTO ANALYST, MERRILL LYNCH: The Chrysler part of DaimlerChrysler was down only 12 percent in operating profits. We thought it would be down a little bit more. And Mercedes was up more than we expected. So the second quarter was a little better, the second half still looks pretty cloudy. 

 EASTABROOK: What is clouding the picture for DaimlerChrysler is a glut of minivans on U.S. dealer lots. At the end of June, the company`s minivan inventory was nearly 50 percent higher than it was the same time last year and substantially higher than similar product inventories for G.M. (GM) and Ford (F). While DaimlerChrysler still dominates the minivan segment, tough competition from imports like Honda (HMC) is eroding the auto maker`s market share. Analysts say the new Plymouth Voyager due in showrooms next month will help DaimlerChrysler maintain its hold on the minivan segment, but they also admit this is a segment with limited potential. 

 RICHARD BROEREN, AUTO ANALYST, BANK OF AMERICA: I think it`s mature. I don`t think you`ll see a growth, the levels of growth that you saw. But I don`t think it`s a declining market. 

 EASTABROOK: Analysts say DaimlerChrysler`s future hinges on exciting, new products like the P.T. Cruiser and many believe the company`s overall prospects look good. 

 CASEA: If you look at the next four model years, the company, by our estimates, will replace 94 percent of its volume with entirely new product. 

 EASTABROOK: Both Broeren and Casesa expect DaimlerChrysler`s stock to remain at its current level until at least the end of this year. But they think the stock could get a pop early next year once the company starts rolling out more new products. 

 Diane Eastabrook, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Chicago. 

 O`BRYON: Microsoft (MSFT) is asking the Supreme Court to leave its anti-trust appeal to a lower court, saying the case is too large and too complex for the high court. Instead, the software giant wants a federal appeals court to review the verdict and government breakup plan. The government lawyers who sued Microsoft want it to go straight to the Supreme Court. The high court isn`t expected to decide until at least September whether it will take the case. Meanwhile, Microsoft meeting with analysts tomorrow. The number one issue for analysts isn`t the legal case, but the outlook for personal computer sales. 

 ART RUSSELL, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST, EDWARD JONES: Well, I think the thing that we need to see to get this stock moving again is going to be some pickup in corporate PC demand and some evidence that Windows 2000 is having an impact in the marketplace. 

 O`BRYON: Microsoft is telling analysts to expect a 15 percent earnings growth rate in the coming year. 

 The battle lines are drawn tonight between the country`s major accounting firms and the regulators who keep an eye on them. The battlefield, an SEC proposal that limits industry consulting activity. As Darren Gersh explains, in the first public hearing on the issue, neither side shows signs of backing down. 

 DARREN GERSH, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT CORRESPONDENT: How seriously does Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt take the issue of auditor independence? Very seriously. 

 ARTHUR LEVITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES & EXCHANGE COMMISSION: In recent years, whole economies around the world have faltered because of lax standards and inadequate attention to the fundamentals of high quality financial reporting. 

 GERSH: And it`s that high quality reporting, Levitt argues, that independent auditors safeguard. But regulators are concerned accounting firms now make much of their money by selling consulting services to the companies they audit. The SEC fears that raises the perception of a conflict of interest as auditors become cross sellers and marketers of business and advisory services. 

 JOHN COFFEE, SECURITIES LAW PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: And to the extent that happens, he becomes much more deferential to management and much more willing possibly to bend the numbers a little. 

 GERSH: So the SEC is proposing new rules that would effectively bar auditors from making investments in the firms they audit. Also proposed, limiting the services an accounting firm can provide to clients it audits. The accounting industry has mounted a fierce lobbying effort against the new rules, warning if adopted, they would make audits more expensive. Providing consulting services, the industry says, also helps auditors learn more about the companies they review. 

 RICHARD MILLER, GENERAL COUNSEL, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS: It was actually an aid in performing audits, doing non-audit services, because it provided them knowledge and a knowledge base about their clients that they gained in another environment. 

 GERSH: Accounting firms say their internal controls prevent any conflicts and call this a non-issue. 

 ROBERT GARLAND, PARTNER, DELOITTE & TOUCHE: And it would be very dangerous for us to take on the considerable risks that I believe the proposed rule would present. To me it would be like doing radical surgery on a healthy patient. 

 GERSH: The accounting industry has recruited some powerful allies. 21 members of Congress recently sent a letter to the SEC warning the agency against a rush to judgment as it considers new rules on the firms that watch over the nation`s books. 

 Darren Gersh, NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT, Washington. 

 KANGAS: Well, there was no accounting for some of the moves we saw on Wall Street today. But most of the down moves were due to concern about future earnings, the Dow losing 183 1/2 points or 1.7 percent of its value. For every 14 stocks up there were almost 15 down. But 90 new highs for the year and only 78 new lows. 

 LSI Logic (LSI) topped the active list on 33.4 million shares, losing 33 percent of its value. After the company`s second quarter earnings at $0.29 were in line with estimates but revenues lower than expected, Bear Stearns, Salomon Smith Barney, to mention a few, lowered their expectations, cut their ratings on the stock. 

 Compaq Computer (CPQ), on the other hand, up 1 3/4. As we reported after the close yesterday, second quarter earnings of $0.21, in line with estimates. Today, Bear Stearns upgraded it from "attractive" to "buy." Hambrecht & Quist upgraded it from "buy" to a "strong buy." 

 Poor Xerox (XRX), down 3 1/4, another new low, another earnings warning about the second half even though second quarter earnings came in at $0.30, in line with estimates. 

 Pfizer (PFE) dropped 5/8. 

 AT&T (T) losing 1 13/16, fifth in volume. 

 NorTel Networks (NT), which had earnings better than expected out yesterday, up 1 3/8. 

 G.E. (GE) down 1 11/16. 

 Rite Aid (RAD) losing a 1/4. 

 Lucent Technologies (LU) down 1 5/16. 

 And Circuit City (CC) down 2 1/4 after dropping 6 1/2 yesterday on the company`s forecast of much lower than expected second quarter earnings of $0.32. The Street was expecting $0.43. 

 AON Corporation (AOC) or AON, down, or I mean up almost 3 points. The story here, Merrill Lynch upgraded it from "accumulate" to a "near term buy." Bear Stearns upgraded it from "attractive" to "buy." 

 Anheuser Busch (BUD) up 1/8 near the close of trading today. Second quarter earnings $1.04, up from $0.90, $0.02 above expectations. And also, Anheuser said a 2 for 1 stock split and a 10 percent boost in the quarterly dividend to $0.33 per share. 

 Hershey Foods (HSY) up 2 5/16. Second quarter earnings $0.29, in lien with estimates. 

 Kimberly Clark (KMB) up 2 11/16. Second quarter earnings $0.81, up from $0.72. That was a penny above expectations. Salomon Smith Barney upgraded it from "outperform" to "buy." 

 McDonald`s (MCD) up 1 13/16. As we reported yesterday, a little better than expected earnings. Today, J.P. Morgan and Bank America Brokerages upgraded their stocks` opinions. 

 And National Semiconductor (NSM) down 3 3/4. No specific news, just caught in the downdraft of the semiconductor group. 

 Chemfab (CFA), the star of the day, up 7 5/16 on news it`ll be acquired by a French firm, Sangobah (ph) for $18.25 a share in cash. 

 Brilliance China Automotive (CBA) up 5 5/16. No specific news today, but the Chinese stocks on the big board have been getting plenty of buying recently. 

 Norfolk Southern (NSC) up almost 2 points. Second quarter earnings, $0.30, up from $0.20 last year and revenues up a massive 32 percent. Alex Brown upgraded it from "market perform" to "buy." 

 Big loser, Novacorp (NIS) of Georgia, down 7 7/16. Yesterday, we noted that it was down 3 3/4 but no one available at the company to talk to us today. A spokesman warned second quarter revenues will be lower than expected. 

 Quantum Hard Disk Drive Group (HDD) down 3 3/16. First quarter earnings $0.19, up from a loss last year, but Salomon still downgraded it from "buy" to "neutral." Prudential cut its 2001 earnings estimate from $0.71 a share to just break even. 

 Finova Group (FNV) down 2 13/16, lower earnings second quarter, $0.69, down from last year`s $0.83. 

 NASDAQ trading, almost a 42 point loss there. Volume was about 1.3 billion, 15 stocks up for every 23 down. 

 JDS Uniphase (JDSU) topped the active list, up 5 3/4. Just after the close, JDS reported fourth quarter earnings $0.14, up from last year`s $0.06, $0.02 above the Street estimate. Standard & Poor`s 500 adds a new member after the close today. It`s JDS. 

 And of course, that`s buying SDL (SDLI), which dropped 9 5/16. 

 Intel (INTC) down 1 7/8. 

 Cisco Systems (CSCO) up 7/16. 

 A 9/16 gain in Sun Microsystems (SUNW). 

 And then we see Microsoft (MSFT) losing 1 3/16. 

 Applied Materials (AMAT) down 2 5/8. 

 Dell Computer (DELL) managed a 1/16 point gain. 

 Broadcom (BRCM) up 1 7/16 and 10th in volume. 

 Oracle (ORCL) gained 3/4. 

 Gemini Genomics (GMNI) went public today. It`s a British company. Six million ADRs offered at 14, opened at 15, the high of the day 22 3/8. 

 Ask Jeeves (ASKJ) up 4 7/16. After the close yesterday reported a smaller than expected second quarter loss of $0.51, $0.05 better than expectations. Today, First Union upgraded it from "buy" to a "strong buy." 

 And Remedy Corp. (RMDY) couldn`t find one to stop the selling today, down 19 and a large fraction. Second quarter earnings, $0.29, a penny above expectations. But revenues below estimates. Hambrecht and Quist downgraded it and so did Bank of America. 

 The American Exchange Index up almost 5 points. 

 Keane Incorporated (KEA) up 3 3/16. Second quarter earnings lower, $0.11 versus $0.37 last year, but the company noted that the second quarter was better than the first and ended a string of six consecutive quarters of lower revenues. It`s also going to buy back 2 million shares. 

 And AO Smith (SMC) down 4 points, the big percentage loser. No officials available to account for that. 

 The Index Shares all on the down side today. 

 And finally in the spotlight after the close, InfoSpace (INSP) says it plans to acquire Go2net (GNET) for $4 billion in stock, 1.82 shares of InfoSpace for each share of Go2net. 

 That`s the Wall Street Wrap Up. Linda? 

 O`BRYON: Well, Paul, four United States air carriers are in the running tonight for new air routes from the U.S. to China. The Department of Transportation is about to decide which airline will get the flights, a lucrative prospect given China`s thriving economy. Georgia Public Broadcasting Reporter Hamilton Northcutt explains. 

 WILLIAM RIS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT/GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, AMERICAN AIRLINES: The airline that is awarded this service is going to get a foot in the door in the biggest market, potential market, in the world. 

 HAMILTON NORTHCUTT, GEORGIA PUBLIC BROADCASTING: That`s why American Airlines, along with Delta (DAL), UPS (UPS) and west coast cargo carrier Polar Express are all so eager to fly the 10 new weekly round trip flights to China. In a new air services treaty struck with the U.S. last spring, China agreed to the added route. Now the Department of Transportation must award the lucrative flights to a single airline. 

 D. SCOTT YOHE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, DELTA AIRLINES: We`re serving the biggest strongest market in a region of the country that has no service today. 

 NORTHCUTT: Delta wants to create service from Atlanta to New York and then nonstop to Beijing. Their primary argument is there`s currently no non-stop service from the east coast to China. Delta would fill a huge void. Another selling point, their route would reduce flight time to China for east coast travelers by up to 7 hours. American Airlines proposes nonstop flights from Chicago to Shanghai, geographically the shortest route. 

 RIS: Shanghai is the place where virtually all business passengers want to go. For the business community, Shanghai is the focal point in China. 

 NORTHCUTT: Both American and Delta are urging the Department of Transportation to choose a passenger airline over a cargo carrier, saying people will do much more than packages to improve U.S.-China relations and create cultural ties. UPS (UPS) counters that strategy by projecting tremendous economic benefits if the DOT decides in their favor. 

 TAD SEGAL, PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIR./WASHINGTON, UNITED PARCEL SERVICE: We will be able to increase U.S. trade with China by about $8.7 billion dollars in four years. We expect to lower the U.S.-China trade deficit by around 4 billion in four years. 

 NORTHCUTT: UPS is itching to compete with Federal Express (FDX), which already flies to China. Northwest (NWAC) and United (UAL) currently provide passenger service. The Department of Transportation is expected to announce its decision soon, possibly by the end of this month and more likely sometime in August. Which ever airline wins, the highly coveted route will be authorized to begin the new flights to China in April of 2001. I`m Hamilton Northcutt in Atlanta for NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT. 

 KANGAS: Tomorrow, what`s up with Sun, Sun Microsystems (SUNW)? We talk with its chairman, Scott McNealy. 

 O`BRYON: The popular Internet music download site Napster is facing the music this afternoon in a California federal courtroom. Major record labels are trying to pull the plug temporarily on the controversial site. Napster lets users search for music on other computers` hard drives and download them for free. The music industry claims that constitutes copyright infringement and amounts to piracy. The case could have broad implications for similar sites on the Web. 

 KANGAS: drkoop.com (KOOP) has another chance at getting off life support. A second Internet company specializing in medical information is offering to take over the ailing Web site. Details weren`t disclosed, but Undertherapy.com is offering drkoop a "substantive offer with an immediate cash infusion." Last week, Millennium Health offered to merge with drkoop.com. The shares of drkoop today fell 3/16 to close at 1 3/4. 

 O`BRYON: In tonight`s money file tonight, the death of a tax. Here`s Terry Savage, author of "The Savage Truth On Money." 

 TERRY SAVAGE, AUTHOR, "THE SAVAGE TRUTH ON MONEY": Remember the old saying, nothing is sure but death and taxes? Well, these days the death tax might not be so sure after all. Astoundingly, both parties in Congress have joined to take the first step in eliminating what used to be called the estate tax. Well, maybe it`s the change of name to the more appropriate death tax that awakened the politicians ire, or maybe it`s the dawning realization that many of their voting constituents and even the politicians themselves are likely to be subject to this tax in its current form. 

 Rising real estate prices and rising stock prices are putting more and more middle class families` estates within reach of the tax collector. Think about it. Your estate is everything you own, your house, cars, investments, retirement plan assets and even life insurance if you own it yourself. As recently as a decade ago, most retirees were still covered by traditional pension plans, a check a month for life, nothing after death. 

 But today Americans have more than $3 trillion in self-directed retirement plans, 401Ks and IRA rollovers, and all of those growing plan assets are included in your estate. For many people, the current $675,000 exclusion, or even the $1 million exclusion level that will be reached in 2006, will still leave a small fortune to be taxed at death. Well, they say you can`t take it with you. But at least it`s looking more likely that you won`t have to leave it to the government either. 

 I`m Terry Savage. 

 KANGAS: Recapping today`s market action, red ink on wall Street. The Dow fell 183 points and the NASDAQ Index lost almost 42. 

 And please join us at our World Wide Web site, NBR.com, or on America Online, keyword: NBR. 

 O`BRYON: Finally tonight, there are lots of winners on Wall Street, but one very special winner visited the New York Stock Exchange today. Two time Tour de France cycling champion Lance Armstrong rang the closing bell at the big board this afternoon, wrapping up a day long tour of New York City. The world`s premiere cyclist, who faced and beat testicular cancer, says he`s looking forward to winning again, this time at the Olympics in Sydney next month. And Armstrong says he`s just a regular guy from Texas who likes to ride his bike, Paul. 

 KANGAS: In the same sense that Tiger Woods is just a regular guy that likes to play an occasional round of golf. Yeah. 

 O`BRYON: Right. Right. Well, that`s NIGHTLY BUSINESS REPORT for Wednesday, July 26th. I`m Linda O`Bryon. Good night, everyone. And good night to you, too, Paul. 

 KANGAS: Good night, Linda. I`m Paul Kangas wishing all of you the best of good buys.

 UPDATE 2-DaimlerChrysler profit pressured, seeks cost  cut . 

 By Neil Winton, European Auto Correspondent

 STUTTGART, Germany, July 26 (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG, announcing stronger second quarter net income but warning full year operating profit would be pressured, said on Wednesday it planned to cut costs by six billion euros and cut administration expenses by 25 percent by 2003. 

 The German-American automotive giant also pledged to boost its share price which has languished since the merger in 1998, and which has slid about 20 percent this year from a high of 74 euros in January. 

 Chrysler, the north American part of the company which has been forced to spend large sums to retain market share with price cuts and incentives, would be under less pressure next year because of slew of new models. The record-breaking U.S. car market, said by some analysts to be about to drop, would be about unchanged next year at around 17 million, the group said. 

 DaimlerChrysler first half figures were ahead of forecasts for the half year but failed to impress a wary market, which had been on the watch for a profit warning. 

 The company's stock slipped almost two percent to 55.30 euros in the wake of the 2000 prognosis, which followed intense media speculation the firm would rein in forecasts. But the share recovered to trade 0.60 euros higher at 56.80 late in the session. 

 "In the operating (profit) business we will not fully match last year's level," warned DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Juergen Schrempp in a statement. 

 Schrempp told a news conference that Chrysler would see its operating income improve in the fourth quarter although it would be pressured in the third quarter. But the group was confident that its new "attractive product model mix will lead to renewed earnings improvement". 

 The group recently announced it would take a controlling stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Motors and Schrempp said that this deal would be signed on Friday. 

 NET INCOME RISES 

 DaimlerChrysler, the world's number five automaker, announced that second quarter net income advanced 18 percent to 1.7 billion euros ($1.598 billion) and earnings per share rose to 1.74 euros from 1.48 euros a year ago. 

 A survey of five analysts by First Call had put second quarter net profit at $1.51 billion or $1.51 a share 

 For the half year, sales of 84.7 billion euros were ahead of market forecasts for an 82.4 billion euro outcome. 

 DaimlerChrysler reported that operating profit in its Chrysler division slipped to 2.516 billion euros from 2.778 billion euros a year ago. The group said its Mercedes cars operations saw operating profit rise in the six months to 1.344 billion euros from 1.147 billion euros. 

 Analyst opinions on the figures were initially divided. 

 ANALYSTS DIVIDED 

 One analyst in London who requested anonymity, was unimpressed by DaimlerChrysler's upbeat presentation 

 "Good performance? you must be joking. Revenues have gone up but they still can't make any money," this analyst said. 

 "Revenues were 17 percent up, but operating income was basically flat. I can't believe they can be so optimistic. The USA looks like a disaster, he said. 

 But Juergen Pieper of Bankhaus Metzler in Frankfurt was more upbeat. 

 "It's a clear positive that DaimlerChrysler made a positive forecast for the Chrysler business in 2001. The half year figures were no surprise," Pieper said. 

 At the press conference, Schrempp said DaimlerChrysler would improve efficiency by six billion euros by 2003, and cut 25 percent from administrative costs over the same period. This would mean job cuts, but he declined to say how many. 

 Asked how the company would improve the share price, Schrempp said this would happen as the strategy unfolded. 

 "Now we will bring our alliances to life and utilize our superior competitive advantage as a basis for profitable growth," Schrempp said. 

 PRESSURE ON CHRYSLER TO EASE 

 James Holden, member of the management board responsible for the Chrysler brand, said the pressure in north America would lessen towards the end of this year as new products like the Stratus sedan and Sebring coupe were introduced. The new Jeep Cherokee would be a big plus and would help to usher an era of what he called "margin opportunity and marketing expense opportunity". 

 Holden said the north American market would retain its strength in 2001. 

 "The market will be relatively stable. There's a lot of competition. But for the last two years the outcome has been considerably underestimated. It's 17 million plus now. We expect something in that range for the 2001 calendar year," Holden told a questioner.

 NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its 2001 earnings estimate on BMC Software Inc. on Wednesday, a day after the company reported sharply lower first quarter earnings and warned it expects revenues for the rest of the year to be flat. 

 - Analyst Rick Sherlund cut its 2001 earnings estimate to $1.43 a share from $2.15 with a market outperformer rating. 

 - The company's first quarter operating earnings totalled $49.9 million, or 20 cents a share, beating Wall Street's previously lowered forecast of 19 cents. Before the company issued a profit warning earlier this month, the estimate had been 46 cents a share. ((New York Newsroom, 212-859-1700)).

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- An uneven earnings performance cost technology stocks more ground, and left market averages lower again Wednesday. 

 LSI Logic slumped sharply after Wall Street pilloried the Milpitas, Calif., semiconductor supplier's second-quarter profit statement. Released late Tuesday, the report showed the company matched Wall Street's profit target for the quarter, but posted revenues that fell short of forecasts, prompting a host of analysts to turn critical of the stock. 

 LSI shares closed Tuesday in 4 p.m. primary trading at 48 13/16, slid to 40 1/2 in afterhours composite trading that day, then declined further Wednesday, ending at 32 3/4. 

 Shares of Rambus declined 9 7/16 to 75 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after Intel indicated it planned to use other memory technology in its upcoming Pentium 4 processor, rather than rely on Rambus as the sole technology provider. That put more pressure on the vulnerable semiconductor sector. 

 Internet stocks also struggled, with Amazon.com down 1 9/16 to 36 1/16 on Nasdaq, near its 52-week low of 32 15/32 set June 23, after Lehman Brothers lowered its rating on the stock to a neutral from a buy ahead of the release of the online retailer's second-quarter profits, due out after the close Wednesday. The firm said the company is exposed to near-term execution risks. 

 Meanwhile, Xerox scattered more bad news around the computer hardware sector after the printer maker issued another earnings warning. Shares of hardware names like Hewlett-Packard, which fell 5 3/8 to 110, and International Business Machines, which lost 1 7/8 to 109 7/8 on the NYSE, posted sharp losses, though Compaq Computer managed to ride its own upbeat profit news, and upbeat comments from PaineWebber, to a gain on the day, up 1 3/4 at 29 3/16. 

 In fact, there was enough good news floating around the technology sector that it kept the Nasdaq Composite Index's loss to relatively tame 41.65 points, a loss of 1.03%, at 3987.92. 

 The index got some measure of support from the rush to trade JDS Uniphase ahead of the optical components maker's entry in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, which was slated to take place after the close of trading Wednesday. The stock ended 4 51/64 higher at 134 63/64 on Nasdaq, after approximately 147 million shares changed hands. The single-issue one-day volume record, though - the 171 million shares of Oracle that traded in December 1997 - wasn't bested. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10516.48, down 183.49. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,371 issues advancing, 1,477 declining and 511 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,170,840,260 shares, compared with 961,835,000 Tuesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 644.81, down 7.75. The average price per share fell 47 cents. 

 Index funds also sold some of the biggest blue-chip names in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index to accommodate the addition of JDS Uniphase. The optics maker had a market cap of approximately $103 billion, as of Tuesday's close; it replaced Rite Aid, a company with a market cap of approximately $1.6 billion. 

 The selling pressure affecting blue-chip prices on the close of the session showed up in the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which finished on its low of the session, down 183.49, or 1.71%, at 10516.48. 

 Anticipation of Thursday's release of a key piece of inflation data, the quarterly employment cost index reading covering the second quarter of the year, made investors anxious about some rate-sensitive growth and financial stocks. 

 Just a week earlier, investors had rallied the market on relief from the interest-rate overhang, as Wall Street adopted an upbeat interpretation of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony to a Senate committee on July 20. 

 "The market has bumped into some valuation concerns, as investors decide that, over the short term, we have already seen all the good news we're going to see," Robert Harrington, head of listed equity trading at PaineWebber. 

 Shares of J.P. Morgan, lofted recently by speculation about the possibility it could be caught in the financial sector's consolidation wave, gave up 5 to 131 3/16. Merrill Lynch declined 4 1/16 to 127 3/4. Chase Manhattan lost 2 1/4 to 49. 

 Traditional growth names, such as General Electric, down 1 11/16 at 52 3/16, AT&T, which bumped 2% higher Tuesday following a better-than-expected profit performance, fell 1 1/2 to 32 1/2, a loss of 4%, while Lucent Technologies, which has struggled recently, trading at its 52-week low, lost 1 1/2 to 48 1/4. 

 Insurance stocks rose sharply in the session, amid signs the pricing environment for the sector has improved, after an extended period of weakness. Shares of Aon, the Chicago insurance provider, gained 2 15/16 to 35 7/16 after Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns boosted ratings on the stock. 

 Hartford Financial, which paced a rally of its own Tuesday, gained another 3 1/16 to 64 1/2, breaking to a new 52-week high in price. Likewise, Chubb reached a 52-week high, up 2 7/16 to 74 5/16, while St. Paul gained 2 3/8 to 42 1/2, and its own high for the year, helped by an upgrade by Salomon Smith Barney. 

 Marsh & McLennan gained 5/8 to 115 9/16. The New York insurance and financial-services concern reported second-quarter results that matched forecasts. The stock traded at a 52-week high. 

 Nova fell 7 7/16 to 11 13/16. The Atlanta provider of credit-card transaction services warned that its second-quarter revenue won't be as strong as analysts anticipated, blaming, in part, what the company described as a disappointing performance from two large portfolios it acquired. 

 Allergan gained 11/16 to 70 1/2 on the NYSE, after a big intraday spike carried shares to 74 3/4. The Irvine, Calif., maker of eye- and skin-care products reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's projections. Separately, the company said it formed an alliance with the Vistakon division of Johnson & Johnson to expand products and services in the contact lens market. 

 Johnson & Johnson eased 3 1/4 to 90 1/4. 

 Energy stocks struggled in a tough session for blue-chip names. Shares of Exxon Mobil gained 1/2 to 75 7/8, after J.P. Morgan raised its rating on the stock to strong buy from outperform. J.P. Morgan also boosted its rating on Chevron, which ended unchanged at 77 5/16. 

 Triton Energy climbed 3 1/8 to 38 1/2. Dain Rauscher raised its rating on the Dallas energy exploration and production concern, which said Tuesday that its fifth well in a field off the coast of Equatorial Guinea could prove to be the most important in the field. 

 Shares of McDonald's, trading near a 52-week low, withstood some pessimistic comments from Wall Street. Lehman Brothers adopted what it called a more conservative stance on the fast-food operator, lowered its 2000 earnings estimates for the company. Merrill Lynch also cut its earnings estimates on the company. Still, the stock, which rose 3.5% Tuesday after the company posted weak second-quarter profits, gained another 1 13/16 to 33 on the NYSE. 

 Circuit City continued to decline, off 2 1/4 at 23 7/8, after Tuesday's 20% loss; shares slipped to another 52-week low. The Richmond, Va., consumer electronics retailer Tuesday said it would stop selling appliances and would overhaul its stores. 

 Oxford Health gained 2 15/16 to 24 5/8 on Nasdaq. The Trumbull, Conn., health-care plan sponsor reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, prompting PaineWebber to boost its rating and its target price on the stock. 

 Kimberly-Clark gained 2 11/16 to 59 3/4. The Dallas consumer products maker posted second-quarter results that topped forecasts. 

 T. Rowe Price fell 1 3/4 to 42 3/8 on Nasdaq. Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on the Baltimore financial-services concern, even though the company's earnings, released Tuesday, beat forecasts. 

 Shares of Nortel moved after a strong second-quarter performance. After the close of trading Tuesday, the Canadian telecommunications-equipment maker reported operating profits that topped forecasts, and increased its growth projections for this year. The stock ended Tuesday's 4 p.m. primary trading session at 82 1/2, climbed to 87 in after-hours composite trading that day, then moved back down to 83 7/8 Wednesday. Credit Suisse First Boston called the name the firm's top pick in the sector. 

 Electronic Arts gained 9 13/16 to 86 5/8 on Nasdaq. The Redwood City, Calif., entertainment software developer reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss in a statement issued after the close of trading Tuesday. 

 Fairchild Semiconductor acquitted itself pretty well, on a relative performance basis. The South Portland, Maine, chip maker limited its decline to 7/8, ending at 37 5/8, in a session where most semiconductor stocks suffered steeper declines. Credit Suisse First Boston boosted its rating on the Fairchild, adding the stock to its Focus List, after the company reported better-than-expected second-quarter results late Tuesday. 

 Keane gained 3 3/16 to 22 3/4. The Boston computer consulting firm end a string of six quarters of revenue declines, as its second-quarter results showed a slight improvement over first-quarter totals. 

 Vignette fell 4 7/8 to 38 3/4 on Nasdaq. The Austin, Texas, provider of electronic-commerce applications lost ground after its second-quarter results, issued late Tuesday, beat forecasts, but its balance sheet showed a sharp increase in collectibles. 

 New Focus fell 29 5/8 to 124 7/16 on Nasdaq. The Santa Clara, Calif., maker of fiber-optics products, which has had a volatile trading pattern recently amid an increased appetite for fiber-optics stocks by investors, reported a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss after the close of trading Tuesday. The company also said it planned to offer 3.5 million shares of common stock in a public offering.

 RICHMOND, Va. -- Circuit City Group said Tuesday that it will close eight distribution centers and cut 1,000 jobs, or 1.7% of its work force, as it remodels most superstores and quits selling appliances. 

 The nation's second-largest consumer-electronics chain also said earnings for its fiscal second quarter will fall far below estimates, pushing its shares down as much as 23%. 

 Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City said it expects earnings of 32 cents, excluding a charge of $30 million, or 9 cents, to close distribution centers for the quarter ending Aug. 30. That's below the 43-cent average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. It earned 35 cents in the year-ago quarter. 

 Circuit City's same-store sales in the second quarter for consumer electronics and home-office products are increasing in the high single digits, while appliance sales have been negative, Chief Executive Alan McCollough said. Same-store sales exclude sales from new or closed stores. 

 "We want to have a consumer-electronics business without any distractions," McCollough told analysts and investors in a conference call. 

 Shares of Circuit City fell $6.38 to close at $26.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading after dropping to $25.25. The stock already had fallen 28% this year. 

 "Appliances are the short-term reason, but the real reason for the problems is an aging store base they haven't remodeled and a nimble competitor in Best Buy," the largest U.S. retailer of consumer electronics, said John Glass, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, who Tuesday cut his Circuit City rating to "market perform" from "strong buy." 

 The cost of store remodelings will be at least $1 billion, Glass said. The company said it will take three years to remodel its superstores.

 Alcatel Q2 operating seen up sharply.

 PARIS, July 25 (Reuters) - French telecoms equipment maker Alcatel is expected to unveil a sharp rise in second quarter operating profit on Thursday helped by better cost control and growth in its three key sectors, analysts said. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters said they expected second quarter operating profit to come in at 530 to 555 million euros, up from 113 million euros last year, and the company to beat its own full year forecasts for operating profit. 

 "Alcatel's management has been overly cautious. There's good news ahead," said Christophe Quarante, a KBC Securities analyst. 

 At the start of the year Alcatel said it was targeting 2000 operating profit of two billion euros, up from 1.275 billion in 1999, and an operating margin of 6.5 percent. 

 However analysts polled by Reuters on average predicted full-year operating profit of 2.2 billion euros and an operating margin of 7.3 to 7.6 percent. 

 "Networks are seeing a rebound in activity thanks to broad band transmission and in general there is an environment of growth," said an analyst at a large Paris brokerage. 

 Analysts said that besides growth in activity for networks, Internet and fibre optics, and demand from corporates and individuals, Alcatel's February acquisition of Canadian network specialist Newbridge Networks would also start to bear fruit. 

 CSFB said it expected Newbridge to contribute up to 225 million euros to turnover in the second quarter and to add 32 million euros to EBIT (earnings before interest and tax). 

 Overall, analysts said they expected Alcatel's second quarter turnover to rise about 20 percent, with forecasts ranging from 6.9 to 7.2 billion euros, up from 6.12 billion in the first three months and 5.77 in the second quarter of 1999. 

 The figures will still include Alcatel's cable business. It plans to spin off this activity, mainly cables for the energy sector, in the fourth quarter but will keep fibre optics. 

 CCF Securities analyst Pascal Mathieu, who is predicting operating profit of 530 million euros and sales of 7.191 billion, was not expecting the results to reveal any surprises. 

 "I'm forecasting an operating margin of 7.3 percent for the second quarter and for the year as a whole," he said. 

 STILL LAGGING COMPETITORS 

 But despite recent improvements Alcatel's operating margin, which was 5.5 percent in 1999, lags its major competitors. 

 Ericsson has an operating margin of about 11.7 percent, Nortel Networks one of 13 percent, Lucent Technologies Inc. 18 percent, Nokia 19 percent and Cisco Systems' about 27 percent. 

 Analysts said Alcatel needed to prove its mettle in the high-earning sector of mobile Internet networks, especially with the explosion of online ventures, and should be looking for an operating margin in double digits in two to three years. 

 Despite Alcatel's relative underperformance on operating margin, investors have piled into the company's shares of late. 

 Analysts welcomed Alcatel's repositioning as a pure telecoms player and were less wary of the firm, which stunned the market with an unexpected profit warning in September 1998, slashing its market value by 38 percent in one day. 

 Shares in Alcatel, the third largest company on the Paris stock market with a market capitalisation of 90 billion euros, rallied to 80.05 euros on Monday, just shy of a record 82.8 euros hit on July 17. The shares have gained more than 75 percent since the beginning of the year. ((David Clarke, Paris newsroom, tel +33 1 4221 5542, fax +33 1 4236 1072, paris.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Markets across the Americas finished mostly higher Tuesday, with Mexican shares ending higher for the first time in six sessions and Toronto's main index finishing at a record. But stocks closed sharply lower in Brazil. 

 Earlier, European stock markets finished mixed, as London's key index notched a modest advance, but shares closed moderately lower in Paris, Stockholm and Madrid. Frankfurt stocks ended little changed. 

 Asian markets finished mostly lower. 

 In Mexico City, the IPC index rose 57.43, or 0.9%, to 6715.60. Shares of Mexico's largest financial group, Banamex-Accival, or Banacci, led gainers after reporting on-target second-quarter earnings on Monday after the market closed. Banamex also took a second-quarter charge of 8.43 billion pesos ($901.8 million) to cover all contingent liabilities linked to the transfer of past-due loans to Mexican bank bailout trust Fobaproa, finally cleaning up its balance sheets after a costly government bank bailout in 1994. Banacci O shares rose 5.4%, and its L shares gained 5%. 

 In Toronto, the TSE Composite index rose 83.59, or 0.8%, to 10867.07. Nortel Networks gained 2.8% after announcing a five-year, $2 billion contract to upgrade British Telecommunications' core national network. 

 Those markets got underlying support from Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 15 points, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 48 points, or 1.2%, recouping part of Monday's 113-point loss. 

 In Brazil, the Bovespa index dropped 336.56, or 1.9%, to end at 17049.42 on profit taking following three straight days of gains. 

 The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index in London rose 9.4 points, or 0.2%, to 6390.7. 

 Pharmaceutical stocks made gains throughout the session. SmithKline Beecham finished 2.2% higher as it released its last set of financial results before the merger with Glaxo Wellcome. SmithKline posted higher-than-expected profit of 1.06 billion pounds. 

 However, the company announced that its merger with Glaxo Wellcome, which closed 2.7% higher, has been delayed until September. 

 The CAC-40 index index in Paris closed down 38.66, or 0.6%, to 6463.91. 

 "It's a general malaise in the market, and investors are either waiting for summer to be over to start trading or a big piece of positive news," an analyst at a United Kingdom brokerage said. "The Concorde crash also hurt the French market." 

 Shares in Air France Group fell following the crash of an Air France Concorde in the outskirts of Paris Tuesday. At the French market's close, Air France shares were suspended after losing 10%. 

 In Frankfurt, the Xetra DAX Index edged up 0.73 point to close at 7329.04. 

 Stockholm's SX General Index dropped 59.84, or 1%, to end at 5889.58. 

 Swedish mobile phone giant Ericsson's profit warning last week continued to weigh on the telecom sector, analysts said. "People aren't buying on expectations as much, and waiting for results from corporate earnings," David Morrison, a trader at Financial Spreads, said. 

 Losses in shares of auto makers such as PSA Peugeot Citreon in Paris and Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG and Volkswagen AG, which reports second-quarter results this week, also kept European markets in check. 

 Madrid's Ibex-35 index slumped 116.90, or 1.1%, to 10714.60. However, main indexes closed slightly higher in Zurich and Milan, while shares in Amsterdam ended mixed. 

 In Tokyo, the blue-chip Nikkei 225 index rose 26.47 points, or 0.2%, to close at 16573.59. Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 7 to 6 on volume estimated at 598.5 million shares, down from 560.8 million shares Monday. However, the Topix index of all the TSE first section issues fell 2.36 points in its sixth straight loss. 

 The Nikkei index dropped about 200 points early in the session on investor bearishness following weakness in New York markets on Monday. But after a round of selling, the Tokyo market erased some of its losses after investors bought selected technology issues, with the Nikkei entering positive territory just before the market's close. 

 In Hong Kong, stocks fell as profit-taking focused on Hutchison Whampoa and China Mobile. However, bank stocks stayed stable ahead of interim results announcements which will start with Bank of East Asia on Wednesday. The Hang Seng index fell 284.35 points, or 1.6%, to close at 17375.34, deepening Monday's 1.5% slump. 

 China Mobile shares fell 3.3%. Analysts traced the stock's decline to the lackluster performance of global telecom shares. Hutchison Whampoa yielded to more selling after dropping 3% in both London and New York as players took profits on confirmation it will make a huge profit from the sale of around 22% in U.S. mobile operator VoiceStream Wireless to Deutsche Telekom. The stock fell 4.2% Tuesday in Hong Kong, and dragged parent company Cheung Kong down as well. The latter ended with a 3.7% loss. 

 In Taipei, Taiwan shares ended below the key 8000 level, as concerns about the competence of the new administration mounted and the New Taiwan dollar continued to slide, analysts and traders said. Market talk about planned mainland China military exercises also hurt sentiment, they added. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed down 163.81 points, or 2%, at 7900.39 in thin trading. 

 The decline came despite efforts by government funds to prop up the bourse, which has fallen for six straight sessions to a seven-month low, dealers said. A statement by Vice Finance Minister Sean Chen on Tuesday that the four big government funds still have some 150 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$4.83 billion) to invest did little to help sentiment, they added. 

 President Chen Shui-bian's new administration has taken a battering since it came to power in late May. First, government officials alarmed investors with a series of contradictory statements on economic policy, and then over the weekend authorities bungled the rescue of four people stranded in a river in southern Taiwan. Early on Tuesday, Premier Tang Fei announced he would remain in his post, but would accept the resignation of Vice-Premier Yu Shyh-kun over the apparent drowning of the four people. 

 In other Asian markets, Singapore shares ended mixed, with the Straits Times Index losing 0.66 point to 2098.30 in subdued dealings ahead of earnings season. DBS Group Holdings and Singapore Telecommunications, which together account for about 18% of the blue-chip index, are expected to announce results this week. 

 In Bangkok, the composite index of the Stock Exchange of Thailand finished up 2.46 points at its high for the day of 295.59 on foreign and institutional buying in blue-chip shares. The Jakarta exchange's JSX Composite Index of Indonesian shares ended down 7.263 points, or 1.4%, at 499.677, as political concerns and fears of a gasoline shortage weighed on sentiment. The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 3.01 points, or 0.4%, to close at 819.88.

 Fiat 1H Earns Seen Up,But Market Worries About Auto Margins

 MILAN -(Dow Jones)- Analysts expect higher earnings and sales from Fiat SpA (FIA) when the automaker posts first-half results Tuesday, but they are cautious about low margins for the auto division and expect losses at its agricultural and industrial machinery unit. 

 Market watchers predict Fiat will post a pretax profit of between EUR491 million and EUR628 million, up from EUR377 million in the first half of 1999. Operating profit should come in between EUR299 million and EUR415 million, up from EUR163 million. Revenues should rise to about EUR30 billion from EUR23.6 billion. 

 Overall, the results should "highlight the disappointing operating development of Fiat," said Markus Pluemer, an analyst with West LB Panmure. "We don't see a positive impetus on the share price." 

 In particular, analysts said they will be looking at margins and overall efficiency at Fiat Auto, which accounts for roughly half of Fiat's revenue and swung to profitability in the fourth quarter of 1999. 

 In the first quarter, Fiat said it was producing the wrong mix of Punto models, providing dealers with too many lower-end cars and not enough higher-end models. Most analysts think that problem has since been resolved. 

 They expect Fiat Auto's operating profit to come in at between EUR69 million and EUR140 million, up from a loss of EUR257 million in the first-half of 1999. Revenues should come be between EUR13.5 billion and EUR13.8 billion, up from EUR12.1 billion. 

 Analysts noted that the auto unit remains in a phase of transition. Just last March, Fiat and General Motors Corp. (GM) formed a strategic alliance, with GM taking 20% in the Auto unit and Fiat a 5.6% stake in GM. 

 Another major concern is agricultural and construction machinery maker CNH Global NV (CNH), which recently issued a profit warning for the second quarter and the full-year before restructuring and acquisition-related costs. Fiat owns 71% of the company, which was formed by the merger of Wisconsin-based Case Corp. and Fiat's New Holland unit. 

 "We are expecting probably a second-quarter loss (at CHN Global)," said Jim Wright, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. 

 Wright said he was just as frustrated with poor first-half numbers at Fiat's car-parts manufacturing unit, Magneti Marelli. Magneti Marelli said Monday that first half pretax profit rose to EUR317 million from EUR100 million. However, the latest half includes one-time gains of EUR334 million due to the sale of its carburetor operations. 

 "We were a shade pessimistic on cars," he said. "But with Magnet Marelli posting a loss, (Fiat) isn't making money on parts either."

        WASHINGTON (FFBN)--As Priceline.com Inc. reported its second-quarter
earnings, causing its shares drop more than 20%, and shares of other
e-commerce companies fell, the Federal Filings Retail Index lost 234.2
points, or 2.6%, to finish at 8833.25 on Monday.
        As most of the subindexes posted losses, losers outnumbered gainers
113 to 47.
        Even though Priceline.com reported a second quarter loss of 1 cent a
share, narrower than consensus estimates of a 3-cent per-share loss, the
company's shares fell 22%, or 8 16/16 points, to close at 31 1/8. Shares
traded as low as 30 1/2, below the previous 52-week low of 32 3/8
recorded on July 11.  Volume exceeded 15 million, compared with average daily
volume of 2.4 million.
        Concerns over profitability and the company's report that revenue was
at the low end of unofficial estimates overshadowed the earnings report. The
Norwalk, Conn.-based company posted $352.1 million in revenue, more than
twice the revenue of the year-earlier period, but still less than what
analysts were expecting.
        Priceline.com's decline led the e-commerce subindex to slump 17.6
points, or 8.9%, to finish at 180.75.  Also contributing to the loss were
Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. Shares of Amazon.com fell 5.8%, or 2 3/8
points, to close at 38 6/8.  Shares of eBay were off 6.2%, or 3 5/8 points,
to close at 55 1/8.
        An earnings warning from Lands' End Inc. brought the company's shares
down 21%, or 8 1/4 points, as the apparel subindex fell 7.7 points, or 1.1%,
to finish at 676.68. Shares of Lands' End closed at 31 7/8 after trading on a
volume of 1.5 million shares compared with average daily volume of 268,500.
        Shares of Lands' End sank after the company said it expects earnings
for the quarter ending July 28 to be around 7 cents a share and sales to be
flat with the year-earlier period. In the year-earlier quarter, the company
earned 14 cents a share on sales of $254.6 million.  Analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to earn 17 cents a
share. Before last month's warning, analysts' estimates had been for
second-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share (see below).
        Also in the apparel sector, shares of Spiegel Inc. lost 2.9%, or 4/16
point, to close at 7 7/16, and shares of AnnTaylor Store Corp. fell 1.6%, or
1/2 point, to finish at 30 1/4.
        The home furnishings and housewares subindex also posted a loss
Monday.  Leading the decline was Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., as its shares fell
6.8%, or 2 11/16, to 37.  And shares of Linens 'n Things Inc. were off 4.4%,
or 1 7/16 points, to close at 30 7/8.
        On the eve of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, the major markets experienced significant declines. Weakness
in computer and Internet shares brought the Nasdaq Composite Index down
113.09 points, or 2.8%, to close at 3981.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
was off 48.79 points, or 0.45%, to close at 10,684.77, and Standard & Poor's
500-stock index dropped 15.9 points, or 1.1%, to 1464.29.

Heilig-Meyers is talking with DeRusha about restructuring the timing and

company said, it plans to seek amendments or waivers to maintain compliance
with covenants under its revolving credit line and certain other agreements.
If the company can't amend its credit line or get waivers, it said that the

 UPDATE 2-Lands' End sees flat Q2 sales, lower net.

 CHICAGO, July 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Lands' End Inc. on Monday fell more than 20 percent after the online and catalogue retailer said its fiscal second-quarter and full-year sales and earnings would fall below Wall Street expectations, marking the second time in two months the company warned of a shortfall. 

 For the second quarter ending July 28, Lands' End said earnings would be about half of last year's 14 cents per share. The retailer also cautioned that sales in the quarter would be flat compared with year-ago sales of $255 million. 

 According to First Call/Thomson Financial, analysts on average had expected Lands' End to report a profit of 17 cents per share. 

 Shares of Lands' End were off 8-13/16 at 31-5/16 after a delayed opening on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is trading well off its 52-week high of 83-1/2. 

 Lands' End, which is known for its preppy casual clothing, said it cut its fiscal 2001 sales growth forecast to less than 6 percent. On June 8 it reduced the forecast to 6 percent from more than 6 percent. 

 Earnings per share for the full year are now expected to be about 20 percent above the year-ago $1.52, the company said. That would be short of the $1.90 per share expected by analysts polled by First Call. 

 Lands' End said the revised outlook stemmed from results to date and trends in its second quarter. A company spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the performance shortfall and said additional details would be provided when the company reports earnings on Aug. 10. 

 The profit warning issued in June was prompted by weakness in the speciality catalogue business, it said at the time. 

 ABN AMRO analyst Kevin Silverman said it was likely that softness in the company's second quarter also came from its speciality catalogues, which include children's clothing and items for the home. 

 Despite Monday's announcement, Lands' End is in good health and represents value to investors looking to buy an Internet retailer, Silverman said. 

 "Long-term, the future at Lands' End is very bright, although near-term confidence is a bit in doubt," Silverman said. "I tend to have patience with them because they continue to have the highest return on equity in retail and they are the largest Internet apparel retailer." 

 Lands' End has been dogged by lower-than-expected profits since efforts to improve profitability by reducing catalogue pages and unprofitable mailings took a larger-than-expected bite out of its sales. 

 The catalogue retailer also overhauled its merchandise this year and now offers "business casual" clothing in more modern colours and fabrics.

 FRANKFURT, July 24 (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler shares fell two percent on Monday after a newspaper report the company would issue a profit warning for the rest of the year. 

 The Wall Street Journal said on Monday that DaimlerChrysler will issue a profit warning for the rest of 2000 when it announces second quarter results on Wednesday. 

 Citing "people close to the German auto maker", the Journal also said that DaimlerChrysler's treasurer Thomas Capo has informed colleagues that he plans to step down because of frustration with "the direction" DaimlerChrysler is headed. 

 DaimlerChrysler declined to comment on the report beyond describing it as "speculation". 

 By 0814 GMT, DaimlerChrysler shares were 2.05 percent weaker at 57.85 euros, off a low of 57.25 euros, while the DAX index was 0.23 percent lower. 

 Analysts say heavy marketing costs in the United States have squeezed profit margins at DaimlerChrysler and other automakers as they battle a growing taste among local consumers for imported cars. 

 Recent weakness in the euro has only increased a trend which analysts say has been seen witnessed 1994. 

 One London-based analyst from a leading U.S. bank told an internal conference call last week that he believed DaimlerChrysler would issue a profit warning on Wednesday, according to sources at the bank. 

 Bayerische Landesbank auto analyst Peter Worel said he did not believe DaimlerChrysler will come out with a "classical profit warning" on Wednesday. 

 "But they may well come out with some cautious comment on earnings for the rest of the year, especially in the U.S." 

 "The problems are mainly in the United States, where they have been having more trouble than in recent years," he said. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters last week said DaimlerChrysler first half sales are expected to rise 14 percent to about 82.4 billion euros ($77.01 billion) from last year's 72.3 billion euros. 

 But the healthy sales growth has in part been achieved at the expense of profitability, with big budget marketing and incentive campaigns eating into margins. 

 DaimlerChrysler officials said they are "comfortable" with Wall Street's estimates of second quarter earnings of $1.52 per share, as tracked by First Call/Thomson Financial and the paper said the company would post "good" second quarter results.

 German carmakers H1 sales seen stronger, earnings mixed.

 FRANKFURT, July 24 (Reuters) - German car makers reporting first half results this week are expected to post stronger sales, but the outlook for earnings remains mixed, analysts said. 

 DaimlerChrysler AG reports first on Wednesday, with Volkswagen AG expected to report at the end of the week. BMW will follow the week after. 

 Nervousness ahead of the results saw DaimlerChrysler shares fall about two percent and Volkswagen slip over one percent on Monday morning after the Wall Street Journal said the German-American automaker would issue a profit warning for the rest of the year. 

 DaimlerChrysler described the report as "speculation," but one London-based analyst from a leading U.S. bank told an internal conference call last week he believed DaimlerChrysler would issue a profit warning on Wednesday, according to sources at the bank. 

 A German-based analyst, Bayerische Landesbank's Peter Worel, said he did not believe DaimlerChrysler would come out with a "classical profit warning" on Wednesday. 

 "But they may well come out with some cautious comment on earnings for the rest of the year, especially in the U.S." 

 U.S. WORRIES 

 Although sales remain relatively healthy, analysts say stiff competition in the U.S. has hit profits and prospects for the rest of the year are clouded. 

 "The problems are mainly in the United States, where they have been having more trouble than in recent years," Worel said. 

 DaimlerChrysler group sales are expected to rise 14 percent to about 82.4 billion euros ($77.01 billion) from last year's 72.3 billion euros, according to analysts polled by Reuters. 

 But the sales growth has in part been achieved at the expense of profitability, with big budget marketing and incentive campaigns eating into margins. 

 U.S. carmakers have been battling for some time against a growing taste among local consumers for imported cars, with weakness in the euro exacerbating a trend analysts say has been observeable since the mid-1990s. 

 According to a poll of seven analysts, first half pretax profit at DaimlerChrysler is expected to slip to some 4.99 billion euros from 5.075 billion last time. 

 A separate survey of five analysts by First Call put second quarter net profit at $1.51 billion or $1.51 a share, against $1.53 billion or $1.53 a year earlier. 

 VW, which in contrast to DaimlerChrysler reported strong first quarter results, appears to be placed more comfortably, although a steady decline in its share price since the middle of last year suggests it will take more than a single quarter's results to win back investor favour. 

 Half year sales are seen at around 82.4 billion marks ($39.7 billion) against 74.4 billion a year earlier, with net profit expected to rise to about 1.107 billion marks from 845 million, according to analysts polled by Reuters. 

 VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said in a magazine interview earlier this month that the group expected to surpass its record full year net profit result of 2.24 billion marks. 

 CAR STOCKS SLIDE 

 Car stocks have fallen steadily in 2000, pressured partly by the popularity of New Economy tech stocks, but also by concern over weak earnings prospects. 

 DaimlerChrysler, the world's number five automaker, which last week closed two major commercial vehicles deals, has seen its share price slide about 20 percent from a yearly high of 74 euros in January. 

 Before Monday's selloff, the share had picked up in recent days but investors continue to be wary, with 21 out of 31 analysts covering the stock rating it a Hold with only nine rating it a Buy, according to company information. 

 Volkswagen has performed almost as badly, sliding over 13 percent from a year high of 52.23 euros in January, despite a pledge by management to boost the share price and improve communication with investors. 

 The falls came against a background of general weakness throughout the auto sector, with the automobiles component of the Eurostoxx 50 index falling 13 percent this year. 

 VW's share has perked up in the past few days, rekindled by merger speculation around the company, with rumours resurfacing last week that Ford may be interested in an alliance. ((Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 Lands' End sees flat Q2 sales, lower net.

 CHICAGO, July 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Lands' End Inc. on Monday fell more than 20 percent after the online and catalogue retailer said its fiscal second-quarter and full-year sales and earnings would fall below Wall Street expectations, marking the second time in two months the company warned of a shortfall. 

 For the second quarter ending July 28, Lands' End said earnings would be about half of last year's 14 cents per share. The retailer also cautioned that sales in the quarter would be flat compared with year-ago sales of $255 million. 

 According to First Call/Thomson Financial, analysts on average had expected Lands' End to report a profit of 17 cents per share. 

 Shares of Lands' End were off 8-13/16 at 31-5/16 after a delayed opening on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is trading well off its 52-week high of 83-1/2. 

 Lands' End, which is known for its preppy casual clothing, said it cut its fiscal 2001 sales growth forecast to less than 

 percent. On June 8 it reduced the forecast to 6 percent from more than 6 percent. 

 Earnings per share for the full year are now expected to be about 20 percent above the year-ago $1.52, the company said. That would be short of the $1.90 per share expected by analysts polled by First Call. 

 Lands' End said the revised outlook stemmed from results to date and trends in its second quarter. A company spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the performance shortfall and said additional details would be provided when the company reports earnings on Aug. 10. 

 The profit warning issued in June was prompted by weakness in the speciality catalogue business, it said at the time. 

 ABN AMRO analyst Kevin Silverman said it was likely that softness in the company's second quarter also came from its speciality catalogues, which include children's clothing and items for the home. 

 Despite Monday's announcement, Lands' End is in good health and represents value to investors looking to buy an Internet retailer, Silverman said. 

 "Long-term, the future at Lands' End is very bright, although near-term confidence is a bit in doubt," Silverman said. "I tend to have patience with them because they continue to have the highest return on equity in retail and they are the largest Internet apparel retailer." 

 Lands' End has been dogged by lower-than-expected profits since efforts to improve profitability by reducing catalogue pages and unprofitable mailings took a larger-than-expected bite out of its sales. 

 The catalogue retailer also overhauled its merchandise this year and now offers "business casual" clothing in more modern colours and fabrics.

 DaimlerChrysler stock falls over profit concerns.

 DETROIT, July 24 (Reuters) - Shares of No. 5 automaker DaimlerChrysler AG fell 1-8/16 to $53-9/16 on the New York Stock Exchange Monday amid profit concerns and talk that another senior American was considering leaving the company. 

 The German-American automaker is to announce second-quarter earnings Wednesday. A London-based analyst said last week he believed DaimlerChrysler would adopt a cautious stance toward the rest of the year because of a slowdown in its normally robust U.S. operations. And the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that DaimlerChrysler would issue a profit warning for the second half. 

 Company officials declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report. 

 "That is speculation and the company doesn't comment on rumour and speculation," spokeswoman Lorie McTavish said from Auburn Hills, Mich., the company's North American headquarters. 

 The shares declined on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange after a 2 percent slide in Europe, bringing the company closer to its 52-week low of $51-13/16 in the United States. 

 DaimlerChrysler's U.S. operations, mostly made up of the former Chrysler Corp., have had trouble jump-starting sales in the second quarter because of an ageing line-up of minivans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and mid-size cars. 

 Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst David Garrity said in a research note Monday the company spent an average of $2,264 a vehicle for incentives in the U.S. in June, up $500 from a year ago. 

 But the extra marketing money was not enough to halt a 9.8 percent drop in June U.S. sales. Vehicle inventories bloated supply for cars to 70 days and supply for light trucks to 86 days at the end of June. Garrity said there were signs the company moved to scale back production of pickup trucks, sport utilities and minivans late in the second quarter. 

 Also Monday, sources familiar with DaimlerChrysler said Treasurer Thomas Capo was considering retiring from the automaker. Capo, who was treasurer at Chrysler, has held the title of global treasurer since April. Since Germany's Daimler Benz bought Chrysler in 1998, he has played a key role trying to develop the treasury department into one that would meet German and U.S. investor needs. 

 If Capo goes, it would be the latest in a string of high-profile departures among senior American executives who came from Chrysler. Chairman Robert Eaton left in March and Thomas Stallkamp, vice chairman and who headed up the U.S. operations, left in December. 

 McTavish declined to comment on the Capo news, calling it speculation. 

 Separately, Chrysler held a ceremony in Windsor, Ontario, Monday marking the official production launch of its new 2001 minivans. Chrysler hopes the new minivan, the fourth generation of the segment Chrysler invented in the 1980s, will help it regain momentum after losing share to stiff foreign and domestic competition. 

 Chrysler executives at the Windsor plant said the company will lose 70,000 units of production in the changeover, 50,000 less than it did during the 1995 model changeover. Production of the new models is scheduled to start later this summer at the second minivan plant in St. Louis, Mo.

 Shares Of Finnish Telecom Sonera Tumble On Weak 2nd-Half Outlook

 HELSINKI -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Sonera Oyj fell Monday on both sides of the Atlantic after the Finnish telecommunications group warned it expects second-half operating profit to fall short of year-earlier results because of massive outlays for new services. 

 The warning clouded Sonera's (SNRA) strong first-half earnings report. For the six months ended June 30, the company reported a nearly five-fold increase in its pretax profit, which soared to 1.06 billion euros ($993.6 million) from 224 million euros in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 11% to 987 million euros. 

 The company's profit was lifted mainly by a gain of 835 million euros following VoiceStream Wireless Corp.'s acquisition in May of Aerial Communications Inc. Sonera, Finland's largest mobile network operator and leading developer of telecommunications services, is one of a group of shareholders with a majority stake in VoiceStream (VSTR), which Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) agreed on Monday to acquire for about $45 billion. 

 Earlier Monday, Sonera said it would accept Deutsche Telekom's offer for its VoiceStream stake, for which the Finnish telecom will receive $569 million cash and a 1.7% stake in Deutsche Telekom some time next year. 

 Also, Sonera has said it expects to book a gain of 650 million euros in the third quarter from the planned sale of its stake in Turkish mobile operator Turkcell Iletism Hizmetleri AS (TKC). 

 However, Sonera said it expects these gains to be offset by heavy spending on "major development outlays on new services," with a total of 500 million euros to be spent over the next two years developing its global wireless operations. These costs likely will drive second-half operating profit and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, below year-earlier levels, the company said. 

 Sonera added that outlays on new services will "significantly lower" 2000 results in its media communications and new services unit. The division, which includes Sonera's Internet operations, posted a widened first-half operating loss of 102 million euros, compared with 16 million euros a year earlier, despite a 32% jump in revenue. Profitability was weakened by spending for product development, marketing and new business start-ups, Sonera said. 

 Sonera plans to renew the business concept of its Sonera Plaza pages by boosting electronic-commerce and financial services offered on the sites. At the same time, Sonera said it is looking into the possibility of listing its Sonera SmartTrust data-security unit and Sonera Zed wireless Web portal by the end of April 2001. 

 First-half operating profit for Sonera's mobile communications division climbed 23% to 198 million euros, while revenue rose 21% to 553 million euros on increased subscription, an improved "churn" rate and growth in value-added services such as short messaging and text messaging. The churn rate measures retention of existing wireless subscribers. 

 Sonera said it will apply for third-generation mobile licenses "selectively" in European markets, but didn't specify countries or regions. The company said it also is examining possible strategic partnerships in mobile communications services. 

 The company's fixed network voice and data services business posted operating profit of 86 million euros, compared with 38 million euros a year earlier, as a result of lower payments to other telecommunications operators. Revenue, however, fell 4% because of a decline in revenue from international voice services. 

 Meanwhile, Kaj-Erik Relander, Sonera's deputy chief executive, said Monday the company plans to sell its eventual 1.7% stake in Deutsche Telekom at a later stage. 

 The holding "doesn't have strategic importance (for Sonera). It's a financial investment and we'll (sell the shares) when we consider the time is right," Mr. Relander told journalists at a Helsinki press conference.

 DaimlerChrysler Plans to Issue  Profit Warning  for Rest of Year --- Auto Maker Is Spending More Than Expected to Sell Vehicles in U.S. --- Treasurer to Step Down, Frustrated Over `Direction' Company Is Headed

 DaimlerChrysler AG, whose stock has plummeted by half over the past 20 months, is to issue a warning about its financial performance for the rest of the year when it announces its second-quarter results Wednesday.   

 In addition, the company's treasurer, Thomas Capo, has informed colleagues that he plans to step down because of frustration with "the direction" DaimlerChrysler is headed, people close to the German auto maker said.   

 Company officials said they remain comfortable that DaimlerChrysler will meet analysts' second-quarter earnings estimate, which is $1.52 (1.62 euros) a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. The company will report "good figures" for the first half of the year, said a person familiar with the situation.   

 But the company is less bullish about its performance during the rest of the year, people familiar with the matter said. Perhaps reflecting that concern, analysts during the past week have cut their full-year earnings projections for the company, to $6.12 per share from $6.20 a week ago.   

 "It's not easy times," a company official said. "There's a lot of difficult waters ahead."   

 DaimlerChrysler's big problem is its U.S. side, which had to spend far more than it expected on incentives to woo Americans to buy its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles. Even though Americans continue to buy new cars and trucks at a record pace, the U.S. auto market is getting more competitive, as Japanese and European auto makers enter segments formerly dominated by Detroit's three major auto makers.   

 At DaimlerChrysler's U.S. operations, marketing costs accounted for 13% of sales in the second quarter, up from 11% in the year-earlier quarter.   

 To make up for those costs, the company's U.S. arm has been ordered to improve its bottom line, mostly through spending cuts, by a massive $2 billion by the end of 2000 -- a chunk that amounts to more than a third of the unit's operating profit last year. In addition, company executives say, DaimlerChrysler is trying to pare the costs of running its dual headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, and Auburn Hills, Michigan, by 25% during the next three years. The campaign could result in major staff cuts, though most are likely to come through attrition rather than layoffs, company officials say.   

 DaimlerChrysler's shares, which reached a high of about $108 following the November 1998 merger that created the trans-Atlantic industrial giant, have fallen steadily since last summer, when the company first surprised investors with lackluster earnings. The company's shares fell 1.5%, or 81.25 cents, to $55.0625 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.   

 Mr. Capo, the treasurer, doesn't plan to immediately go to work for another company, people familiar with the situation said. DaimlerChrysler is looking for a replacement for him, the people said.   

 The departure of Mr. Capo, who couldn't be reached Sunday, will mark the second important resignation in the company's financial section in recent months. Ralf Brammer, DaimlerChrysler's investor-relations head, left in June.

SYMBOL: X.FFI
        WASHINGTON (FFBN)--As Priceline.com Inc. reported its second-quarter
earnings, causing its shares drop more than 20%, and shares of other
e-commerce companies fell, the Federal Filings Retail Index lost 234.2
points, or 2.6%, to finish at 8833.25 on Monday.



        As most of the subindexes posted losses, losers outnumbered gainers
113 to 47.
        Even though Priceline.com reported a second quarter loss of 1 cent a
share, narrower than consensus estimates of a 3-cent per-share loss, the
company's shares fell 22%, or 8 16/16 points, to close at 31 1/8. Shares
traded as low as 30 1/2, below the previous 52-week low of 32 3/8
recorded on July 11.  Volume exceeded 15 million, compared with average daily
volume of 2.4 million.
        Concerns over profitability and the company's report that revenue was
at the low end of unofficial estimates overshadowed the earnings report. The
Norwalk, Conn.-based company posted $352.1 million in revenue, more than
twice the revenue of the year-earlier period, but still less than what
analysts were expecting.
        Priceline.com's decline led the e-commerce subindex to slump 17.6
points, or 8.9%, to finish at 180.75.  Also contributing to the loss were
Amazon.com Inc. and eBay Inc. Shares of Amazon.com fell 5.8%, or 2 3/8
points, to close at 38 6/8.  Shares of eBay were off 6.2%, or 3 5/8 points,
to close at 55 1/8.
        An earnings warning from Lands' End Inc. brought the company's shares
down 21%, or 8 1/4 points, as the apparel subindex fell 7.7 points, or 1.1%,
to finish at 676.68. Shares of Lands' End closed at 31 7/8 after trading on a
volume of 1.5 million shares compared with average daily volume of 268,500.
        Shares of Lands' End sank after the company said it expects earnings
for the quarter ending July 28 to be around 7 cents a share and sales to be
flat with the year-earlier period. In the year-earlier quarter, the company
earned 14 cents a share on sales of $254.6 million.  Analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company to earn 17 cents a
share. Before last month's warning, analysts' estimates had been for
second-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share (see below).
        Also in the apparel sector, shares of Spiegel Inc. lost 2.9%, or 4/16
point, to close at 7 7/16, and shares of AnnTaylor Store Corp. fell 1.6%, or
1/2 point, to finish at 30 1/4.
        The home furnishings and housewares subindex also posted a loss
Monday.  Leading the decline was Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., as its shares fell
6.8%, or 2 11/16, to 37.  And shares of Linens 'n Things Inc. were off 4.4%,
or 1 7/16 points, to close at 30 7/8.
        On the eve of congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, the major markets experienced significant declines. Weakness
in computer and Internet shares brought the Nasdaq Composite Index down
113.09 points, or 2.8%, to close at 3981.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
was off 48.79 points, or 0.45%, to close at 10,684.77, and Standard & Poor's
500-stock index dropped 15.9 points, or 1.1%, to 1464.29.

announced expectation of 6% growth and estimates that earnings for the year
will increase about 20% above last year's $1.52 a share.

Heilig-Meyers named Donald S. Shaffer president and chief executive to
replace William C. DeRusha, who had been chairman and chief executive since
1986. DeRusha will receive about $8.1 million in connection with his
departure.
Heilig-Meyers is talking with DeRusha about restructuring the timing and
amount of his severance package.  After these discussions are over, the
company said, it plans to seek amendments or waivers to maintain compliance
with covenants under its revolving credit line and certain other agreements.
If the company can't amend its credit line or get waivers, it said that the
charges for DeRusha's departure would result in the company not being in
compliance with its covenants under its revolving credit line and other
agreements as of the end of the second quarter.

PALO ALTO, Calif. - Companies from Agilent

Technologies and International Business Machines Corp. to Ericsson AB are losing sales because a parts shortage is

preventing them from making computers and communications

gear.

Agilent, which sells everything from ultrasound devices to phone-network testers, said shortages may cut profit by as much as half from the year-earlier period's. Ericsson, the biggest maker of mobile-phone networks, blamed losses in its phone-making unit on a lack of flash-memory chips and other parts.

The dearth of semiconductors, capacitors, liquid crystal

displays and flash memory already has sapped profit at Dell Computer Corp. and cut sales growth at Palm and Nintendo Co. Now the shortages may linger as long as two years because parts makers weren't prepared to gear up so quickly after a slump in the late 1990s. That could take a toll on more

companies.

"I don't think this is something that turns around in a

quarter," said Kurt Brunner, a fund manager at Swarthmore Group, which has $750 million in assets and owns shares of Cisco Systems and Tellabs.

Agilent shares tumbled $28.56, or 35 percent, to $48.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading after last night's profit warning for the fiscal third quarter that ends July 31. About 19

million shares changed hands, more than four times the

three-month daily average. Ericsson American depositary

receipts dropped $2.75 to $19.81.

Parts makers say the escalation in cell-phone use caught them by surprise.

Motorola, the No. 2 mobile-phone maker, predicts 425 million to 450 million cell phone shipments industrywide this year, up from a forecast of 400 million as recently as May.

"We're all expanding, but we can't expand enough," said

Benedict Rosen, chief executive of AVX Corp., the world's No. 2 maker of ceramic capacitors used in cell phones and

computers.

Rosen last month traveled to South Korea and Japan to speak with customers such as Sony Corp. Last week he flew around the United States on a similar mission to find out what his customers want.

"The word is the same everyplace. `We need more parts,' " Rosen said.

 QUESTION: How can a company that lost $60 billion in market cap when it issued a profit warning in January let the same thing happen seven months later? 

 ANSWER: That's a question many investors and analysts are asking. Some argue the drop-off in earnings is almost inevitable as Lucent tries to move away from its slowly eroding business of circuit switches for telephone carriers and toward selling equipment for higher-speed communications networks. 

 Q: Is the problem related to January's warning? 

 A: No. That was tied to a misreading of the market. Lucent failed to anticipate the demand for new high-speed optical transmission equipment. 

 This time, the decline is in part due to a drop in sales of Lucent's core circuit switches to telephone service carriers. Sales of new optical network equipment -- which moves data on light -- is not expected to offset those losses. 

 Q: Is there a chance this type of problem can happen again? 

 A: Analysts said there is always the chance, but they give Lucent credit to owning up to the fact that its core business is declining. Many say Lucent, with its resources and research abilities, is well-positioned to grab a hefty share of the emerging optical and data networking markets. 

 Q: What has Lucent done to address the problems? 

 A: The company has tripled its manufacturing capacity to build the new optical systems, but the transition is going to take at least two quarters. 

 Q: What about the spinoff it announced yesterday? 

 A: The spinoff of the unit which makes semi-conductors and fiber optic components is largely viewed on Wall Street as a wise move. Analysts think it will allow investors to put a higher value on the unit and afford Lucent the chance to focus more closely on new emerging optic, wireless and data networking markets. 

 Q: What is the value of the spinoff? 

 A: With the business growing at the rate of nearly 40 percent a year, one analyst projects the value of the spinoff at $100 billion. Lucent plans to sell up to 20 percent of the company in an IPO in the first quarter of 2001. 

 Q: If I own Lucent stock, what does the spinoff mean to me? 

 A: Lucent first plans to sell 20 percent of the unit to the public in an IPO. The remaining 80 percent will be distributed to Lucent shareholders as a tax-free dividend by this time next year. 

 Q: Should I buy Lucent stock at this price? 

 A: In the short term, some analysts think the spinoff of the new unit will boost Lucent's share price. But in the high-flying optical networking market, Lucent is behind many of its competitors in its growth rate. 

 Q: What kind of management changes are in the works? 

 A: Deborah Hopkins, the new chief financial officer, already has hired a new executive to take over the revamping of Lucent's vendor financing unit, which has come under fire for its performance. Other changes are expected to be announced within 10 days. 

 Q: What does this mean for Lucent's chief executive officer, Richard McGinn? 

 A: Only time will tell. In the past year, however, the top executives of Coca-Cola, Xerox and Mattel all resigned after their companies failed to meet earnings estimates. 

 Q: Does the loss in market capitalization today affect Lucent's ability in the future to make more acquisitions? 

 A: The drop in stock value decreases the currency Lucent has to target other companies. Nevertheless, the stock decline in January did not stop it from completing the acquisition of Chromatis Networks this year.

 WSJ.com 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Technology stocks led the market lower Friday as disappointing earnings news from Ericsson and Agilent Technologies fueled a retreat following Thursday's rally. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 90.11 points, or 2.2%, to 4094.45, finishing the week down 3.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.31 points, or 1%, to 10733.56, ending the week off 79 points. 

 Other major indexes fell Friday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 15.28 to 1480.19, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 4.81 to 655.38 and the Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks sank 12.05, or 2.3%, to 522.70. 

 Earnings news and profit-taking pressured stocks, with Internet and semiconductor issues showing some of the sharpest losses to send the Nasdaq composite lower following Thursday's 3.2% jump. The weakness spread to the Dow industrials, where the technology components posted losses. Rate-sensitive banking and other financial shares were weak following Thursday's strong gains. 

 Bill Barker, investment strategist and consultant at Dain Rauscher, said some weak second-quarter results and earnings warnings this week made investors more cautious about companies showing questionable growth prospects. 

 "This is a stock-specific market," said Mr. Barker, noting the day's declines by Agilent and Ericsson. "If the numbers are good, they'll pay up. If the numbers are bad, they'll take you to the cleaners. 

 Shares of Agilent (A) were down 25 1/2, or 35%, to 47 1/2 at 4 p.m. EDT from its regular session close Thursday after the computer-products and test-equipment maker, which was spun off by Dow component Hewlett-Packard, issued a profit warning and was downgraded by analysts. Shares of Hewlett-Packard (HWP) dropped 7 15/16 to 123 3/8. 

 Meanwhile, the American depositary receipts of Ericsson (ERICY) fell 2 3/4 to 19 13/16 on heavy volume of nearly 91 million shares after the Swedish communications giant issued a mixed earnings report, showing strong profit growth for the second quarter but troubles for its mobile telephone business. The news dragged down the broader telecom sector. 

 And America Online (AOL) fell 4 1/8 to 57 7/16 after beating estimates as some analysts expressed concern that the company's revenue growth rate was slowing. But computer maker Sun Microsystems (SUNW) jumped 5 15/16 to 104 after topping Wall Street estimates for earnings. 

 Michael Lyons, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the day's earnings reports gave Wall Street little to push stocks higher. "Investors are kind of taking a breather here, sitting back and letting things happen," Mr. Lyons said. 

 Favorable comments Thursday from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about the U.S. economy and interest rates, coupled with a positive reaction to second-quarter results from International Business Machines sent stocks and bonds soaring Thursday. On Friday, bond prices were higher, while the dollar fell against the euro and rose compared with the yen. 

 Investors were cautious this week ahead of Mr. Greenspan's remarks, as second-quarter earnings season continued full force and gave the market some direction. Consumer-price data released Tuesday didn't improve investors' mood, while earnings reports from Microsoft and Intel weighed on the market Wednesday. 

 But Mr. Greenspan's remarks Thursday fueled some hopes that the cooling U.S. economy may permit the Fed to end its campaign of rate increases. The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999 to curb inflationary pressures and slow the economy. 

 The Fed left rates unchanged at its policy meeting last month, noting signs of a slowdown. But many analysts still expect some caution from the market ahead of the Fed's next policy meeting in August, since Mr. Greenspan has indicated that the threat of inflation remains. 

 On Friday, shares of Lexmark International (LXK) dropped 18 1/4, or 29%, to 45 3/4 after the desktop printer supplier reported that its second-quarter earnings failed to meet analysts' expectations and issued a third-quarter earnings warning. Analysts said Lexmark's drop contributed to Hewlett-Packard's decline. 

 Among the Dow components, Eastman Kodak (EK) fell 1 7/8 to 58 after the photography and imaging company met Wall Street's earnings estimates and said its third-quarter profit will broadly meet expectations. Shares of IBM (IBM), which jumped Thursday following the company's upbeat earnings report, fell 2 9/16 to 114 7/16. 

 Outside the U.S. on Friday, European shares declined as technology and telecommunication stocks dragged markets lower. In the Asian-Pacific region, stocks finished mixed as Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index continued higher, finishing just shy of the key 18000 level. 

 In major U.S. market action: 

 Stocks fell. On the Big Board, where 964 million shares traded, 1,762 stocks declined and 1,089 advanced. On the Nasdaq market, 1.52 billion shares changed hands. 

 Treasurys rose. The 10-year Treasury note was up less than 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 invested, bringing the yield down to 5.99%. The 30-year bond was up more than 1/4 point to yield 5.79%. 

 The dollar was mixed. It traded at 93.70 cents to the euro and 108.86 yen to the dollar, compared with 93.36 cents to the euro and 107.63 yen to the dollar late Thursday in New York.

 Companies: Lucent Warns of Weaker Profit To Come; Plans `Major' Change --- Company Also Reports Net Loss of $301 Million in 3rd Quarter --- Stock Plummets in New York

 Lucent Technologies Inc., which has been trying to work its way back into Wall Street's good graces after a disappointing first quarter, stunned investors with a warning that revenue and profit going forward would be weaker than expected.   

 The news came as Lucent reported a net loss of $301 million (326 million euros) for its third quarter and formally announced a widely expected spinoff its $4 billion microelectronics unit. News of the spinoff, which will create a separate, publicly traded company that could be valued at $50 billion, wasn't enough to save Lucent's stock, which was trading lower on Thursday afternoon by 16%, or $10.50, at $54 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   

 Lucent Chairman and Chief Executive Richard McGinn said he expects fourth-quarter pro forma revenue and earnings per share to grow about 15% instead of the 20% the company had originally forecast. For the first quarter of 2001, Mr. McGinn said revenue from continuing operations will increase 20%, but warned that pro forma earnings per share will fall 15% below expectations. Analysts had expected Lucent to earn 42 U.S. cents a share in the fourth quarter and 41 U.S. cents a share in the first quarter of 2001, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.   

 Mr. McGinn called the revised numbers a "disappointment" and acknowledged that the company needs to make substantive changes. He said he plans to announce "major" structural and management changes in the next 10 days. While Mr. McGinn isn't expected to leave the company, people close to the firm said other top-level executives may be moved to lower-profile positions or let go.   

 Lucent has been trying to regain investors' confidence after reporting a 23% drop in first-quarter profit in January. The company blamed the decline on its failure to anticipate demand for optical networking gear, which can carry huge amounts of Internet and telephone traffic at lightening-fast speeds. Since then, company executives have tried to convince investors that the company is back on track but Mr. McGinn conceded that the company was "still paying" for its first-quarter glitches and would continue to feel the ramifications for the next two quarters.   

 The spinoff of the microelectronics unit is clearly an attempt to help resolve some of the nagging questions that have been dragging down Lucent's stock in recent months. The company has been under pressure to make substantial changes and a spinoff would help unlock significant shareholder value, analysts said. The microelectronics division is one of the hottest sectors, making computer chips, as well as lasers and gear used in optical networks. Optical networking gear allows telecommunications providers to carry huge amounts of Internet and phone traffic at lightening-fast speeds. Lucent's closest competitors in the optical and chip-making sector are JDS Uniphase Inc., with an $83.5 billion market capitalization and Texas Instruments Inc., with a $101 billion valuation.   

 But industry analysts questioned whether the spinoff is enough to solve Lucent's woes and said it is becoming apparent that fundamental management and execution problems persist within Lucent.   

 "Getting products to market on a timely basis has not been Lucent's strength," said Steven Levy, an analyst with Lehman Bros., who has been warning of problems within the New Jersey firm. While the spinoff will likely help the microelectronics unit flourish, Mr. Levy said, it won't solve the systemic problems within Lucent. "The question is `What's left at Lucent?' The next two quarters at a minimum will be very confusing and very uncertain," he said.   

 Lucent's downward revisions are surprising because they come as its main competitors -- Nortel Networks Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- continue to report dazzling growth and stellar earnings. The three companies are in a race to sell networking gear to service providers that are building state-of-the-art networks capable of handling high-speed Internet and phone traffic.   

 Mr. McGinn blamed the coming shortfalls on several factors, including slow deployment of its optical gear, as well as a migration to new products with lower profit margins and a declining market for its core telephone switch, which accounts for 15% to 20% of Lucent's revenue.   

 The market for that switch has been declining as carriers migrate to newer technologies. While Lucent has started making new gear, Mr. McGinn said, the decline in its core switch would "not be offset enough by new products." The company has also undergone a "substantial reduction" in a contract with the Saudi Arabian government, which scaled back plans to purchase gear from Lucent.   

 Mr. McGinn dismissed talk that the company was weakened and said the company is experiencing strong growth in sales to service providers and in its optical networking gear.   

 "We've been dealing with enormous volatility over the past nine months . . . but we have high confidence that there's an enormous growth opportunity" for Lucent, Mr. McGinn said. He added that the spinoff of the microelectronics unit, combined with the previously announced spinoff of the firm's enterprise business unit, will give Lucent the focus it has been lacking.   

 For the third quarter, which ended June 30, Lucent posted a net loss of $301 million, or nine cents a diluted share, because of charges for discontinued operations and recent acquisitions. In the year-ago quarter, Lucent earned $763 million, or 24 cents a share. Profit from continuing operations rose to $1 billion, or 30 cents a share, from $732 million, or 23 cents a share, a year ago. That beat Wall Street's earnings expectations of 29 cents a share by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.

 Lucent Technologies Inc., which has been trying to work its way back into Wall Street's good graces after a disappointing first quarter, surprised investors with a warning that fiscal fourth-quarter revenue and profit would be weaker than expected.

News of the spinoff, which will create a separate, publicly traded company that could be valued at as much as $85 billion, wasn't enough to save Lucent's stock, which plunged 16%, or $10.25, to $54.25 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   

 Lucent Chairman and CEO Richard McGinn, in an interview, blamed the coming shortfalls on several factors, including slower-than-expected deployment of optical gear, which routes Web traffic at lightning speed. He also cited pricing pressure on new products and softening of Lucent's core telephone-switch market, which accounts for 15% to 20% of its revenue. The industry is replacing the switches with cheaper, more efficient gear.   

 While Lucent has started making new gear, Mr. McGinn said, the decline in its core switch revenues would "not be offset enough by new products." The company is also suffering from a "substantial reduction" in a billion-dollar contract with the Saudi Arabian government.   

 Mr. McGinn dismissed talk that the company was weakened, and said it sees strong growth in sales to service providers and in its optical-networking gear.   

 "We've been dealing with enormous volatility over the past nine months . . . but we have high confidence that there's an enormous growth opportunity" for Lucent, he said, that the combined spinoffs of the microelectronics unit and -- previously announced -- of the enterprise-business unit, will give Lucent the focus it has lacked.

 For the third quarter, which ended June 30, Lucent posted a net loss of $301 million, or nine cents a diluted share, because of charges for discontinued operations and recent acquisitions. A year earlier, Lucent earned $763 million, or 24 cents a share. Profits from continuing operations rose to $1 billion, or 30 cents a share, from $732 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat Wall Street's earnings expectations of 29 cents a share by a penny, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Third-quarter revenue from continuing operations increased 18% to $8.7 billion. Mr. McGinn said revenue growth was fueled by sales of wireless and broadband equipment to service providers, which rose 16% to $6.9 billion, as well as sales in the microelectronics and communications technologies operations, which jumped 39% to $1.8 billion from the same period last year.

 UPDATE 2-Warnaco shares fall after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Warnaco Group Inc. , pitted in a legal battle against designer Calvin Klein Inc., on Thursday said fiscal 2000 earnings would fall far short of analyst estimates, driving the apparel company's shares down 26 percent to their lowest since the early 1990s. 

 Shares of Warnaco were trading off 1-3/4 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange after the company said it expected fiscal 2000 earnings, before charges and investment gains, to range between 26 to 36 cents a share, as much as 85 percent below current estimates. 

 Warnaco, in a statement, blamed the expected earnings decline on higher interest expense, additional product price markdowns, poor sales in certain sportswear brands and costs related to litigation with Calvin Klein. 

 "I can't say it was really a big surprise that there was downward guidance, but I would say the magnitude was certainly more than expected," said Noelle Grainger, an analyst at J.P. Morgan. 

 Grainger said the legal proceedings with Calvin Klein and weakness throughout the retail sector were reasons why the announcement didn't catch her off guard. Grainger maintains a "market performer" rating on Warnaco shares. 

 Analysts on average had expected the company to report fiscal 2000 earnings of $1.74 a share, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. As recently as May 5, Warnaco said it expected to post fiscal 2000 earnings of $1.80 a share. 

 The company said it expected second-quarter results to be reduced commensurately when it reports earnings Aug. 4, as scheduled. Wall Street had expected Warnaco to post a second-quarter profit of 47 cents a share, according to First Call. 

 Warnaco also said it expected to take an after-tax charge of $60 million to $70 million in the second quarter relating to cost-saving initiatives recently launched. The moves included plant consolidations, worldwide work force reductions of 10 percent, and consolidating finance and manufacturing organisations. The company expects annualized pre-tax savings of about $42 million per year after completing the initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2000. 

 The company expects the initiatives to "result in substantial improvement in operating earnings in 2001," said Chief Executive Linda Wachner in a statement. "We expect to maintain substantial free cash flow over each of the next four years." 

 Even so, analysts were keeping up their guard over the company's outlook. 

 "I kind of remain cautious on that front at this point in time," Grainger said, regarding Wachner's comments. "If they are able to achieve the savings and the synergies that they are forecasting, yes, they should be able to achieve significantly better earnings. But that's a long ways away." 

 The company also said its lead banks have committed to extend up to $2.9 billion in financing through August 2002 in an agreement expected to close in September. Upon closing, Warnaco will have no material debt maturing before August 2002. The agreement extends the maturity of its $500 million trade credit and $600 million bridge loan facilities from July and October 2000, respectively. 

 Credit rating service Standard & Poor's put Warnaco's credit rating on CreditWatch with negative implications after all of the news, indicating it may cut the firm's credit rating. Currently, S&P maintains a triple-'B'-minus rating, the lowest investment grade rating for debt. A downgrade would drop Warnaco's bonds to "junk" status, indicating a company with questionable credit quality. 

 Warnaco, which owns part of the Calvin Klein brand, sued the clothing company on June 26 for alleged trademark violations of Calvin Klein products. It countersued Calvin Klein for its May 31 suit charging that Warnaco sold unauthorised goods and made large-volume sales to discount stores. 

 At the time Warnaco also sued company founder Calvin Klein, citing defamation and trade libel over what it called recent intentional false and malicious statements by him allegedly maligning Warnaco and the quality of its Calvin Klein products. 

 The case is scheduled to get under way on Jan. 16.

 U.S. stocks rally at midday on IBM.

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Stocks ran up sharply at midday on Thursday as comments by the nation's top inflation fighter did not deflate a rally sparked by results from the nation's No. 1 computer maker. 

 International Business Machines Corp. leaped 10-7/16 to 113-15/16 after saying it was on the brink of climbing out of a year-long sales rut. IBM also reported a 1 percent drop in revenues but its earnings beat analysts' estimates. 

 "The bottom line is that IBM is the saviour," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahenstock & Co. in Great Neck, N.Y. "I give (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan an 'A' for neutrality. I think the market is writing his comments off." 

 In his twice-a-year report to Congress, Greenspan tempered renewed warnings about inflation risks such as the tight jobs market with upbeat remarks on high productivity. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) jumped 132.23 point, or 1.24 percent, to 10,828.31 with much of the gain coming from IBM. The 30-stock Dow recouped its losses from the last two sessions. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) also moved up, lifting 14 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,495.96. 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC), meanwhile, was up 110.47 points, or 2.72 percent, at 4,166.10, nearly recovering from its downturn in the previous session. 

 In the Nasdaq, fiber optic company JDS Uniphase Corp. soared 16-5/8 to 123-3/8 after Standard & Poor's said JDS will replace drug store chain Rite Aid Corp. in the S&P 500 Index. Rite Aid, a New York Stock Exchange listed issue, eased 3/16 to 5. 

 "IBM is the story of the day," said Alfred Goldman, technical analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "The reality is that we are in a bull market. We had two days of correction. The market was ready to resume the up trend." 

 In his remarks before a Senate committee, Greenspan said it was too early to conclude the U.S. economy has slowed enough to avoid inflation risks, but added that there was also no sign of ebbing in productivity growth. 

 "It's just a barely balanced testimony with a lot of weight on the side that suggests the Fed does not need to tighten any further," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics. "The statement is amazingly friendly." 

 The Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets next on Aug. 22 to decide whether to raise interest rates again. The U.S. central bank has hiked interest rates six times since June 1999 to keep inflation from cropping up in the economy. 

 In economic news, the number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000 in the latest week, suggesting the labour market remains buoyant. 

 In a separate report, the government said construction starts on new homes and apartments fell to their lowest level in over two years in June as the housing market showed modest signs of slowing in response to higher interest rates. 

 In general, housewares, footwear and software companies were up while retail toy, drug and precious metals firms were on a downswing. 

 Other big movers included Lucent Technologies Inc., the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, which dropped 10-11/16 to 54 after it cut some revenue and profit growth forecasts. The company posted stronger-than-expected results and also said it plans to spin off its microelectronics unit. 

 VoiceStream Wireless Corp. gained 8-15/16 to 154-7/16 after a source familiar with the situation said the German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG is in talks to acquire U.S. wireless telephone company in a deal valued at $53 billion. 

 France Telecom declined to comment on speculation that it too was bidding on VoiceStream. 

 The stock of Federated Department Stores Inc. fell to the lowest level in more than five years after the parent of retailers Macy's and Bloomingdale's issued a profit warning. The stock was off 2-5/8 at 24-1/8. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose more than a full point, up 1-10/32, driving the yield, which moves inversely to the price, down to 5.83 percent from Wednesday's close of 5.92 percent. Bond traders grew increasingly optimistic during Greenspan's commentary that the Fed might leave rates alone at the next meeting. 

 The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 1-1/32, with the yield falling to 6.02 percent from Wednesday's close of 6.17 percent.

 FEER: Mazda Faces Dilemma As Turnaround Stalls

   -By Chester Dawson in the Far Eastern Economic Review published
Thursday.



HIROSHIMA, Japan -(Dow Jones)- Mark Fields, the dapper new president of
Mazda Motor Corp. (J.MZD or 7261), is behind the wheel of a company with
two noisy back-seat drivers: impatient shareholders and nervous unions.


 While investors in the company, which is one-third owned by Ford Motor Co. (F), seek a turbocharged shortcut to higher profits by moving more production overseas, the car maker's Hiroshima-based rank-and-file want to ride the brakes and plod along the local scenic route, ensuring everyone comes along for the ride. "It's a real balancing act," says Fields, 39. "That's the toughest part of the job." 

 Mazda's dilemma is simple: More than 80% of the cars it sells are made in Japan and the strong yen is eroding the value of its profits in key overseas markets. But longtime company hands are resisting pressure to shift production away from domestic plants like the flagship Hiroshima factory, located next to Mazda headquarters. 

 It's easy to see why. A glance at a map of Hiroshima shows Mazda's overwhelming presence in the community. Stretching across seven kilometers of reclaimed land on the southern border of the city, Mazda's massive complex dominates the shoreline of the Inland Sea. The company employs about 24,000 people in the Hiroshima area and some 200,000 people are said to owe their jobs to Mazda indirectly. For years, the town prospered as a steady stream of shiny new Mazda models rolled off the production line and into showrooms worldwide. 

 At its peak in 1990, the Hiroshima plant produced 1.2 million vehicles a year. But over the past decade the plant's annual output has been more than halved to just 507,000 vehicles and the founding family from Hiroshima has been replaced by controlling shareholder Ford. Next year, when rivals will introduce a plethora of additions to their product lineups, Mazda won't debut a single model. Even more troubling, the company's promising earnings turnaround appears to have stalled. 

 That's bad news for Hiroshima, the economic anchor of southwestern Japan, nicknamed the country's "rust belt" because of the many factories there that operate below capacity. "When Mazda sneezes, Hiroshima catches a cold," says Hiroshi Yamamoto, chief plant manager and a second-generation Mazda employee. 

 Recently, the company has begun to show some flu-like symptoms. After posting its first net profit in five years in 1999, Mazda issued a glum profit warning in May. Japan's fifth-largest car maker now expects to report a Y12 billion net loss for the six months to Sept. 30. 

 It forecasts a 50% drop in net profit to Y12.5 billion for the full year. Investors aren't impressed. Mazda's share price has tumbled 35% so far this year to around Y285, far worse than the 8% slide in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's broad Topix index over the same period. 

 Fields, who last December became the third foreigner to head Mazda in the past four years and is among the youngest leaders of a major company in Japan, is feeling the heat. "I don't take solace in the fact that since I've been named president the stock has fallen significantly," he says. 

 But this vegetarian from New York City is confident that Mazda is on the right track for long-term growth. Downplaying concerns about a dearth of new models, Fields says the introduction of the Tribute this summer in the red-hot market for small sports utility vehicles will jump-start the company's sales in the U.S. and Japan. 

 Fields says the company will get a further boost from a "new generation" of Mazda vehicles to be introduced in 2002 that will share "platforms" - chassis, engine and other major components--with cars produced by parent company Ford. The idea is to cut production costs through joint parts procurement and streamlined manufacturing. As benefits are realized from synergies with Ford and streamlining of distribution, says Fields, "you're going to see a lot of that fall to the bottom line." 

 Until then, Fields, who earned his spurs at Ford as a marketing guru, says Mazda will concentrate on improving brand image and customer satisfaction. So even as rivals Honda (J.HMC), Toyota (TY) and Nissan (NSANY) roll out dozens of new models in the next 18 months, Mazda's chief says his company will be circling the wagons around its existing line-up. "That's our approach: We're going to market our way through."

 Wachovia quarterly profit drops 43 percent.

 WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.,, July 19 (Reuters) - Southeast regional banking company Wachovia Corp. said on Wednesday its second-quarter operating earnings fell 43 percent, but exceeded Wall Street's lowered forecast, as higher interest rates took a bite out of profits. 

 The company, which operates more than 700 branches in five states, said operating earnings dropped to $143.3 million, or 70 cents per diluted share. That compared with operating earnings of $253.1 million, or $1.22 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. 

 On June 15, Wachovia warned investors that rising interest rates, which the U.S. Federal Reserve has increased six times since last June, would hurt profit margins. On that date, the banking company also said it planned to take a $200 million provision to protect against the possibility of bad loans, which would cut earnings by 64 cents per share. That provision is reflected in the second-quarter operating earnings. 

 Wall Street, which had been expecting the bank to post a profit of $1.34 per share, cut its consensus estimate to 67 cents per share after the profit warning in June, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks estimates. 

 Wachovia's provision for loan losses in the second quarter was $273.4 million, up from $74.5 million last year. Net interest income, after the provision for loan losses, fell 33 percent to $366 million as higher interest rates made it more expensive for the bank to borrow money and cut into revenues. Wachovia stock closed at 55-1/2 in Tuesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The Fed has been raising interest rates to try to cool down the U.S. economy and head off inflation.

 Software Concern Citrix Posts 48%  Decline  In 2nd-Quarter Profit

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Server-software developer Citrix Systems Inc., which issued a profit warning last month because of unexpected problems in its sales channels, reported a 46% decline in its second-quarter net income. 

 Citrix, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said net income came to $15 million, or seven cents a share, compared with $27.8 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 12% $106.1 million from $94.4 million a year earlier. 

 Citing problems at its sales channels, Citrix announced in June that it expected to report second-quarter profit of between nine cents and 11 cents a share, about half of the 21 cents a share Wall Street had expected. 

 The company blamed delays in closing deals with large corporations and a shift in the software purchasing cycle that delayed revenue bookings and left Citrix with too much inventory. The company also had said the process of setting up sales channels in Asia has been slower than expected. 

 Following the poor earnings outlook, Citrix's founder and chairman Edward E. Iacobucci resigned and Mark B. Templeton stepped down as chief executive officer. Citrix's former CEO Roger W. Roberts was named chairman and interim chief operating officer. Templetion kept his role as the company's president.

 (recasts lead, adds comments on currency effect from acting CFO in paragraph 18, CEO comments from conference call paragraph 8) 

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Computer services supplier Unisys Corp. said on Tuesday second-quarter net income fell to less than half what it was a year ago, and the company's stock skidded to a three-year low. 

 The company's results missed recently lowered earnings per share expectations by a penny. 

 Unisys cited delayed sales to customers who are mulling how to bring their operations online and said it doesn't expect sales to pick up until the fourth quarter. 

 Shares fell 2-3/4 to 11-3/16 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, a low the company has not seen since late summer of 1997. 

 The Blue Bell, Pa.-based company said second-quarter net income reached $56.3. million, or 18 cents a diluted share, compared with $118.0 million, or 37 cents, in the second quarter of 1999. Revenues fell 16 percent to $1.6 billion from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period. 

 As previously announced, the company took an after-tax charge of $19.8 million, or 6 cents per share, in the second quarter related to the early retirement of debt. 

 The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for 19 cents. The estimate was lowered when the company issued the profit warning last month. 

 Unisys has been forced to issue such warnings ahead of reporting its results in three quarters over the past year. Previously, it cited a slowdown in spending by customers ahead of the Year 2000 date changeover and a reorganization of the company's sales force as reasons for failing to meet earlier forecasts. 

 "We're very disappointed about falling short for several quarters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Weinbach in a conference call. "We're not going to sit here and blame the whole world. We need to execute better and faster." 

 He said customers have delayed purchasing decisions on complex electronic business projects while they work out their strategies for how to use the Web. Total worldwide orders showed double-digit declines in the second quarter versus a year ago. 

 "Unisys was late to embrace e-commerce offerings," said Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones. "The other issue is a lack of clarity by customers about what specifically to buy, install and do to get there (to the Web). And that lack of clarity is elongating the selling cycle." 

 The company's gross margin in the quarter declined to 30.1 percent from 32.3 in the first quarter while operating profit margins declined to 5.0 percent, down from 10.5 percent in the first quarter. Weinbach said higher-margin computers and services had suffered the most. 

 Revenue in the services business declined 18 percent and in the technology, or computer hardware business, sales declined 9 percent, the company said. 

 Weinbach said he is cautious about the near-term outlook, with third-quarter revenues expected to be lower than a year ago, and earnings per share below second-quarter levels. Revenues are expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, with earnings per share relatively flat with the year before, the company said. 

 "We remain cautious about our results over the near term, particularly in the third quarter, as we work through this transition in our business and conduct the necessary training to enhance the skills set of our employees," Weinbach said. 

 Weinbach added in a conference call that he was undertaking a 60-day performance review of the services business, and that the company has enacted a partial hiring freeze and has cut discretionary spending. 

 Jones said he had expected 2 percent revenue growth in the third quarter. 

 "Now it looks like (the third quarter) will be negative," he said. "We've got at least one more quarter before they get traction." referring to Unisys' ability to show stronger sales. 

 On a geographic basis, Unisys reported double-digit declines in both U.S. and international revenue in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

 On a constant currency basis, which negates the effect of currency exchange rates on sales, international revenue showed single-digit declines over the prior-year quarter. Overall, the currency effect knocked three percentage points off of the second-quarter revenue growth rate. 

 Acring Chief Financial Officer Janet Haugen will continue to lose three percentage points off of revenue and order growth rates in the the third and fourth quarters, as well as the full-year, due to currency exchange rates. 

 Internationally, revenue growth in Japan and Brazil was more than offset by declines in other geographic regions. 

 Unisys said it expects shipments of its new ES7000 servers, which manage heavy transactions loads on corporate networks, to increase in the fourth quarter and into 2001.

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - ISS Group Inc. , parent of Web security software provider Internet Security Systems Inc., on Tuesday posted second-quarter profits that nearly doubled, narrowly beating Wall Street expectations, on the back of strong licensing revenues. 

 Despite the better-than-expected results, ISS shares fell sharply in early afternoon trading on Nasdaq amid broader weakness in Web security stocks. One analyst also said the market was reacting to the perception that ISS would not immediately be seeing significant income from "intrusion detection" software and other new products. 

 Atlanta-based ISS said it earned $4.08 million, or 9 cents per diluted share, up from $2.13 million, or 5 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. 

 Analysts had been expecting it to earn 8 cents per share in the period ended June 30, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 ISS's total revenue for the second quarter grew 62 percent to $44.2 million, but the company said it suffered a 19 percent decrease in third-party product sales, affecting overall product license and sales growth. 

 However, the company said third-party product sales are "not a strategic emphasis of the company". 

 Shares of ISS were down 17, or about 16 percent, at 90, and the stock was Nasdaq's No. 4 net loser and the No. 4 percentage loser. 

 "The market is somewhat skittish about security stocks," Sands Brothers & Co. analyst David Zale said. "There is a weakness in the sector even if there is not a weakness in the companies." 

 Other Internet security software makers showing weakness included Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. , which was off 9-3/16 at 251-5/8; Entrust Technologies Inc. , down 1-5/8 at 32-1/16; WatchGuard Technologies Inc. , down 2-1/16 at 67-15/16; and RSA Security Inc. , down 1-1/2 at 66-3/8. 

 Entrust saw its stock battered and its ratings cut earlier this month after it issued a profit warning. 

 Zale said "the street wanted instant gratification" from ISS, but realised results from new products such as intrusion detection technology "were not imminent." 

 "The market is responding to the fact that the company had hyped a couple of significant growth drivers," he said. 

 Year-to-date revenues grew 66 percent to $50.25 million, and earnings per share doubled to 16 cents, up from 8 cents a year earlier.

 The company also said it was cautious about its near-term outlook, and doesn't expect sales to pick up until the fourth quarter.

 The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for 19 cents. A previous estimate was lowered when the company issued the profit warning last month. 

 Unisys has been forced to issue three such warnings ahead of reporting its results over the past year. Previously, it cited a slowdown in spending by customers ahead of the Year 2000 and a reorganization of the company's sales force as reasons for failing to meet earlier forecasts. 

 "As announced in late June, we have experienced a slower-than-expected rebound in our business over the first half of the year," said Unisys Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Weinbach. "While we continue to see high levels of proposal activity in our services business and strong interest in our new technology products, it is taking longer than anticipated to translate this activity into additional business." 

 He said customers have delayed purchasing decisions on complex electronic business projects while they work out their strategies for how to use the Web. Total worldwide orders showed double-digit declines in the second quarter versus. 

 The company's gross margin in the quarter declined to 30.1 percent from 32.3 in the first quarter while operating profit margins declined to 5.0 percent from 10.5 percent in the first quarter. 

 Revenue in the services business declined 18 percent and in the technology, or computer hardware business, sales declined 9 percent, the company said. 

 As previously announced, the company took an after-tax extraordinary charge of $19.8 million, or 6 cents per share, in the second quarter related to the early retirement of debt. 

 Weinbach said he is cautious about the near-term outlook, with third-quarter revenues expected to be lower than a year ago, and earnings per share below second-quarter levels. Revenues are expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, with earnings per share relatively flat with the year before, the company said. 

 "We remain cautious about our results over the near term, particularly in the third quarter, as we work through this transition in our business and conduct the necessary training to enhance the skills set of our employees," Weinbach said. 

 On a geographic basis, Unisys reported double-digit declines in both U.S. and international revenue in the second quarter compared to the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, which negates the effect of currency exchange rates on sales, international revenue showed single-digit declines over the prior-year quarter. 

 Internationally, revenue growth in Japan and Brazil was more than offset by declines in other geographic regions. 

 Unisys said it expects shipments of its new ES7000 servers, which are computers that manage heavy transactions loads on corporate networks, to increase in the fourth quarter and into 2001. 

 Results were announced before the open of trade. Shares were trading in pre-opening trade at 13, down from a close of 13-15/16, according to Instinet.

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Unisys Corp. on Tuesday said second-quarter net income was less than half what it was the year before, but roughly in line with recently lowered expectations, as the computer services supplier suffered from currency fluctuations and weak sales in the government and financial sectors. 

 The Blue Bell, Pa.-based company said second-quarter net income reached $56.3. million, or 18 cents a diluted share, compared with $118.0 million, or 37 cents, in the second quarter of 1999. Revenues fell 16 percent to $1.6 billion from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period.

 Unisys has been forced to issue such warnings before reporting its results in three quarters over the past year. Previously, it cited a slowdown in spending by customers ahead of the Year 2000 date changeover and a reorganization of the company's sales force as reasons for failing to meet earlier forecasts. 

 "As announced in late June, we have experienced a slower-than-expected rebound in our business over the first half of the year," said Unisys Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Weinbach. "While we continue to see high levels of proposal activity in our services business and strong interest in our new technology products, it is taking longer than anticipated to translate this activity into additional business." 

 He said customers have delayed purchasing decisions on complex electronic business projects while they complete their strategies.

 (recasts lead, adds comments on currency effect from acting CFO in paragraph 18, CEO comments from conference call paragraph 8) 

 NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Computer services supplier Unisys Corp. said on Tuesday second-quarter net income fell to less than half what it was a year ago, and the company's stock skidded to a three-year low. 

 The company's results missed recently lowered earnings per share expectations by a penny. 

 Unisys cited delayed sales to customers who are mulling how to bring their operations online and said it doesn't expect sales to pick up until the fourth quarter. 

 Shares fell 2-3/4 to 11-3/16 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, a low the company has not seen since late summer of 1997. 

 The Blue Bell, Pa.-based company said second-quarter net income reached $56.3. million, or 18 cents a diluted share, compared with $118.0 million, or 37 cents, in the second quarter of 1999. Revenues fell 16 percent to $1.6 billion from $1.9 billion in the year-ago period. 

 As previously announced, the company took an after-tax charge of $19.8 million, or 6 cents per share, in the second quarter related to the early retirement of debt. 

 The consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for 19 cents. The estimate was lowered when the company issued the profit warning last month. 

 Unisys has been forced to issue such warnings ahead of reporting its results in three quarters over the past year. Previously, it cited a slowdown in spending by customers ahead of the Year 2000 date changeover and a reorganization of the company's sales force as reasons for failing to meet earlier forecasts. 

 "We're very disappointed about falling short for several quarters," said Chairman and Chief Executive Lawrence Weinbach in a conference call. "We're not going to sit here and blame the whole world. We need to execute better and faster." 

 He said customers have delayed purchasing decisions on complex electronic business projects while they work out their strategies for how to use the Web. Total worldwide orders showed double-digit declines in the second quarter versus a year ago. 

 "Unisys was late to embrace e-commerce offerings," said Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones. "The other issue is a lack of clarity by customers about what specifically to buy, install and do to get there (to the Web). And that lack of clarity is elongating the selling cycle." 

 The company's gross margin in the quarter declined to 30.1 percent from 32.3 in the first quarter while operating profit margins declined to 5.0 percent, down from 10.5 percent in the first quarter. Weinbach said higher-margin computers and services had suffered the most. 

 Revenue in the services business declined 18 percent and in the technology, or computer hardware business, sales declined 9 percent, the company said. 

 Weinbach said he is cautious about the near-term outlook, with third-quarter revenues expected to be lower than a year ago, and earnings per share below second-quarter levels. Revenues are expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, with earnings per share relatively flat with the year before, the company said. 

 "We remain cautious about our results over the near term, particularly in the third quarter, as we work through this transition in our business and conduct the necessary training to enhance the skills set of our employees," Weinbach said. 

 Weinbach added in a conference call that he was undertaking a 60-day performance review of the services business, and that the company has enacted a partial hiring freeze and has cut discretionary spending. 

 Jones said he had expected 2 percent revenue growth in the third quarter. 

 "Now it looks like (the third quarter) will be negative," he said. "We've got at least one more quarter before they get traction." referring to Unisys' ability to show stronger sales. 

 On a geographic basis, Unisys reported double-digit declines in both U.S. and international revenue in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. 

 On a constant currency basis, which negates the effect of currency exchange rates on sales, international revenue showed single-digit declines over the prior-year quarter. Overall, the currency effect knocked three percentage points off of the second-quarter revenue growth rate. 

 Acring Chief Financial Officer Janet Haugen will continue to lose three percentage points off of revenue and order growth rates in the the third and fourth quarters, as well as the full-year, due to currency exchange rates. 

 Internationally, revenue growth in Japan and Brazil was more than offset by declines in other geographic regions. 

 Unisys said it expects shipments of its new ES7000 servers, which manage heavy transactions loads on corporate networks, to increase in the fourth quarter and into 2001.

 Dana's 2nd-Quarter Earnings Meet Lowered Expectations

 TOLEDO, Ohio -(Dow Jones)- Dana Corp., maker of auto parts and machinery components, reported a 24% decline in second-quarter net income, in line with analysts' diminished expectations, as weakness in the automotive-aftermarkets business weighed on resuults. 

 Dana (DCN) said net income came to $145 million, or 95 cents a diluted share, compared with $190 million, or $1.14 a share, for the same period a year earlier. Sales fell 3.6% to $3.29 billion from $3.41 billion. 

 Excluding one-time expenses of $9.6 million, the company earned $154 million, or $1.01 a share, a penny above the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Dana blamed the decline in sales on recent divestitures. The company said that over the past 12 months it has unloaded nonstrategic or nonperforming businesses that had annual revenue of more than $850 million. 

 Confirming reasons Dana gave last month for the expected profit shortfall, the company said second-quarter results were hurt by softness in its automotive aftermarket group in North America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. After the company's warning in late June, analysts lowered their estimates. 

 Dana also said systems complications encountered during consolidation of the group's engine controls warehouse network hurt second-quarter results. 

 "While these factors will continue to impact our results during the second half, we have remediation plans in place and are beginning to see positive results," Dana Chairman and Chief Executive Joe Magliochetti said in a prepared statement. "Additionally, we expect that the solid performance of our other six business units and the benefit of our stock repurchase program will help to offset a portion of any aftermarket-related shortfall," he added.

 U.S steel makers expected to show modest quarterly gains. 

     By Claudia Grisales

     NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - The top U.S. steel makers are 

 expected to show only modest improvement in the second quarter 

 after a robust start, held back by weak seasonal demand, a 

 strong dollar and a year of rising interest rates. 

     "It's sort of a quarter that started out hopeful and ended 

 up depressing," said Richard Aldrich, industry analyst at 

 Lehman Brothers. "Things are better year over year, but things 

 turned for the worse during the quarter." 

     Steel makers are already battling intensified competition 

 from foreign producers because the strong U.S. dollar has made 

 domestic companies far less competitive because it tends to 

 make imported steel cheaper. 

     But as the second quarter progressed, clear signs of 

 flagging domestic demand emerged as well -- at least in part 

 because the Federal Reserve's series of six interest rate 

 increases since June 1999 have cooled the sizzling U.S. 

 economy. 

     Even as late as March, most steel buyers remained bullish 

 on the economic outlook, but sentiment has appeared to take a 

 "nasty turn" since then, said analyst Michelle Galanter 

 Applebaum in a Salomon Smith Barney survey report. 

     Of those surveyed by Salomon, 48 percent of the steel 

 buyers expected their customers to trim inventories, compared 

 with 20 percent in March. The trend points to normal seasonal 

 weakness in steel demand as well as buyers' expectations that 

 the economy is slowing, the report said. 

     PRICES RECEDE WITH DEMAND 

     Among steel customers, inventories increased after reports 

 of robust demand in the first quarter, with major buyers 

 scrambling to stock up in an effort to beat price increases 

 forecast earlier in the year. 

     But in the event, steel prices have started to decline

 along with demand, Applebaum said. For producers, hot-rolled 

 sheets, used for automobiles, was the weakest product in terms 

 of pricing. 

     Even though the trend points to modest improvement in the 

 performances of most steel producers, a mixed picture emerges 

 when looking at the individual companies, with about half still 

 expected to be mired in red ink. 


    Bethlehem Steel Corp.	  is expected to improve from



last year's loss of 31 cents a share, though it is still



expected to post a loss of 2 cents for the second quarter,



according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson



Financial.



    After a profit warning last month, National Steel Corp.



 is expected to post a loss of 45 cents per share, versus



11 cents per share a year ago.



    "National Steel had a very disappointing pre-annoucement where



people were thinking they would be profitable instead of losing



money," Aldrich said.



    Cleveland-based LTV Corp. is also expected to post a wider



second-quarter loss of 35 cents per share versus a loss of 19



cents a year earlier.



    But companies such Nucor Corp.	  , a leading operator



of steel mini-mills, and USX-U.S. Steel continue to pull



away from a mid-1998 slump.



    Nucor is expected to post earnings of $1 per share versus



58 cents the same period a year ago. USX-U.S. Steel Group is



seen improving to 70 cents a share versus 34 cents.



    LOOKING AHEAD



   "There is some big concern going into the third quarter,"



Todd Hinrichs, an analyst at ABN Amro, said. "But that said,



the stocks are so dog-gone cheap, somewhere in here is a buying



opportunity."



    With second-quarter forecasts already trimmed, analysts



have lowered their earnings estimates for the second half of



the year. The third quarter is traditionally the weakest



quarter for steel makers in terms of seasonal demand, so the



industry may not regain its stride until the fourth quarter at



the earliest.



    "The third quarter will be definitely weaker than the



second quarter," Hinrichs said. "Fourth quarter you tend to see



some seasonal strength. Whether that strength is strong enough



to push things along is hard to say right now."



     If market conditions allow for a weaker U.S. dollar as



well as lower steel prices, imports and inventories, steel



stocks could rally, Aldrich said.



    "If the Fed doesn't keep raising rates that will improve



consumer confidence," he added. "That would help."



     The following shows First Call/Thomson Financial



second-quarter earnings-per-share estimates for U.S. steel



companies, as well as reported results for the second-quarter

 New Jersey-Based Packaging Firm Is the Latest to Falter from Earnings Warning 

 David Schwab

 Last July, Stewart Scharf, an analyst at Standard & Poor's, was vacationing in the Hamptons when he turned on CNBC and learned that one of the 30 companies he follows had issued a profit warning. 

 By the end of the day, shares of the company, Waste Management Inc., had tumbled 35 percent. 

 With that in mind, this July he cut his vacation short. It's a good thing. 

 As he settled into his cubicle on the 44th floor of his lower Manhattan building shortly after 8 a.m. on July 6, Scharf's computer screen alerted him to another warning on his beat -- this one from New Jersey-based Sealed Air Corp., a global leader in the packaging business and the inventor of Bubble Wrap. 

 "This time I was prepared for it," said Scharf, who would dash off a note downgrading the stock from "accumulate" to "hold." "I think my colleagues were relieved to know I was in the office." 

 Sealed Air was just the latest company to disappoint Wall Street -- that is, Scharf and the 12 other analysts who regularly follow the company and whose quarterly earnings estimates are collected for investors and widely reported by numerous financial organizations. 

 What happened in the case of Sealed Air shows what can become of any company that disappoints Wall Street in these days of instantaneous communications and heightened expectations. 

 And it's happening more and more. Five years ago, there were 715 so-called "pre-announcements" from the 6,000 publicly traded companies surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts estimates. Last year there were more than 3,000. About 60 percent report bad news. 

 The proliferation of earnings warnings is also raising questions of fairness. Critics say small-scale individual investors don't have the second-by-second financial information available to institutional fund managers and Wall Street traders. 

 There's also concern, voiced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and others, that companies sometimes announce profit warnings and other bad news to select major analysts and shareholders. In the spring, for example, AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive C. Michael Armstrong reportedly told two top telecommunication analysts of an impending warning because he wanted their thoughts on the likely reaction. 

 "It still remains a little bit of an insiders' club," said Eli Neusner, senior analyst at MetaMarkets.com, a Web site for online investors. "It's just not fair for the individual investor." 

 For Sealed Air, things came to a head Wednesday, July 5, when executives concluded they had disappointing news about the quarter that ended June 30. 

 They huddled at the company's headquarters in Saddle Brook and quickly drafted two paragraphs for a press release, which was sent over the Dow Jones news wire at 8:51 p.m. The late hour meant some analysts, like Scharf, didn't see it until first thing the next morning. 

 In the statement, the company said second-quarter earnings would rise at least 5 percent, or at least 2 cents a share above the 44 cents it made in the same period a year ago. 

 The forecast was less than the company earlier had led analysts to believe. The consensus estimate called for the company to earn 52 cents a share -- an 18 percent increase over the year before. 

 The company blamed a 25 percent increase in the cost of raw materials -- the resin pellets melted down to make plastic packaging products. 

 When companies issue pre-earnings releases -- part of putting the best spin on potentially bad news -- they quickly set in motion a process that includes hurried telephone calls from analysts to senior company executives seeking more details, or "guidance," to help them revise earnings estimates. Their reports are passed quickly to clients and brokers. 

 The morning after Sealed Air's announcement, on July 6, news of the earnings shortfall flashed across television screens tuned to CNBC, and trading was briefly halted on the New York Stock Exchange because of the flood of sell orders. 

 Sealed Air's shares fell as much as 19 percent early in the session before rebounding later in the day. At 4 p.m., the stock closed down $4.25, or 7.9 percent, at $49.88. 

 The bottom line: A company ranked No. 524 on the Fortune 1,000 lost $350 million in market value in 61/2 hours of trading. 

 Some investor relations experts say companies have no better option to handle bad news. 

 "There is no more efficient dissemination method we have come up with, short of every shareholder with a pager," said Matt Clawson, a vice president at Allen & Caron Inc. in New York, which handles investor relations for 30 publicly traded companies. 

 Companies must walk a tightrope, he said. The SEC requires prompt and widespread dissemination of news. But a company must maintain good relations with Wall Street analysts who recommend their stock, and some of them may be embarrassed if they've made a wrong call. 

 Mismanaging an earnings announcement can be more damaging than the actual news because it can sour relations with Wall Street, and in some cases generate enough poor publicity to cut sales, some experts say. 

 By pre-announcing, they say, companies give analysts and Wall Street time to make sense of the information before the company formally announces its earnings for the quarter, generally several weeks later. 

 Things are getting better for the average investor. In the old days, before financial data was widely available via the Web or electronic media, an investor might not learn about a problem until the next day's newspaper. Now, there are dozens of Internet sites and other media outlets to help smaller investors track news. 

 For analysts and investors, earnings surprises have become a part of doing business. 

 Rising share prices and volatile stock markets have forced investors to scrutinize every bit of financial information. There's always a fear of shareholder lawsuits if companies don't fess up soon enough. 

 More than 400 companies have pre-announced this quarter, down slightly from a year ago, when some companies were suffering lingering effects from the Asian financial crisis. Many of those with bad news this quarter are in the basic materials sectors, whose raw materials are more expensive due to rising energy costs, according to Joseph Cooper, research manager at First Call. 

 Analysts -- who often begin their days during the confession season by checking "to see if anything is blowing up" -- know the drill well. The news from Sealed Air that popped up on their computer screens was big, but they weren't sure how the market would react. 

 An earnings disappointment for Sealed Air was unusual because the company had a history of steady growth and of avoiding precisely these sorts of surprises, analysts said. Just a week before, Mark Gulley, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, had reiterated his "buy" rating. 

 Many of the analysts also knew resin prices were a concern, since a basic ingredient in resin is oil or natural gas, and energy prices had soared during the quarter. The announcement appeared to be a one-time hit, and earnings were still growing, albeit at a slower pace. 

 There didn't seem to be any reason to believe there was something fundamentally wrong with the company or its strategy. This didn't seem to be another Lucent. On Jan. 6, Lucent Technologies Inc. saw its shares fall 28 percent after announcing lower earnings, surprising analysts by saying it couldn't build some equipment fast enough and some customer orders were delayed. 

 As analysts were digesting the latest news on Sealed Air, it was all over CNBC. When the bell sounded on the Big Board at 9:30 a.m., trading of Sealed Air shares, under the ticker symbol SEE, was halted for about 45 minutes. 

 The stock opened at $48.75, down 9.9 percent from its $54.13 close the day before. By 10:45 a.m., shares bottomed out at $44, a slide of 18.6 percent. On May 25, shares had been at $57.69. 

 More than 6 million shares were traded that day, 10 times the daily average, much of it from some big institutional players and momentum-driven traders programmed to dump stocks that disappoint --not necessarily your average investors. 

 "I think the stock traded really badly," said Linda Bolton Weiser, a senior equity analyst at HD Grous & Co. Inc. in Great Neck, N.Y., who has been following the company for four years. "There is no reason for a stock to trade down 16 percent during the day and end up down only 8 percent. That shows the information wasn't flowing too evenly." 

 Because the company chose not to have a conference call with analysts, Weiser had to wait until late in the day for a call back to answer her questions -- after Sealed Air responded to bigger investment firms. 

 Nevertheless, the stock quickly rebounded as analysts and institutional investors became convinced the problem was "just raw materials," she said. She reiterated her "buy" rating. 

 In the end, S&P's Scharf was the only analyst to downgrade the stock, according to Sealed Air. Shares actually closed at 4 p.m. more than a dollar higher than when trading began. 

 Weiser said she got a whiff of what was coming on June 13, when she last spoke with company officials. J. Ryan Flanagan, the company's director of investor relations, noted that price increases Sealed Air announced in April were providing only a modest boost for the second quarter. The problem is, you can't raise prices for all your customers at once. It looked like the company "might barely scrape by and make the quarter," she said. 

 In an interview, Flanagan said Sealed Air knew June would be an important month. But the company "couldn't conclude (there) was an issue until the end of the month." 

 Analysts are divided over how long it may take for the stock price to rebound, which may hinge in part on what earnings Sealed Air actually reports later this month. The stock closed Friday at $49.38, up 56 cents. 

 "I could see it back in the mid 50s or even the low 60s by the end of the year," said Daniel Khoshaba, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 

 Two months before the pre-announcement, Khoshaba had initiated coverage of the company with a "buy" recommendation, predicting the stock would hit $70 within a year. After Sealed Air dropped its bombshell, he reiterated his "buy" recommendation. Some clients made money that day buying at $45 and $46 a share, he said. 

 "These kind of events basically test your mettle," he said.

 The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission plans to review what it calls the price-cap regime for charges on local phone service. 

 The current regime, which came into effect in January, 1998 for a four-year period, limited price increases for local telephone services by using a formula pegged to the inflation rate. At that time, the commission said it would review the regime before the period ended. 

 "This is the first stage to get an idea of what works, what doesn't work," John Macri, a director in the telecommunications branch at the commission, said yesterday. "One of the things we wanted the regime to do was to allow competition to evolve. Is it doing that?" 

 The regulator wants to receive comments from the public and telephone-service providers by Sept. 11. 

 Papers go to Cox 

 Information-services giant Thomson Corp. is selling its southwest Ohio newspapers to Cox Newspapers, not to Gannett Co. as was announced last month. 

 Thomson said yesterday Cox Newspapers exercised its right of first refusal on those newspaper properties, which include two dailies, the Middletown Journal and the Journal-News in Hamilton, and 10 non-dailies. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed. 

 Thomson expects the sale to be completed during the third quarter. Gannett will still acquire 19 dailies and 23 non-dailies in groups located in central Ohio, Louisiana, Chesapeake, Maryland, Wisconsin and Utah. 

 Russia to cut DeBeers ties 

 MOSCOW (AP) - Russia will not renew its exclusive agreement to sell diamonds to the South African monopoly De Beers Consolidated Mines when the current contract expires in 2001, a Russian official said yesterday. 

 The current agreement, which puts a strict cap on Russian exports, is stunting Russia's mining and cutting industry, said Valery Rudakov, chief of the country's precious gems reserves. 

 Russia is ready to sell diamonds independently, he said, according to the Interfax news agency. The announcement came ahead of a World Diamond Congress meeting in Antwerp, Belgium next week. 

 The present deal limits Russian rough gem exports to 26 per cent of De Beers' total sales, said Rudakov. 

 The new agreement will encourage Russia and De Beers to consult and co-operate, but "won't have the character of strict mutual obligations on sale volumes," Interfax quoted him as saying. 

 Russia produces about 20 per cent of the world's diamonds and has vast untapped reserves, including the estimated $12 billion US worth at the Lomonosov field in the Arctic. 

 Coffee crop hurt 

 Brazil's state of Parana has lost 35 per cent of its forthcoming 2001 coffee crop after dawn frosts this week damaged 400 million trees, the agriculture ministry said yesterday. 

 Agronomists, however, tended to be more skeptical about how quickly frost damage to trees can be quantified in terms of final coffee production. 

 Respected private forecaster Leon Yallouz told Reuters in an interview last year that final crop damage depends on the length of the trees' over-all exposure and could be properly known only a week after the cold snap. 

 Parana grows around 8 per cent of Brazil's coffee crop, the world's largest. 

 Holders sue Xerox 

 Shareholders have filed a lawsuit seeking "tens of millions of dollars" in damages against Xerox Corp. for alleged "wrongful business practices" in Mexico, the photocopier and office equipment maker said. 

 The complaint, filed July 5 in New York State Supreme Court, alleges Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., inadequately supervised and failed to instruct workers and managers and took no legal steps against those responsible for problems with bill collection in Mexico. 

 The company issued a second-quarter profit warning in June, citing problems in Mexico related to customer receivables, or unpaid bills. The lawsuit, revealed yesterday in documents Xerox filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, came a week after the company announced U.S. securities regulators were investigating accounting practices at its Mexican business. 

 The shareholders said they have suffered damages that would exceed "tens of millions of dollars," Xerox said in the filing, which did not identify the shareholders. 

 Xerox, which employs 3,000 workers in five Mexican cities, has said it is co-operating with the investigation.

 LONDON, July 14 (Reuters) - Shares in jewellery retailer Signet Group Plc dropped in robust early trade on Friday as investors sold the stock in response to losses prompted by a U.S. competitor's profit warning, dealers said. 

 Signet shares were trading 7.7 percent or 4-1/2 pence lower at 54-1/4p by 0912 GMT on significant early volume of 5.9 million. 

 Shares of Whitehall Jewellers Inc. in the United States fell more than 50 percent on Thursday after it forecast disappointing sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter and continued softness in results through the third quarter. 

 The slowdown in sales was primarily a result of a decline in overall unit sales which was driven by a reduced number of impulse purchases, Whitehall said. 

 Shares of Whitehall's U.S. rivals also fell with Zale Corp. off $4-1/16 at $40-11/16 and Tiffany & Co Inc. down $2-1/8 to $74-3/4. 

 Signet, which operates the H Samuel and Ernest Jones stores in Britain and Kay stores in the United States, where it earned two thirds of last year's revenues. 

 Its shares were 9.6 percent down on the year to date at Thursday's close, underperforming the FTSE All Share Index by 5.5 percent according to Reuters Securities 3000 data. ((Patrick Chalmers, London newsroom, +44 20 7542 4365 fax 7542 2120 uk.equities.news@reuters.com)).

 US drugs news hurts sector.

 Market forces 

 News that the United States might use the long arm of the law to crack down on expensive drugs rocked the pharmaceutical sector and the wider market yesterday. 

 The share prices of the big drug companies fell as investors had their first chance to react to a proposal made by the chairman of the senate finance committee to offer drug coverage to all the 39m beneficiaries of Medicare. 

 Analysts said that greater state participation in drug management raised the prospect of the US government trying to force down drug prices, either through legislation or buying power. Goldman Sachs said the proposal supported `a neutral at best" stance towards the sector. 

 Glaxo Wellcome shares were the worst affected, shedding 63p to #19.11, closely followed by AstraZeneca, off 98p at #30.82, and SmithKline Beecham, down 26p to 869p. 

 Undermined by the weak performance of the three pharmaceutical firms, the main FTSE 100 ended 42.8 points easier at 6,475.7. 

 Technology stocks were the best blue-chip performers, aided by the continued strength of the Nasdaq, which is now back above the 4,000-point level. 

 Freeserve led the pack, rising 21.5p to 335.5p amid speculation that takeover talks with Germany's T-Online might be back on track. 

 Strong figures from US firm Motorola underpinned the advance in chip designer ARM Holdings, up 41.5p at 766.5p. Analysts at CSFB expected ARM to report strong figures next week for the first half. 

 With worries of a profit warning banished, accountancy software group Sage continued to shine, gaining 27p to close at 580p. 

 Compass appreciated 20p to 818p after Goldman Sachs highlighted its attractions. With a market value now available for Granada Media, Goldman estimates that Compass's management has effectively acquired Granada's roadside and contract catering assets for less than half of what they are worth. 

 News that Diageo is discussing a potential merger of its Pillsbury food division with US group General Mills failed to inspire. The shares closed down 12.5p at 599p. 

 British Airways rose 7p to 389p following a broadly positive assessment of the benefits of a merger with Dutch carrier KLM. Dresdner Kleinwort Benson said that although the deal was not the perfect solution it addressed both companies' strategic weaknesses and might even provide BA with an alternative to US partner American Airlines. 

 Among second-tier stocks, Independent Energy continued its upward march, adding 117.5p to 865p. The company has reportedly applied to the government for permission to build a 220-megawatt power station in Kent. 

 NXT, the audio equipment group, surged 70p to #11.35 after signing a speech processing technology deal with the BBC. A positive reaction to its recent acquisition of Canadian group Teklogix boosted Psion 45p to 710p. 

 On the downside, building materials group RMC slipped 65.5p to 733p as analysts took the red pen to forecasts after a trading update. Deutsche Bank said it would cut its full-year pre-tax profit estimate by 10-15%. 

 IMI sank 20p to 220p after Merrill Lynch lowered its rating and Airtours dropped 53p to 254p following a shock profits warning. 

 European Motor Holdings fared better, shooting up 9.5p to 55.5p with the appearance of Trefick on its shareholder register. Trefick has acquired a 5.67% stake. 

 Glass manufacturer Darby Group, which finished the session down 0.25p at 11.5p, attracted attention after 22.9m shares changed hands. The company said Swedish investor Peter Gyllenhammar had taken a 16% stake in the company. Mr Gyllenhammar specialises in making investments in small, undervalued companies.

 Pathmark Files for Bankruptcy / Action frees supermarket chain from $1B debt, allows for expansion

 Now that Pathmark has filed for bankruptcy, freeing it from $1 billion in debt and hefty interest payments, the company said it plans to open three to five stores on Long Island and in Queens over the next three years. 

 Harvey Gutman, senior vice president for retail development, also said that at least 15 area Pathmark outlets will undergo major renovations during that period. 

 "Our new capital structure will allow us to open new stores, modernize existing stores and be more aggressive in our merchandising program," Gutman said. 

 While Pathmark sees its latest move as a step to recovery, others still see major problems -and even an eventual sale -looming. The New York supermarket industry is very cut-throat and shoppers price conscious, making it difficult for any operator to prosper. 

 Pathmark, based in Carteret, N.J., filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday to lift a crushing load of nearly $2 billion of debt, which the chain has carried since its 1987 leveraged buyout. The company struggled to keep up with its interest payments, which totaled $163 million last year, $30 million more than its operating earnings. 

 The company had hoped to solve its problems by selling itself to Royal Ahold, a Dutch company that operates the Edwards supermarket chain. But the deal fell through last year after hitting federal regulatory snags. 

 Under the terms of the pre-packaged reorganization, which 99 percent of bondholders have already approved, Pathmark will swap $1 billion in debt for equity, leaving it with $1 billion in debt. The company said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy within 75 days as a public company with a healthier balance sheet. It has already secured $675 million from Chase Manhattan Bank to operate during its bankruptcy and after it reorganizes. 

 The company has said there will be no store closings or layoffs, and all vendors will be paid. 

 Not everyone, however, will emerge unscathed. Those involved in the LBO-Merrill Lynch, The Equitable Cos. and the then-management team -will lose their entire $100 million investment. Preferred stock holders, comprised of institutions and individuals who own five million shares bought between $2 and $40, will split a $500,000 pool. And bondholders will receive between 20 percent and 100 percent of the value of their investment. 

 Despite its problems, Pathmark has been expanding. The company, which has 24 stores on Long Island and five in Queens, among its 136 locations in the mid-Atlantic region, opened a new store in March in Springfield Gardens. It plans to open five more in the city by the end of 2001, including one in the Bronx this weekend. 

 Pathmark is not the only supermarket chain to seek bankruptcy protection. Several, including regional operator Grand Union, have filed in recent years. In Grand Union's case, the move did not succeed and the company is now on the market. 

 Pathmark, however, maintains it has healthy operations and said those who stick with Pathmark will prosper after the reorganization. Some analysts and industry observers agree. 

 "It has a good franchise," said David Orgel, editor of Supermarket News, a weekly trade publication in Manhattan. "Royal Ahold would not have gone after it if [Ahold] didn't think Pathmark had potential." 

 Unlike some other area groceries, Pathmark has large, productive stores with one of the highest sales per square foot in the nation, said Robert Goch, analyst with Miller Tabak Roberts Securities in New York. 

 But not everyone is as enthusiastic about Pathmark's prospects. Most area supermarket chains are struggling. In addition to Pathmark's bankruptcy and Grand Union's putting itself up for sale, Royal Ahold is eliminating its Edwards brand in favor of the more desirable Stop & Shop, and A&P recently issued a profit warning. 

 "This [reorganization] was Pathmark's last resort," said Jules Rose, president of Marketing Strategies, a Sarasota, Fla. firm that follows the industry. "You don't do your best thing last."

 Applied Micro Circuits, Pepsi Rise; Industrials Post a Slight Increase

 NEW YORK -- Earnings strength fortified the growing confidence in the technology sector, which rallied impressively, even though the rest of the market moped through the session.   

 Shares of several companies that reported upbeat profits after trading concluded Wednesday found buyers willing to pay escalating prices after the companies posted upbeat profit statements.   

 Applied Micro Circuits (Nasdaq), one of the high-tech growth stocks whose share price swooned in the second quarter, got back in range of its March highs, rallying 28 1/16 to 153 1/2, just shy of its high of 158 7/8, reached March 27.   

 Internet software maker Ariba (Nasdaq), another tech name that had a dizzying rise in March and a stunning slide in April, also rallied back on stellar earnings, climbing 27 11/16 to 131 3/16. Rational Software (Nasdaq), meanwhile, managed to eclipse the 52-week high it set in March, finishing at 113 1/8 after a gain of 20 7/16.   

 Powered by those big gains, as well as big advances from rival technology companies now expected to post upside earnings surprises when those numbers come out later in this reporting cycle, the Nasdaq Composite Index shot up 75.27, or 1.84%, to close at 4174.86.   

 Impressive as those gains proved to be, though, the technology sector's success came at the expense of the rest of the market. Some groups, such as drug stocks, fell sharply on the session, as investors raised cash in those areas to pay for investments in high technology.   

 Merck fell 4 5/16 to 69 1/16, while Eli Lilly declined 4 1/4 to 95 3/4.   

 "Companies in the health-care or consumer-products areas, for example, are producing nice earnings gains," Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "But the truly dynamic earnings growth is coming from technology companies, and that is why we find ourselves in this tech-driven market."   

 Consumer companies that did report their profits in the session didn't get the kind of reaction from investors that technology issues garnered. PepsiCo, for example, finished 5/8 higher at 40 3/8, after reporting that its profits grew 21% in the second quarter, coming in stronger than analysts anticipated.   

 General Electric fell 7/8 to 52 3/8, even though the Fairfield, Conn., industrial and entertainment giant posted second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's projections by a penny a share.   

 Maytag came through with profits that topped forecasts by a penny a share, but the stock ended down 7/16 at 38 7/8.   

 J.P. Morgan rose 1 9/16 to 124 1/8, after the banking giant reported second-quarter earnings that handily topped what Wall Street had expected.   

 Helped by that contribution, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.3, or 0.05%, to 10788.71.   

 Not all the profit statements from technology companies captured Wall Street's heart. Three Five Systems, a Tempe, Ariz., maker of liquid-crystal-display products, sank 31 5/8 to 33 9/16, after the company accompanied its second-quarter earnings release with a warning that its revenue is expected to decline in the second half of this year.   

 Motorola rose 3 7/8 to 39 1/4. The Schaumburg, Ill., semiconductor and cellularphone maker reported results late Wednesday that lived up to analysts' forecasts.   

 Tollgrade Communications (Nasdaq) jumped 28 3/64 to 166 19/64. The Cheswick, Pa., developer of telecommunications network test systems reported second-quarter profits of 54 cents a share, well ahead of analysts' projections of a 31-cent profit.   

 Numerical Technologies (Nasdaq) added 2 9/16 to 65, reaching a 52-week high. Credit Suisse First Boston published an upbeat research note, forecasting better-than-expected quarterly results from the San Jose, Calif., semiconductor technology concern; after the close of trading, the company issued quarterly results that beat forecasts.   

 Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq) rose 6 3/4 to 86 11/16. After the close, the Camarillo, Calif., chip maker reported fiscal third-quarter results that matched Wall Street's forecasts.   

 RealNetworks (Nasdaq) climbed 5 3/16 to 51 15/16. America Online agreed to install software from the Seattle Internet software developer in what may be the biggest deployment yet of software that can broadcast audio and video over the Internet.   

 AOL, Dulles, Va., gained 5/16 to 58 3/8.   

 Celestica gained 6 5/8 to 58 5/8. The Canadian contract electronics manufacturer late Wednesday said it will manufacture subassemblies for optical amplifiers under a contract with JDS Uniphase that gives Celestica an exposure to the growing fiberoptics business.   

 VeriSign (Nasdaq), up 7% Wednesday, rallied further, gaining 15 3/16, or 8.5%, to 192 7/8. UBS Warburg started coverage of the Mountain View, Calif., Internet-security concern.   

 Tyco International increased 2 7/8 to 51 3/8. The Bermuda-based conglomerate run out of Exeter, N.H., said it received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division saying the agency ended its informal investigation of the company's accounting practices.   

 Schering-Plough fell 4 5/16 to 44 in a session of sharp losses by drug stocks. The decline came one day after the Madison, N.J., pharmaceuticals concern told analysts at a meeting the company sponsored Wednesday that its earnings growth is slowing down after several years of growing at 20% or more.   

 Jones Pharma (Nasdaq) fell 3 3/4 to 40. King Pharmaceuticals agreed to merge with the St. Louis drug maker in a pact that values Jones shares at $51.12 a share, for a total of $3.4 billion. King Pharmaceuticals, Bristol, Tenn., declined 8 7/8 to 36 9/16.   

 Guidant added 3 9/16 to 50. The Indianapolis medical-device maker said that it expected its second-quarter earnings to live up to analysts' targets, easing some fears surrounding the competitive threat from Johnson & Johnson in the coronarystent market.   

 J&J fell 2 13/16 to 95 1/4.   

 Six Flags gained 7/8 to 23 1/4. The Oklahoma City, Okla., amusement-park operator received a favorable ruling in a Georgia state court case against Time Warner, which sold its interest in the Six Flags amusement park operation to Six Flags' predecessor company, Premier Parks.   

 Time Warner, which rose 2 9/16 to 84 11/16, said it would take a $50 million charge in the second quarter as a result of the court decision.   

 The American depositary shares of Diageo, the British food-products giant, fell 9/16 to 36 5/16. The company is talking with U.S. cereal maker General Mills about merging its Pillsbury food division with General Mills in a deal valued at about $11 billion.   

 WorldCom (Nasdaq) moved up 3 7/16 to 47 15/16, while Sprint rose 5/8 to 47 15/16, after the companies acknowledged that they officially halted their controversial merger plans.   

 Deere added 1 1/4 to 39 7/8. Bear Stearns reiterated its buy rating on the Moline, Ill., farm-equipment maker, saying that strong performance in the last two months could lead to better-than-expected results for the quarter.

 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Building materials maker Owens Corning Corp. on Thursday said second-quarter earnings dropped nearly 20 percent, and blamed a weaker housing market, rising costs and a $1 billion charge related to asbestos liability. 

 The Toledo, Ohio-based company, which issued a profit warning for the quarter on June 26, said earnings in the three months ended June 30 fell to $61 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, 4 cents above analyst and company expectations. 

 This compared to profits of $76 million, or $1.31 per share, in the year-ago quarter, excluding extraordinary items. 

 Revenues in the latest period fell slightly to $1.295 billion from $1.310 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

 Analysts on average had estimated earnings at $1.00 per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, a research firm that tracks such forecasts. The stock fell 1/2 to 8-3/4 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a new 52-week low. 

 Analysts had been expecting lower earnings after the company issued its earnings warning last month. 

 "There should be no surprises," said Ivy Zelman, analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, before the announcement. 

 "(Earnings) were pretty much in line with what we were expecting, which was a buck," said analyst John Stanley, analyst for UBS Warburg, who rates the stock a "buy." 

 Including the charge for the addition to the asbestos litigation reserve and the $210 million pretax gain from the insurance recovery, the company had a net loss for the second quarter of $425 million, or $7.76 per share. 

 The company said the decline reflected weaker demand in its roofing, siding and insulation businesses amid a slowdown in the housing market after a series of interest rate increases.

 A corrected version follows: 

 NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Building materials maker Owens Corning Corp. on Thursday said second-quarter earnings dropped nearly 20 percent, as a weaker housing market, rising costs and a $1 billion charge related to asbestos liability dampened its bottom line. 

 The Toledo, Ohio-based company, which issued a second-quarter profit warning on June 26, said profits in the three months ended June 30 fell to $61 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. This compared to profits of $76 million, or $1.31 per share, in the year-ago quarter, excluding extraordinary items. 

 Revenues in the latest period fell slightly to $1.295 billion from $1.310 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

 Analysts on average had estimated earnings at $1.00, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, a research firm that tracks such forecasts. On Wednesday, the stock fell 1/8 to 9-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange, just above its 52-week low of 9. 

 Including the charge for the addition to the asbestos litigation reserve and the $210 million pretax gain from the insurance recovery, the company had a net loss for the second quarter of $425 million, or $7.76 per share. 

 The company said the decline reflected weaker demand in its roofing, siding and insulation businesses amid a slowdown in the housing market after a series of interest rate increases.

 UPDATE 1-Whitehall shares off 50 pct after warning.

 CHICAGO, July 13 (Reuters) - Shares of Whitehall Jewellers Inc. fell more than 50 percent on Thursday after the jewelry retailer forecast disappointing sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, as well as continued softness in results through the third quarter. 

 Shares of Whitehall were off 9-1/8 at 8-1/2 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, the stock scored a fresh 52-week low of 8-1/16. 

 Whitehall said that, due to lower-than-expected sales, it sees second-quarter earnings of 2 to 5 cents per share, down from 15 cents a year earlier. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the jewelry retailer to report second quarter earnings of 18 cents a share. 

 Whitehall said same-store sales are expected to be flat to slightly lower in the quarter, compared with a 12.3 percent increase last year. Total sales for the quarter ended July 31, 2000 are expected to range from $73 million to $75 million, compared with $65.9 million a year earlier, the company said. 

 The slowdown in sales was primarily a result of a decline in overall unit sales which was driven by a reduced number of impulse purchases, Whitehall said. 

 Whitehall also said it expects continued sales and earnings softness through the third quarter. 

 One Wall Street analyst said the sluggish impulse sales could be viewed as a sign that higher interest rates are slowing consumer spending of luxury purchases like jewelry. 

 "This indicates the consumer could be negatively impacted by the series of six (interest) rate hikes," Lazard analyst Todd Slater wrote in a research note. "This revelation could impact the entire jewelry sector, especially if the slowdown proceeds into the fourth quarter, which represents 80 percent of the year's earnings." 

 In response to the profit warning, Slater lowered his rating on Whitehall to hold from outperform, and cut his 12-to 18-month price target to $20 from $28. 

 Shares of Whitehall's competitors also fell. Zale Corp.'s were off 4-1/16 at 40-11/16 and shares of Tiffany & Co Inc. fell 2-1/8 to 74-3/4, both in trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Whitehall operates 319 shopping mall-based stores in 35 states under the names Whitehall Co. Jewellers, Lundstrom Jewellers and Marks Bros. Jewellers. ((-Chicago Equities News at 312-408-8787, chicago.equities.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 TOLEDO, Ohio, June 26 (Reuters) - Building materials maker Owens Corning Corp. on Thursday said second-quarter earnings dropped nearly 20 percent, as a weaker housing market, rising costs and a $1 billion charge related to asbestos liability dampened its bottom line. 

 The company, which issued a second-quarter profit warning on June 26, said profits in the three months ended June 30 fell to $61 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. This compared to profits of $76 million, or $1.31 per share, in the year-ago quarter, excluding extraordinary items. Revenues in the latest period fell slightly to $1.295 billion from $1.310 billion in the year-ago quarter. 

 Analysts on average had estimated earnings at $1.24, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, a research firm that tracks such forecasts. On Wednesday, the stock fell 1/8 to 9-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange, just above its 52-week low of 9. 

 Including the charge for the addition to the asbestos litigation reserve and the $210 million pretax gain from the insurance recovery, the company had a net loss for the second quarter of $425 million, or $7.76 per share. 

 The company said the decline reflected weaker demand in its roofing, siding and insulation businesses amid a slowdown in the housing market after a series of interest rate increases.

 Earnings  Decline  20 Percent for Schaumburg, Ill.-Based Motorola Inc.

 Motorola Inc.'s second-quarter earnings, burdened by hefty special charges, declined 20 percent despite a 22 percent upturn in sales. 

 But excluding special items, operating profits at the Schaumburg telecommunications-product giant nearly doubled, matching Wall Street's expectations. 

 The increase in operating results was fueled by surging semiconductor sales and wider profit margins at Motorola's cellular-phone business. The company said it made "good progress" in resolving negative issues that badly pinched profits at the cell-phone group earlier this year. 

 For the quarter ended July 1, Motorola's earnings before unusual items jumped 91 percent to $515 million, or 23 cents a share, from $269 million, or 13 cents a share. Sales climbed to $9.26 billion from $7.60 billion. 

 Results of the year-ago quarter have been restated to include the results of General Instrument Corp., which Motorola acquired in a pooling-of-interest transaction early this year. 

 Special items skewed bottom-line results in both periods: Including $316 million in pretax charges to write down the value of acquired R&D in the latest quarter, and $81 million in charges a year ago, net income slid to $204 million, or 9 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter's $255 million, or 12 cents a share. 

 Motorola released its earnings, which were in line with analyst forecasts, after the market's close Wednesday. In late New York Stock Exchange trading, the stock jumped $2.68 to $36.25. Motorola officials will discuss the latest results at a telephone conference call scheduled for early Thursday morning. 

 Motorola shares have dropped substantially in recent months, reflecting investor concerns about the company's near-term profit prospects. 

 In April, one day after the company reported generally solid first-quarter results, officials sent the company's stock into a tailspin by warning that earnings for the second quarter would be hurt by eroding profit margins in its wireless-phone business. A shift toward less-profitable "lower-tier" handset products, as well as a component shortage, contributed to the problems, the company explained at the time. 

 "We made good progress in addressing the profitability issues experienced by the personal communications segment in the first quarter," said Robert L. Growney, Motorola's president and chief operating officer. Sales for the crucial segment rose 20 percent to $3.3 billion, while operating profits increased a more modest 5.6 percent to $132 million, Motorola said. Operating profit margin was about 4 percent of sales in the latest quarter, about equal to the year-ago period's margin but significantly higher than the first quarter's margin of 2 percent of sales. 

 At Motorola's semiconductor group, sales rose 27 percent to $2.0 billion, and higher computer-chip prices helped operating profits soar to $166 million from $24 million a year ago. The semiconductor group continued to enjoy "excellent sales growth and profit improvement," said Growney.

 N.Y. Stocks End Higher; Techs Shine; Nasdaq Comp Up 1.8%

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Earnings strength fortified the growing confidence in the technology sector, which rallied impressively Thursday, even though the rest of the market moped through the session. 

 Shares of several companies that reported upbeat profits after trading concluded Wednesday found buyers willing to pay escalating prices after the companies posted upbeat profit statements. 

 Applied Micro Circuits, one of the high-tech growth stocks whose share price swooned in the second quarter, got back in range of its March highs, rallying 28 to 153 7/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, just shy of its high of 158 7/8, reached March 27. 

 Internet software maker Ariba, another tech name that had a dizzying rise in March and a stunning slide in April, also rallied back on stellar earnings, climbing 27 11/16 to 131 3/16 on Nasdaq. Rational Software, meanwhile, managed to eclipse the 52-week high it set in March, finishing at 113 1/8 after a gain of 20 7/16 on Nasdaq. 

 Powered by those big gains, as well as big advances from rival technology companies now expected to post upside earnings surprises when those numbers come out later in this reporting cycle, the Nasdaq Composite Index shot up 75.23, or 1.84%, to close at 4174.82. 

 Impressive as those gains proved to be, though, the technology sector's success came at the expense of the rest of the market. Some groups, such as drug stocks, fell sharply on the session, as investors raised cash in those areas to pay for investments in high technology. 

 Merck fell 4 5/16 to 69 1/16, while Schering-Plough lost 4 3/8 to 43 15/16, and Eli Lilly declined 4 to 95 3/4. 

 "Companies in the health-care or consumer-products areas, for example, are producing nice earnings gains," Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. "But the truly dynamic earnings growth is coming from technology companies, and that is why we find ourselves in this tech-driven market." 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10788.71, up 5.30. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,463 issues advancing, 1,423 declining and 482 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,021,519,110 shares, compared with 976,147,970 Wednesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 659.71, down 1.42. The average price per share fell 9 cents. 

 Consumer companies that did report their profits in the session didn't get the kind of reaction from investors that technology issues garnered. Pepsico, for example, finished 11/16 higher at 40 7/16, after reporting that its profits grew 21% in the second quarter, coming in stronger than analysts anticipated. 

 General Electric eased 7/8 to 52 3/8 on the NYSE, declining even though the Fairfield, Conn., industrial and entertainment giant posted second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's projections by a penny a share. 

 Maytag came through with profits that topped forecasts by a penny a share, but the stock ended unchanged at 38 7/8 on the Big Board. 

 Shares of J.P. Morgan managed to gain 1 9/16 to 124 1/8, after the banking giant reported second-quarter earnings that handily topped what Wall Street had expected. 

 Helped by that contribution, the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to close the session in the black on the day, but just marginally so; it rose 5.30, or 0.05%, to end at 10788.71. 

 Not all the profit statements from technology companies captured Wall Street's heart. Shares of Three Five Systems, a Tempe, Ariz., maker of liquid crystal display products, sank 29 1/8 to 33 3/8, after the company accompanied its second-quarter earnings release with a warning that its revenue is expected to decline in the second half of this year. 

 Motorola finished 3 3/4 higher at 39 3/16. The Schaumburg, Ill., semiconductor and cell-phone maker reported results late Wednesday that lived up to analysts' forecasts. 

 Tollgrade Communications jumped 28 3/64 to 166 19/64 on Nasdaq. The Cheswick, Pa., developer of telecommunications network test systems reported second-quarter profits of 54 cents a share, well ahead of analysts' projections of a 31-cent profit. 

 Numerical Technologies added 2 9/16 to 65 on Nasdaq, reaching a 52-week high. Credit Suisse First Boston published an upbeat research note, forecasting better-than-expected quarterly results from the San Jose, Calif., semiconductor technology concern; after the close of trading Thursday, the company issued quarterly results that beat forecasts. 

 Vitesse Semiconductor rose 6 3/4 to 86 11/16 on Nasdaq. After the close, the Camarillo, Calif., chip maker reported fiscal third-quarter results that matched Wall Street's forecasts. 

 RealNetworks climbed 5 3/16 to 51 15/16 on Nasdaq. America Online agreed to install software from the Seattle Internet software developer in what may be the biggest deployment yet of software that can broadcast audio and video over the Internet. 

 AOL, Dulles, Va., gained 3/4 to 57 3/4. 

 Celestica gained 6 5/8 to 58 5/8. The Canadian contract electronics manufacturer late Wednesday said it will manufacture subassemblies for optical amplifiers under a contract with JDS Uniphase that gives Celestica an exposure to the growing fiber-optics business. 

 VeriSign, up 7% Wednesday, rallied further, gaining 15 3/16, or 8.5%, Thursday, to end at 192 7/8 on Nasdaq. UBS Warburg started coverage of the Mountain View, Calif., Internet security concern. 

 Tyco International added 3 3/8 to 51 3/8. The Bermuda-based conglomerate run out of Exeter, N.H., said it received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division saying the agency ended its informal investigation of the company's accounting practices. 

 Schering-Plough fell 4 1/2 to 43 15/16 in a session of sharp losses by drug stocks. The decline came one day after the Madison, N.J., pharmaceuticals concern told analysts at a meeting the company sponsored Wednesday that its earnings growth is slowing down after several years of growing at 20% or more. 

 Jones Pharmaceutical fell 3 3/4 to 40 on Nasdaq. King Pharmaceuticals agreed to merge with the St. Louis drug maker in a pact that values Jones shares at $51.12 a share, for a total of $3.4 billion. King Pharmaceuticals, Bristol, Tenn., declined 9 7/16 to 36. 

 Guidant added 3 9/16 to 50. The Indianapolis medical-device maker said that it expected its second-quarter earnings to live up to analysts' targets, easing some fears surrounding the competitive threat from Johnson & Johnson in the coronary stent market. 

 Johnson & Johnson weakened in the session, down 2 13/16 to 95 1/4. 

 Dow Jones fell 1 3/4 to 71 1/16. The New York publishing concern reported second-quarter results that beat analysts' projections, but, in a subsequent conference call, company executives said that growth rates will decline in the second half. (Dow Jones publishes this newswire.) 

 Six Flags gained 7/8 to 23 1/4. The Oklahoma City, Okla., amusement park operator received a favorable ruling in a Georgia state court case against Time Warner, which sold its interest in the Six Flags amusement park operation to Six Flag's predecessor company, Premier Parks. 

 Time Warner, which advanced 2 9/16 to 84 11/16 in the session, said it would take a $50 million charge in the second quarter as a result of the court decision. 

 The American depositary shares of Diageo, the British food products giant, eased 9/16 to 36 5/16. The company is talking with U.S. cereal maker General Mills about merging its Pillsbury food division with General Mills in a deal valued at about $11 billion. 

 WorldCom moved up 3 7/16 to 47 15/16 on Nasdaq, while Sprint rose 5/8 to 47 15/16 on the NYSE, after the companies acknowledged that they officially halted their controversial merger plans. 

 Deere added 1 1/4 to 39 7/8. Bear Stearns reiterated its buy rating on the Moline, Ill., farm-equipment maker, saying that strong performance in the last two months could lead to better-than-expected results for the quarter.

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, the roar that rose up from the Nasdaq: Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) , a turbo rally for techs, thanks to one standout profit report. 

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: You heard it here first, and today, PaineWebber (URL: http://www.painewebber.com/) and UBS Warburg (URL: http://www.ubs.com/) made their marriage official. We`ll ask  Don Marron why he stopped playing hard to get. 

 VARNEY: A corporate prescription for disaster that has left a drug store giant in dire straits. Can Rite Aid (URL: http://www.riteaid.com/) ever recover? 

 BAY: A pie in the sky advertising gamble that took off, sort of. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay and Stuart Varney. 

 VARNEY: Good evening everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 Well, it was a rally that recalled the high-tech glory days. 

 BAY: The Nasdaq taking a triple-digit jump, led by some of the most beaten-down stocks of the year. For months, you only heard the word "dot-com" connected with words likes "disaster." Well, not today. Shares of Yahoo! shot into the stratosphere and took a host of other Net stocks along for the ride. The buying spree followed Yahoo!`s better-than- expected profit report. That bullish news spread throughout the tech sector, driving the Nasdaq to a point not seen since April: 4,099, just above break even for 2000, a powerful rebound after the index plunged into a harrowing bear market. 

 Fred Katayama reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tech investors just about yelled "yippee" after Yahoo! wowed Wall Street with surprisingly strong earnings. That sparked what strategist say is a start of a long-awaited summer rally, as the Nasdaq finally broke into positive territory for the year. 

 JOE BATTIPAGLIA, GRUNTAL & CO.: We`re making that transition from fear of the Fed to focus on profits and the outlook for the economy. For a couple of weeks before this point, we worried that maybe a recession was looming. That`s not case. 

 KATAYAMA: Internet stocks rebounded sharply from yesterday`s setback. Yahoo! gained more than 19. Retailer Amazon.com (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) shot up nearly 2. Auctioneer eBay (URL: http://www.ebay.com/) rocketed more than 8. AOL (URL: http://www.aol.com/) and CMGI (URL: http://www.cmgi.com/) also gained ground. 

 TERRENCE GABRIEL, IDEA GLOBAL.COM: Yahoo! had sold off pretty dramatically since mid-June, had lost 33 percent of its value, came out with a report that calmed investor, and we`re seeing a very strong move in the stock back up. It`s spreading to other Internet names. 

 KATAYAMA: Computer and chip stocks also helped lift the Nasdaq, which surged steadily throughout the day to end at 4,099, a gain of more than 140 points. 

 ELAINE YAGER, HERZOG HEINE GEDULD: It`s just starting a break out. Above 4,074, 4,100 is really the area you need to get above, and that is just about what you`re starting to do. 

 KATAYAMA: Over on the Big Board, bank and brokerage soared after UBS Swiss financial giant UBS announced it`s buying the retail brokerage PaineWebber. PaineWebber soared and investors placed their bets on who`s next. J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) gained more than 5 1/2. Lehman Brothers (URL: http://www.lehman.com/) hit a new 52-week high. Goldman Sachs (URL: http://www.gs.com/) and DLJ (URL: http://www.dlj.com) also rose. The Dow gained for the fourth straight session, rising more than 56 points to, 10,783. 

 Advancers swamped decliners in both markets, and volume picked up as it has in the last few sessions. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATAYAMA: Market watchers note that volatility in the big name Nasdaq stocks has shrunk to half the levels of March and April, a sign, they say, that stocks are set to break out of a trading range --Stuart and Willow. 

 BAY: Fred Katayama, welcome news for investors, indeed. Thank you. 

 VARNEY: Yes, indeed. 

 Well, the engine behind today`s dot-com surge, as we mentioned, Yahoo!. In fact, today`s rally was one of the top five biggest point gains ever for that stock. But before today`s rebound, there was a pervasive  fear on Wall Street that many dot-coms were destined for extinction, and that a sharp decline in dot-com advertising would slow Yahoo`s! bottom line, slow it down. Well, today on CNNfn, Yahoo!`s chief executive tried to dispel that fear, and said that reports of the industry`s demise are wildly premature. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 TIM KOOGLE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, YAHOO!: We`re in period of industry consolidation that we`ve actually been in for probably, from our perspective, for at least three quarters now. It`s a natural thing, and I think it`s healthy, frankly. What happens is actually in the long term, you go through period of consolidation after initial really rapid growth, and it settles out, and you know, and things continue to move. The fundamentals of the Internet are still there and will be there. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: A bullish outlook. But one look at the stock shows just how far Yahoo! has to go before staging an all-out comeback. Even after today`s record rally, Yahoo! shares are still down 50 percent from their high. 

 Yahoo!`s profit report set the tone of trading today on Wall Street, but it remains to be seen if Motorola will have the same effect. After the closing bell, the wireless phone maker reported second quarter profits that were just in line with estimates. 

 Bruce Francis joins us now with more on this -- Bruce. 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, Yahoo! was a moonshot and not so with Motorola. Motorola didn`t really wow Wall Street, but the problems here, particularly with the mobile phone business, were well known. Motorola says it had sales of $9.3 billion in the quarter, but light by some analysts` estimates. Profits came in at 23 cents a share, right in line with estimates. In a statement, Motorola said strong sales of wireless infrastructure equipment and cable TV gear were the best performers. The mobile handset business, a drag on Motorola last quarter, improved in profitability. That impressed Mona Eraiba of Rosetta Management. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 MONA ERAIBA, ROSETTA MANAGEMENT: Now we have the handsets improved. They hit the numbers. The key thing to see is if that improvement is going to continue and that the company will be able to fire on  all cylinders, both in semiconductors and handsets and in the infrastructure. So that`s very key for the company overall. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 FRANCIS: But some analysts say that Motorola has its work cut for itself. To meet its goals on handsets by the end of year. 

 In after-hours trading, Motorola (URL: http://www.mot.com/) is up a buck. Motorola`s stock peaked in early March at just over $60 a share, but took big hits in April on disappointing  earnings and in May on an estimate cut from Salomon Smith Barney. The stock is now down more than 40 percent. Motorola is expected to discuss the outlook for the future tomorrow morning on a conference call. Usually we have that kind of guidance to give you now, but we don`t. 

 VARNEY: You were talking a lot about the handset business. 

 FRANCIS: That`s the key. 

 VARNEY: Yes. Well, can it improve that handset business quickly enough? 

 FRANCIS: They`ve got to make sure they get the right kind of components. They`re constrained across this whole industry right now. They`ve also got to start seeing those new fancier Web phones start kicking in with consumers. The infrastructure`s not really there yet. 

 BAY: Anything you`d like to have clarified on that morning call? 

 FRANCIS: I`d really like to see where they are going and what their feelings are, especially in getting those components and really seeing the profit margins improve in the handset business. That`s critical for Motorola. 

 VARNEY: Get your questions in early, Bruce Francis. Thanks very much, Bruce. 

 BAY: Another after-the-bell surprise from Ariba (URL: http://www.ariba.com/) tonight. The Web software maker reported a third quarter loss of five cents a share, three cents smaller than expected. Revenue jumped to more than $80 million. That is more than seven times higher than last year. In heavy after-hours trading, Ariba jumped 2 1/2 after surging more than 12 during the regular session. 

 VARNEY: Well, not take a quick look at some of big winners before the bell rang today. Chip stock contended with Internet stocks as the top gainers. PMC-Sierra (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com/) soared more than 11 1/2 points. That`s ahead of its earnings report that comes out tomorrow. Broadcom (URL: http://www.broadcom.com/) surged more than 9 3/4. Altera (URL: http://www.altera.com/) , Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/)  and , all up more than 3. But tech stocks also led the blue chips higher: IBM, Intel, Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) , all those issues gained ground today. 

 Still, those gains paled next to the rally staged today by PaineWebber. As we mentioned, the stock vaulted after the company confirmed what we told you first here on MONEYLINE last night, that Swiss banking giant UBS was buying the American brokerage for nearly $12 billion. Today`s double digit point gain put PaineWebber stock at 67, far surpassing its 52-week high. 

 Susan Lisovicz reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The gentlemen`s handshake symbolizing the merger between Wall Street`s fourth-largest brokerage firm and the world`s biggest private sector bank, an idea hatched at a  private dinner this spring between the two top executive that quickly became serious. 

 DONALD MARRON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PAINEWEBBER: It was very clear each time we talked that the reasons for doing this got more and more powerful, more and more compelling and clearer. And then we came one day --I came one day, and said, you know, this is the right time for us to be doing something to be global, this is Clearly the right organization, and after a little while, I thought this was the right price. 

 LISOVICZ: And price was certainly a factor in convincing Donald Marron to relinquish PaineWebber`s long history of independence. UBS is paying nearly $11 billion in cash and stock for PaineWebber, or $73.50 per share, a 47 percent premium over its closing price Tuesday. But the Swiss financial conglomerate said as the brokerage firm with the wealthiest client base in the U.S., PaineWebber is worth it. 

 MARCUS OSPEL, CEO, UBS: It was inevitable that UBS must come here. PaineWebber is without question the most attractive partner for us  in establishing a serious position in the U.S. 

 LISOVICZ: Executive of both companies say they expect the deal to close in the fourth quarter. Because there is little overlap, they don`t think  there will be any regulatory resistance. 

 JOHN LEONARD, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: PaineWebber is not a major investment bank, however, it is one of the major U.S. players in secondary equities research, sales and trading. That will be a very powerful addition to UBS` primarily European-focused securities business. 

 LISOVICZ (on camera): Financial deregulation, accounting changes, corporate globalization and the advent of low-cost online trading put pressure on PaineWebber to seek a diversified partner. The rally in brokerage stocks was a strong indication that Wall Street expects more of these mergers in the near future. 

 Susan Lisovicz, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VARNEY: Well, today`s trans-Atlantic marriage is not the first of its kind and certainly will not be the last. In fact, most of the recent megamergers have involved European companies buying American companies. 

 Peter Viles now on the European invasion of corporate America. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): First the Germans bought Chrysler and the Jeep, Unilever bought Skippy peanut butter, the French bought a piece of Hollywood, and now a Swiss bank is buying a Wall Street icon. If you`re thinking the trans-Atlantic merger route is a one-way street, you`re on to something. 

 These are the biggest mergers between U.S. companies and European companies, and in every case the buyer -- Vodafone (URL: http://www.vodafone-airtouch-plc.com/) , British Petroleum, Daimler Benz (URL: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com) , Unilever (URL: http://www.unilever.com/) -- is European and the seller is American. 

 Bankers and analysts say this is a trend born of strength. The U.S. economy is so strong European companies with global ambitions feel they have no choice but to buy into it, even at huge premiums. 

 KIM FENNEBRESQUE, SG COWEN: As European companies continue to grow and want to compete on a global scale, U.S. assets become much more attractive. I don`t -- I think Americans firms buy in Europe because they want to. I think European firms buy in the U.S. because they feel they need to. 

 VILES: Last year, European companies bought $242 billion worth of American companies. U.S. companies spent only 85 billion buying in Europe. The numbers are almost as lopsided this year. Analysts cite the move to a common currency in Europe and rebounding economies there, which have built stronger capital markets to support these deals, giving European multinationals the financing to build global networks that many American companies have already built. 

 RICHARD PETERSON, THOMPSON FINANCIAL SECURITIES DATA: If you look at the 

 likely acquirers, those being large multinational companies, they already have e presence in Europe or in Asia or overseas. So to find a target, it has to be a very special target for them to make that acquisition. 

 VILES: Lastly, there is the point Alan Greenspan made Tuesday. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: Greenspan said -- Greenspan said America is a great place to do business partly because its labor markets are so flexible. Unlike Europe, where trade unions are still strong, in America most companies are free to hire, and fire, as they see fit -- Stuart, Willow. 

 VARNEY: All right, Peter Viles reporting, and thank you, Peter. 

 BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, there was no deal for PaineWebber until 

 our next guest gave it the green light. 

 VARNEY: We`ll ask Donald Marron, the chairman and chief executive of PaineWebber, why he finally decided to sell: that and a lot more still to  come on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: After two decades as CEO, Don Marron finally decided today to sell PaineWebber, a brokerage founded by Mr. Paine and Mr. Webber more than a century ago. With all you may have heard today about Don Marron, here are a few things you may not have heard: He`s a college dropout, but a dropout with an IQ of 190. He founded his own investment bank at the age of 24, which he later sold at age 30. Marron then started the economic forecasting firm DRI, which he sold to McGraw-Hill in 1979. He`s also a serious art collector and is currently a  vice chairman of New York`s Museum of Modern Art. 

 Joining us now, Don Marron, the chairman and CEO, besides all of that, of PaineWebber. 

 You`ve been courted by a lot of suitors, no doubt, over the years. So why was Mr. Ospel able to convince you, besides that rather generous price tag. 

 DONALD MARRON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, PAINEWEBBER: Well, first, the world is changing in the last couple of years. I`ve said it before, the `90s was the decade of the individual. Going from pensions to defined contribution plans created this huge increase in household financial assets. And we`ve had record years in seven of those nine years that went on. It`s now going to be the decade of the global individual. You`ve going to need global capabilities to serve individuals, and there`s going to be the same opportunity in the rest of the world to get individual accounts. 

 UBS is in that business probably larger than anybody else in the world. 

 BAY: Your shareholders, as we noted, get a hefty premium. UBS gets a major toehold in this country. 

 MARRON: Right. 

 BAY: But I`m not clear as to what your clients get. 

 MARRON: Right, and that was the first question. Anybody that came in to see me, I said, "Tell me what you add to the clients," because if you can do 

 that, then everything else ought to follow. 

 First, the clients get a much broader range of products. For example, we have 65 analysts covering half the S&P. UBS has 600 analysts, and combined, we`ll cover 90 percent of the S&P. 

 BAY: So they get access to that kind of research? 

 MARRON: (UNINTELLIGIBLE). Then there`s banking services, because they`re a bank. There are derivatives. UBS is a double-A+- rated company. They could provide the kinds of derivatives that we can`t. 

 So they get a whole range of services and still be with the same brand-name, same management, same group. 

 BAY: It looks like you`ll be grouped with Warburg, but their clients, their high net-worth individuals will be taken care of under the PaineWebber brand. 

 MARRON: That`s right. 

 BAY: And you will still be there? 

 MARRON: I will still be there. 

 BAY: All right. Just checking. 

 You have the added difficulty -- as you well know, mergers are tough-going -- but you have the added difficulty of a cross-border merger, something that I`m sure you thought a great deal about. 

 MARRON: Yes. 

 BAY: What will be the toughest challenges there? MARRON: Well, clearly, one challenge is explaining it to both sides. And we started today. We had a town meeting with 500 people this evening and we went through everything that was going on. 

 The second one is to show our clients and our employees that these increased services are there. We have to go about four months between now and closing. We`ll have to do some of the things in there. But we`ve got to show people why we`re as excited as we are. 

 BAY: The market was excited today as well. We just heard... 

 MARRON: Yes. 

 BAY: ... Susan Lisovicz report that the market expects more of these deals. Do you think we`ll see increased consolidation? Who do you think is next? 

 MARRON: Well, I think the industry is both consolidating and expanding. It`s consolidating on one level; it`s expanding with new Internet companies and dot-coms and money managers and things. 

 I don`t know who`s next, but I think the choice is be domestic with that focus or be global. It`s pretty hard to be something in between. 

 BAY: Don Marron, congratulation on your deal today and thanks as always for joining us. 

 MARRON: Thanks, Willow. It`s nice to be here -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right. Thank you, Willow. 

 Still ahead on MONEYLINE, firefighters search for the missing after the collapse of two New York apartment buildings. We`ll tell you about that in our "News Digest," coming up. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers": GoTo.com (URL: http://www.goto.com/) , it rose 5 1/4 on news that it has been added to the Russell 2000 Index. The Web commerce firm also said it will continue to be the search provider for Netscape`s Net Search program. ConMed (URL: http://www.conmed.com/) plunged 9 points -- that`s 35 percent -- after warning that it will miss second quarter profit estimates by as much as 24 cents a share. Electro Scientific Industries (URL: http://www.esi.com/) gained  nearly 8. The electronic equipment maker beat the Street with quarterly sales jumping 33 percent from last year. And Digex (URL: http://www.digex.com/) rose more than 4 points. Several brokerages made positive comments following news that Intermedia Communications  may sell its 62 percent in the Web-hosting company. 

 BAY: The White House talking of real engagement between Israel and the Palestinians on this second day of the Mideast peace summit. 

 Jim Moret is in Washington with more on that in the "MONEYLINE News Digest." 

 JIM MORET, CNNfn ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow. Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak were back at work today, trying to hash out a peace deal at Camp David. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart refused to say if any progress had been made. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 JOE LOCKHART, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It`s been a busy day between all of the parties, and that there`s been real engagement today dealing with the substantive issues that define what the parties need to agree on in order to reach an overall agreement. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 MORET: In the presidential race, George W. Bush today praised the Clinton administration for organizing that summit. Bush refused to criticize the president`s role, saying he won`t -- in his words -- politicize the process. And two days after Bush`s speech at the NAACP convention, delegates today heard from Al Gore. He urged the group to pay attention to Bush`s action, not his words. 

 Also today, promising news on a treatment for Alzheimer`s patients. Researchers at New York University say a drug called Memantine may help slow the disease in its late stages. And finally, at least one person is dead, three missing after a building collapse in New York City. Two Brooklyn Brownstones caved in last night after what officials say may have been a gas explosion. Those are the day`s top stories. I`ll have much more ahead on "THE WORLD TODAY," 8:00 Eastern, 5:00 Pacific -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Jim -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Thanks, Willow. 

 In tonight`s "Tech Watch," Walt Disney bails out one of its own. Disney says it has offered to buy the customer list of toysmart.com, a failed e-tailer of which Disney is a majority owner, a majority owner I should say. Toysmart`s customer list became a subject of debate, because the company had promised to protect its customers` privacy. But after going bankrupt in May, Toysmart placed ads offering those assets, including those lists filled with personal data. The Federal Trade Commission filed suit against toysmart.com earlier this week, claiming the company broke its privacy promise. Disney says it will work with the FTC to keep that list confidential. 

 BAY: Still to come, looking to juice up your portfolio? Salomon Smith Barney says it has the answer. 

 VARNEY: The brokerage unveils its list of must-have stocks. But do you really want to own them? That`s when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Looking for the hottest stocks to own over the next 12 months? Salomon Smith Barney believes it has the answer. The brokerage today released its "10-Plus Exceptional Names" list, and that helped the stocks, at least for today. Some of the names on the list, NorTel (URL: http://www.nortelnetworks.com/) Networks, which jumped 3 today, Philips Electronics, up more than 1 1/2. Chubb, up 2 1/4. Electronic Data Systems (URL: http://www.eds.com/) gained more than 1. And America Online up 3 1/2. It is merging with Time Warner (URL: http://www.timewarner.com/) , the parent of CNN. The performance of those stocks over the past year has been mixed. Nortel, Philips (URL: http://www.philips.com/) and Chubb (URL: http://www.chubb.com/) are all up sharply, while EDS has fallen nearly 40 percent year to date. AOL down more than 24 percent. But one note of caution: In 1999, Salomon`s exceptional list didn`t live up to its name. The portfolio fell 10 percent. Salomon blamed the poor performance on too many value stocks and not enough techs. 

 VARNEY: Not enough techs. 

 Coming up in our next half hour, full coverage of today`s market action. BAY: We`ll check out what sparked today`s summertime surge that lifted the Nasdaq into the black for the year. 

 VARNEY: And, why General Electric (URL: http://www.ge.com/) is sitting pretty after today`s big financial merger. We`ll tell you how GE`s sizable stake in PaineWebber paid off. 

 BAY: Plus, you`ve probably never heard of him, but he may determine the fate of the cigarette industry. Florida`s Judge Robert Paul Kaye, presiding over the biggest class action case in history. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay. 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, Web stocks mount a furious rally, lifted by a beaten-down Net pioneer, helping to push the Nasdaq back into the black. And PaineWebber seals a deal to join forces with UBS. We`ll check out how the buyout charged up the brokerage sector. Plus, as big tobacco holds its breath in a landmark Florida case, we`ll have an interesting look at the presiding judge. 

 VARNEY: But first, more on our top story, a remarkable achievement for the  Nasdaq: back in the black for the year 2000. 

 In just seven weeks, the Nasdaq has surged nearly 30 percent from its low for the year, and today, crossed the break-even mark for the first time in months. 

 Driving the rally? Those beaten-down dot-coms, led by an extraordinary gain in Yahoo! They helped send the Nasdaq up 143 points. That`s more than 3 1/2 percent. 

 As for the Dow, it enjoyed a modest gain, up 56 points, with the  tech names accounting for most of that rally. 

 Will the tech comeback continue tomorrow? After-the-bell profits from bellwether Motorola didn`t give a conclusive answer. Profits were in-line with expectations. But the stock, however, is up a dollar in active after-hours trading. 

 Tomorrow night on MONEYLINE, we`ll talk about Motorola`s struggle this year with CEO Chris Galvin. 

 Also out after the bell today, results from the Web software maker Ariba, which lost less than expected on big revenue gains. That stock is up 12 1/2 points, also in active late trading. After jumping -- I`m sorry. Yes, it`s up 12 1/2 points and it also jumped 12 points during the regular session. 

 BAY: The catalyst behind today`s Nasdaq rally, that positive profit report from Yahoo! As we mentioned, it set a fire under battered Internet stocks as Allan Chernoff reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A revival of the Internet glory days, at least for one trading session. Yahoo!`s better-than-expected earnings ignited a buying frenzy, brining smiles to the Internet faithful. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I made a few -- a very good amount of money today, especially after the $20 jump in Yahoo! stocks. I had 100 shares. So it`s probably a couple of thousand dollars. Not bad. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I haven`t looked at the exact amount, but we`re going out to dinner tonight, you know, and we`re going to celebrate. 

 CHERNOFF: Joining Yahoo! in the celebration, CNET (URL: http://www.cnet.com/) , eBay (URL: http://www.ebay.com/) , PSINet (URL: http://www.psi.net/) , and Priceline (URL: http://www.priceline.com/) : All scored double-digit gains. CNet was up 36 percent. 

 Beaten-up business-to-business stocks were standouts. 

 GLEN FREY, ORBITEX: Business-to-business sector is a place where corporations are continuing to channel their incremental dollars. So therefore, B2B and infrastructure software, Internet software-related companies will continue to benefit. 

 CHERNOFF: Internet advertising firms also enjoyed big gains after Yahoo! management allayed fears about struggling dot-com companies slashing spending. 

 RYAN JACOB, JACOB INTERNET FUND: All of the companies are benefiting from Yahoo!`s good numbers and some optimism is returning to the markets where for the last few weeks it`s been very pessimistic. 

 CHERNOFF: It is a stunning one-day turn for the Internets, many of which have crashed. 

 From March 3rd through yesterday, the Street.com index had plunged 43 percent. The index had a 7 percent gain today. 

 Also pacing the tech sector, semiconductor stocks, rising in advance of Motorola`s earnings. Semiconductor equipment stocks had the biggest gains as positive news continued to flow from the Semicon West Conference in San Francisco. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: None of this implies it`s going to be up, up and away for the tech sector, especially the dot-coms. Plenty of investors remain sober. And as we illustrated earlier this week on MONEYLINE, even for a star company like Yahoo!, valuations based on expectations for next year`s earnings are sky-high. 

 But today`s price action does go a long way toward repairing the damage that the group has suffered -- Stuart, Willow. 

 BAY: So, Allan, ultimately what does this do to investor psychology? 

 CHERNOFF: It takes a step forward. It doesn`t repair all the damage, but 

 certainly people have to feel better about their portfolios if they`re holding some of these Net stocks. When you`re down 30, 40 percent on the year, you just want to dump them, you`re wondering, "When can I get out?" When they start moving up, you`re thinking, "Maybe I should get back in and get some more." 

 BAY: Investors craving some good news, and today, at least they got some. 

 Allan Chernoff, thanks. 

 VARNEY: Our other top story, as we told you first on MONEYLINE last night, PaineWebber is in a deal with Swiss bank UBS. The price tag, nearly $11 billion in cash and stocks, or $73 1/2 per share. And a few minutes ago, PaineWebber chairman and chief executive Donald Marron told 

 us that he was attracted to the deal because of its prospects for global growth. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 MARRON: It`s now going to be the decade of the global individual. You`re going to need global capabilities to serve individuals and there`s going to be the same opportunity in the rest of the world to get individual accounts. UBS is in that business probably larger than anybody else in the world. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: Now, check the market`s response to the news: PaineWebber surged nearly 17 points, and the broker also came out with quarterly earnings today. They beat the street`s forecast. UBS shares in New York slumped more than 13 1/2. 

 BAY: One big winner to emerge from the PaineWebber deal: Jack Welch and General Electric. GE owns nearly a quarter of the brokerage house. 

 Terry Keenan takes a look "Behind the Numbers." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Willow, the  deal to buy PaineWebber surely must bring a smile to the folks at General Electric: GE is the biggest shareholder in the company, a byproduct of a disastrous foray into the brokerage business that began all the way back in 1986. That`s when GE paid $600 million to buy Kidder Peabody. After pumping another 800 million into the company, GE sold Kidder to PaineWebber for approximately $670 million in stock in 1994 after scandal, leverage, and a bear market in bonds led to a lot of red ink and even more bad ink in the press. 

 Well, GE had to take a huge charge to cover the Kidder fiasco, it did get a 22 percent stake in PaineWebber: a stake that at today`s prices is worth more than $2.1 billion. 

 The windfall from the PaineWebber buyout won`t hit GE`s bottom line until later this year, though when GE reports second-quarter earnings tomorrow, it is expected to show an 18 percent profit increase over a year ago. 

 For GE CEO Jack Welch, who took the plunge into Wall Street 14 years ago, the PaineWebber buyout will make for a happier end to the Kidder Peabody chapter when he writes his highly anticipated memoirs next year. But it may also have had an indelible impact on his view of big takeovers. After a burst of buying in the mid-1980s, GE hasn`t made a major takeover in 14 years. 

 Ironically the buyout of Kidder Peabody that year was Welch`s last big deal -- Willow. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Thanks, Terry, and those memoirs could mean another big payday for Welch with publishing houses bidding for the book, offering upwards of $7 million. GE says Welch plans to donate the proceeds to charity. 

 VARNEY: It didn`t take long for news of the PaineWebber deal to spark buzz about which brokerage houses might be next in-line on the merger gravy train. Checking out the big beneficiaries today -- quite a few of them -- J.P. Morgan rose more than 5 1/2 points and Lehman Brothers jumped nearly 5 1/2. Goldman Sachs, up almost 3 1/2. Merrill Lynch gained more than 2 1/2. Bear Stearns (URL: http://www.amrcorp.com/) and Northwest first started talking early last month, just days after United Airlines announced its plans to acquire US Airways (URL: http://www.usairways.com/) . 

 Now, take a look at their stocks. Northwest Airlines gained more than two points today. AMR was up nearly 1 3/4. Other airlines stocks also higher: US Airways up almost 1 1/2, and UAL, the parent of United, gained just under one point. As for Delta, it rose more than 1 1/2. 

 BAY: In more M&A news tonight, a deal in the tech sector: Chip-maker PMC-Sierra is acquiring Quantum Effect Devices for nearly $2.5 billion in stock. That comes to more than $75 a share, a 25 percent premium over Quantum`s closing stock price on Tuesday. Separately, PMC-Sierra is due to report quarterly earnings tomorrow. And in the telecom sector, Global Crossing is getting out of the local phone business. The company is selling the local phone unit it bought when it acquired Frontier to Citizens Communications. The price tag: more than $3.5 billion in cash. 

 The deal allows Global Crossing (URL: http://www.globalcrossing.com/) to focus on its high-speed telecom network. Taking a look at those stocks, Citizens Communications rose just a fraction today. It`s trading near its 52- week high. Global Crossing gained nearly three. PMC-Sierra was up more than 11 1/2. And Quantum gained 18 1/2. 

 VARNEY: Tobacco industry lawyers continued their closing arguments today in Florida`s landmark class-action tobacco trial. Philip Morris attorney Dan Webb told jurors the proposed $154 billion in punitive damages would actually be a reward to smokers, sending the message that, if smokers do not quit, they can become instant millionaires. 

 One person who could decide that the penalty is indeed too big is Judge Robert Kaye. 

 Tonight, Allan Dodds Frank takes a closer look at the man playing a pivotal role in deciding the fate of the tobacco industry. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 JUDGE ROBERT KAYE, FLORIDA: You`ve made your record. You made your record before. You made your record now. 

 ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): No one has been more conscious than Judge Robert Kaye about how his record will stand up on appeal. In this case covering 500,000 or more Florida smokers, he has grown accustomed to being challenged on appeal, especially by the tobacco companies. 

 They even tried to get Kaye kicked off the case because he is an ex-smoker. But Kaye, who reportedly gave up cigarettes 40 years ago, was kept  on the bench by the appeals courts. The 71-year-old judge took an unusual route to the bench. After college at the University of Florida, he served as an Army radar repairman, then on the GI bill, he earned a law degree in Miami. Then with a voice that would later serve him from the bench, he became a radio announcer, disc jockey and news director. Kaye then switched to law, becoming a Florida state prosecutor in 1970 before being appointed to the bench in 1981 as a circuit court judge. 

 Regarded as feisty on the bench and deliberate in his rulings, his work is certain to be challenged by the tobacco companies. 

 CLARK FRESHMAN, PROFESSOR, UNIV. OF MIAMI LAW: The two big rulings that the tobacco companies would like to have set aside are the ones setting the size of the class of all Florida smokers, and two, the ruling that punitive damages could be awarded for the entire class. 

 FRANK: But appeals courts usually have upheld Kaye, even as he has repeatedly pushed both sides to settle. 

 DAVID ADELMAN, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: There have been a variety of decisions made through this case that have been made with the intent to encourage a settlement among the parties. And because the industry has not settled, ultimately, those will be looked upon in retrospect as legal errors and a basis for appeal. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANK: Especially if the jury does decide to award billions of dollars in punitive damages, the judge will be more important than ever. It will be up to him to decide whether to reduce the award or try to force the parties to accept a settlement before he does anything else --Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right, when do we know that number? When we do have a figure to put up there? 

 FRANK; Well, it`s between a zero and $200 billion. It`s up to jury to decide first, and then judge will decide if they make an award, it`s too 

 big. 

 Now the courthouse speculation if that it`s above $6 billion, which is the number that Philip Morris has been trying to pin as the bankruptcy break-even, then he might move to reduce the award, but we just won`t know until the jury comes in -- Stuart. 

 All right, Allan Dodds Frank, there reporting. 

 Thank you, Allan. 

 BAY: Up ahead, it`s up, up and away for a novel advertisement. 

 VARNEY: Yes, we`ll tell you what had Pizza Hut shooting for the stars. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) BAY: It has big-name backers, like Microsoft and Hewlett- Packard, but the much anticipated IPO from Divine InterVentures didn`t have many investors behind it today. The Web incubator finally priced last night at $9 per share, on the bottom end of its already lowered price range. The offering was delayed seven times since filing last December, on concerns from the SEC over aggressive pre-IPO publicity, and today faced another problem: weak enthusiasm for Web incubators. Divine InterVentures ended the day below its offering price, down a quarter to 8 3/4. 

 VARNEY: Now something that did take off today was a Russian rocket carrying an unusual message into space, along with its scientific payload. The rocket was emblazoned with the logo of "Pizza Hut," which reportedly paid $1 million to deliver its advertisement into orbit. But you may have a hard time making out the company`s logo -- it`s right there, halfway up the nodule. But Russia`s cash- strapped space program has turned to Madison Avenue to help fund the project, which by the way, also has a serious mission, and that is to send up the living quarters for the $60 billion International Space Station. 

 BAY: Up next, "Ahead of the Curve," some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open tomorrow. 

 You`re watching MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Several companies on tap to report earnings tomorrow, including Dow component General Electric. Analysts are expecting profits of 33 cents a share, up 5 cents from a year ago. Also due out, J.P. Morgan. Wall Street looking for earnings of $2.45 cents per share, down 7 cents from last year. Gateway expected to report second quarter results of 36 cents, up 8 cents from a year ago. Also watch for chip maker PMC-Sierra, due out with profits of 19 cents a share. 

 Just a quick programming note: Tomorrow night, Motorola`s CEO, Chris Galvin, will join us to talk about his company`s latest profit report. After today`s closing bell, Motorola met second quarter estimates. 

 Stay a step ahead of the markets, tune in to "AHEAD OF THE CURVE," every weekday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, right here on CNN. 

 And that is MONEYLINE for this Wednesday. I`m Willow Bay. 

 VARNEY: And I`m Stuart Varney. Good night from New York. 

 "CROSSFIRE" is next.

 Market Savvy STOCK SPOTLIGHT International Speedway Stock Plunges on Earnings  Warning  The stock-car race provider cites weak ticket sales, plans to build fewer seats for the quarterly  profit  outlook.

 Shares of International Speedway Corp. crashed hard Tuesday after the leading provider of NASCAR stock-car races warned of lower-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter ending Aug. 31 and for next year as well. 

 The stock (ticker: ISCA) tumbled $8.50 a share, or 20%, to a 52-week low of $34.50 in heavy trading on the Nasdaq Market, as more than 6 million shares changed hands. 

 Stocks of some other racetrack operators fell in sympathy, including Speedway Motorsports Inc. (TRK), which lost $1.19 to $21.81, and Dover Downs Entertainment Inc. (DVD), which slipped 13 cents to $13 a share, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

 Citing lower-than-forecast attendance at the Pepsi 400 race in Daytona Beach, Fla., on July 1, International Speedway said its third-quarter profit could be 2 to 3 cents a share below estimates. The company was expected to earn about 27 cents a share in the period, according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Moreover, the company warned that "at least for the short term, ticket demand continues to grow, though not quite as quickly as in the past," and that therefore it plans to build fewer new grandstand seats next year than planned. 

 The combination of those trends, plus costs related to a previously disclosed settlement of a lawsuit, "may cause the company's 2001 [earnings] results to be 6 cents to 8 cents [a share] lower" than analysts' consensus estimate of $1.72 a share, the company said. 

 International Speedway owns or operates 11 major racetracks, including the Daytona International Speedway and the California Speedway in Fontana. Amid the soaring popularity of stock-car racing in recent years--both in terms of live attendance and television viewership--International Speedway and its stock had flourished until November. 

 The stock peaked at $71.13 on Nov. 19 but then began sliding, in part because the shares were commanding a rich price-to-earnings multiple that made some investors nervous. Indeed, before Tuesday's drop, the stock was still trading for a lofty 40 times its expected per-share earnings for fiscal 2000. 

 The company, based in Daytona Beach, said ticket sales for the Pepsi 400 were affected by several factors, including the threat of wildfires in Florida, higher gasoline prices and heavy rain during the week before the race. International Speedway didn't disclose exact attendance figures, but the race typically draws well over 100,000 fans. 

 But more important was the company's decision to cut its expansion plans in half, to about 20,000 new grandstand seats next year, because of softening ticket demand, said analyst Dennis McAlpine of the investment firm Ryan, Beck Southeast Research in New York. Even before Tuesday's announcement, McAlpine rated the stock a "hold" because of its price-to-earnings ratio. 

 International Speedway and other track owners aren't having problems selling their best seats that typically cost $90 or more, but "we may have reached a peak in the pricing ability at the low end," meaning not as many fans are willing to keep paying higher prices for the least-desired grandstand seats, which now generally sell for $40 or $45 each, McAlpine said.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, late-breaking profit news from an Internet pioneer: Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) beats the Street, but will that restore faith in a floundering stock? 

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: A very different Nasdaq name facing controversy: Krispy Kreme (URL: http://www.krispykreme.com/) . We`ll ask the CEO whether investors are really glazed and confused about the company`s prospects. 

 BAY: The winners on Wall Street today? Some of the oldest of the old economy stalwarts. What did that say about the markets? 

 VARNEY: And a jackpot for a former giant of GE (URL: http://www.ge.com/) : Gary Wendt grabs a record signing bonus, in cold hard cash. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney and Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, and welcome to MONEYLINE. We have a lot of news for you tonight, including a better-than-expected profits from Yahoo!. 

 VARNEY: But first, breaking news of a major trans-Atlantic takeover. "The Financial Times" is reporting that the Swiss bank UBS is set to buy an American brokerage landmark: PaineWebber (URL: http://www.painewebber.com/) . 

 Robert Thomson of "The Financial Times" joins us now with all the details. Mr. Thomson, welcome back to MONEYLINE. What do you have for us? 

 ROBERT THOMSON, "FINANCIAL TIMES": Well, we hear that the boards of the two banks are having a meeting tomorrow. They are very close to agreeing on this deal. It`s a deal that would value PaineWebber at about $73 dollars a share. It closed today at just under $50. And as you say, this is further evidence of the trans-Atlantic migration of those European banks. 

 VARNEY: Now that amounts to a 46 percent premium over PaineWebber`s closing price today. That`s a rich premium, indeed. Any reason for that? 

 THOMSON: It is absolutely rich. It shows determination of UBS to get an extensive retail network here in the U.S., as well as the asset management of PaineWebber, which is altogether you`ve got more than 300 branches there, and this is an asset that`s hard to build from the ground  up. 

 VARNEY: So that`s the niche that PaineWebber would occupy within UBS` broader global strategy, retail outlets in the United States -- that`s what they`re buying. 

 THOMSON: Absolutely. Frankly, if you`re not in U.S., you`re not global, and UBS definitely wants to be global. 

 VARNEY: Now are there any other factors at play here that you want to mention? 

 THOMSON: Well obviously, any deal could go wrong at the last moment, but as we said, they`re very, very close. Also, it`s going to be controversial, because as you know, they are still some standing Holocaust-related issues for Swiss banks. And as yet, there is no final agreement on compensation from those banks. So expect controversy there, but probably not a fatal legal obstacle. 

 VARNEY: When do you expect some kind of formal announcement on this? 

 THOMSON: Well, it could come early as tomorrow. The fact that we`re breaking this news on CNN may encourage them to hurry up. 

 VARNEY: Thank you very much, Mr. Thomson. We are flattered, indeed. 

 But last week, Merrill Lynch went up very sharply. Is there some suspicion here that UBS was also looking at Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) last week? 

 THOMSON: There`s a lot of Merrill and a lot of talk of about other European banks. I think what we can say with some degree of certainty is that there is going to be further consolidation in this industry. 

 VARNEY: Robert Thomson, "Financial Times," joining us from New York. We thank you very much for being with us sir. Thank you indeed. 

 And to repeat, we understand, according to the "FT," that UBS, the Swiss bank, is going to make a bid for PaineWebber of $73 a share. That would value PaineWebber at $7.5 billion. That is a 46 percent premium over PaineWebber`s closing price today -- Willow. 

 BAY: Stuart, the other late-breaking story tonight: Yahoo! beats the Street. The Internet bellwether surpassed expectations with its after-the-bell profit report, even clearing the so-called "whisper number." Shares of Yahoo! exploded in after-hours trading, up more than 14, erasing losses during regular trading. 

 Bruce Francis reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yahoo! urged Wall Street to set aside worries that dot-coms were going to dot-bomb the bottom line. Yahoo! says that it took in $270 million in the second quarter, an increase of 110 percent. Net income, excluding special items, rose to just under $74 million, up 173 percent. That works out to be 12 cents a share, two cents a share better than analysts` expectations. 

 PAUL NOGLOWS, CHASE H&Q: The company has once again, just as in every quarter prior, outperformed, and significantly outperformed. 

 FRANCIS: And Yahoo! addressed, but didn`t fully answer, a key concern about the quality of future revenue. A Lehman Brothers (URL: http://www.lehman.com/) report say that some 63 percent of Yahoo!`s advertisers are dot-coms, which are seen as pulling back their ad spending these days. But in a conference call, Yahoo! executives said that for competitive reasons, the company won`t tell analysts how much advertising comes from dot-com world. Besides, Yahoo! maintains, it`s increasingly difficult to say what is and what isn`t a dot-com. But company did admit that -- quote -- "financially questionable" --unquote -- clients account for 10 percent of revenue. That might not contradict Lehman`s number, but it sounds less scary. 

 FREDERICK MORAN, JEFFERIES & COMPANY: Investors are fearing that  as some of the smaller, less well-capitalized Internet companies struggle and can`t get capital from Wall Street, that they`ll stop advertising, that they`ll pull business away from Yahoo!. In fact, in the second quarter report, we saw no impact from that whatsoever. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: Yahoo! says that this quarter marks a key transition. Now companies consider the Web a key part of strategic initiatives, not just a costly experiment -- Willow, Stuart. 

 BAY: Bruce, what do you think this means for Yahoo! stock tomorrow and for the rest of the sector, since this is a bellwether? 

 FRANCIS: Of course what`s good for Yahoo! isn`t necessarily good  for all those companies out there, but Yahoo! really help put aside issue this issue, a strong revenue number, and that was what Wall Street was looking at, could help lift a lot of those advertising- dependent Internet stocks. 

 BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks. 

 VARNEY: Yahoo! shares may be soaring late today, but during the regular trading session, the stock was a Nasdaq albatross on what was a very mixed day for the markets. Adding to the uncertainty early on, a speech from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, but the Nasdaq still managed to stay higher for half the session, even pulling above 4,000 for a while before succumbing to selling pressure. It ended down nearly 24 points, at 3,956. The Dow, in contrast, solidly in the black, up as much as 161 points. It ended, however, up just half that, at 10,727. 

 Susan Lisovicz looks at a promising rally that didn`t quite deliver. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Investors looking for reasons to buy found encouragement soon after the opening bell. 

 GAIL DUDACK, UBS WARBURG: The market needs to be event-driven, and any day that has an event will drive it. 

 LISOVICZ: The event in early going, an upbeat speech by Alan Greenspan, followed by better-than-expected profits from an old economy stalwart, International Paper (URL: http://www.internationalpaper.com/) . Coming on the heels of good earnings news from ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) , cyclical stocks put in  a strong showing. Brokerage stocks also took off, Merrill Lynch to a 52-week high on renewed optimism that the Fed won`t raise interest rates next month. 

 But the tech-heavy Nasdaq reversed its early gains, nervousness in advance of Yahoo! earnings after the bell. Tech losers straddled many sectors, including Internet infrastructure plays such as Akamai (URL: http://www.akamai.com/) , chip stocks such as Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/) , and biotechs, including Millennium Pharmaceuticals (URL: http://www.mlnm.com/) . 

 ELIZABETH MACKAY, BEAR STEARNS: Basically, we saw a kind of an asset allocation shift or reallocation, taking some profits out of tech, where actually the valuations are generous, and maybe justified, but are generous in moving into some of the areas of the market that if we don`t have a hard landing, if the Fed doesn`t continue to raise rates, really are pretty undervalued. 

 LISOVICZ: But some analyst say that continuing sector rotation could turn into a broad-based rally once investors get a better picture of second-quarter earnings. 

 DONALD SELKIN, JOSEPH GUNNAR: The Street wants to see earnings that will come in at least on consensus, and perhaps forward-looking statements that show that later on in year when economy will slow down that the earnings will not be affected by the slowdown that much. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISOVICZ: And that`s the high standard the Street wants. Even as the economy cools, which will inevitably show up in lower revenue numbers and quarterly earnings reports, some analysts say the continuing productivity gains that Alan Greenspan extolled today should keep profit margins aloft -- Willow. 

 BAY: Susan Lisovicz, thanks. 

 The high anxiety today ahead of Yahoo`s! earnings wasn`t just confined to that one beaten down stock. It spread throughout the dot-com sector. eBay (URL: http://www.ebay.com/) today lost more 4. DoubleClick (URL: http://www.doubleclick.net) down nearly 3 1/4. Amazon (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) off almost 2. RealNetworks (URL: http://www.real.com/) fell more than 5 3/4. And Yahoo! slid 4 1/2 before staging an after-the-bell come back. All of these stocks are trading way off their peaks: eBay, DoubleClick, Amazon, RealNetworks and Yahoo! were all down 58 percent or more from their 52-week high. 

 VARNEY: Still, Internet investors got a major shot of adrenaline after the bell, with Yahoo`s! very solid profit report. And all those stocks we just mentioned are indeed trading higher in after-hours trading, led of course by Yahoo!, double-digit again. 

 Our guest tonight thinks that Yahoo! was overvalued, even before today`s late-day rebound. Vince Farrell joins us now. 

 Vince, welcome back. 

 VINCE FARRELL, SPEARS, BENZAK, SALAMON & FARRELL: I don`t mean to be picking on Yahoo!, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: But you are. 

 FARRELL: But I just think that the Internet sector is still very much overpriced, because their growth rates, while still healthy, are slowing down dramatically. Now when you have growth rates slowing down, the multiple simply can`t stay where they are. 

 VARNEY: Am I correct in saying that the top 25 Nasdaq stocks are trading at more than 100-times earnings. Am I accurate there? 

 FARRELL: Yes, you`re accurate, and it`s significantly more. And go one step further, five of those 25 don`t have earnings at all. So the 20 that have earnings are trading well north of 100-times expected earnings. And I don`t  know that a hundred multiple is ever really appropriate, but my vision, unfortunately, it`s not appropriate when the growth rates are going to slow. Mr. Greenspan has said the economy is going to slow, and the growth rates of these companies are still going to be very, very healthy, but slower than they were, and those multiples will not hold. 

 VARNEY: If I`m right in saying, you`re quite bearish on the Nasdaq overall. Here`s a dramatic statement. I think you believe that the Nasdaq is going to end this year 20 percent below where it started this year. 

 FARRELL: Yes, that`s not -- that`s not a passion on my part. That`s in response to a question. So if I have to pick a direction, I do believe that the Nasdaq, after an 80 percent gain last year, is going to 

 give that up. 

 Now, if you had an 80 percent gain in a stock and it retreated 50 percent of that gain, a technician would tell you it`s still in a bull market trend. So you could retreat that 40 percentage point and still be in a bull trend. So I`m probably more optimistic than I should be about the Nasdaq index. 

 VARNEY: All right. A safe haven from here to the end of year: Where do I go? 

 FARRELL: I think you stay out of the high-tech stocks. I think you go into the consumer staples, like food stocks. I think most especially that you buy the energy stocks still. 

 I think they`re a terrific place to be. I think you want to be in financial stocks, because if we`re not at the end of Mr. Greenspan`s tightening, we`re close to the end. 

 And I don`t know if UBS is paying a right price for PaineWebber or not, but if it`s at all indicative of what the values of these companies might  be, you ought to shut your eyes and be very much overweighted in financials. 

 VARNEY: You are a value investor. Do you think that UBS, if it pays $73, a 46 percent premium for PaineWebber, are they overpaying? 

 FARRELL: Yes. 

 VARNEY: Flat out? 

 FARRELL: Flat out. Very much so. And thank you PaineWebber. Take the money and run. 

 (LAUGHTER) 

 VARNEY: On that note... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 Vince Farrell, what a pleasure. Thanks very much indeed. 

 FARRELL: Thanks, Stuart, Willow. 

 VARNEY: OK. 

 BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE: Does Deutsche Telekom (URL: http://www.dtag.de/) have eyes for VoiceStream (URL: http://www.voicestream.com/) ? We`ll tell you how word of a possible bid sent a clear signal to investors. 

 VARNEY: Plus, the debate over downloading music comes to the Senate. Find out how the Napster fight played on Capitol Hill. 

 BAY: And a former bright light at GE bundles up a record signing bonus at Conseco (URL: http://www.conseco.com/) with every dollar in cash. We`ll tell you how Gary Wendt did it. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: The German telecom giant with deep pockets has reportedly set its sights on VoiceStream Wireless, sending the stock soaring today. As we told you here on MONEYLINE last night, Deutsche Telecom, also rumored to be interested in Sprint (URL: http://www.sprint.com) or Qwest (URL: http://www.qwest.net/) , may be looking at VoiceStream to build its presence in the U.S. mobile phone market. 

 Greg Clarkin has more on the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just a week ago Deutsche Telekom was said to be courting Sprint. But now it looks like Sprint`s German suitor has its eye on another prize. Reports say Deutsche Telekom has found VoiceStream and is offering anywhere from $30-40 billion in a combination of cash and stock for the fast-growing wireless company. But Sprint`s deal with WorldCom is not officially dead, and analysts say Deutsche Telekom is growing impatient and may be using a bid for VoiceStream to force Sprint to bargain. 

 CHRIS DOYLE, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS: It may put pressure on Sprint to play the game with Deutsche Telekom. They may become much more aggressive  and indeed look for other suitors. Of course, WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) is now a deal that`s not going to happen, but Sprint may well go to other players. 

 CLARKIN: But VoiceStream is an attractive takeover target in its  own right: It has almost 2.3 million wireless subscribers, it boasts wireless licenses throughout the U.S., and has technology compatible with what`s being used in Europe. 

 CHRIS LARSEN, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: The other thing it brings is it uses a technology called GSM, which is the same technology that the Europeans use on their wireless networks, which means that if Deutsche Telekom were to buy VoiceStream, they could allow their customers in Europe to roam seamlessly to the U.S. with one phone and phone number. 

 CLARKIN: And some are betting Deutsche Telekom may buy VoiceStream and then go after Qwest as a way of breaking into the U.S. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And of all potential targets analysts say VoiceStream would be the easiest deal to get past regulators. It`s strictly a wireless company without the local business of Qwest or the long- distance business of Sprint -- Stuart, Willow. 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin, thanks. 

 Checking the stocks: VoiceStream jumped more than 14 to close above 139. Qwest slipped more than 1 1/4, while Deutsche Telekom shares in New York slipped nearly two. Meanwhile, Sprint today lost nearly 4 1/4, WorldCom off almost one. Both downgraded today by CIBC over concerns that price competition in the long-distance market will intensify over the next two years. 

 VARNEY: And there were other movers. Let`s check them for you. JDS Uniphase (URL: http://www.jdsunph.com/) fell for a second day in a row, losing nearly 5 1/2 points despite several brokerages making positive comments about its deal with SDL (URL: http://www.sdli.com/) , including Deutsche Bank (URL: http://www.deutsche-bank.de/) , who said JDS is now even better positioned to benefit from the demand for fiber optic networks. 

 Aspect Communications (URL: http://www.aspect.com/) , it plunged almost 24 points -- that is 54 percent -- after warning late yesterday that it will report a second- quarter loss, excluding a one-time gain. Analysts were expecting the software maker to earn, make a profit of eight cents a share. 

 Pinnacle (URL: http://www.pinnacletowers.com/) fell nearly 13 1/2. The media equipment company said it will miss fourth-quarter estimates by as much as 10 cents a share. 

 BroadVision (URL: http://www.broadvision.com/) , down more than 4 3/4 after Wal*Mart.com (URL: http://www.wal-mart.com/) said it will not use the company`s software for its Web site. Since losing AMR (URL: http://www.amrcorp.com/) as a customer last week BroadVision shares  have plummeted 35 percent. 

 BAY: In other corporate news tonight, Frederick`s of Hollywood, known for its risqu lingerie, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company will continue to operate its 200 stores nationwide while it seeks to restructure  its debt. It`s also looking to revamp its image, trying for a more upscale look. Frederick`s has been having trouble since its costly leveraged buyout three years ago. 

 And Bill Gates is making some investments outside the world of software. Gates has acquired a more than 6 percent stake in Castle Cooke. That`s a real estate company that owns most of the Hawaiian island of Lanai, where Gates and his wife, Melinda, married several years ago. Also today, word that Bill Gates is investing more money with Craig McCaw. Gates is among a group of investors who have pledged millions of dollars for the satellite ventures of the telecom magnate. Gates, an original investor, has pledged another $100 million for McCaw`s ICO-Teledesic Global. 

 VARNEY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, musicians in Congress? 

 BAY: At least that`s where the drummer for Metallica was today as the national debate over, yes, Napster came before the U.S. Senate. That is next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: We have an update for you on a developing story. A source close to PaineWebber has confirmed to MONEYLINE that PaineWebber has received a bid of $12 billion from UBS. "The Financial Times" reported it here on MONEYLINE earlier, and we will continue to monitor the story as it unfolds -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right. Thanks, Willow. 

 Napster, back in the spotlight today as the raging debate over downloading free music caught the attention of the U.S. Senate. Several musicians, Internet innovators and music company executives had their say in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 

 Bob Beard has the story in tonight`s "Tech Watch." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), CHAIRMAN, JUDICIARY COMMITTEE (singing): But one  tearful night I prayed for God`s... 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Christian songwriter and current senator, Orrin Hatch, heard from Metallica`s drummer over the cacophony surrounding the free downloading of digital music. 

 LARS ULRICH, METALLICA: It`s (UNINTELLIGIBLE) the new paradigm that the Internet gurus tell us we must adopt sounds to me like old- fashioned trafficking in stolen goods. 

 BEARD: Napster CEO Hank Barry defended his 20 million users, a half million every night, saying they shouldn`t be branded as thieves. 

 HANK BARRY, CEO, NAPSTER: Napster simply facilitates communication among people interested in music. It`s a return to the original information-sharing approach of the Internet, and it allows for a depth and a scale of information that is truly revolutionary. 

 BEARD: The CEO of MP3.com (URL: http://www.mp3.com/) demonstrated new software that allows users to buy and store a collection of music online. He called the debate a fork in  the road for the industry. 

 MICHAEL ROBERTSON, CHAIRMAN & CEO, MP3.COM: Will licensing bodies work in a free market environment to license responsible technologies like My.MP3.com? Or will they use this opportunity to squeeze competitors and 

 consumers? 

 BEARD: Sony Music is exploring new options for downloading but said copyright payments are essential to protect music in cyberspace -- otherwise... 

 FRED ERLICH, SONY MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT: It will be very difficult to sustain the level of investment involved in developing music. 

 BEARD: The tune from senators: Let the marketplace and the courts work out copyright disputes involving digital music, not legislators. 

 HATCH: We must protect the rights of the creator, but we cannot in the right of copyright unduly consumers and the promising technology the Internet presents to all of us. 

 BEARD (on camera): The debate will now play out in the California courts 

 where Napster is being sued by the recording industry and Metallica, the industry seeking an injunction to shut Napster down and damages for lost revenue. 

 Bob Beard, CNN Financial News, Washington. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, a three-way push to settle one of the world`s toughest conflicts gets under way at Camp David. 

 VARNEY: We`ll have that story and more in the "MONEYLINE News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: A push for peace between Israel and the Palestinians is under way tonight with President Clinton acting as intermediary. 

 Jim Moret is in Washington now with more on that in the "MONEYLINE News Digest" -- Jim. 

 JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow. 

 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today began peace talks at Camp David in Maryland. President Clinton met with each leader separately, then brought them together for what he admitted would be a difficult task. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The two leaders face profound and wrenching questions, and there can be no success without principled compromise. The road to peace, as always, is a two-way street. 

 Both leaders feel the weight of history, but both, I believe, recognize this as a moment in history which they can seize. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 MORET: A White House spokesman called the atmosphere today good and the discussions serious. 

 Also today, Arkansas Judge Leon Johnson has agreed to hear the disbarment case against the president, that after four other judges turned down the case down citing conflicts of interest. 

 Finally, New York prosecutors have charged a former doctor with murdering three patients at a Veterans Administration hospital. Michael Swango allegedly killed the men in 1993 with lethal injections and false orders 

 not to resuscitate them. 

 Those are tonight`s top stories. We`ll have much more ahead on "THE WORLD TODAY." Join me at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 on the West Coast -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Jim. 

 VARNEY: Still to come, more details on the potential takeover of PaineWebber. 

 BAY: And it`s the profit report every dot-com has been waiting for and Yahoo! didn`t disappoint. The very latest. 

 VARNEY: And no way to sugarcoat this one: Shares of Krispy Kreme have gotten crushed this week. Is it deserved? We`ll ask the CEO. 

 BAY: And a look at less-than-divine prospects for a company struggling to go public. Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Willow Bay and Stuart Varney. 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s headlines, Yahoo! pushes past Wall Street profit forecasts, but will it be enough to reverse the stock`s recent downswing? And a divided day for the markets, as investors flee from new economy pioneers in favor of some old stalwarts. And the tobacco industry fights back against plaintiffs who want up to $200 billion in damages. Question: Can cigarette-makers convince a jury that they`ve really changed their ways? 

 BAY: But first, more on tonight`s top story. A source close to PaineWebber confirms a story the "Financial Times" brought to you here first on MONEYLINE, that Swiss banking giant UBS has made a $12 billion bid for Wall Street fixture PaineWebber. The deal, of course, could fall apart. And the boards of the two firms will meet tomorrow to vote. But an  announcement could be imminent according to the "FT". PaineWebber sources confirmed to MONEYLINE the price tag, about $12 billion dollars. And the "FT" reports that comes out to about $73 a share, a 46 percent premium on today`s price. PaineWebber closed just below $50 today. And UBS finished at 148 3/4. PaineWebber stock not moving in after-hours. 

 VARNEY: Our other top story tonight: Yahoo! rolls past profit forecasts, but will it be enough to stop Wall Street`s skepticism over that  stock? Yahoo! reported earnings of $74 million in the quarter, 12 cents a share. Wall Street was expecting 10 cents a share. Now that is a 173 percent in net income from one year ago, driven by 110 percent in revenue. Jitters ahead of the report hit the stock in regular trading. Yahoo! was down 4 1/2. But shares rebounded in after-hours activity -- to say the least -- up 14 1/4 to 119 3/4 and that was on  volume of more than two millions shares. 

 BAY: Even with Yahoo!`s late recovery, times have changed since the stock`s halcyon days, when Yahoo! was seen as a shining star in cyberspace. 

 Terry Keenan takes a look "Behind the Numbers." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Terry, a funny thing happened on the way the Yahoo!`s profit report today. The stock, which usually rallies ahead of its numbers, has been dropping for days, off nearly 15 percent in the last three days alone. In fact, since hitting a high of $237 in early January, Yahoo! has plunged 56 percent, a move that has erased more than $70 billion in market value. It`s an unusual comedown for the official net-stock of the new economy, and an institutional favorite. 

 In fact, Yahoo! has been such a Wall Street darling that few have demanded specifics when it comes to the source of the company`s revenues, 80 percent of which is estimated to come from advertising; that is, until now. With dot-com dollars drying up, even the Yahoo! business model is coming into question. And investors are bailing out. 

 GARRETT VAN WAGONER, VAN WAGONER FUNDS: A lot of the advertising they got was from dot-coms that got funded with hopes and dreams and are kind of running out of money. So, a lot of the advertising revenues they had is starting to slow down. And that`s not a model we`re very interested in, in the moment. 

 KEENAN: And, according to a Lehman Brothers report out today, Yahoo! and other Internet companies dependent on advertising face a tough environment going forward. Although Yahoo! and others like to point to a growing list of bricks-and-mortar customers, Lehman says, right now, traditional advertisers are still spending less than one percent of their total ad budgets online. And a recent survey shows that a majority of executives are not satisfied with the effectiveness of the Web advertising that they`ve done; now another reason some very anxious Yahoo! shareholders would like to see the company diversify its revenue stream -- Stuart.

 VARNEY: All right, Terry Keenan there with "Behind the Numbers." 

 Concerns over Yahoo! acted like a shadow over Wall Street today with Web worries putting a leash on the Nasdaq despite a strong showing in blue chip stocks. The Dow surged to triple-digit gains, but the index came off its highs and close up 80 at 10727. But jitters ahead of that Yahoo! earnings news, and that put a crimp on the Nasdaq. That index slipped almost 24 points.

 more than 2 3/4. ExxonMobil (URL: http://www.exxon.mobil.com/) gained nearly 2 /12, and Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) was 3 1/4. As for Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) , it edged little higher, up 3/4 there, but Sprint slipped more than four points after a CIBC downgrade and speculation that Deutsche Telekom will not bid on it. As for the Nasdaq, JDS Uniphase down again -- lost another 5 1/2. BroadVision down more than 4 3/4; eBay slumped more than four points. Amazon and Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) both lost more than 1 3/4 on the day. 

 BAY: One big winner in today`s action: cyclical stocks, companies that are tied to the ups and downs of the broader economy. Checking some of those stocks: International Paper up more than three. Union Carbide gather more than 4 1/8; ALCOA up three. DuPont  Company; Ticker: DD; URL: http://www.dupont.com/> rose nearly 2 1/4. And Caterpillar gained almost two. 

 Allan Chernoff has more. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Investors rushed into cyclical stocks today as if the economy were about the blast off, but economic growth appears to be slowing. So what`s behind the buying? Second-quarter earnings are looking good, better than anticipated. International Paper beat expectations today. ALCOA did it yesterday, and followed up by raising prices on aluminum sheaths for soda cans, a bullish sign for business. Profits should be very strong for basic material companies after a week year-ago quarter. 

 Analysts expect paper company earnings will rise by 151 percent; steel up 96 percent; aluminum 41 percent; and chemicals up 12 percent. Meanwhile, the stocks have been beaten up. ALCOA, for example, fell to a new 52-week low last Friday. And International Paper hit its low two weeks ago. 

 TONY DWYER, KIRLIN HOLDING GROUP: These stocks have started to discount a recession in their valuations. People are now fearing that the economy is slowing too quickly, and may end up going toward a recession. These stocks already reflect a recession. So any kind of surprise is likely  to be positive. And that`s what we`ve had, and we`re getting a bounceback. 

 CHERNOFF: In fact, the thinking now is that the Federal Reserve`s interest rate hikes will result in a soft landing for the economy, not recession. 

 STEPHEN WEISS, LEHMAN BROTHERS: The Fed`s at the end of the cycle. Typically, the market overall starts to move up six weeks in advance of the last tightening. 

 CHERNOFF: And perhaps most important for cyclical stocks, like retailers, they`ve stopped falling on bad news. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: When that happens, speculators betting against the stocks -- short sellers -- want to take their bets off the table. They do that by covering their short positions; that is, buying stock they had sold short. And that short covering has been helping some of the cyclicals move higher -- Willow. 

 BAY: Allan Chernoff, thank you. 

 CHERNOFF: We`ll take any help we can get. 

 VARNEY: Now, Wall Street today got an unexpected lift from the Federal Reserve chairman. Alan Greenspan sounded off on a favorite theme: productivity and the economy`s capacity to grow without sparking inflation. 

 Peter Viles has the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At first blush, the markets loved what Alan Greenspan had to say about productivity growth, that it is still happening. 

 ALAN GREENSPAN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: There are no indications in the marketplace that the process of re-engineering business operations is slowing. 

 VILES: Stocks initially rallied on that. But on further review, Fed watchers said Greenspan had broken no new ground. 

 BRUCE STEINBERG, MERRILL LYNCH: I think what happened today was, you know, Greenspan speaks, he doesn`t say anything negative. He talks about productivity. People like that. But then they realize: Hey, we`ve heard this story before. He said exactly the same thing a few weeks ago. And he really hasn`t said anything about what he`s thinking about the economy today. And that`s probably why the market gave it back. 

 VILES: However measured in his words, Greenspan is still seen as an optimist about the new economy. Nobel Prize winner Milton Friedman, who unlike Greenspan is old enough to remember what happened in 1929, says talk  of the new economy reminds him of the `20s. 

 MILTON FRIEDMAN, STANFORD UNIVERSITY: Automobiles, electricity were playing the same role then that the Internet and telecom and so on plays now. There is nothing new under the sun. The thing -- ups and downs in the economy have been going on for hundreds of years. They haven`t come to an end. 

 VILES: Greenspan did offer a candid view of why the American economy has left Europe and Japan in its wake, because it is so much easier to fire workers in the United States. 

 GREENSPAN: Here, labor displacement is more readily countenanced, both in  law and culture. Parenthetically, because our costs of dismissing workers are lower, the potential costs of hiring and the risks associated with expanding employment are less. 

 VILES (on camera): One byproduct of that healthy churn in the work force Greenspan said is not so healthy. Despite low unemployment, many Americans still feel anxious and insecure about their jobs.

 BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, an Internet incubator having trouble getting  its own IPO off the ground. We`ll give you the latest on Divine InterVentures` troubled plans for going public. 

 VARNEY: And his IPO was a big hit, but now Krispy Kreme -- oh, I can`t say it -- getting creamed. We`ll talk to the -- I did it -- we`ll talk to the CEO. 

 All of that is coming up on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: A much anticipated initial public offering has finally priced tonight, after being delayed seven times. Divine InterVentures, priced just  over 14 million shares, at $9 dollars each, at the bottom of its already lowered range, raising $128 million for the company. 

 Lisa Leiter tonight on Divine InterVentures struggle to go public. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISA LEITER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This man, Andrew Filipowski wants to put Chicago on the Internet map. But in just seven months, his company, Divine InterVentures, has gone from the Windy City`s hottest dot-com to its biggest potential flop. Divine InterVentures has delayed its initial public offering seven times since filing last December. 

 SARAH CHANG, 123JUMP.COM: People are just taking really hard looks at these companies. And unfortunately, Divine InterVentures isn`t showing up too well for a lot of people. 

 LEITER: The company develops and funds business-to-business Internet start-ups. But despite the best efforts of its flamboyant founder, Divine`s prospects of going public faltered. April`s tech wreck dried up Wall Street`s demand for so-called Internet incubators. Since then, Divine fired its underwriter, C.S. First Boston, cut the size of its offering, and this week, even lowered the price. 

 JEFFREY HIRSCHKORN, IPO.COM: Problems Divine has it quite simple. They have 52 investments of which 30 have revenue. So why has Divine been so desperate to go public? First, it`s running out of money. As of the end of May, it had $132 million in cash, but it is burning about $13 million dollars a month. But more than that, Divine is running out of time. If it doesn`t complete an IPO by the end of this month, it could lose $233 million in private funding from big-name backers such as Microsoft, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. 

 (on camera): A failed IPO would also be a huge loss for the city of Chicago, which literally banked on Filipowski`s success, giving him $14 million in tax breaks to build new headquarters here on Chicago`s Goose Island. 

 GEORGE NICHOLS, MORNINGSTAR.COM: The city of Chicago can go on without Flip and Divine InterVentures. The local community is really looking up to the  company. 

 LEITER: Filipowski personality has helped take Divine this far, but as one person put it, investors buy into profits, not charisma.

 VARNEY: And up next on MONEYLINE, tobacco makers fight a legal bid they say could kill their industry. 

 BAY: We`ll tell you about the second day of closing arguments in the landmark Florida smokers trial. That story and more just ahead. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Oil drillers jumped today on positive analysts comments. Both Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette (URL: http://www.dlj.com) and ING Barings (URL: http://www.inggroup.com/) forecast positive second quarter earnings for the group. Also, BP-Amoco announced today that it expects to increase capital spending by 30 percent. Analysts see this move as a trend in the oil industry, which will be a boost to oil drillers. Halliburton (URL: http://www.halliburton.com/) gained 4 3/4 after DLJ upgraded the stock to a buy rating. Schlumberger (URL: http://www.slb.com/) up more than 6. Diamond Offshore (URL: http://www.diamondoffshore.com/) , Baker Hughes (URL: http://www.bakerhughes.com/) and Noble Drilling (URL: http://www.noblecorp.com/) all rose on the day as well. 

 VARNEY: Closing arguments in the landmark class-action tobacco trial continued today. After the main attorney for Florida smokers finished his summation, the attorney for Philip Morris` (URL: http://www.philipmorris.com/) started his. He said the plaintiffs` demand for huge punitive damages would put the American tobacco industry out of business. 

 Allan Dodds Frank has been covering the trial in Miami. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The lead lawyer for the tobacco industry told a Florida jury it will sign the industry`s "death warrant" if it awards billions of dollars in punitive damages. Philip Morris attorney Dan Webb began his closing argument by ridiculing the plaintiffs` lawyer, Stanley Rosenblatt, who is seeking $154 billion in punitive damages. 

 DAN WEBB, ATTY. FOR PHILIP MORRIS: By that demand of $154 billion, Mr. Rosenblatt does not seek truth, he does not seek fairness, and he does not seek justice; he only seeks money. 

 FRANK: Webb argued the tobacco industry has changed its ways and should pay nothing, but he added, if Philip Morris had to pay, $75 million would be reasonable. Recognizing that the jury has twice ruled against cigarette makers, Webb tried to demonstrate that Big Tobacco, companies with a combined net worth of $15 billion, cannot afford a huge sum. 

 WEBB: That amount is a death warrant, because that amount will destroy each of these companies, not once, but 10 times over, 10 times over. It`ll cost hundreds of thousands of employees their jobs. It will wipe out the investments of all stockholders, whether they be large or small. 

 FRANK: The Philip Morris lawyer repeatedly tried to alarm the jury. 

 WEBB: You don`t have to award $75 billion or $80 billion; you don`t have to award $50 billion or $20 billion. If you award $6 billion, you`ve got Philip Morris, it`s gone, its history, it`s out of here. 

 FRANK: With such dire warnings, the industry hopes the jury, or at least the judge, will take note of the Florida law that does not permit punitive damage awards to put a company out of business. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANK: After the tobacco lawyers finish, Rosenblatt will have the final say in rebuttal. On behalf of hundreds of thousands of Florida smokers, he`s expected to argue that the industry clearly has the capacity to pay and should be punished -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Allan Dodds Frank, reporting from Miami, thanks very much, Allan. 

 Coming up, a troubled insurer borrows a page from pro sports, offering a staggering signing bonus for a new boss. 

 VARNEY: But will Conseco`s pitch to Gary Wendt pay off for shareholders? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: We`ve promised several times tonight to try to bring you the chief executive officer of Krispy Kreme. However, we have technical problems. We cannot do that interview. We do apologize -- Willow. 

 BAY: A company fighting for a comeback, setting a new record for a signing bonus. Conseco today gave its new CEO, Gary Wendt, the biggest cash signing bonus in memory -- $45 million, also three million shares of stock and options for 10 million more. It`s a move bound to fuel the longstanding debate on massive executive compensation packages. And experts in the field say there may be more big bonuses  still to come. 

 Steve Young has more. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The cash Conseco lavished on its new CEO has left plenty of slacked jaws. Not that Gary Wendt hasn`t delivered before. At GE Capital, he increased annual profits more than 10 fold. But Wendt`s not taking much risk by pocketing $45 million up front, three million shares of stock now and more later. 

 BILL PATTERSON, AFL-CIO: This is unprecedented, to my knowledge. I`ve never seen a pay package where you unload that much cash on a CEO before he shows up at the doorstep of the company. 

 YOUNG: Critics say executive compensation was a runaway train even before Wendt`s windfall. 

 PATTERSON: The whole search for CEOs tends to be focused on luminary CEOs that tend to overpay each other and tend to sit on each other`s board. 

 YOUNG: Mattel even gave its beleaguered CEO Jill Barad $50 million to go away. 

 For now, the Gary Wendt phenomenon is limited to old economy companies, but stay tuned. Dot-coms have been giving their senior executives mostly stock options, and many of those options are worth little since the new economy stock bubble burst. 

 Analysts say if dot-com CEOs go through the holiday season with their options still underwater, they, too, may start demanding cash- rich compensation as early as next year. GE, which straddles the new and old economies, drove a hard bargain before agreeing to release Gary Wendt from his employee contract. Conseco agreed to GE a warrant for 10 million shares of Conseco stock at $5.75 a piece, good through the end of June 2005. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: With Conseco`s stock closing above $9 today, that means GE is up more than $30 million since letting Wendt walk. Now it will be nice if Conseco does well, too -- Stuart, Willow. 

 BAY: Exactly. So what about GE`s deal, though? Has anybody done that before? 

 YOUNG: Not quite this way. Everybody we talked to said that Welch and company have done a remarkable deal for themselves too. 

 BAY: And might it set a precedent. 

 YOUNG: It might. 

 VARNEY: We`ll see, will we not? 

 Steve Young. 

 BAY: Up next, "Ahead of the Curve," some of what you need to know tonight before tomorrow`s markets open. 

 You`re watching MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Now here`s what could move the markets tomorrow: Ariba is on tap to announce third quarter results, and investors are anticipating a loss of 8 cents a share. And after tomorrow`s closing bell, Motorola is expected to announce second quarter profits. The expectation is for 23 cents a share there. Also tomorrow, Alan Greenspan will address the Council on Foreign Relations on the state of the global economy. 

 And to stay a step ahead of the curve, tune in to "AHEAD OF THE CURVE" at 5:00 a.m. Eastern right here on CNN. 

 BAY: Just an update now on our top story, a possible trans-Atlantic takeover in the finance business. A source close to PaineWebber has confirmed a "Financial Times" report that Swiss banking giant UBS has made a $12 billion bid for the big American brokerage. The deal could still collapse, and the boards of the two firms will meet tomorrow to vote. But an announcement could be imminent. The "FT" reports the deal would come out to be would be about $73 a share, a 46 premium on today`s closing price, just below $50. 

 VARNEY: You know, normally at this time, after July 4, it`s a slow news time, especially in business. 

 BAY: It was not a slow news day today, was it? 

 VARNEY: It`s all happening, which is all good news for us, of course. 

 BAY: That`s true. 

 Are we done? 

 VARNEY: I believe we are. 

 BAY: That is MONEYLINE for this Tuesday. I`m Willow Bay. 

 VARNEY: And I`m Stuart Varney. Good night from New York.

 British Energy CEO Still  Cautious  On Pft Outlook 

878 words

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- British Energy PLC (BGY) Chief Executive Peter Hollins told Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday that rising gas prices could be good news for the company but that British Energy wasn't changing its very cautious earnings outlook for fiscal year 2001. 

 British Energy May 10 warned that it could incur a loss for the year to March 2001 because of falling electricity prices in the U.K., and said it halved it dividend as a result of the future profit uncertainty. 

 "Increasing gas prices, we believe, are good news for the company," Hollins said in an interview Tuesday. "But whilst it's good news, it doesn't dramatically change our outlook." 

 He said the company in May made its profit-warning when gas was selling at around 11 pence or 12 pence per therm, and the price had recently hit 21 pence. 

 But he said the company doesn't expect prices to stabilise at those levels, and instead projects prices to go back down towards the 14 pence to 15 pence level. 

 Earlier Tuesday, British Energy said it signed an agreement to lease two nuclear plants, each with four reactors, from Ontario Power Generation Inc. (X.OPG). 

 Hollins said the Ontario Power leasing deal would increase British Energy's earnings per share in fiscal year 2003 and be neutral on fiscal year 2002 earnings, which is the first full year of the leasing deal. 

 He didn't quantify the expected impact on earnings in fiscal 2003. 

 Hollins ruled out further acquisitions in Canada for the time being, noting that the company now has its plate full. 

 Each of the nuclear reactors leased from Ontario Power is expected to generate an operating profit of around GBP20 million within three years, Hollins said. 

 The Ontario Power plants currently have four reactors running and British Energy expects to start up two more and is evaluating the possibility of starting up a seventh reactor. 

 The seventh reactor appears economically unviable, while the eighth was damaged when it was decommissioned, Hollins said. 

 The four reactors currently operating are at OPG's Bruce B plant, while the four currently shut down are at Bruce A. 

 Hollins said the two reactors BE expected to start up in around three years' time still hadn't been fully inspected, but that they were the ones which OPG had kept in better shape since being mothballed between 1995 and 1998. 

 Bruce B's four reactors currently have an amalgamated capacity of 3,140 megawatts, and the two which could be repowered would add another 1,538MW. The total of those six reactors represents very nearly 50% of BE's current U.K. capacity from its eight nuclear plants of 9,600MW. 

 The added power from the two reactivated Bruce A plants would be used for a mix of domestic and export purposes, BE officials said, noting that Ontario was eager to replace polluting coal plants' output with cleaner nuclear output. One reactor has an expected lifetime ending in 2008 and the other in 2016. 

 Should the two plants not be able to go on line, BE wouldn't receive any money back from OPG, chief financial officer Mike Kirwan said. Under the leasing agreement with OPG, the Canadian company will manage the spent fuel and will assume all liability for decommissioning once the lease ends. The lease runs through 2018, but BE has an option to extend it up to 25 years if authorities extend the lifetime of the plants. 

 BE executives said they could increase profitability at the Bruce plants by capitalizing on their experience in the deregulated U.K. market, notably by implementing shorter outages and improving operating systems. 

 BE acted alone rather than through its 50/50 Amergen joint venture with Peco Energy Co. (PE) because PECO currently is undergoing a merger with Unicom Corp. (UCM) and didn't want to add the OPG venture to its plate, Hollins said. The merger is expected to be completed in September, creating a new company to be called Exelon Corp. 

 Under their JV agreement, BE must first present any potential deal to Peco for the Amergen venture when that deal is in the U.S., but not Canada, Hollins said. 

 Hollins nevertheless said the Peco-Unicom merger wouldn't slow down any potential acquisitions in the U.S. for Amergen, noting that the venture had made enough deals so that new ones are so easily done that "its almost like sausage making." 

 Last year, Amergen acquired two reactors, including one at the Three Mile Island complex, and is awaiting final regulatory approval for two more, Vermont Yankee and Oyster Creek in New Jersey. 

 The OPG deal, however, involves a new set of regulatory issues expected to take up to nine months before the Bruce plants officially are leased by BE. 

 In addition, they operate using so-called Candu technology, which have the lowest operating cost among nuclear reactors and which Hollins described as "a bit like a Land Rover. It's good, rugged, reliable, solid." 

 There are 22 reactors in the Canada which use that technology, and seven others elsewhere in the world.

 Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) : just one of many tech titans to tumble in the Nasdaq`s year 2000 nightmare. But do they have even further to fall? 

 And the undisputed wizard of the publishing world, but just how much will Harry Potter translate to profit? 

 Good evening and welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney. 

 Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. Willow is off tonight. 

 A year ago, just a few tech insiders knew much about a company called JDS Uniphase. A year later, it is one of the Nasdaq`s most important stocks. And today, the company pulled off the biggest deal the high-tech world has ever seen. JDS, which makes gear for optical networks, said it would buy its rival SDL for $41 billion at a hefty premium. That may be one reason investors sent JDS shares down more than 15 points to 101 1/8, a loss of 13 percent. It was the Nasdaq`s most active issue. 

 SDL surged 25 1/2, to just under 320 3/4. 

 Bruce Francis looks at whether the companies can really seal this deal. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The companies that help move information at the speed of light are consolidating almost as fast. 

 Just a year after JDS Uniphase started trading as a unified company and just a week after it closed a $15 billion deal for E-TEK, JDS Uniphase announced it is buying SDL for $41 billion in stock, in what would  be the highest price for a technology merger ever. 

 The $41 billion price tag represents more than a 50 percent premium over Friday`s closing price of SDL. 

 JOZEF STRAUS, CEO, JDS UNIPHASE: We thought the price reflects the opportunities in front of us, opportunities which we`re going to provide to our customers, our shareholders, as well as all the stakeholders in the company. 

 FRANCIS: The deal unites two tech high-fliers at a time when investors have been bullish about the worldwide build-out of high- speed optical networks for voice, video and data. 

 DREW PECK, S.G. COWEN: In the case of JDS Uniphase, you`re using one inflated stock to buy another. So in that regard, it probably does make sense. 

 FRANCIS: Both companies make light amplifiers, devices that boost the light impulses that carry digital data speeding through fiber-optic lines. Combined, the companies would have approximately 80 percent of that market, something that could send up a red flag with regulators. 

 They`re going to take a rather jaundiced view of these two companies getting together because it is such an important part of the market. It may be arcane and complex, but you can`t have fiber optic networks proliferate without these amplifiers, and these two companies together would pretty much monopolize that market. 

 FRANCIS: But not all analyst agree. 

 DAVID WONG, PAINEWEBBER: There a good argument to believe that it will be passed by regulators. We`ve seen a recent example of this, the JDS Uniphase acquisition of E-TEK. The combined company will be able to produce more material that customers need than the two customers separately. I think it`s a similar situation with SDL and JDS Uniphase. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: On a conference call this morning, the company said that they expect the deal to be approved by the end of September, and they declined to speculate about possible concessions to regulators. But this one is controversial from the start. 

 VARNEY: It is indeed. Bruce Francis, thank you. 

 While both JDS Uniphase and SDL are up strongly in what`s been a tumultuous year for Nasdaq stocks, their returns over the past 52 weeks are nothing short of astounding. Listen to this. Since last July, JDS shares are up nearly 400 percent, even when you count in today;s double- digit point loss. And SDL has rocketed more than 1,000 percent. Compare that to the broader Nasdaq, up just 42 percent over the past year. 

 Those scorching rallies in JDS and SDL are testament to the recent craze over the fiber-optics business. The technology is complicated enough to make your eyes glaze over. But the reason companies are anxious to set up these systems is not: They are desperate to speed up traffic on the Net. 

 Fred Katayama reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Undersea and underground, telecom companies are racing to deploy fiber optics. The pulses of light that run through these cables carry data, voice and video at speeds 1,000 times faster than through the copper wires used for cable TV. Driving demand: the Internet. 

 MARABEL LOPEZ, FORRESTER RESEARCH: Clearly the growth of the Internet is requiring service providers to build a lot more bandwidth, and that`s why they want optical products. 

 KATAYAMA: Fiber optics expands a bandwidth capacity anywhere from 40 to 160 times. More bandwidth enables consumers to get high- speed delivery of Internet services called broadband. The hot fiber technology spurring the industry now is DWDM: short for Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing. It packs more information into a single strand of fiber, adding capacity by using different colors of light. 

 Analysts say deployment takes place in three stages. Long distance carriers began laying down optical fiber to build the Internet backbone in the late 1990s. But that build-out is soon expected to slow. Taking up the slack, wiring the metropolitan areas, mostly to connect business from one city to another. The industry has only begun that, spurred by cascading costs for optical gear. 

 The final goal: fiber to the home. But analysts say that`s not expected to happen in the United States for another five to 10 years. 

 CHARLES WILLHIOT, J.P. MORGAN: I think we`re actually in the very early innings of the fiber-optics game. If it`s a baseball game, we`re talking about the first or second inning. We`ve really only penetrated some of the long-distance networks to the U.S. We haven`t penetrated the metropolitan areas, we`re just beginning to penetrate Europe, and we haven`t really touched Asia. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) KATAYAMA: That global demand for bandwidth is expected to nearly double each year for the next five years. As one analyst put it in his report, bandwidth is a lot like money: one can never have enough. 

 It`s no wonder, Stuart, that investors are aglow over fiber optics. 

 VARNEY: I`m with you there, lad. 

 Fred Katayama, thanks very much. 

 Well today`s tech merger did little to energize the overall markets today. In fact, it was an old-economy stock that helped lift the Dow industrials: ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) , one of the best-performing Dow stocks today, after it beat second-quarter profit estimates. 

 The Dow industrials gained 10 points to close at 10647, this after gaining  more than 150 points on Friday. 

 Over on the Nasdaq, weakness in JDS Uniphase weighed on other tech stocks, and that pushed the Nasdaq down nearly 43 points. It closed at 3980. But today`s better-than-expected report from ALCOA could set the tone for what many expect will be a strong earnings season and perhaps a strong summer rally. 

 Greg Clarkin reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): "This bull run has just a few more days to go." "This one could last a lot longer." That`s the sentiment of some of Wall Street`s most vocal bulls who say they see nothing to derail stocks in the near term. 

 TOM GALVIN, DONALDSON, LUFKIN & JENRETTE: I don`t think bull markets end because of old age. I don`t think they end because of high P/Es. They end because of a major resurgence in inflation. And 2 to 3 percent inflation is not adequate enough to deride this bull market, particularly when you`ve got earnings growth in the strong double-digit areas and a Fed that continues to be vigilant. 

 CLARKIN: And others say strip away the holding pattern the Dow and the Nasdaq have been in, and the market have been strong. 

 LARRY WACHTEL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: Its base decline line right now is the highest level since February. So while people are talking about the sideways movement in the Dow or the recalcitrant movement in the Nasdaq, the market representing all the stocks has been doing quite well. 

 CLARKIN: And while it was a lackluster day for the indices --the Dow gained 10 points, the Nasdaq lost 42 -- there were stand outs. 

 Shares of brokerage houses rose on hopes of a summer rally. Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers reflected that. 

 ALCOA, the first Dow component to release its quarterly report card, set a positive tone by beating earnings estimates. 

 The Home Depot (URL: http://www.homedepot.com/) opened store No. 1,000 and its stock rose. 

 And semiconductor maker Advanced Micro Devices (URL: http://www.amd.com/) rose on upbeat analysts` comments, something the entire tech sector could be seeing in the coming weeks. 

 AL GOLDMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: The No. 1 sector has been and will again be technology. This is the sector best positioned to grow their earnings. Most shares are down substantially because of the tech wreck experienced this spring. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And the catalyst for the tech sector is expected to be a string of solid earnings reports over the next few weeks. Hundreds of companies will reveal their latest results. One of the most closely watched will come tomorrow, when Yahoo! reports after the closing bell --Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Yes, that`s a key one, isn`t it. 

 CLARKIN: It is. 

 VARNEY: All right, we`ll watch it. Thanks very much, Greg Clarkin. 

 We have late word tonight of more wheeling and dealing in the telecom business. The "Financial Times" is reporting that Deutsche Telekom (URL: http://www.dtag.de/) has made an offer for VoiceStream (URL: http://www.voicestream.com/) worth more than  $30 billion. The paper says this does not prevent the German telecom company from also going after Sprint, just weeks after U.S. regulators sought to block WorldCom`s (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) buy-out of Sprint (URL: http://www.sprint.com) , the U.S. long-distance giant. 

 France Telecom (URL: http://www.francetelecom.fr/vfrance/ftindexbv3.htm) and SBC Communications (URL: http://www.sbc.com/) are also said to be interested in Voicestream, but the "FT" says Deutsche Telekom is holding the most advanced talks. 

 Still to come on MONEYLINE, Applied Materials (URL: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/) says it has a way to boost the power of chips. We`ll talk to the CEO about the prospects for the product and his company. 

 Plus, the FTC files suit against Toysmart.com. Did the Web retailer break a promise and sell personal information about its customers? 

 And closing arguments in a landmark case against the tobacco industry: how much the plaintiffs are asking for and how much the tobacco industry can afford to lose. 

 We`ll be back. 

 ANNOUNCER: From CNN`s New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s "Tech Watch," it is being billed as the world`s largest trade show ever for the chip equipment industry, and today at Semicon-West, Applied Materials unveiled new chip-making systems  that will help create more powerful semiconductors. But the future strength of the chip industry is a matter of intense debate on Wall Street. Just last week, analysts clashed over the prospects for the sector. Despite last week`s volatility, shares of chip bellwether Applied Materials have more than doubled, but they are still trading below their 52-week high. 

 Well, joining us now from San Francisco: the company`s chairman and chief executive, James Morgan. 

 Mr. Morgan, welcome back to MONEYLINE. 

 JAMES C. MORGAN, CEO, APPLIED MATERIALS: Thank you, Stuart. Great to be here. 

 VARNEY: Now there is this intense debate about whether or not the semiconductor industry is beginning a slowdown phase. As we said there, one  analyst came out strongly last week saying, yes, it`s slowing down. You`re in the middle of it. Is the growth rate of this industry truly slowing now? 

 MORGAN: Well, I think you have to look at the overall perspective for the industry. I mean, you just had the discussion in the --earlier in the show about the impact that fiber`s going to have. What we see is that the Internet and the information age is just beginning. Think about the fact that only 2 percent of the people in the world have a PC, and only about 7 percent a cell phone. So just with those two statistics, we have a great growth opportunity over the next several decades. 

 VARNEY: Well let me press the point, because we`re not really referring to  several decades, we`re referring to the next six to nine months. I mean, do you see a cyclical change, a cyclical slowdown in that time frame? 

 MORGAN: Well, I just talked to most of our customers today at our trade show here and also in traveling around the world the last month. And they see the next couple years as being good opportunities for them because of the broadening demand for semiconductors for all applications. And for our particular segment of the industry, our announcement today about the equipment to make semiconductors that are the 300-millimeter, which is moving from a kind of a salad plate size to a dinner plate size wafer on which the chips are made, means  that our customers will -- should be investing for the next several years to upgrade their technology, because this in effect obsoletes a lot of the older technology that they have in place to make chips. 

 VARNEY: Now you`re going from the 200-millimeter size chip to the 300- millimeter size. Can you explain to me, a complete layman, why this is such  a big deal? 

 MORGAN: Well, it enables you to get a little over twice as many chips off of a wafer, and so as a result you can substantially reduce the cost. And so that enables us to continue to make chips more powerful and more portable and, of course, a lot more affordable. And so it will continue to expand the market for semiconductor chips and make growth of our industry, the equipment and materials industry, enable it to grow over the years ahead. 

 VARNEY: Who is at the cutting edge of manufacturing technology in your industry now? It used to be the Japanese, is it now America? 

 MORGAN: Well, I -- what`s happening is that people like us are providing the cutting-edge technology for wafer processing to build semiconductors. So our customers, like Intel, TSMC and Samsung, Micron, ST in Europe, all these companies buy our equipment because we make every chip every day everywhere in the world. And so as a result, we have developed a lot of the technology for the industry, working in partnership with our customers. 

 VARNEY: All right, James Morgan, Applied Materials, thanks for being with us, sir. 

 MORGAN: Thank you, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: OK. 

 From the high-tech chips of the new economy, to an old-economy giant: Later on MONEYLINE, we`ll talk to the CEO of Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , Michael Bonsignore, about his company`s latest profit warning and Honeywell`s meeting today with the analysts. 

 MONEYLINE will be right back for you. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: The Federal Trade Commission today said it is not OK for a company to break its promise to customers, even if it is bankrupt. The FTC today filed a complaint against Toysmart.com to prevent the failed Internet retailer from selling the names, addresses and buying habits of its customers. 

 Susan Lisovicz reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Toysmart.com is no longer placing new orders for its merchandise, but the recently bankrupt Internet retailer is placing adds, which offer its inventory and Web site address and just about everything else for sale, as well as its customer list. 

 Toysmart.com had promised those customers it would never share those lists, which include detailed information about children, so the Federal Trade Commission has filed suit. 

 DAVID MEDINE, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Privacy promises on Web sites are critical to giving consumers the confidence they need in electronic commerce so that it can continue to expand. And secondly, it doesn`t matter whether a company continues in business or goes out of business, if the consumer has expectations that their privacy will be protected, it doesn`t matter if the company is liquidating its assets. 

 LISOVICZ: And information lists are among any e-tailer`s most valuable assets. Direct marketers say untargeted mailings have a less than 1 percent likelihood of a response. Internet customer lists, such as Toysmart`s, are highly targeted because of the extensive information they collect. 

 ANDREW SHEN, ELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION CENTER: They contain profiles of your family, what your family`s made up of, how many kids you have, what their birthdates are. I`m sure Toys `R` Us in the real world can`t keep track of all that information and no desire to. On the Internet, that`s become the norm. 

 LISOVICZ: And critics say selling information lists will also become the norm as more dot.coms go belly up. 

 RUSSELL SMITH, CONSUMER.NET: Oh, yes, I think it`s going to increase, not only bankruptcies, but mergers and so forth, the information that`s collected is going to be transferred. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISOVICZ: Toysmart.com, which is majority-owned by Walt Disney, did not return "MONEYLINE"`s repeated calls. However, FTC spokesman Madine (ph) told me that Toysmart is in settlement talks with the commission. He said  the FTC filed suit as a precaution in case those talks fall through before the sale of assets begin later this month. 

 One last point: It`s not illegal to sell lists of customer information. The problem here appears to be breaking an explicit promise to consumers. 

 VARNEY: And therein lies the rub, yes. 

 LUSOVICZ: You got it. 

 VARNEY: But they did not actually do it then, did they? They didn`t go out  and say: ten bucks for this name and address. They didn`t do that? 

 LUSOVICZ: No. They`re hoping to. And that`s why the FTC stepped in. The assets sale is July 26th. 

 VARNEY: You`ll hear a lot more of this, I suspect. 

 LUSOVICZ: You got it. 

 VARNEY: Susan, thanks very much. 

 Well, checking tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers," we have Best Buy (URL: http://www.bestbuy.com/) , which gained more than three points. Prudential Securities upgraded it to a strong buy, citing the electronic retailer`s aggressive expansion plans. 

 TenFold (URL: http://www.10fold.com/) plunged nearly seven points. That`s 39 percent. The e- business software-maker warned it will report a second-quarter loss. Analysts were looking for it to earn -- make a profit of --nine cents a share. 

 Krispy Kreme (URL: http://www.krispykreme.com/) lost more than 6 1/4, after a "Barron`s" article questioned whether the doughnut-maker is overpriced. Since debuting at $21 a share, that stock has surged 248 percent. 

 And then we have Diageo (URL: http://www.diageo.com/) . It`s hoping that its famous Doughboy can create such an appetite. It is reportedly seeking -- or trying to sell or merge its Pillsbury division, which could be worth as much as $12 billion. General Mills, H.J. Heinz, and Sara Lee are all potential buyers. 

 And in a different kind of take-over attempt, Heinz (URL: http://www.heinz.com/) today introduced its new ketchup. It is green, believe it or not -- there it is --designed to appeal to children. It tastes the same as the red kind and will hit the stores in October. Heinz hopes the new EZ Squirt ketchup, as it is called, will raise sales. 

 Still ahead on MONEYLINE, is Chrysler coming back to the New York landmark that bears it name? We`ll tell you what DaimlerChrysler (URL: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com) is saying about that. And a crucial vote for Israel`s prime minister on the eve of an historic summit. We`ll have more on that in our "News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: DaimlerChrysler may be coming home to an icon of Chrysler`s glory days. The German-American auto maker told MONEYLINE it is in talks to lease offices in the Chrysler Building, a well-known cathedral of modern architecture completed in 1930 by Walter Chrysler and renowned for its stainless steel spire. The company would only have a symbolic presence, with 10 offices and about a dozen employees focused in corporate communications and investor relations. But the move could help defray DaimlerChrysler`s image of being overly focused on its operations in Germany. 

 It`s been a rough ride for the combined company. The stock is down nearly 35 percent since the merger, which took place in November of 1998. 

 A U.S. summit on Middle East peace on track tonight after a dramatic showdown -- showdown I should say -- today in Israel`s parliament. 

 Jim Moret is in Washington with more on that story and the MONEYLINE "News Digest" -- Jim. 

 JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart. 

 The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, is tonight heading for a make-or-break peace summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat; that after he narrowly survived a confidence vote in parliament amid opposition concern about concessions to the Palestinians. Mr. Barak`s destination: Camp David in Maryland, where he is scheduled to begin talk tomorrow with Mr. Arafat and with President Clinton. 

 Also today, after last winter`s home heating oil shortages, Mr. Clinton created a temporary two-million barrel reserve for the Northeast. Congress must approve the reserve to make it permanent. 

 In the White House race, death-penalty protesters today interrupted an introduction for George W. Bush at the NAACP`s national convention. The Republican candidate used his appearance to promote his education plans, and call for an end to discrimination. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There`s a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and poor, white and minority. This too leaves a divided society. And whatever the causes, the effect is discrimination. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 MORET: Al Gore today urged Bush to press Congressional Republicans for action on stalled legislation, including a minimum- wage hike and tougher gun laws. 

 And finally, a call for new research into Alzheimer`s disease at a world conference on the illness in Washington. One group of scientists warned that, unless a cure is found, Alzheimer`s may reach epidemic levels. Their forecast: By 2025, more than 22 million people could be affected; that compared to 12 million today. 

 Those are tonight`s top stories. I`ll have much more ahead on "THE WORLD TODAY." That`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right, thanks very much, Jim. 

 Coming up in our next half-hour: As teenage wizard Harry Potter works his magic on the world`s children, we`ll check out whether Wall Street has fallen under his spell. That, and a great deal more, coming up for you. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Stuart Varney. 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s headlines, closing arguments in the Florida case that could rock the tobacco industry as plaintiff lawyers now put the price tag on the damages. Web stocks still stuck in the red this year, but some on Wall Street still say the sector is overvalued. We`ll put that question to market watcher Gregg Hymowitz. Plus, Honeywell faces Wall Street with lowered profit forecasts and unveils a big restructuring. We`ll talk to the chief executive Michael Bonsignore about why the company failed to live up to expectations. 

 But first, more on tonight`s top story. It is the largest technology deal in history. JDS Uniphase engineering a blockbuster fiber-optics deal, snapping up its rival SDL. Just a week after it closed a $15 billion acquisition of E-Tek, JDS Uniphase said today that it will buy SDL for $41 billion in stock. 

 Under terms of the deal, JDS will swap 3.8 of its shares for each SDL share. The price tag represents nearly a 50 percent premium over SDL`s closing price on Friday, and if SDL decides to abandon this merger, it will have to pay JDS Uniphase a $1 billion breakup fee. 

 Earlier on CNNfn, the chief executives of both companies talked about the  merits of the deal, and the chief executive of SDL explained why the two companies started talking in the first place. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 DON SCIFRES, CEO, SDL: SDL initiated the conversations. I won`t speculate on who else we were talking with at the time. But as soon as JDS Uniphase finished their discussion with E-Tek, I called Joseph -- we had known each other for a long time -- and said, would you like  to talk to us about also being a suitor here? 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: Check Wall Street`s reaction to this: shares of JDS Uniphase dropped more than 15 points, and that stock was the most active on the Nasdaq. SDL, though, skyrocketed nearly 25 1/2. 

 There was not much other excitement on Wall Street today as the big tech deal failed to inspire investor enthusiasm across the broader market. The Nasdaq slipped from its perch above 4,000, putting an end to a two session winning streak. The index ended down nearly 43 points. 

 Blue chip shares clawed their way back into the black, but found little inspiration for any sustained push. The Dow closed nearly 11 points higher at 10,647. 

 Check some of the day`s big movers, start with Alcoa, the first Dow stock to report earnings. It gained nearly two points. And General Motors moved up more than two. Home Deport rose almost 2 1/2. Ah, but Microsoft slipped more than 2 1/2 and Intel was down a point and a half. 

 Brokerage stocks, they were big winners today. Lehman Brothers (URL: http://www.lehman.com/) jumped five, and Goldman Sachs (URL: http://www.gs.com/) , DLJ (URL: http://www.dlj.com) , Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) , Morgan Stanley (URL: http://www.msdw.com/) , all of them gained more than two points. 

 Now check some Nasdaq movers: Yahoo! slumped 6 1/2. Inktomi (URL: http://www.inktomi.com) down more than 9 1/2. And DoubleClick (URL: http://www.doubleclick.net) lost 4 1/4. Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) was down 2 1/4, but Sun (URL: http://www.sun.com/) gained nearly 1 3/4 on the day`s trading. 

 Today`s losses in Yahoo! stock point to a troubling trend in the Internet sector. Allan Chernoff explains how Wall Street is changing its views on some Web companies and turning back to some traditional valuation measures. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Main Street, maturity is a quality to admire. Not so on Wall Street. It means a company is no longer high growth. And now Wall Street is placing some Internet blue chips into that category. 

 JONATHAN COHEN, WIT CAPITAL: We`re seeing individual companies, though, across the Internet space begin to get a lot bigger and as a result see some slowing growth rates. 

 CHERNOFF: It`s having devastating consequences for Net stocks. Once viewed as firms that could generate explosive growth, the glory days are fading fast. 

 At Yahoo! revenue growth has been in the triple digits but it`s rapidly slowing down. Part of the problem for Yahoo!, it`s highly dependent on revenue from other Internet companies that had been advertising heavily on Yahoo! but can no longer afford to do so. So revenue growth is slowing down into double-digit territory. Earnings growth this year is still forecast for the triple digits, but it`s expected to plunge next  year. 

 Consider what that means for Yahoo`s stock market valuation. The most common measurement is the ratio of price to earnings per share. Professional investors like to compare that to the earnings growth rate. On that basis, Yahoo! appears reasonable looking at this year`s numbers. Its price/earnings ratio is below its growth rate. But the steep decline in Yahoo!`s expected growth rate next year makes the stock appear way overvalued, a P/E nine times the company`s growth rate. 

 JIM AWAD, AWAD ASSOCIATES: The market`s going to be groping with this -- with this, I believe, for the next several quarters at least and maybe for the next few years as we emerge from the free-for-all where everybody was attracting capital and worrying about profits later to the more disciplined rational environment of having to produce profits in the foreseeable future. 

 CHERNOFF: This is why quality Internet companies like Yahoo! continue to see their shares sinking. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: As you know, the majority of Internet companies don`t even have earnings to speak of and their stock price declines reflect that reality. The glamour is gone for one high-flying Internet names, and without glamour, companies trade on hard numbers. Hard for many shareholders to digest -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: We get hard numbers on Yahoo!, is it -- tomorrow, after the bell, I think. 

 CHERNOFF: It is tomorrow. In fact, the expectation is for 10 cents a share, although the whisper number now is 11 cents a share. 

 VARNEY: Work that one out. Allan Chernoff, thanks very much. Let`s get more perspective on the stock market now, where are we going as the summer moves along. We`ve joined now by Gregg Hymowitz. He`s with Entrust Capital. He joins us again on MONEYLINE. 

 Welcome back, Gregg. 

 GREGG HYMOWITZ, ENTRUST CAPITAL: Thank you. 

 VARNEY: In the broadest possible sense, where is this market going? 

 HYMOWITZ: It`s tough. We`ll probably tread water here. I mean, clearly, I think the focus will be on Friday`s numbers. Unless we see a real acceleration in the economy, I think pretty much most people will feel the Fed is on hold until at least the election or after the election, and therefore it`s going to be very company-specific. Earnings will dictate. 

 And the problem is, the negative is, if you miss your number, you`re going to be taken out behind the barn and whacked pretty hard. 

 VARNEY: It`s serious, isn`t it? 

 HYMOWITZ: Very serious. 

 VARNEY: There are some big-name companies which have missed by -- what? -- one or two cents a share and down they go 30 percent. 

 HYMOWITZ: You know, it`s interesting. It seems that on the face of it the earnings season so far, the preannouncements have been worse than normal. But the numbers actually show that it`s pretty much inline. 

 What I think is happening is a lot of these names that we all talk about constantly are these relatively high-flying stocks, which tend to be very new companies. The problem with new companies is it`s very difficult to forecast quarter by quarter. 

 So I expect more disappointments from some of the big names that everyone constantly talks about. They`re bound to mess up when it comes to forecasting. 

 The other thing I`ll just mention quickly is these acquisitions, these acquisitions that we were talking about a few minutes ago with JDS Uniphase. Constantly doing acquisitions also makes the forecasting much more difficult integrating these acquisitions. 

 VARNEY: Why? 

 HYMOWITZ: Oh, I mean, it`s effectively taking two, three companies, putting sales teams together, lowering, cutting expenses. And then you have to give the Street an earnings forecast down to the penny. And if you miss by a couple of pennies -- I just had a company miss this evening by three pennies -- and the stock`s off in the Instinet market 25, 30 percent. It can be very painful. 

 It`s a game we play on Wall Street. You have to make the quarterly numbers. 

 VARNEY: You`re talking Aspect Communications. 

 HYMOWITZ: Right. Aspect Communications reported after the close, a disappointment. We spoke to the company. It`s a relatively small and isolated disappointment, but yet the company`s been absolutely taken to task in the Instinet market. 

 VARNEY: Taken out and whacked. 

 HYMOWITZ: Right. Now, we`ve been buying the stock because that also demonstrate, in the Instinet market, because clearly the Instinet market, you can -- it`s a very risky game. The liquidity is very, very tight. And therefore people are selling the stock down 30, 40 percent. And we believe, after speaking with the company, everything remains intact, we`ll buy the stock. But it`s a tough game. 

 VARNEY: Good luck, Gregg Hymowitz. You always say that. Thanks very much, Gregg. 

 HYMOWITZ: Thanks. 

 VARNEY: Still to come, Honeywell on the defensive. The company holds its first meeting with analysts since its second-quarter profit warning. We`re going to talk to the chief executive Michael Bonsignore about his turnaround plans and a good deal more. That`s when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s "MONEYLINE Focus": Honeywell. The Dow component today  answered tough questions indeed from the analysts. The stock plunged last month after it surprised Wall Street with a second-quarter profit warning. And today it tried to calm investor fears about its plans for the future. 

 The outlook so far, somewhat weak. Honeywell lowered its profit estimates for this year and next. It also plans to cut 6,000 jobs, about 5 percent of its work force. That`s on top of a previously announced 10 percent reduction. 

 Honeywell also plans to close or sell several units, an effort aimed at saving $100 million a quarter. 

 Chief executive Michael Bonsignore said he will soon announce a stock buy-back program. He called the stock cheap. Honeywell shares are down 47 percent over the past year. 

 Joining us now: the chairman and CEO of Honeywell, Michael Bonsignore. 

 Michael, welcome back. 

 MICHAEL BONSIGNORE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, HONEYWELL: Thank you. 

 VARNEY: OK. Now you`ve revised down your profit outlook for 2000 and 2001. Is all the bad news out there? Have you seen the bottom and gone past? 

 BONSIGNORE: Absolutely. That`s we took the three weeks from the profitwarning to today to make sure that whatever we told the investment community today was something they could count on. 

 VARNEY: Your strategy then is sell those under performing parts of the business, fix others, and move ahead? No matter what, move ahead? 

 BONSIGNORE: 15 percent of the portfolio is non-core. We took a very exhaustive look at the portfolio over the last two or three months. We couldn`t buy our shares back. We couldn`t make material divestitures under the pooling rules. 

 We used that time to look at the portfolio, and about 15 percent of the portfolio, non-core. We want to look at those businesses: fix them, sell them or close them. 

 VARNEY: OK. Now you`re just six months on the job. You`re the chairman of the combined Allied Signal-Honeywell, and you took over from a business legend, Larry Bossidy (ph). 

 Do you think when you came into the job just a few short months ago you made too high of yours goals, tour targets>? Set them too high up. Did you? 

 BONSIGNORE: I think the goals for 2000, 20 percent EPS growth, were clearly ambitious but achievable when we put the plants together. And I think what`s happened is that in the midst of integrating the two companies, taking out 11,000 people, getting the company directed back to growth, and doing that under the confluence of a number of very unusual factors operating on the company all simultaneously -- weak euro, very high raw material prices, interest rates, supplier problems -- nor margin for error. 

 VARNEY: The weak euro hurt you? 

 BONSIGNORE: Very much so. We have -- most of our turbocharger business is in Europe. That`s about four points from the growth from euro. We`ve had the euro affect a number -- 25 percent of our business is in Europe. So, that affects the revenue line and some of the income line as well. 

 VARNEY: Can you stick to your current profit forecast if the Fed continues to raise rates? 

 BONSIGNORE: Yes. We -- when we looked at the outlook for the rest of the year, 10 to 15 percent for the second half, 12 to 14 for the total year, we clearly did that making some assumptions, that they`re not going to be material changes in raw material prices. And obviously, we tried to build in some realism into those forecasts going forward. 

 VARNEY: What it`s like being the chairman of a company, a huge $25 billion company, that sees its stock chopped off at the knees very, very suddenly. I`m asking you a personal question. 

 BONSIGNORE: Yes. 

 VARNEY: How do you feel when you wake up in the morning and you see this happening? 

 BONSIGNORE: Well, I don`t feel good at all, because first and foremost I try not to confuse value with valuation. And here we have a tremendously powerful franchise -- nothing about Honeywell`s fundamental franchise has changed from a month ago -- we have leading market shares, technologies other companies would kill for, wonderful brand, great businesses, a lot of growth potential. We just have to fight our way back in a market which is very unforgiving in terms of missing expectations. 

 VARNEY: You`re over the hump? 

 BONSIGNORE: Over the hump. 

 VARNEY: Guaranteed? 

 BONSIGNORE: Read to go. 

 VARNEY: Michael Bonsignore, chief executive, chairman of Honeywell, thanks very much for being with us. 

 BONSIGNORE: Thank you, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: OK, sir. 

 Coming up, the pressure may be mounting on cigarette makers. We`ll tell you how much a Florida class-action suit could cost the tobacco industry. We`ll be back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: It`s the beginning of the end for the greatest legal challenge the tobacco industry has ever faced. Two years after jury selection and 56,000 pages of testimony later, attorneys for the plaintiffs started their closing arguments today in the final punitive stage of this landmark trial. And those attorneys finally detailed just much they think the industry should pay to sick Florida smokers. 

 Allan Dodds Frank reports from Miami. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After two years of silence about how much money he wants tobacco companies to pay, class-action lawyer Stanley Rosenblatt revealed the magic number he hopes will become the largest jury award ever. 

 Rosenblatt set a range of punitive damages for the jury to consider from $123 billion to $196 billion before settling on his idea number. 

 STANLEY ROSENBLATT, PLAINTIFFS` ATTORNEY: ... the total figure -- the total figure of punitive damages for all the companies, for all the companies collectively, that an appropriate, just number would be $154 billion. 

 FRANK: He said he arrived at that figure because the companies, when negotiating a potential agreement with Congress, had indicated they could pay about $120 billion. That was on top of the $246 billion the industry agreed to pay the states to settle tobacco litigation. And Rosenblatt argued the companies` cash flow could support a judgment of $150 billion or more. 

 In the two-year trial, Rosenblatt has already won two verdicts. Last year, the jury found cigarette makers liable for making defective and dangerous products. And earlier this year, the jury awarded compensatory damages to three smokers. Rosenblatt urged the jurors not to be overwhelmed by the size of his latest request. 

 ROSENBLATT: And hopefully you`re going to show them that regular people not engaged in high finances, not intimidated by these numbers... 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANK: Throughout his closing argument, Rosenblatt hammered at the theme that the tobacco companies deserved to be punished for manufacturing dangerous and defective products, and denying that they caused cancer. He also blasted several tobacco companies who were in court for being unapologetic and not -- for being unapologetic and not taking the stand during the first year of the trial. 

 Rosenblatt will close his argument tomorrow, leaving time for the tobacco industry lawyers to begin their defense that the industry does need deserve to be punished further because it has changed its ways. They also of course are trying to avoid what could be the largest jury verdict in history by more than 30 times -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Allan, exactly who decides how much: Is it the jury alone or does the judge have some input here? 

 FRANK: The jury makes the decision, Stuart, but the judge has power to reduce the jury verdict if he so chooses. And he`s indicated he might even consider that. 

 VARNEY: Now does the tobacco industry, the tobacco companies, if they are -- they do have to pay out a good deal of money, do they have to post a bond? 

 FRANK: They do have to post a bond, and what earlier had scared Wall Street about this case was a Florida law requirement that a 125 percent of the award be posted as a bond. This year the legislature changed that and limited the bond to $125 million, which the companies could easily post. Other states in tobacco country followed suit, so that their assets couldn`t -- tobacco company assets could not be attached in those states. 

 So Wall Street is not worried whether this would immediately force the companies into bankruptcy, and undoubtedly, any payment would be spread over a number of years -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Allan Dodds Frank reporting from Miami. Thank you, Allan. 

 Well, tobacco stocks barely budged today, but they have rebounded sharply from their 52-week lows. Philip Morris (URL: http://www.philipmorris.com/) , for example, is up 44 percent from its low. British American Tobacco (URL: N/A) American Tobacco has gained just over 74 percent. R.J. Reynolds has surged 87 percent. Loews (URL: http://www.loewshotels.com/) trading 66 percent higher than its 52-week low. 

 Topping tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers": Advanced Micro Devices up two points after tech analyst, Dan Niles, upped his price target on the chip-maker to $110 and repeated his outperform rating. 

 Premier National Bancorp (URL: N/A) jumped more than 6 1/2 on news that M&T Bank will purchase it in a $340 million stock deal. That`s a 57 percent premium to Friday`s closing price. 

 Biogen (URL: http://www.biogen.com/) down nearly 4 3/4. Prudential Securities downgraded it on concerns of slowing sales of its flagship drug, Avonex, which is used to treat multiple sclerosis. The first half of 2000 has been  tough on the biotech firm. It has fallen 46 percent since hitting its high of $129 a share. 

 And still to come, "Harry Potter" casts his magic over the publishing world, drumming up record sales. 

 This story and more when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: A big flop from "Big Brother"? Well, the second reality show of the season from CBS seems to be one too many for viewers. After a tremendously successful 13.5 rating debut last Wednesday, "Big Brother" lost more than 40 percent of its viewers on its second night out. And ratings have continued to sink nightly. The network argues that "Big Brother" is still pulling in higher numbers than CBS programs aired in the same time slot last summer, and that the show took time to catch on in Europe, as well. CBS spent an estimated $20 million for the rights  to "Big Brother" and has committed to run the show for 89 nights this summer. 

 But Americans couldn`t get enough of a very different kind of European import, the fourth book in the "Harry Potter" series by British author J.K. Rowling. This past weekend saw history made in the publishing business, a rush of book-buying unlike anything ever seen in this country. 

 Peter Viles reports on whether "Potter" really spells big profits for retailers and its U.S. publisher. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kids lined up to read it, parents to pay for it, and critics to praise it. The "New York Times" called it, quote, "big, clever, vibrant, and tremendously assured... everything it promised to be"; and more, causing the biggest burst of book-buying in modern history. Barnes & Noble sold 114,000 copies in one hour. Over the weekend, in sales on- and off- line, it reported 502,000 copies sold. Amazon`s tally stood at 392,000. And Borders said it sold 300,000 copies. 

 Publisher Scholastic plans to print another two million copies in the next two months, adding to the initial U.S. print-run of 3.8 million copies. The only world "Harry" didn`t conquer was Wall Street. Shares in those book retailing and e-tailing stocks were mixed. Amazon fell more than one dollar. And shares of Scholastic gained only fractionally. 

 PETER APPERT, DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX BROW: Scholastic`s stock has moved from the low 40s to the low 60s over the course of the last couple of months, largely in anticipation of the release of "Harry Potter" four. So I do think that much of the good news with regard to "Harry Potter" is perhaps already reflected in the stock. 

 VILES: E-tailers like Amazon probably lost money on weekend sales, because in addition to selling the book at 40 percent off, they were subsidizing rush delivery. 

 LAUREN LEVITAN, ROBERTSON STEPHENS: It`s possible that the company did experience a slightly negative margin on that first dose of items. At the same time, I think, if you look at this in the context of their total cost and the total benefit of the event, we actually think it`s a huge positive. 

 VILES (on camera): The only negative in all of this is that some stores haven`t been able to keep the book in stock. This Barnes & Noble in Manhattan had 900 books Friday night and none on Saturday night. Reinforcements finally came today. 

 Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.

 VARNEY: Up next: "Ahead of the Curve," some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open up again tomorrow. 

 You are watching MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Here`s what could move the markets tomorrow. The profit parade marches on, beginning with Dow component, International Paper; investors expecting second-quarter earnings of 74 cents a share. That would be more than triple last years` results; Biogen expected to report earnings of 42 cents. 

 And after tomorrow`s closing bell, Internet giant Yahoo! due to report profits of around 10 cents a share. 

 Keep an eye on the shares of Aspect communications. After today`s closing  bell, the company announced it will miss second- quarter earnings estimates. And it`s stock plummeted 21 points in active late trading.

 Honeywell Will  Cut  6,000 Jobs In Wake Of  Profit Warning

Dow Jones Business News

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Honeywell International Inc., which last month shocked Wall Street by issuing a second-quarter profit warning, Monday said earnings for the year will fall short of analysts' expectations and announced plans to eliminate 6,000 additional jobs. 

 The company said it will implement "aggressive cost-cutting initiatives" to offset weaker-than-expected revenue and higher raw-materials prices. Honeywell plans to reconfigure some of its businesses, including merging its polymers and specialty-chemicals businesses into one unit. 

 Honeywell said it will trim its workforce through hiring freezes, attrition and layoffs. The anticipated 6,000 job cuts would be in addition to the 11,000 positions Honeywell previously said it would cut after it completed its merger with AlliedSignal Inc. late last year. 

 Morris Township, N.J.-based Honeywell makes aircraft-guidance systems, electronic materials, industrial controls and a host of other things. 

 For this year, Honeywell (HON) expects to earn $3 to $3.05 a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for 2000 earnings of $3.11 a share. Honeywell earned $2.68 a share last year. 

 Honeywell caught Wall Street off guard when it reported on June 19 that it expected to earn 73 cents to 77 cents a share in the second quarter, below the 78 cents that analysts anticipated. At the time, That warning came just weeks after company executives sounded upbeat at an investment conference. 

 Michael Bonsignore, chairman and chief executive officer, Monday said management is willing to take the blame for not communicating with Wall Street about the shortfall before, and he vowed it won't happen again. "No excuses, no alibis," Bonsignore said during a conference call with analysts and investors. Management is "fully responsible for what transpired here," he said. 

 The company sees second-quarter sales growth of 6% to $6.3 billion, but with revenue growth offset by a subpar performance of its industrial automation and control unit and its aerospace-electronics unit hindered by a temporary supplier-parts shortage. 

 Bonsignore declined to talk about specific businesses that might be sold but he did say that the net result of the actions should be positive, although there may be a short-term drag on per-share results from divestitures. 

 Honeywell exited the chip-packaging business, writing down a chip-packaging piloting plant in the quarter. "We are out of that business," he said. Management will also move aggressively to fix the problems with its pharmaceutical operation, likely within six to 12 months. The business fell short of expectations in the second quarter. 

 "In the next three to four quarters, we will take significant actions to fix or sell businesses not pulling their weight," Bonsignore said. "Within a year, we expect to have the portfolio reconfigured as we like it." 

 Honeywell identified some segments of its materials business as non-core, and cited its friction-materials and consumer-branded-products operations as similarly non-core. "We won't do anything with aerospace," Bonsignore said, adding that he was "really excited" about that operation, which possesses "very exiting prospects." He added, "We have a wonderful business there" and it's the "envy of the industry." Bonsignore also said the company was "extremely well positioned as the acknowledged leader in industrial control." 

 Honeywell also plans to buy back some of its shares. "We will have a buy-back program...clearly in the near term," Bonsignore said. "The current stock price doesn't reflect the inherent value of the company," Bonsignore added. 

 "The failure to hit EPS (growth target) doesn't mean Honeywell is broken; Honeywell is not broken," Bonsignore said, adding that Honeywell still has a diversified portfolio of "very valuable businesses" with "technology that other companies would kill for." 

 He said there haven't been any problems with the AlliedSignal merger and that management still expects to realize $750 million in savings from from synergies. 

 Bonsignore forcefully defended his management team, citing an "overly aggressive objective and unusual confluence of factors" working against the firm. "This isn't about the lack of financial control or ability." He also said the company will give regular updates as it reconfigures its portfolio. "This has been an extremely painful situation for all of us," he concluded, and one that management doesn't intend to repeat.

 Dime Bancorp Deal Aims 

 To Deflect Takeover Bid 

 Taking its last opportunity to fend off a hostile bid by North Fork Bancorp, Dime Bancorp announced Thursday a $238-million investment by Warburg, Pincus Equity Partners, a private investment firm. 

 Although shareholders had been hoping for an acquisition of the entire company, or at least a selloff of part of the company, Dime's announcement closed the door on its month-long review of alternatives, according to Dime chief executive Lawrence J. Toal. 

 North Fork chief executive John Adam Kanas greeted the news with disdain, saying he was still asking Dime shareholders to "withhold authority" against Dime's slate of directors who are up for election at the annual meeting Friday. 

 "This does absolutely nothing for the common shareholders," Kanas said. 

 Worries About Cost of Winter Heating Already Surfacing 

 With temperatures hovering in the 80s and 90s, who's thinking of winter and heating costs? Petroleum experts and utility officials are, and they're keeping fingers crossed that residents will not be subjected to the sky-high prices they endured last winter. 

 What could help, they said, is if more crude oil is produced overseas so supplies are plentiful, demand for power this summer is low so electric utilities don't deplete stores of oil and refineries make a smooth transition from producing gasoline to home heating oil. 

 Computer Associates Suffers Huge Loss After Profit Warning

 A bombshell warning at midnight Tuesday about revenue and profit shortfalls by Computer Associates triggered a collapse of the company's stock Wednesday. It fell 42 percent, or more than $21, to $29.50. 

 By day's end, the stock had traded at 10 times its normal volume after the company's pronouncement that it would earn only about 11 cents to 16 cents per share in the first quarter, to be reported soon. Wall Street had expected about 55 cents per share. Executives said last week that internal and market pressures would hurt revenues. 

 CA's share price, which hit a 52-week high in January of more than $79, finished the week at $31. 

 The drop in price was devastating to the company's highest ranking executives, like chief executive Charles Wang, whose stock value lost $733 million in the drop, and Sanjay Kumar, whose shares lost $123 million in value. But it also hurt many of CA's 21,000 employees, who earlier this year were given rights to buy shares at a 15 percent discount. 

 Retailing Legend Alan Fortunoff Dies; Wife Possible Successor 

 The past week saw the passing of Alan Fortunoff, a retailing legend on Long Island, who died Tuesday night in his sleep at home from complications related to cancer. He was 67. 

 Only the day before, said co-workers who praised him for his work ethic and determination, he had shown up at his office at Fortunoff corporate headquarters to take care of business. 

 But with decades behind them in running the company, family members and other executives said they envision a smooth succession in top management. And, some retail industry experts suggested, a likely candidate to succeed Fortunoff as chief executive is his wife of 47 years, Helene. 

 Arrow Electronics Takes Large Stake in Mexican Dicopel SA 

 Melville-based Arrow Electronics Inc., the biggest seller of electronic components and computer products, has expanded its reach, announcing Wednesday that it acquired a 60 percent stake in closely held Dicopel SA, one of Mexico's largest electronics distributors. 

 The stake is part of Arrow's plan to align itself with distributors based in emerging markets as the company seeks to expand internationally. 

 Dicopel, based in Mexico City, employs 200 people and had sales of about $17 million in 1999. Arrow had sales of $9.3 billion last year. 

 Comverse Buys Exalink in Third Acquisition in Past Month 

 Comverse Technology Inc., one of the largest sellers of telephone- messaging systems, agreed to buy Exalink Ltd. for about $437 million in stock to add software used to deliver Internet content to Comverse's wireless devices. 

 Woodbury-based Comverse said Wednesday that it will exchange about 5.26 million new shares for closely held Exalink, based in Herzelia, Israel. Comverse will assume an undisclosed amount of options and warrants. 

 This is Comverse's third acquisition in the past month to add to its products for mobile-phone service companies, which generate 80 percent of its sales. 

 Spirit Airlines Halting 

 Service at MacArthur Airport 

 Like they say, you can't always get there from here, especially if here is MacArthur Airport, and if you want to fly on Spirit Airlines. That's because the carrier has pulled out of the Long Island airport, where it has provided service to five destinations in Florida: Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, West Palm Beach, Fort Myers and Orlando. 

 However, Spirit Airlines, which had flown from MacArthur since November, 1998, said it would expand its service from LaGuardia Airport in Queens to those same cities. 

 Energy Program Helps 

 Keep Companies Around 

 With business costs always rising in the area, some executives say cut-rate electricity from the New York Power Authority is having significant impact on their bottom line, and serves as an incentive to keep their operations in this area. 

 The state's electric costs are 60 percent higher than the national average, according to research by the State Assembly's energy committee. 

 Nearly 650 companies statewide have reduced their utility bills through the "Power for Jobs" program, created in 1997 to bolster private-sector employment by giving cheap electricity to businesses and not-for-profit organizations that promise to maintain jobs and to create new ones where possible. The program, considered one of the state's most successful, was extended in May by the state Legislature for another three years. 

 Area Investors Roll With 

 Stock Times to Blue Chips 

 With talk of the economy possibly slowing and the markets down, how are Long Island and Queens investors reacting? Measured concern, but not panic, over recent stock-market fluctuations characterizes how investors on Long Island and in Queens have typically reacted to the first half of 2000, which saw the markets climb skyward and then plunge just as quickly. 

 In a Newsday poll conducted last month, few said they had given up on Wall Street. Instead, many have shifted to the blue-chip stocks of large U.S. companies while the shares of the high-flying technology sector have fallen. 

 But in a shift signaling that perhaps investors have themselves returned to earth along with stocks' values, the average rate of return investors now expect from technology stocks is nearly half- about 15 percent -of what respondents said in a Newsday poll in March. 

 Island Mortgage Network 

 Suspended by State 

 Melville-based Island Mortgage Network Inc., a mortgage banker that has spent the past several years building itself through acquisition, was suspended from doing business on June 30 by the New York State Banking Department. 

 The subsidiary of AppOnline.com, a publicly-traded online mortgage banker, faced charges of funding loans without the necessary assets and refusing to show the banking department its books and records. 

 "They don't have the finances in order to be able to stay in business and fund loans," said Barbara Kent, the state banking department's director of consumer affairs. Kent said the charges could result in a revocation of the company's license. A hearing is scheduled for tomorrow.

 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 Jobs Report Reassures Wall Street

 Wall Street cheered Friday as the government's report on June employment provided further evidence that the Federal Reserve is having success in cooling the torrid U.S. economy. 

 The June jobs report, which showed weaker-than-expected growth in payroll employment, keyed a moderate rally in stocks that boosted the Dow Jones Industrial average by 154 points, to 10,635, on the day. For the week the Dow climbed 188 points, or 1.8%, cutting its year-to-date loss to 7.5%. Before Friday's advance, the major market averages had been little changed in the holiday-shortened week. 

 The Nasdaq added 57 points in the week, to 4023, a 1.4% rise. The technology-heavy index overcame a 128-point selloff Wednesday, which followed profit warnings from two software companies, Computer Associates and BMC Software. But the Nasdaq rallied 97 points Thursday and gained 62 points in the week's final session. 

 Investors quickly shrugged off Computer Associates' and BMC's news because those two companies specialize in the mature mainframe business, not the rapidly expanding networking area. Computer Associates plunged 20 1/2, to 30 5/8, and BMC was down 13 1/4, to 23 3/16, in the week. IBM was another casualty, falling 4 7/8, to 104 11/16, because Computer Associates' and BMC's situations underscored Big Blue's exposure to big iron. IBM still generates well over half its revenues from mainframe sales and services. 

 But, as one investor put it: "The dinosaurs are dying. What's the big deal?" Indeed, Larry Ellison, chief executive of database software giant Oracle, told The Wall Street Journal that "our business has never been better. We're going to have a spectacular quarter." 

 Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says a "euphoric soft-landing sentiment" may be building on Wall Street now that the June employment data suggest that the Federal Reserve may not have to raise rates much more. "The Fed seems to have done it again," Paulsen says, noting that real economic growth could slow to 3.5% in the just-ended second quarter, from 5.5% in the first quarter. A slowdown of that magnitude undoubtedly would please the inflation-phobic central bank. Bulls say there's plenty of appreciation potential in stocks, with the S&P and Nasdaq little changed this year and the Dow still in a hole. 

 Investors may soon be cheered by what are expected to be strong second-quarter profit reports. The earnings news will start flowing next week with reports from such stalwarts as General Electric, J.P. Morgan and Alcoa. GE, whose market value of $500 billion tops the stock market, is expected to post profits of 33 cents a share, up 18% from the 28 cents a year earlier. GE fell 1 11/16, to 51 5/16, last week. The earnings calendar is pretty light this week, but there will be an avalanche of reports next week. 

 Operating profits for the companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up an impressive 19% in the second quarter, not much worse than the 23.6% rise in the first quarter, according to First Call. Technology and energy likely were standout sectors in the period. Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, says the rest of the year looks good, with S&P profits seen rising 18.5% in the third quarter and 16.8% in the fourth. That means they may increase 18%-20% this year to over $60. Based on these estimates, the S&P now trades at around 25 times projected 2000 profits. S&P earnings advanced 18% last year. The big issue, Hill says, is whether profit growth will decelerate markedly in 2001 because of an economic slowdown. 

 The S&P 500 rose 24 points, or 1.7%, in the week, to 1478, and now is up 0.7% this year. The Russell 2000 index gained 2%, to 528. 

 Buoyed by rate hopes, major financial stocks advanced. American Express rose 1 5/8, to 53 3/4; Citigroup was up 5, to 65 3/16; Chase Manhattan added 4, to 50 1/16, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter gained 7 3/8, to 90 5/8. In the tech sector, Microsoft advanced 2, to 82; Intel, 5 5/8, to 139 5/16, and Cisco Systems tacked on 1 3/4, to 65 3/8. But Oracle was off 8 1/8, to 75 7/8. 

 -- Retailing stocks are having another tough year, although the group did post a strong advance last week on rate hopes. 

 In 1999, investors worried about the challenge from Internet competitors. Now that the e-tailing threat has faded, new worries have emerged about the weakening economy and uninspiring sales in recent months. The Dow Jones index of U.S. retailing stocks was off 15% through Thursday. And as the accompanying table shows, many stocks, including Federated Department Stores, Saks and Kmart, are down 30% or more in 2000 (See accompanying table -- Barron's July 10, 2000). 

 Some retailers, including industry leaders Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores, whose market values dominate the sector, did rise smartly on Friday following the June employment report. Home Depot added 3 3/4 to 55 while Wal-Mart gained 4 1/16 to 61 9/16. 

 Aside from Home Depot and Wal-Mart, most major retailers trade for under 25 times earnings with many fetching less than 10 times projected 2000 profits. 

 Some depressed retailers appeal to Ross Margolies, one of the top value-oriented managers in recent years. His fund, Salomon Brothers Capital, is up 18% this year. Margolies considers the retailing sector to be among the most attractive in the market, and he likes two out-of-favor stocks, Federated and Costco Wholesale. 

 Federated got pounded last week, falling 4 3/4 to 29, half its high last summer of 57, after it reported rising credit delinquencies at its Fingerhut division in June. Wall Street was spooked by the delinquency news because the company didn't quantify the problem and said little other than that it was "monitoring this situation closely." 

 Fingerhut, which sells to lower-income customers through its catalogue, finances much of its sales. It generally sustains sizable credit losses but charges high rates to compensate. Federated bought Fingerhut last year partly in a bid to expand its e-tailing capabilities. Margolies says he doubts Fingerhut's problems are serious, although the credit difficulties could nick 50 cents a share from next year's earnings if the problems persist. Federated, which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's, is expected to earn $4.05 a share this year and $4.55 in 2001, before any adjustment for higher credit losses at Fingerhut. 

 Margolies likes Federated because it has steadily taken market share from such competitors as J.C. Penney and May Department Stores, making it one of the strongest players in an admittedly slow-growth business. At its currently depressed valuation, Federated trades for less than eight times estimated 2000 earnings and its market value stands at a mere $6 billion, just 33% of annual sales. Margolies believes Federated could hit 50 in the next year if sentiment turns positive on the sector and the company executes well. It's notable that Federated competitor Kohl's, a favorite of growth investors, rose 4 1/2 last week to a record 60 and now trades for 60 times projected 2000 profits. Kohl's market value is now $20 billion, more than three times Federated's, even though Kohl's sales are about a third of Federated's. 

 Margolies' other choice, Costco, rose 1 9/16 to 34 9/16, but it remains below its April high of 60 because of its May profit warning. Margolies views Costco as a category killer that actually is beating Wal-Mart, whose Sam's Clubs have underperformed Costco. 

 Peter Siris, a former retailing analyst and the current head of Guerrilla Capital, a New York money manager, believes the combination of low valuations and strong cash flows could prompt takeover interest in certain retailers. He points out that retailers' profits are less cyclical than many investors believe, noting that May has generated annual earnings gains for 25 straight years. The group has historically benefited more than banks do from benign monetary policy. 

 Siris is impressed that the Gap rose 4 1/2 to 35 1/2 last week despite reporting weak June sales and guiding down current-quarter profit estimates. 

 Siris thinks Saks looks undervalued at 10 3/4, a third of its high last summer. His view: The Saks Fifth Avenue chain alone is worth the current stock price. Saks was the name adopted by Proffitt's, a Southern department-store chain, when it bought Saks in 1998. Siris also suspects that the Dillard family, which controls depressed Dillard's, is very frustrated by that stock. Dillard's, at 14 3/16, changes hands at around six times projected 2000 profits. 

 "I'd be surprised if we don't start to see some financial restructurings in the industry," Siris says. 

 -- 3Com is attracting investor interest ahead of the spinoff of its big stake in Palm on July 27. 

 3Com, which fell 1 to 56 13/16 last week, stands above its May low of 37 but below its peak of 119 on March 1, when investor mania on the day before Palm's initial public offering prompted a spike in 3Com's stock price. Palm fell 2 3/8 to 31 last week, leaving it way below its March 2 peak of 165. 

 Most of 3Com's value is attributable to its stake in Palm. Each 3Com holder will get an estimated 1.5 shares of Palm for every 3Com share, or roughly $46 in Palm stock (final ratios will be determined in the next two weeks). 

 This means that 3Com's core networking business is being valued at around $11 a share. It is the Palm-less 3Com that is luring some investors because 3Com will emerge following the spinoff with a spanking-clean balance sheet featuring over $3 billion in cash, or roughly $9 a share based on 3Com's 350 million outstanding shares. It has been difficult to isolate the core 3Com business until recently because Palm shares are difficult to sell short. This prevented investors from buying 3Com and selling short Palm to create a Palmless 3Com "stub." But pure 3Com shares began trading actively last week on a when-issued basis, finishing Friday at 13 1/2 (the ticker symbol is COMSV). The difference between the current price of 13 1/2 and the theoretical 3Com value of 11 mentioned above reflects uncertainty about the exact amount of Palm stock that will be distributed for each 3Com share and investor demand for the pure 3Com stub. 

 "3Com is very cheap," says Alec Cutler, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Asset Management. Cutler says that considering 3Com's cash position, investors are paying little for its core operation. 

 It's true that major chunks of 3Com's business are in decline, including network interface cards, but it does have some emerging businesses, like broadband and home-networking products, that are showing strong growth -- albeit from low levels. Cutler and Salomon Brothers' Margolies believe the new 3Com is worth at least $20 a share, although the stock may settle in around 15 after the Palm spinoff as investors take a wait-and-see attitude. Bulls say 3Com could hit 30 within the next year. 3Com is expected to lose 50 cents a share in its current fiscal year, ending May 2001, but earn 50 cents in the following 12 months. 

 Cutler points out that at 20, 3Com would be trading at around one times estimated fiscal 2001 sales of $3.4 billion, before factoring in the cash on its balance sheet. No networking company has such a low valuation. Cabletron Systems, a weak networking outfit, commands around three times sales. 3Com is expected to initiate a $1 billion stock-buyback program after the Palm spinoff, which could boost its share price. 

 One problem with 3Com is potentially heavy dilution from option issuance to 3Com employees in the wake of the Palm spinoff. This option issue has gotten little attention on Wall Street. 

 3Com employees now control options on an estimated 41 million 3Com shares. Following the Palm spinoff, 3Com will issue more options to employees to compensate them for the reduced stock price of a Palm-less 3Com. The formula will be based on the price of 3Com on the day before the spinoff, divided by the price of 3Com on the day of the spinoff. 

 Based on current prices, 3Com would have to issue about four options for each one currently held by its employees (using the company's current price of 56 13/16 divided by the when-issued price of 13 1/2 ). This could swell the total number of 3Com's fully diluted shares by an estimated 100 million or more. The current 3Com options are estimated to be deeply in the money. The dilution may not be so severe if 3Com employees exercise options prior to the spinoff or if Palm stock falls. More details on the option issuance are expected soon. 


But even with the option overhang, 3Com fans consider it the cheapest
play in the hot networking sector.

  Jobs Report Reassures Wall Street
  By Andrew Bary



Wall Street cheered Friday as the government's report on June
employment provided further evidence that the Federal Reserve is having
success in cooling the torrid U.S. economy.


 The June jobs report, which showed weaker-than-expected growth in payroll employment, keyed a moderate rally in stocks that boosted the Dow Jones Industrial average by 154 points, to 10,635, on the day. For the week the Dow climbed 188 points, or 1.8%, cutting its year-to-date loss to 7.5%. Before Friday's advance, the major market averages had been little changed in the holiday-shortened week. 

 The Nasdaq added 57 points in the week, to 4023, a 1.4% rise. The technology-heavy index overcame a 128-point selloff Wednesday, which followed profit warnings from two software companies, Computer Associates and BMC Software. But the Nasdaq rallied 97 points Thursday and gained 62 points in the week's final session. 

 Investors quickly shrugged off Computer Associates' and BMC's news because those two companies specialize in the mature mainframe business, not the rapidly expanding networking area. Computer Associates plunged 20 1/2, to 30 5/8, and BMC was down 13 1/4, to 23 3/16, in the week. IBM was another casualty, falling 4 7/8, to 104 11/16, because Computer Associates' and BMC's situations underscored Big Blue's exposure to big iron. IBM still generates well over half its revenues from mainframe sales and services. 

 But, as one investor put it: "The dinosaurs are dying. What's the big deal?" Indeed, Larry Ellison, chief executive of database software giant Oracle, told The Wall Street Journal that "our business has never been better. We're going to have a spectacular quarter." 

 Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, says a "euphoric soft-landing sentiment" may be building on Wall Street now that the June employment data suggest that the Federal Reserve may not have to raise rates much more. "The Fed seems to have done it again," Paulsen says, noting that real economic growth could slow to 3.5% in the just-ended second quarter, from 5.5% in the first quarter. A slowdown of that magnitude undoubtedly would please the inflation-phobic central bank. Bulls say there's plenty of appreciation potential in stocks, with the S&P and Nasdaq little changed this year and the Dow still in a hole. 

 Investors may soon be cheered by what are expected to be strong second-quarter profit reports. The earnings news will start flowing next week with reports from such stalwarts as General Electric, J.P. Morgan and Alcoa. GE, whose market value of $500 billion tops the stock market, is expected to post profits of 33 cents a share, up 18% from the 28 cents a year earlier. GE fell 1 11/16, to 51 5/16, last week. The earnings calendar is pretty light this week, but there will be an avalanche of reports next week. 

 Operating profits for the companies in the S&P 500 are expected to be up an impressive 19% in the second quarter, not much worse than the 23.6% rise in the first quarter, according to First Call. Technology and energy likely were standout sectors in the period. Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, says the rest of the year looks good, with S&P profits seen rising 18.5% in the third quarter and 16.8% in the fourth. That means they may increase 18%-20% this year to over $60. Based on these estimates, the S&P now trades at around 25 times projected 2000 profits. S&P earnings advanced 18% last year. The big issue, Hill says, is whether profit growth will decelerate markedly in 2001 because of an economic slowdown. 

 The S&P 500 rose 24 points, or 1.7%, in the week, to 1478, and now is up 0.7% this year. The Russell 2000 index gained 2%, to 528. 

 Buoyed by rate hopes, major financial stocks advanced. American Express rose 1 5/8, to 53 3/4; Citigroup was up 5, to 65 3/16; Chase Manhattan added 4, to 50 1/16, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter gained 7 3/8, to 90 5/8. In the tech sector, Microsoft advanced 2, to 82; Intel, 5 5/8, to 139 5/16, and Cisco Systems tacked on 1 3/4, to 65 3/8. But Oracle was off 8 1/8, to 75 7/8. 

 -- Retailing stocks are having another tough year, although the group did post a strong advance last week on rate hopes. 

 In 1999, investors worried about the challenge from Internet competitors. Now that the e-tailing threat has faded, new worries have emerged about the weakening economy and uninspiring sales in recent months. The Dow Jones index of U.S. retailing stocks was off 15% through Thursday. And as the accompanying table shows, many stocks, including Federated Department Stores, Saks and Kmart, are down 30% or more in 2000 (See accompanying table -- Barron's July 10, 2000). 

 Some retailers, including industry leaders Home Depot and Wal-Mart Stores, whose market values dominate the sector, did rise smartly on Friday following the June employment report. Home Depot added 3 3/4 to 55 while Wal-Mart gained 4 1/16 to 61 9/16. 

 Aside from Home Depot and Wal-Mart, most major retailers trade for under 25 times earnings with many fetching less than 10 times projected 2000 profits. 

 Some depressed retailers appeal to Ross Margolies, one of the top value-oriented managers in recent years. His fund, Salomon Brothers Capital, is up 18% this year. Margolies considers the retailing sector to be among the most attractive in the market, and he likes two out-of-favor stocks, Federated and Costco Wholesale. 

 Federated got pounded last week, falling 4 3/4 to 29, half its high last summer of 57, after it reported rising credit delinquencies at its Fingerhut division in June. Wall Street was spooked by the delinquency news because the company didn't quantify the problem and said little other than that it was "monitoring this situation closely." 

 Fingerhut, which sells to lower-income customers through its catalogue, finances much of its sales. It generally sustains sizable credit losses but charges high rates to compensate. Federated bought Fingerhut last year partly in a bid to expand its e-tailing capabilities. Margolies says he doubts Fingerhut's problems are serious, although the credit difficulties could nick 50 cents a share from next year's earnings if the problems persist. Federated, which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's, is expected to earn $4.05 a share this year and $4.55 in 2001, before any adjustment for higher credit losses at Fingerhut. 

 Margolies likes Federated because it has steadily taken market share from such competitors as J.C. Penney and May Department Stores, making it one of the strongest players in an admittedly slow-growth business. At its currently depressed valuation, Federated trades for less than eight times estimated 2000 earnings and its market value stands at a mere $6 billion, just 33% of annual sales. Margolies believes Federated could hit 50 in the next year if sentiment turns positive on the sector and the company executes well. It's notable that Federated competitor Kohl's, a favorite of growth investors, rose 4 1/2 last week to a record 60 and now trades for 60 times projected 2000 profits. Kohl's market value is now $20 billion, more than three times Federated's, even though Kohl's sales are about a third of Federated's. 

 Margolies' other choice, Costco, rose 1 9/16 to 34 9/16, but it remains below its April high of 60 because of its May profit warning. Margolies views Costco as a category killer that actually is beating Wal-Mart, whose Sam's Clubs have underperformed Costco. 

 Peter Siris, a former retailing analyst and the current head of Guerrilla Capital, a New York money manager, believes the combination of low valuations and strong cash flows could prompt takeover interest in certain retailers. He points out that retailers' profits are less cyclical than many investors believe, noting that May has generated annual earnings gains for 25 straight years. The group has historically benefited more than banks do from benign monetary policy. 

 Siris is impressed that the Gap rose 4 1/2 to 35 1/2 last week despite reporting weak June sales and guiding down current-quarter profit estimates. 

 Siris thinks Saks looks undervalued at 10 3/4, a third of its high last summer. His view: The Saks Fifth Avenue chain alone is worth the current stock price. Saks was the name adopted by Proffitt's, a Southern department-store chain, when it bought Saks in 1998. Siris also suspects that the Dillard family, which controls depressed Dillard's, is very frustrated by that stock. Dillard's, at 14 3/16, changes hands at around six times projected 2000 profits. 

 "I'd be surprised if we don't start to see some financial restructurings in the industry," Siris says.

 TECH WEEK IN REVIEW: Microsoft, Napster, Amazon

 WSJ.com 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It's the halfway point of a year that's brought wave upon wave of bad legal news for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), witnessed downloads of digital music go from future-think to the Next Big Thing, and seen a correction in tech stocks that's changed, well, everything. 

 It's been a year that could use the breather brought about by a shortened holiday week. But that breather gives us a chance to look ahead at the stories that are guaranteed to keep simmering for the next six months. When New Year's Day 2001 comes (complete with a repeat of tedious millennium talk, but thankfully without a Y2K-inspired death watch), what will the tech world look like? Will college kids still be able to grab Limp Bizkit songs from Napster? In what court will Microsoft's lawyers make their arguments? What level will the Nasdaq Composite Index be at? Will investors love Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) or hate it? 

 We can't know, but we'll try a few guesses. (For Dec. 29's Tech Week, we'll take a look back and see just how wrong we were.) 

 Whither Microsoft? 

 It hasn't exactly been a banner year for the Colossus of Redmond. 

 Settlement talks between the software giant and the government broke down in late March; almost immediately thereafter, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued stinging "findings of law," ruling that Microsoft maintained its monopoly in operating-system software by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the Web-browser market by unlawfully "tying" Internet Explorer with Windows. In all, Judge Jackson accepted 23 of 26 arguments brought by the government 

 The government, joined by 17 of the 19 states that sued Microsoft, then asked Judge Jackson to split Microsoft into two companies - one based around applications software, the other around the Windows operating system. Last month, Judge Jackson accepted the proposed split and moved the case to the appeals process, setting off a complex duel for legal position. The government invoked a once-obscure law allowing it to offer antitrust cases of great national interest to the Supreme Court for immediate review, skipping the U.S. Court of Appeals. Microsoft, seeing the appeals court as its best chance to get Judge Jackson's ruling overturned, fought to thwart that effort. 

 When the dust settled, the U.S. Court of Appeals had ordered the case delivered to it for review by the full appellate panel - an extremely rare request. But the appeals court also agreed to suspend its briefing schedule until the Supreme Court rules on whether or not it will take the case for expedited review. Microsoft's lone victory so far has been a ruling by Judge Jackson suspending tough restrictions on Microsoft's business practices while appeals are pending - but even that ruling was probably designed to get the Supreme Court to take the case. 

 Which court the case winds up in is the important question for Microsoft. The company's first brief on that question is due at the Supreme Court on July 26, with all replies due to be filed by Aug. 22. If the high court agrees to hear the case, arguments would be scheduled for sometime in the 2000-2001 term, which begins in October. 

 Here's betting that the high court won't do so. Generally speaking, the Supreme Court prefers to take a case only after a lengthy roster of lower-court opinions have been compiled. Add in the fact that the U.S. Court of Appeals has gone to extraordinary lengths to indicate that it wants the case and it seems even less likely that the high court will intervene. 

 So Tech Week's first fearless prediction is that the Microsoft case will belong to the U.S. Court of Appeals. But here's also a bet that even more people will be wondering if the case's outcome isn't becoming less and less important. The year 2000 has seen the Internet move from the personal computer to a wealth of handheld devices, such as Palm and its clones and mobile phones, and seen far more debates about online services than about operating systems. Microsoft isn't a contender in either market - its handhelds are also-rans, while its hapless MSN service should have been hauled behind the barn and shot years ago. (As for its much-hyped .NET strategy, it's so vague it could mean anything, and nothing will appear before 2002 at the earliest.) 

 While Microsoft will remain a PC operating-systems power for years, there's no guarantee that it will be more than a minor player in non-PC devices. If that happens, corporate historians may one day regard the antitrust case as having been more devastating as a distraction than as a fight in its own right. 

 Napster - and Its Discontents 

 Speaking of Microsoft, antitrust surgeon David Boies is spending his summer defending the beleaguered music-search service - an assignment that could prove far more of a challenge than hanging clueless Microsoft executives with their own e-mail messages. 

 Napster's legal defense is, well, kind of a stretch. Boies and Hank Berry, Napster's acting president, want the court to believe that it's legal for Napster users to share MP3s, provided they don't charge money to do so. In their view, that's in line with the "fair use" doctrine that lets you make a tape of your favorite CD for listening to on your Walkman. (But make no mistake: The recording industry would gladly sue you six ways to Sunday for that if it thought it could win.) 

 The next hearing in the case is set for July 26 - while it isn't really going out on a limb, here's betting that Boies won't get very far with the "fair use" argument. (To make matters worse, Napster executives have an e-mail problem of their own, blabbing about "pirated music" on the site and how promoting unknown bands could thwart the recording industry in court. Bill Gates must be smiling.) 

 A more interesting question is whether the recording industry will win a preliminary injunction shuttering Napster before a full trial. To do so, the industry will likely have to demonstrate that Napster has done immediate harm - such as by hurting music sales. Since studies of that question have differed, here's a bet that a preliminary injunction won't be granted. 

 It also seems unlikely that the recording industry will do what it really should - strike a deal and turn Napster into a revenue source. The battle has been too bitter, and by all accounts the industry seems determined to make an example of Napster. That may be a decision the industry will one day regret, but if so, the lesson won't be apparent until next year at the earliest. Here's predicting that the end of the year will find Napster still breathing, but in peril. 

 The Amazon Riddle 

 Here's a guarantee: Financial results from Amazon.com will be subjected to rigorous scrutiny and be the subject of nonstop argument whatever the numbers show. 

 That's not a very brave prediction - after all, the Seattle online retailer has always polarized stock watchers. Amazon loyalists point to its customer base of 20 million, solid-gold brand name and reputation for terrific customer service as indications that whatever the pitfalls of business-to-consumer e-commerce, Jeff Bezos and company will be not only survivors but also winners. Amazon's doubters, meanwhile, point to the company's rivers of red ink, endless expansion into new market categories and thin profit margins as warning signs that Bezos is doing little more than playing a shell game with investors' money. 

 So far, 2000 has belonged to the doubters. The most recent shot taken at Amazon came from Lehman Brothers debt analyst Ravi Suria, who blasted the company as a bad credit risk because it has shown no ability to convert its growing sales into profits and intimated that Amazon could find itself out of money. But more damage has been done by the spring's Nasdaq correction, which sent investors fleeing from dot-coms and demanding profits and fundamentals with the same misguided fervor that they once put toward demanding growth at any cost. 

 Amazon faces immediate worries about its second- and third-quarter revenues, which even the company's champions don't expect to offer much upside. Fearless prediction: The revenue numbers will indeed be seen as lackluster, breeding more anxiety from investors who won't have bothered reading deeply enough to see that the tepid numbers came as a surprise to absolutely no one. 

 But for Amazon, the real question will come next year, when the all-important holiday quarter's numbers get tallied up and some other questions are answered. At the end of the first quarter, Amazon executives said they expected the company's books, music and DVD/video businesses to attain operating profitability for 2000, adding that the company should generate positive cash flow on an operating basis for the next three quarters combined. Come New Year's Day, it'll be too early to know for sure how Amazon did, but some early returns should be in. Here's betting that those early returns will be good news for Amazon - but that its critics will be far from silent nonetheless. 

 Pick the Nasdaq 

 Will tech stocks be dominated by bulls or bears come New Year's? That's what everybody would really like to know - and so would we. Honestly, if we could predict something like that with any degree of confidence, we'd be in the Caribbean arguing the merits of the swimming pool vs. the ocean instead of sitting here battling carpal tunnel syndrome. We're not even going to guess.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE:  Tonight on MONEYLINE, Wall Street closes the week with a bang, lifting the Nasdaq back above 4,000 as investors take heart that the Fed will refrain from another rate hike. Setting the stage for today`s rally, a big drop in new jobs created. But is the real story a shortage of workers? And after a few earnings blowups, we look ahead to next week`s profit picture. How will Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) , Motorola (URL: http://www.mot.com/) and Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) perform? 

 Plus we`re hours away from learning whether the new "Harry Potter" book was worth the build-up, but is stock in the publisher --Scholastic -- worth a read? We check out "The Bottom Line" at Scholastic, 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, everyone. Stuart is off tonight. 

 Surprising weakness on Main Street today was applauded on Wall Street, the Dow industrials posting their best showing since the end of May. Stocks took off in a broad rally sparked by the June employment report. It showed job growth slowing down, and that could keep the Fed from raising interest rates again next month. 

 After a week filled with disappointing profit warnings, investors were looking for some good news, and today, they found some. 

 Allan Chernoff has more on the Friday firepower. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It`s Wall Street logic: The economy turns down and investors celebrate, toasting the idea that the Federal Reserve may no longer need to raise interest rates. 

 LARRY RICE, JOSEPHTHAL & COMPANY: Investors are coming back with more confidence that perhaps the Fed is gone for the rest of the year and there won`t be any surprises. 

 CHERNOFF: That thought is a tonic for bank stocks, whose profits depend on interest rates. 

 FRED PRICE, SANDLER O`NEILL: Financials have been beaten up so bad people for the last two years that people are finally, the value investors are finally taking a hard look and then saying, this really is a cheap sector, you can see that nibbling going on. 

 CHERNOFF: Financials led the Dow to 154-point gain. For the week, up nearly 2 percent. 

 The Nasdaq composite leaped over 4,000 for the first time in two weeks, delivering a 1 1/2 percent gain on the week. 

 Investors continued scrambling back into semiconductor stocks, especially capital equipment names, as the list of brokerage firms supporting the sector grew. Semiconductors had a roller-coaster week, tumbling on Wednesday when Salomon Smith Barney downgraded the stocks. 

 TIMOTHY GHRISKEY, DREYFUS CORPORATION: The demand for technology products remains extremely strong. This is an economy being driven by the  demand for technology. 

 CHERNOFF: But tech troubles remain. Yahoo! fell on a downgrade, pointing to slowing revenue and profit growth. And Compuware (URL: http://www.compuware.com/) became the latest software company to disappoint, warning earnings for the quarter could be only half of what "The Street" was expecting. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: But wait a minute. There`s a potential hole in Wall Street`s logic. If the economy is definitely slowing, won`t that be bad for corporate profits? Earnings for the second quarter should look good, but more soft economic data could very quickly end Wall Street`s celebration -- Willow. 

 BAY: And then the logic would change again. 

 CHERNOFF: And the attitude on Wall Street. It can shift back and forth very rapidly. 

 BAY: Now today, folks are in a good mood, a good Friday rally, a decent week for all the indexes. Any sense of optimism now heading into the second half of the year, the third and fourth quarters? 

 CHERNOFF: Well, certainly going into earning season, because we`re now just about finished with the preannouncement season. That`s usually when bad news comes out. Second-quarter earnings should be very good, setting a  positive tone for the Street. We`ll have to see, though, how much the economy slows down. That`s the key question going forward. 

 BAY: In the meantime, we`ll take the goods news on a Friday. 

 Thanks, Allan. 

 Checking some of the other big winners on Wall Street today, the Dow industrials powered ahead, led by strong gains in Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , up nearly 6 1/2. Two retailers, The Home Depot (URL: http://www.homedepot.com/) and Wal*Mart (URL: http://www.wal-mart.com/) , jumped more than four. IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , up nearly three after a recent slump. And Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) gained more than 2 1/2. 

 Over on the Nasdaq, Sycamore Networks (URL: http://www.sycamorenet.com/) rocketed 16 3/4. Redback Networks (URL: http://www.redbacknetworks.com/) gained more than nine. 

 Other big tech movers: Millennium Pharmaceuticals (URL: http://www.mlnm.com/) , Veritas Software (URL: http://www.veritas.com/) and Sun (URL: http://www.sun.com/) . 

 That tamer-than-expected employment report showed a significant slowdown in job growth last month. Businesses created fewer jobs in June than  at any time during the last four years. Nonfarm payrolls increased by just 11,000, down significantly from the revised 171,000 jobs created in May. 

 Bob Beard has more from Washington. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BOB BEARD, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): June`s overall nonfarm job growth, way below market predictions -- the smallest since a nasty blizzard battered the East Coast in January 1996. 

 While corporate America added 206,000 jobs in June, that was offset by government layoffs, including the loss of 190,000 temporary census jobs. Most experts agree the economy is showing signs of a second-quarter retreat. 

 WILLIAM DICKENS, BROOKING INSTITUTION: It`s one more piece of evidence that there`s been a slowdown in what had been a very rapid rate of growth in the economy in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. 

 BEARD: Services added the most jobs in June, 148,000. Retail added 49,000 jobs. Manufacturing, 19,000. Job losses, though, came in a key sector for economic growth, real estate. But 4 percent unemployment was enough to keep the administration crowing. 

 ALEXIS HERMAN, U.S. SECRETARY OF LABOR: This report is actually very reassuring. I think it tells us that this economy continues to perform at a very solid and steady pace, and I think it further indicates that this economy probably did take a breather last month. 

 BEARD: U.S. workers enjoyed a little more in their paychecks, too. Average hourly earnings grew a nickel to $13.71 last month. And so far, wage inflation remains fairly tame, up 3.6 percent from a year ago. 

 DICKENS: Wage growth is moderate, but not so hot that it has to be inflationary is again good news for most people. 

 BEARD: But the available pool of workers, a favorite indicator of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, fell 3 1/2 percent. 

 (on camera): That shrinking pool of workers means employers are having a tough time filling open positions, forcing many to boost wages. Bob Beard, CNN Financial News, Washington. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: And that very issue -- the tight labor market -- is something Fed policy-makers will be watching closely. 

 Ceci Rodgers picks up the story from Chicago. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CECI RODGERS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Job growth is slowing, and the labor market is easing up? Try telling that to small-business owners like Bill D`Ambrosio. He has three job openings, and his starting pay is about $2 over minimum wage. 

 BILL D`AMBROSIO, MAIL BOXES ETC.: We normally get a lot of referrals, but they`ve been hard to come by lately. Everybody seems to be looking. 

 RODGERS: Looking for qualified workers. Still, the numbers show that private-sector job growth has slowed. Average monthly payroll gains in the private sector were a blistering 244,000 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, those gains were nearly cut in half. 

 Economists say there may be more than one reason for dwindling job growth. 

 ANTHONY CHAN, BANK ONE INVESTMENT ADVISORS: One way to interpret this is that there is some slowing coming on. Another way of interpreting  is maybe there are not a lot of potential employees, so therefore employers don`t bother. 

 RODGERS: One indication that it could be the latter: the shrinking pool of available workers and its potential for pushing wages higher. Economists say the Fed will remain on the alert for signs of creeping wage inflation. The question is, will inflation continue to be a threat as  the economy slows? 

 LYLE GRAMLEY, MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION: I don`t think anyone knows the answer to that question. I don`t, and I don`t think the Fed does either. So there`s -- because inflation is creeping, not more than that, there`s no reason for the Fed to continue to tighten until the answer to that question becomes clearer. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 RODGERS: Gramley says there`s now less than a 50-50 chance the Fed will raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in late August. Still, with labor markets remaining tight, it may be many months before the Fed signals an all-clear on its credit-tightening campaign -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Ceci. 

 Both stock and bond investors today were betting that the jobs report will help convince the Fed to keep interest rates right where they are. Economists say the possibility of a rate increase at the next policy meeting in August is now below 50 percent. 

 Checking the Treasury action today, the 10-year bond up 7/32. The 30-year gained more than a half point, pushing the yield down to 5.87 percent. 

 Our next guest says it may be too early to tell what the Fed will do. Joining us now from Boston: Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics. 

 Allen, welcome back. 

 ALLEN SINAI, PRIMARK DECISION ECONOMICS: How are you? 

 BAY: Good. Give us your take on today`s labor numbers: a slowdown in demand, a slowdown in supply, a shortage of workers. 

 SINAI: It`s going to make it very tough for the Federal Reserve, and the hawks and doves factions on the Federal Reserve to decide what to do on August 22nd, pending on the data between now and then. Job growth definitely is slowing down in the private sector. There`s lots of weakness  in demand in the second quarter that says that`s why job growth slowed down. At the same time, we have a very tight labor market, indicated by the 4 percent unemployment rate and declines in labor force growth and the available supply of workers. 

 At the Fed, the hawks are going to say low unemployment rate, inflation risk ahead, let`s buy insurance with a quarter-point hike. The doves, perhaps led by Chairman Greenspan, will say let`s wait and see. 

 BAY: Now, this statistic, the available pool of labor, is an indicator that apparently Alan Greenspan watches very carefully. Is it a better indicator of the labor market and potential inflationary pressures? 

 SINAI: It`s an interesting indicator. I don`t think I would say it`s a better indicator. The sequence of events normally is the economy slows down  and responds to higher interest rates, and in this case, higher oil and energy inflation. Then the demand for workers eases off. That appears to be happening. And regardless of the supply side, in the aftermath of that with the lag, the unemployment rate goes up and the inflation prospect improves. And I would go with that scenario, and I think you see the bond market and the expectations in the fixed-income market going with that scenario as well. 

 BAY: Now, one of the concerns on the horizon is this notion of a rebound, that we`ll see an uptick in the economic indicators. How common is this in the process of a slowdown? 

 SINAI: In the last five years it`s been quite common to have one or two weak quarters in a sea of strength. But conditions are different now. Interest rates are almost two percentage points higher in the front end of the yield curve. The stock market`s gone nowhere for years, so the wealth effect isn`t happening. And we do have a bite out of purchasing power coming from higher oil and energy costs. So I think we really do have a slowdown that`s going to be permanent. But remember slowdown is not such a big thing anymore, because we`re slowing down from big numbers and our potential rate of growth is 3 1/2 percent a year. 

 BAY: Allen, briefly, is the Fed going to pull off, pull this off? Are we headed for the perfect soft landing? 

 SINAI: Well, over the next quarter or two, things are looking very good for that. I think next year we`re going to be softer -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) harder than a soft landing. And after a summer rally in the stock market, which started today, I think the stock market will correct further, but after we get that summer rally. The stock market looks good right now. 

 BAY: Allen Sinai, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE. 

 SINAI: Thank you. 

 BAY: Still to come, another blow to QUALCOMM (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) .  South Korea`s biggest wireless carriers snub the telecom pioneer and turn to its rivals. A similar disappointment for BroadVision (URL: http://www.broadvision.com/) sent investors running for cover. The software company gets the losing end in a bid for a high-profile contract. And its sure to be a blockbuster hit at your local bookstore, but can Harry Potter help Scholastic become a bestseller on Wall Street? "The Bottom Line" still to come tonight on MONEYLINE." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers," Orchid BioSciences (URL: http://www.orchid.com/)  jumped 9 1/2, hitting a new 52-week high. The biotech company said today that Celera Genomics (URL: http://www.celera.com/) will use its patented gene-analysis techniques in its research. PeopleSoft (URL: http://www.peoplesoft.com/) gained 2 1/2 after Lehman Brothers upgraded it to an outperform rating. Lehman said that meetings with the software company`s management indicated that business is improving. And Starbucks (URL: http://www.starbucks.com/) gained 3 3/4 after reporting a 9 percent increase in same-store sales late yesterday. The coffee retailer said that sales have jumped 32 percent so far this year, which has helped boost the stock. It`s up 72 percent year-to-date. 

 Broadvision plummeted today after American Airlines chose rival Internet software provider Art Technology Group as its Web site provider. Both companies make software that personalize what viewers see on Internet sites. American selected Art Technology`s "Dynamo" software package to develop its new "aa.com" Web site. American had been a longtime Broadvision client. 

 While AMR -- parent of American Airlines -- fell fractionally today, Broadvision plunged more than 13 1/2, or 25 percent, the most active stock on the Nasdaq. Art Technology Group gained 17. The stock is up nearly 2,000 percent from its 52-week low that it hit last August. Meanwhile, Broadvision is down more than 54 percent from its 52-week high. 

 Another big Nasdaq loser today: Qualcomm. The stock plunged after it appeared that South Korea will not choose to use Qualcomm technology. An official decision won`t come until next week, but investors weren`t willing to wait. Qualcomm stock tumbling more than 5 to 56 5/8. 

 For the details we`re joined by Casey Wian in our Los Angeles bureau --Casey. 

 CASEY WIAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Willow, Qualcomm`s stock was hammered by another blow to its future business prospects in Asia. Three large South Korean mobile phone companies have decided they prefer a technology designed by Ericsson (URL: http://www.ericsson.com/) and Nokia (URL: http://www.nokia.com/) for their next generation wireless phone service. Right now, Qualcomm`s technology dominates the lucrative Korean mobile-phone market. But it appears that may  not be the case when so-called third generation chips allowing wireless Internet access become available there in 2002. 

 This is the latest in a series of setbacks for Qualcomm. Its chip business has already been hurt by the Korean government`s decision to stop subsidizing cell phone sales, and two weeks ago, the company announced layoffs. 

 Last year Qualcomm`s stock soared. This year it has fallen almost as fast, losing more than 70 percent of its value. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 EDWARD SNYDER, CHASE H&Q: I mean, the good news for Qualcomm is that the core business is intact. They`re in no danger of insolvency or problems with the basic business. The bad news, of course, is all the announcements in the last quarter or so have basically dampened any prospects of rapid growth. And I think the run-up last year was based on the assumption that the company`s technology would spread throughout the world, and they would get revenues, whether royalties or equipment sales, from that technology. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 WIAN: Qualcomm says the Korean government has still not made a final decision, and it believes both standards will be used. Qualcomm also claims it will collect royalties no matter which system is adopted, because the competing standard is based on Qualcomm-patented technology. 

 And separately, Qualcomm is fighting another battle, this one against computer hackers. According to a published report, the FBI is investigating a former University of Wisconsin graduate student for penetrating  Qualcomm`s electronic defenses and compromising proprietary information -- Willow. 

 WIAN: Casey Wian from Los Angeles, thanks. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, the Pentagon prepares its latest test of a disputed missile defense system. Will tonight`s outcome determine whether the program lives or dies? We`ll have that story and more just ahead in our "News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: As you might imagine, several stocks hit a 52-week high today, including Brocade Communications (URL: http://www.brocade.com/) , CIGNA (URL: http://www.cigna.com/) , Genzyme General (URL: http://www.genzyme.com/) , Marriott (URL: http://www.marriott.com/) and MedImmune (URL: http://www.medimmune.com/) . 

 Saudi Arabia`s promise to increase oil supply by 500,000 barrels a day is -- quote -- "coming very soon": that according to a Persian Gulf oil official who also said today that intense discussions are ongoing. No details yet as to which other countries will cooperate or just how much extra oil supply will hit the market. But the official did say that non-OPEC member Mexico also plans to boost output. Since Saudi Arabia`s surprise announcement on Monday, oil prices have fallen more than $2, but today, light sweet crude closed up 29 cents at 30.28. 

 Turning now to the day`s top stories outside the world of business, Joie Chen in Atlanta has that in the "MONEYLINE News Digest" --Joie. 

 JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Willow, thanks. 

 The White House taking action tonight regarding the first planned execution under federal law in 40 years. President Clinton will postpone the execution of Juan Raul Garza, scheduled for next month. Garza was convicted  of ordering the murders of three men. The White House spokesman says the president wants Garza to have a full opportunity to apply for clemency under new Justice Department guidelines, which are coming out  soon. 

 Mr. Clinton supports the death penalty but says he wants it carried out fairly. 

 Just hours from now the launch window opens for the third test of a controversial anti-missile program. The president is expected to decide within months whether to deploy the national missile defense system. It has already flunked one test. 

 The White House says the program`s future doesn`t hinge on tonight`s outcome. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 P.J. CROWLEY, NSC SPOKESMAN: I would say a hit doesn`t automatically suggest success nor does a failure automatically come with a miss tonight. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 CHEN: Also today, Florida police say they have identified a body found in  a car at the bottom of a pond as Cory Erving, the son of basketball star Julius Erving. Cory was missing for over a month. Foul play is not suspected in this case. 

 Stock car driver Kenny Irwin died today in a crash while practicing for Sunday`s New England 300 race. Adam Petty, the fourth generation in the NASCAR dynasty, was killed at almost the same spot in May. 

 We`ll have more ahead on "THE WORLD TODAY." It`s coming up at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific. We hope you join us then -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Joie. 

 Still to come on MONEYLINE, some of America`s richest corporate executives are bailing out of their company stocks at a rapid pace: the list of who`s selling when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Despite today`s rally, several stocks hit a 52-week low today, including ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) , Ask Jeeves (URL: http://www.ask.com/) , Compuware, GoTo.com (URL: http://www.goto.com/) and Unisys (URL: http://www.unisys.com/) . 

 Some U.S. executives are dumping out of their company stock. According to  the Washington Service Research Firm, insider selling surged 68 percent to a record, $36 1/2 billion in the first half of the year. Leading the way, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. He shed $4 billion worth of Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) shares. Bill Gates sold $153 million worth of Microsoft stock. Together the two made up 12 percent of all insider selling in the first half. 

 Other big sellers included Michael Dell, who sold $755 million worth of Dell Computer (URL: http://www.dell.com/)  stock; Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) founder Ted Waitt` John Chambers of Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) and Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) . 

 Coming up in our next half hour, full coverage of today`s market action. We`ll check out what drove the Dow to its best showing in five weeks. But can tech stocks keep up the pace? We`ll ask money manager David Alger. And a Web powerhouse gets a thumbs-down from one Wall Street analyst. The lowdown on how Yahoo! stock reacted. Plus job cuts hit one of the top dogs on Wall Street: We`ll check out why Merrill Lynch is trimming its staff even while business is growing. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, a surprising slowdown in the number of jobs added to the U.S. economy: Will it be enough to stop the Fed from pulling the trigger on another rate hike? 

 And we`ll take a look at profits coming down the pike: Will next week`s batch of tech earnings live up to billing after a few big-time disappointments in recent days? 

 Plus, while millions can`t wait to get their hands on Harry Potter`s new adventures, we check out whether you might want to get a piece of the publisher: "The Bottom Line" on Scholastic. 

 But first, more on tonight`s top story, a Friday rally on Wall Street that carried all the major markets into positive territory for the week. Blue chip stocks posted their strongest showing since May 30th, as the Dow bolted higher from the opening bell, closing up 154 to 10635, up nearly 2 percent for the week. Tech and retail shares drove the move. Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) jumped nearly 6 1/2, The Home Depot (URL: http://www.homedepot.com/) surged  4, Wal*Mart (URL: http://www.wal-mart.com/) rose nearly 4 3/4, IBM and Intel up more than 2 1/2. Those Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) gains also helped power the Nasdaq back above 4000 for the first time in two weeks. The index gained 62, to 4023, up nearly 1.5 percent for the week. 

 Checking some other Nasdaq movers, Applied Materials (URL: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/) and Sun (URL: http://www.sun.com/) rose more than 2 1/2. Dell Computers surged nearly 3. Gateway up nearly 5 1/2 and Apple Computer (URL: http://www.apple.com/) gained more than 2 1/2. 

 Planting the seeds for today`s rally, another sign the economy may be cooling off, as U.S. businesses added only 11,000 jobs in June, far less than expected and a huge drop from previous months. The Treasury market welcomed the news on hopes the Fed would hold pat on interest rates at its next meeting. The 10-year issue gaining nearly one-quarter, its yield dropping 6 percent while the 30-year jumped more than half a point. 

 But the equity markets were the scene of most of the Friday fireworks. For more on the day, we go to Fred Katayama at the New York Stock Exchange -- Fred. 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, investors couldn`t seem to get enough out of that surprisingly weak job creation number. With the triple-digit gains today, stock strategists say they now expect to see a summer rally in the third quarter. They argue the prospects for corporate profits are bright. Earnings tracker IBES predicts overall gains of 18 to 19 percent in the third quarter. 

 This could spark enough momentum for stocks to break out of the current trading range and into a summer rally, but a mild one at best. And traders and strategists warn that any rally may not last long. 

 Bill Meehan of Cantor Fitzgerald says he`s advising his clients to use any rallies at the end of earnings season to sell and raise cash. He just doesn`t see any catalysts for pushing stocks higher once the upcoming earnings season nears an end. 

 And some strategists say there`s still room for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in August. They note that the average hourly earnings figure in today`s report still hints that a tight labor market is applying upward pressure on wages. And that figure, they say, is one stat Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan likes to monitor. 

 And one of his other favorites, the Economic Cycle Research Institute`s future inflation gauge, is close to an 11-year high -- Willow. 

 BAY: Fred, still a nice way to end the week. Fred Katayama at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 One loser today in an otherwise up market: Yahoo!. It took a hit on a grim prognosis from Deutsche Banc Alex Brown. The brokerage house cut its rating for Yahoo!, this based on concerns of slower-than-expected growth in revenues, as well as worries over the stock`s valuation. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 ANDREA WILLIAMS RICE, DEUTSCHE BANC ALEX BROWN: So it gets to be much more difficult to generate the revenue and EPS growth that investors have come to expect from Yahoo!. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: The stock dropped today, down nearly six ahead of next Tuesday`s earnings report. 

 Compuware prepared investors for its own profit report, and the stock got hammered today. The software maker warned that first quarter earnings will be well below Wall Street estimates due to weak revenues. Compuware expects to post a profit of seven to nine cents a share. Analysts expected 15 cents. Today its stock lost 11 percent, down more than a point to a 52-week low. 

 Compuware is only the latest in a list of tech firms to alert investors to disappointing results. But Bruce Francis reports warnings may be up, but surprisingly, so are projections for the tech sector. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Compuware, Computer Associates, Unisys, all recently warned of worse-than- expected results, part of a rising tide of negative preannouncements. In fact, according to First Call, negative preannouncements as a percentage of the total are at 59 percent, significantly higher than last quarter and ahead  of the same period last year as well as the historical average. 

 But tech investors are hoping that the worst is over. 

 DENNIS MCKECHNIE, PIMCO: This week was the week of confessions, preannouncements. Companies had finished their three-month quarters just so they know what they`re going to print, they feel confident about their numbers. Once they didn`t have confidence, had to let that out to the public. And so right now we go from bad to good. 

 FRANCIS: Despite the wave of negative preannouncements, expectations for tech earnings overall have been rising, not falling. A month ago, analysts expected tech earnings on average to rise a healthy 29 percent. But now the overall expectation has soared to an average gain of 37 percent, partly due to Intel`s preannouncement of a big investment gain. Intel`s preannouncements supercharged an already strong outlook for semiconductors, on top of the very strong gain last year. Profits for software makers are expected to grow 22 percent, slightly off last year`s levels. Despite concerns about mainframes, computer company earnings are expected to edge out `99`s results, but dragged down by laggards like 3Com (URL: http://www.3com.com/)  and Cabletron (URL: http://www.cabletron.com/) . 

 Communications technology companies are expected to post just 8 percent growth, way behind last year`s results. 

 CHUCK HILL, FIRST CALL: Technology in the aggregate is going to have a terrific quarter in terms of earnings growth. It`s just this one area over here and part of the software area that`s having a little bit of a problem. 

 FRANCIS: The data storm starts with a trickle next week, as Yahoo!, Motorola and Gateway report results. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: The question for investors: Will strong tech results be enough to  lift tech stocks? Last quarter`s mostly stellar results failed to stop the Nasdaq correction, as investors reconsidered those high valuations. Right now, the Nasdaq is just about where it stood at the beginning of the first quarter reporting period. 

 So, Willow, investors get to decide. 

 BAY: So when you look at the sectors, Bruce, the barn burner here? 

 FRANCIS: Semiconductors, far and away. Yes... 

 BAY: Despite the debate we saw this week, the verdict is in. 

 FRANCIS: The debate this week is more really about the future. This quarter, I think, there`s very, very little discussion of whether this should be great. They`ve got pricing pressure, everybody is constrained. Let`s see, though, how that affects other people, like the computer systems makers. Maybe they won`t get all the parts they need, and you could see hits to revenue there. 

 BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks. 

 Coming up, should we expect tech stocks to turn it around for the third quarter? We`ll put the question to David Alger, one of the top tech-fund managers over the past decade. 

 That`s next on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers," HotJobs.com (URL: http://www.hotjobs.com/) jumped more than 3, or 24 percent. Deutsche Banc raised it to a strong buy based on considerable momentum and attractive valuation. 

 Brio Technology (URL: http://www.brio.com/) plunged nearly 11 1/2, or 57 percent, hitting a new low. The software maker reported a first-quarter loss of 16 cents a share. Analysts were looking for it to earn eight cents. 

 And Millennium Pharmaceuticals gained nearly six. Several brokerages making comments following the biotech firm`s $53 million purchase of Cambridge Discovery Chemistry. Since falling dramatically earlier in the year, the stock has rebounded, up 114 percent year to date. Just a few months ago, our next guest was named one of three top fund managers. At the time, his Spectra Fund, with nearly 70 percent of holdings in tech stocks, had the best returns over 10 years. So far this year, Spectra is down more than 9 percent compared to the S&P 500`s slight gain. Still, over the last decade, Spectra boasts an annualized return of nearly 27 percent against the S&P 500`s near 18 percent return. 

 Overall, he manages 20 different funds. Four of his top five holdings are tech stocks, including Microsoft and Cisco. The exception: Home Depot. 

 Joining us now for tonight`s "MONEYLINE Focus" is David Alger of Alger Funds. 

 David, welcome. 

 DAVID ALGER, ALGER FUNDS: Wonderful to be here. 

 BAY: Given what you saw today, decent week, good Friday rally, a sign of that strong second half that you expect? 

 ALGER: I think so. I mean, I think what`s happening is exactly predictable. The economy is slowing. You`ve had about 15 different signals that that`s happening. The National Association of Purchasing Managers` numbers, housing numbers, are down. Car sales are down, retail sales are lousy, and now, of course, we`ve got the second employment data, which is lower. And so, consequently, I think it`s very, very clear that the economy is slowing, and I think the Fed should logically get off our back. 

 BAY: Well take the good news today, because the market has been rattled quite a bit this week by some warnings. Today, an analyst commented  on Yahoo!. I`d like your take on that. Do you think we`re going to see slowing revenues for Yahoo!? 

 ALGER: I don`t think we`re going to see slowing revenues for Yahoo!. I mean, I think there may be some constraint on the dot.com advertising front, but I think Yahoo!`s going to grow very, very rapidly over the next five years. 

 BAY: But some constraint on the dot.com advertising revenue is potentially a big deal for Yahoo! and for the Internet sector in general. 

 ALGER: Well, I think over time there`s going to be a lot of advertising on Yahoo!, I mean, which is not necessarily going to be dot.com in nature. I think conventional advertisers, or conventional retailers are going to advertise as well. So... 

 BAY: You think they`re learning the value of that highly targeted market? 

 ALGER: Exactly so. That`s exactly right. And I think the comments that were made today, I mean, you know, you can play with those numbers any which way. I mean, one of the, I think, errors that was made is the terminal valuation of 30 times earnings. And if you put a terminal valuation on 30 times earnings, of course you`re not going to get 30 percent stock gain for five years. I mean, that`s, of course, preposterous. 

 BAY: One of the concerns today also was valuations. At 116, was Yahoo! expensive in this market? 

 ALGER: No, I don`t think it is. I think because once you get a strong market in general in the second half with technology stocks doing  very well, which I think they will, I think Yahoo!`s growing extremely fast. It`s certainly one of the two or three leaders in the Internet sector, and I think it will do well this year. How it does  five years from now I think is anyone`s conjecture. And I think this is just a call, a dramatic call, perhaps, but based on numbers, which anyone can cast in any which was five years out. 

 BAY: Now one of your funds, your midcap fund, is up more than 17 percent. We`ve been hearing a lot of talk about the midcaps lately. Are they going to keep up the growth throughout the year? 

 ALGER: I think they will. I think midcap is a wonderful sector because the companies are large enough to withstand any kind of downturn in the economy, and yet they`re small enough to grow really rapidly. And I think that`s why we`ve always liked midcap, and that`s why we`re doing well there this year. 

 BAY: David Alger, as always, thanks. 

 ALGER: Wonderful to be here. 

 BAY: Still to come, the world`s largest brokerage trims the fat to boost its bottom line. The story, when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Another dot.com delay: Divine Interventures was expected to go public this week between $13 and $15 per share, but sources close to the  deal say the IPO will now price lower than anticipated. And now it`s scheduled to start trading Tuesday. The reason: concern from the Securities and Exchange Commission over pre-offering publicity by the company, an issue that forced the postponement of Webvan`s (URL: http://www.webvan.com/) IPO last year. 

 Merrill Lynch is doing something it hasn`t done in two years. It`s trying to cut costs by cutting its payroll. The last time it slimmed down, the cutbacks were due to big bond market losses. This time, the move is a preemptive strike to protect profits. 

 The stock plunged early in the session 

 Allan Dodds Frank has more. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Merrill Lynch has started to trim operations, determined to cut costs even while business is strong. 

 MARK CONSTANT, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Some of the revenue elements are out of their control. This is what they can control. Stan O`Neal, who`s now running the private client group at Merrill Lynch, you know, this is his opportunity to really make his mark, put his stamp on the franchise and achieve a very visible target. And I think he`s going at it  pretty aggressively. 

 FRANK: Last month, Merrill Lynch reduced its regional office structure to 19 districts from 26. And over the next three years, the firm is expected to lay off several thousand back-office workers, as well as executives, but none of its 14,600 brokers. 

 Merrill Lynch had no comment, but insiders tell MONEYLINE the 28,000 workers in marketing, technology and strategic planning will bear the brunt of the cuts. 

 Analysts say Stanley O`Neal, the new boss of Merrill`s brokerage force, telegraphed his intentions two months ago. He told institutional investors: 

 "We`re focused on rationalizing the use of our resources, which will produce even greater efficiencies. We believe we can increase the pre-tax profit margin in this business from 16 percent currently to 20 percent over the next three to four years." 

 AMY BUTTE, BEAR STEARNS: Merrill`s in the process of changing its strategy. It`s becoming more technology-oriented, going from normal commissions or traditional commissions to $29.95 a trade. And in order to do that and be profitable for shareholders, you have to be lean and you have to be mean. And that`s what we`re seeing. 

 FRANK: And to stay on track, Merrill vows to reduce the 52 percent of net revenue it spends on pay and benefits. That`s a higher ratio than that of  any of its rivals. 

 (on camera): The rest of Wall Street is sure to note Merrill`s moves, and some analysts predict other firms may consider cutbacks, too. 

 Allan Dodds Frank, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Shares of Merrill Lynch have been on a tear over the past year. They`re up 58 percent, trading just under their 52-week high, reached yesterday. 

 Microsoft has bowed to European regulators and agreed to scale back its plan to take joint control in British cable operator Telewest Communications (URL: http://www.telewest.co.uk/) . The software giant has agreed to break all structural links with its partner, Liberty Media (URL: http://www.libertymedia.com/) , and it will now only buy a 23.7 percent stake in Telewest. 

 The European Commission had feared that Microsoft would dominate  the market for digital television software. Shares of Microsoft rose more than a point today to close at 82. 

 In other corporate news, Cisco on a tear. The company continued its buying spree today, snapping up the 80 percent of Netiverse  it doesn`t already own for $210 million in stock. Privately held Netiverse develops hardware and software technology for speeding delivery of Web content. It is Cisco`s 13th acquisition this year. 

 Just ahead, the wait for Harry Potter`s "Goblet of Fire" is nearly over. But does the frenzy over a teenage wizard mean you should rush out to buy the publisher`s stock? The story, when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Now for our regular Friday feature, "The Bottom Line," an in-depth look at a company making news. This week, Scholastic, the publishing house that`s riding a tidal wave of publicity over the fourth book in the "Harry Potter" series. Unless you live in a place with  no television, no newspapers, no bookstores and no Internet access, you`ve probably heard a lot, maybe more than you wanted to hear, about the new book. But when a single product commands that much attention, should you buy the stock behind it? 

 Peter Viles goes behind the hype and gives us "The Bottom Line," on Scholastic. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Each of those beeps represents another copy of the new Harry Potter book sold and labeled for delivery tomorrow. The book`s American publisher, Scholastic, has shipped 3.8 million copies, a British publisher another million and a half, making it the biggest first-run printing of a book in history. 

 Today, Amazon was selling a copy every three seconds, and investors are taking note. Shares of Scholastic have rallied more than 40 percent since early May. 

 (on camera): Scholastic has already succeeded in creating a huge marketing event that combines secrecy and hype. In all likelihood, tomorrow this will be the best-selling book in America. But tonight, it`s a mystery. Millions of copies are locked up in back rooms like this one... 

 (voice-over): ... with strict instructions: do not touch until July 8th. The question for investors is, what happens to Scholastic stock after the latest round of Harry hype dies down? 

 Analyst Rudy Hokanson believes the spotlight will reveal a well- run company trading at an attractive price. 

 RUDOLF HOKANSON, CIBC WORLD MARKETS: We think Scholastic stock is undervalued as it is. So if you believe that value is eventually recognized, which I`m a big believer in, whatever it takes, you know, and who knows why, as attention is drawn to a company, if other investors see the value, the stock can get the bounce. 

 VILES: But to understand Wall Street`s relationship with Scholastic, you need to know about "Goosebumps" and the "Goosebumps" nightmare of 1997. "Goosebumps" was a huge hit, a best-selling monthly paperback series. But Scholastic printed too many copies and was forced to take a huge charge to cover returns. The stock fell 40 percent in one day in 1997, and, as you can see, has never fully recovered. So what if the same thing happens to Harry Potter? 

 RICHARD ROBINSON, CEO, SCHOLASTIC: "Goosebumps" and Harry Potter are really apples and oranges. "Goosebumps" was a paperback series with one book published every month. Here, we`re talking about only four books, and longer, hardback, literary classics, really, that are going to be around for 100, 150 years. 

 VILES: Still, anyone who buys this stock for the Harry factor needs to consider the Harry risks: This fourth book might not sell as well as the first three. The author, J.K. Rowling, might take books five, six and seven to another American publisher. Scholastic does not own the lucrative movie and licensing rights -- those went to Warner Brothers, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner. And there`s the risk the Harry bounce is already priced into the stock. 

 But the ultimate caution is this: Harry may be magic, but he`s not the be-all, end-all for Scholastic. 

 ED HATCH, S.G. COWEN: The Harry Potter books might be 5 percent of sales or 5 percent of profits. It`s certainly become a big franchise, but not  necessarily the reason to go out and buy Scholastic stock. 

 VILES: If you do your homework on Scholastic, you`ll find it is a family business that makes its money helping kids do their homework. It has been a leader in educational publishing since the 1920s, when Richard Robinson`s father started the company. 

 HOFKANSON: If you want to think children and you want to think reading, we  think Scholastic is the brand name. 

 VILES: Its highest-margin businesses are book fairs and book clubs. It recently published reference publisher Grolier and has posted solid earnings gains. First Call consensus is for $3.18 in fiscal 2000, more than double earnings from 1998. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: One last note on Harry Potter. Analysts do not believe this was a fluke or a lucky find for Scholastic. The company has a long history of coming up with children`s best sellers. In fact, its series called "Clifford the Big Red Dog," has sold more than twice as many copies as the Harry Potter series -- Willow. 

 BAY: Pete, what are the chances, what are the odds, they printed a few copies too many here? 

 VILES: It`s possible, but with the Internet giving them a read on early demand, unlikely. BAY: Peter Viles, thanks.

 Sears, Roebuck profits will exceed forecasts Sears, Roebuck & Co., the second-biggest U.S. retailer, yesterday said its second-quarter earnings will rise more than forecast because of higher sales in June. 

 The company expects profit to exceed the 99 cent-a-share average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Per-share results will be 20 percent to 25 percent more than the 86 cents earned a year earlier. 

 This is the third straight quarter Sears has said earnings would beat estimates. Sears has been trying to woo shoppers with new marketing and by cutting prices on basic clothing such as T-shirts. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 2.3 percent in June, a month when rainy weather and higher gas prices and interest rates cooled sales for many retailers. 

 ''In a difficult period, Sears had a surprisingly good performance," said Paul Resnik, directory of equity research at Joseph Stevens & Co. Sears shares fell 50 cents to $33.56 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 10 percent this year, while Standard & Poor's department store index has dropped 4.3 percent. Federated Stores hit by credit delinquencies Federated Department Stores Inc. shares fell 15 percent yesterday, their biggest drop ever, after the retailer warned of rising delinquencies among credit-card holders at its Fingerhut catalog division. 

 Shares of the parent of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and other chains fell $5.19 to $29.63, the lowest level since February 1996, in New York Stock Exchange trading. 

 Fingerhut, which Federated bought last year, sells electronics, linens and other household goods to low- and middle-income consumers using its credit or payment plans. Fingerhut's customers will likely continue to be hurt by rising gasoline prices and interest rates, meaning delinquencies could continue to increase, analysts said. 

 ''The stream of earnings coming out of Fingerhut is going to be more cyclical compared with Federated's department stores," said analyst Jeffrey Stein at McDonald Investments, who rates Federated a "long-term buy." Boeing widens lead over Airbus Boeing Co. widened its lead over rival Airbus Industrie even further in a final tally of half-year orders released yesterday by the world's biggest maker of commercial jetliners. 

 Boeing listed orders for 328 planes through June 30 on its Web site, with six cancellations reducing its net total to 322. Airbus has said it had orders for 239 planes through June 30. 

 The figures for Boeing are higher than the 295 cited by a spokesman as the half-year tally a week ago. They include orders for 30 additional 737 and 757 planes from American Trans Air Inc., which announced the purchase in May, and orders for three 737s from other customers. Gap warns it will miss forecasts Gap Inc., the largest U.S. clothing chain, expects fiscal second-quarter earnings will miss forecasts because of lower sales and profit margins. 

 Earnings for the quarter ending July 29 are expected to be about 3 cents a share less than the 26- cent average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. The operator of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains earned $195.8 million, or 22 cents, a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year fell by 2 percent in June as Gap cut prices to clear out spring and other seasonal goods. Some analysts predicted a 5 percent decline and expected Gap to issue a profitwarning. Its shares rose $3.38, or 11 percent, to $33.38 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. PricewaterhouseCoopers resigns as fund auditor Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. said PricewaterhouseCoopers resigned as an auditor of its mutual funds due to potential conflict of interest. 

 The resignation, reported yesterday in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, affects funds with assets totaling about $20 billion, said Tom Campbell, Morgan Stanley's manager of mutual funds. PricewaterhouseCoopers had been a long-time auditor of Morgan Stanley institutional and variable annuity funds, but not the firm's retail funds. 

 PricewaterhouseCoopers made headlines in January when an outside consultant reported that some of the firm's accountants and executives had invested in audit clients, a violation of accounting independence rules. However, the auditor's resignation at Morgan Stanley didn't stem from this type of conflict, Campbell said. 

 ''We have been very happy with them," Campbell said. He added that the type of conflict PricewaterhouseCoopers faces at Morgan Stanley will arise more often as accounting firms increasingly merge. Campbell declined comment when asked whether PricewaterhouseCoopers is planning a transaction that would affect its auditor independence at Morgan Stanley. Retail data suggests economy still cooling New orders to U.S. factories in May took their biggest jump in more than seven years. But a more up-to-date report showed that many of the nation's largest retailers had sluggish sales in June, adding to signs that the economy's pace is slowing. 

 A big burst in demand for electronics helped push factory orders up by a larger-than-expected 4.1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted $385.8 billion, the Commerce Department said yesterday. It marked the biggest increase since December 1992 and follows a 3.8 percent drop in April. 

 In another report, many retailers in June reported weaker-than-expected sales for the fourth consecutive month. Soaring gas prices and some unseasonably cool weather were cited as the biggest factors dampening Americans' desire to shop in June. But analysts also said the Federal Reserve six interest-rate increases over the past year affected sales. 

 ''Consumers took a breather," said Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp. "These figures support the notion of a slowing economy." IBM and Compaq teaming on storage products International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp. yesterday said they will resell each other's data-storage products, as the world's No. 1 and No. 3 computer makers team up to battle top storage company EMC Corp. 

 Compaq and IBM said they'll invest more than $1 billion in the venture. Compaq, the world's biggest maker of personal computers, will sell IBM's Shark storage server and some software and provide support for the products. IBM will offer Compaq's smaller storage systems, software and services. 

 IBM is challenging EMC for a bigger chunk of the storage-systems market, where sales will rise to $48 billion in 2003 from $16.6 billion today, IBM said, citing market researcher IDC. Storage has become more important as companies collect mounds of data on customers, sales and inventory. 

 IBM shares fell $2.25 to $101.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Houston-based Compaq fell 13 cents to $24.81. EMC slipped $1.13 to $74.50. EDS gets $2.1 billion IT outsourcing contract Information technology services company Electronic Data Systems Corp. yesterday said it received a $2.1 billion contract from British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce PLC to provide information technology systems and services through 2012. 

 The contract is an extension of a 1996 agreement between the companies. Under the new contract, EDS will focus on updating Rolls-Royce electronic business and supply chain systems worldwide. Plano, Texas-based EDS had $18.5 billion in revenue last year. Its stock ended regular trading at $39.81, down 31 cents, or 0.9 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. Lilly wins FDA approval for menstrual mood drug Pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly and Co. yesterday said it won U.S. regulatory approval for Sarafem, the first prescription drug to treat women who experience severe mood and physical symptoms during their menstrual cycles. 

 Sarafem contains fluoxetine hydrochloride, the same active ingredient found in Prozac, Lilly's blockbuster antidepressant drug. 

 Lilly said the additional trademark will help with educational efforts for this condition, known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder, while reducing confusion about the differences between depression and PMDD.

 Stocks sank slightly on Bay Street yesterday as investors awaited key economic data from the United States and Canada, due out today, that may indicate a direction for interest rates. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-stock composite index closed down 81.19 points to end at 10,242.56 after two consecutive record-high closes. 

 In Vancouver, the Canadian Venture Exchange index slid 21.58 points to 3,420.60. 

 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average finished slightly lower, dipping 2.13 points to 10,481.47. The market was down for most of the morning, with shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business Machines Corp. suffering declines. 

 The tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index was up 97.47 points to 3,960.57 as investors returned to some tech stocks tentatively after Wednesday's declines, looking for bargains. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 10.44 points to 1,456.67. 

 Nortel Networks Corp. was the most-traded stock on the TSE, and the heavy-weighted telecommunications giant company saw its shares sag $2.25 to close at $103.75. And fibre-optic components maker JDS Uniphase Canada Ltd. finished down $8.45 at $169.55. 

 Big losers in Toronto also included MDSI Mobile Data Solutions Inc., a wireless software company based in Richmond, B.C. It warned of a second-quarter earnings shortfall and saw its stock sink 37 per cent to $22.40. 

 There were some bright spots in yesterday's trading session, with Mississauga, Ont.-based biotech firm Cangene Corp. -- among the most active stocks on the TSE -- up 30 cents to $9.30. 

 Stock in Montreal-based Bombardier Inc. rose 95 cents to close at $21.70. 

 Semiconductor maker Mosaid Technologies Inc. saw its shares jump 39 per cent or $9.65 to close at $34 in the wake of analyst recommendations. 

 Although many investors were looking ahead to this morning, when U.S. employment numbers and Statistics Canada's labour-force survey are to be released, volume was surprisingly heavy, at almost 85 million shares. 

 Mario Angastiniotis, senior financial economist with Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto, says today's numbers could signal a summer rally. 

 "Under the surface, we believe there may be a bubbling up of a rally of sorts. Certainly, all of it depends on what [today's] numbers say." 

 He also cautioned that more evidence than today's employment figures will be needed to see if predictions of a soft landing for the U.S. economy -- without the need for the U.S. Federal Reserve Board to hike interest rates -- will be borne out. 

 In New York, some technology shares saw a limited recovery from Wednesday's earnings-warnings-related plunge. 

 IBM's decline came after brokerage house Bear Stearns & Co. lowered its earnings expectations for the hardware giant. IBM's troubles followed profit warnings on Wednesday from software companies that blamed weakness in their mainframe businesses. 

 In another blow to the software world, Visual Networks Inc. saw its stock plummet more than 50 per cent in trading on the Nasdaq, down $14.25 (U.S.) to $12 after it issued a profit warning. 

 Gold was down 70 cents at $284.60 an ounce. Crude oil was down 68 cents to $29.99 a barrel. 

 The Canadian dollar was worth 67.32 cents, up 0.21 cents.

 Profit  Alerts Cause a Tech-Share Slide --- Suffering in U.S. Market and an Analyst's  Warning  Hurt Asian Chip Makers --- Computer Associates Earnings Will Fall Far Below Predictions

 Earnings warnings from several software makers and one forecast of a downturn in the semiconductor industry worsened jitters about the technology sector's broad health and pulled down the U.S. stock market.   

 The tumble Wednesday in U.S. semiconductor stocks sparked a flurry of activity in Asian markets, with investors shedding shares in chip makers Thursday.   

 The Nikkei average fell 1.3% to 17216.97, and the Singapore Straits Times Index shed 0.8% to a level of 2063.79. The Taiwan Weighted Price Index closed down 1.6% at 8289.39. All three saw hefty losses on key technology semiconductor stocks.   

 In the U.S., Computer Associates International Inc. said Wednesday that its operating income would fall as much as 80% short of analysts' estimates for the first quarter ended June 30 and that its second quarter would also be a disappointment. Elaborating on a warning it issued during the long holiday weekend, the country's No. 3 software maker blamed the shortfall on weakness in its mainframe-computer software business, sluggish sales in Europe and its failure to wrap up several expected contracts by the quarter's end.   

 Systems-management software maker BMC Software Inc. and database software maker Informix Inc. also added their names to the list of companies announcing lower-than-projected results for the quarter that ended June 30.   

 The warnings came as a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, Jonathan Joseph, suggested the highly cyclical chip industry may be nearing a peak and could slow within the next six to nine months. Together, the statements dragged down technology stocks, the market's once gleaming stars, tarnishing in particular the shares of semiconductor makers and companies that rely on mainframes for growth. Computer Associates stock fell $21.75 to $29.375 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. BMC Software fell $14.1875 to $21.3125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. International Business Machines Corp. fell $5.4375 to $104.375 a share, and No. 2 software maker Oracle Corp. fell $7.875 a share to $72.3125.   

 Computer Associates estimated that its operating income would be 11 cents to 16 cents a share in the quarter, only a fraction of the 55 cents a share estimated by a First Call/Thomson Financial survey of analysts. Its projections exclude amoritization of goodwill and a net gain of 15 cents from the return of executive stock awards after a write-off for unpaid receivables.   

 Sanjay Kumar, president of the business software concern, warned analysts that second-quarter revenue would probably be about $1.92 billion, up 20% from the same period a year earlier, but significantly less than the 25% growth level that was expected. Mr. Kumar told analysts that the company is "targeting" the 20% growth and couldn't guarantee it given current conditions. The company had said a day earlier that it would have first-quarter revenue of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, significantly below analysts' expectations of about $1.6 billion.   

 BMC, a company with $1.7 billion in annual revenue, said a sharp decline in the sales of mainframe software would keep its revenue as much as 25% below Wall Street projections. "This was a very trying quarter," said BMC's chief executive, Max P. Watson Jr. The expected profit of 18 cents to 21 cents a share would be less than half of Wall Street's consensus estimate of 46 cents. He projected revenue of about $370 million, below analysts' estimate of about $475 million and below the $401 million the company registered in the same period last year.   

 Two smaller software concerns, Entrust Technologies Inc. and Davox Corp., also warned that they would miss quarterly numbers. Entrust, which sells computer-security software, blamed delays in closing sales on certain product lines, while Davox said customers were taking longer than expected to make buying decisions.   

 Despite investors' worries, several corporate computer managers canvassed Wednesday said they weren't cutting technology budgets. In some cases, budgets are up sharply but managers have yet to begin doling the money out for new projects related to network and Web site expansion.   

 Still, in spite of the predictions of slowing growth at some companies, few people in the industry believed an overall slowdown was afoot.   

 "Our business has never been better," said Larry Ellison, chief executive at Oracle. "We are going to have a spectacular quarter. Our pipelines are extraordinary."   

 Yet a lingering worry hung over the U.S. stock markets, which have been unsettled this year, first by a sharp shakeout among Internet companies and lately by other warnings from several older-line tech companies. Unisys Corp. warned last week that its earnings for the June period would be disappointing, and Electronic Data Systems Corp. said its second-quarter revenue would be below expectations.   

 Mr. Ellison said companies that have been hurting for the past few days are those that have yet to make the change to Internet-focused software. "Some very big companies haven't made the transition. It's a tough change to make."

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, tech stocks mount their best showing in more than two weeks on rebounds by some new economy powerhouses, while blue chip stocks go nowhere. 

 We`ll talk to one long-time bull who`s keeping the faith, Prudential analyst Ralph Acampora, why he sees the Dow soaring in the second half of the year. 

 And the debate is raging across Wall Street: Are chip stocks primed for a fall, or are the best days yet to come? 

 Plus, as Web fever cools off, we`ll check out why some Net firms are shedding their cyberimage, dumping the dot.com. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, everyone. Stuart is off tonight. 

 Call it the chip comeback, tech stocks powered ahead today led by a surge in semiconductor stocks. The Nasdaq jumped more than 2.5 percent, almost making up for its big losses yesterday. But the chip power did little to boost the Dow industrials, which gave up all of a mid-day rally, despite a strong gain in Dow-component Intel. 

 Greg Clarkin has more. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Call them the defenders of the chips -- one day after a shocking sell-off, Wall Street firms came rushing to the aid of semiconductor companies. 

 DLJ (URL: http://www.dlj.com) , Chase H&Q, and Merrill Lynch all issued kind words for the group, opposing the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who downgraded some chip stocks. Merrill`s analysts said while they see no support near term, they "strongly believe the sector will be hitting new highs before the end of the year." 

 SCOTT BLEIER, PRIME CHARTER LTD.: A lot of these stocks really got hammered yesterday, down 5 and 10 points, and today at some point, bargain hunters, if you would, set out to buy these stocks. 

 CLARKIN: Shares of Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , Altera (URL: http://www.altera.com/) , chip equipment maker Applied Materials (URL: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/) , and Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/)  all gained. But National Semiconductor (URL: http://www.national.com/) , one of the stocks singled out by Salomon, continued to slide. The chips helped boost the Nasdaq to an almost triple-digit gain, sending it back over 3,900. 

 A different story for the Dow, which after a full day of trading wound up just shy of where it began, losing 2 on the day. IBM held the blue chips back, after Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns cut revenue estimates. And Eli Lilly and other big-name drug stocks were weak. 

 But oil stocks rose after a recent sell-off. And Marriott (URL: http://www.marriott.com/) said more of its hotel rooms were full and at higher rates last quarter, and its stock rose. But a profit warning from Visual Networks sparked a sell-off in the software maker. 

 But strip away the corporate news, and strategists say the market is locked up, waiting and watching for interest rates and oil prices to settle. 

 STEPHEN LANGAN, DONALD & COMPANY: The market is going to continue to go sideways and I don`t think we`re going to get that big rally. There are a lot of major players just taking a breather. I think that the fall, or last quarter, is really going to be a big run- up probably in both indices. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: Now, the technology sector did pass the test today with the modest rebound in chip stocks. But there are still major concerns, and IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) is one of them. And recent profit warnings from Computer Associates and BMC Software (URL: http://www.bmc.com/) have left those stocks  in shambles -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg, mainframe issues still the concern for IBM? 

 CLARKIN: Exactly, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns both raising issues with that today. 

 BAY: Greg, thank you. 

 Taking a closer look at some of today`s big winners and losers on Wall Street, a powerful day for brokerage stocks: Merrill Lynch jumped $6 to a new 52-week high, Lehman Brothers up more than 3, Morgan Stanley gained 2 5/8, and Bear Stearns -- PaineWebber and Bear Stearns both up more than $1. Checking some other big winners today: Microsoft gained nearly 2 1/2, Oracle up more than 3 1/4, Biogen (URL: http://www.biogen.com/) and Immunex  (URL: http://www.immunex.com/) both higher as well, and Inktomi (URL: http://www.inktomi.com) gained more than 4. 

 But there were a few losers today, including the most active stock on the NYSE: Qwest Communications (URL: http://www.qwest.net/) fell more than 3, giving back some of yesterday`s big gains when it joined the S&P 500. Lucent Technologies (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) down nearly 2. SBC, Corning  (URL: http://www.corning.com/) and Genentech (URL: http://www.gene.com/) lower as well. 

 Investors had some conflicting reports on the economy to sift through today: new orders to U.S. factories surged unexpectedly last month, boosted by strong demand for electronics. Factory orders posted their biggest increase in more than seven years, reversing weakness from the month before when orders fell 3.8 percent. 

 But there were also more signs of a slowdown today. Many of the nation`s biggest retailers reported lackluster sales figures in June, making it the  fourth consecutive month of disappointing results at stores open a year or more. 

 Casey Wian has more from Los Angeles. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CASEY WIAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Like most retailers, Sears (URL: http://www.sears.com/) had a decent, but not spectacular month of June. High gasoline prices in 

 the Midwest, cool summer weather throughout much of the nation, and rising interest rates everywhere convinced consumers to keep a tighter grip on their wallets. 

 At Sears, that meant a mixed bag. Appliance, electronics, hardware, and lawn and garden sales were strong, but apparel was down. Overall, the nation`s retailers reported sales rose a little more than 3 percent over the same period last year. 

 ASMA USMANI, EDWARD JONES: This was one of the smallest rises since 1997, September of 1997, so many of the retailers are starting to see some impact of a consumer consumption slowdown. 

 STEVE KERNKRAUT, BEAR STEARNS: Consumers have stopped spending or slowed down their spending. It`s partially fashion, partially weather, partially interest rates, partially gasoline prices. But something`s happening out there and it`s not good. 

 WIAN: Among the nation`s largest retailers, Costco (URL: http://www.costco.com/)  and Wal*Mart (URL: http://www.wal-mart.com/) reported the biggest sales gains. Sears, Target (URL: http://www.target.com/) , and Federated Department Stores (URL: http://www.federated-fds.com/) , the parent of Macy `s and Bloomingdale `s, logged smaller increases, while Kmart`s (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) sales fell. One factor is the timing of the July 4 holiday. Most retailers held Independence Day sales the first week of this month. Normally, those sales include the last few days of June. 

 Another concern for many retailers: inventories remain too high and many slashed prices during June to clear their shelves. That`s squeezing profits, and Gap warned its second-quarter earnings will fall short of Wall Street`s expectations. 

 (on camera): Analysts expect more price cutting to reduce inventories throughout the month of July. As a result, the next true measure of the strength of the nation`s retail sector is not expected to come until the end of the summer. 

 Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Los Angeles. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: A mixed reaction on Wall Street to today`s retail figures: Federated Department Stores sank more than 5 after it reported disappointing results. But the Gap surged nearly 3 1/2, despite the weak sales and second quarter profit warning Casey just mentioned. Radio Shack up more than 3 1/4 on a 13 percent sales jump. Other retailers that got a nice boost today: Abercrombie & Fitch (URL: http://www.abercrombie.com/) and  AnnTaylor (URL: N/A) . 

 The big report Wall Street is waiting for: the June employment numbers due out tomorrow. The jobs data could shed some light on whether the Federal Reserve will need to hike interest rates for a seventh  time at its policy meeting next month. Economists expecting that U.S. businesses added 263,000 jobs in June, with the unemployment rate dropping slightly to 4 percent. 

 Ahead of that report, the Labor Department today said claims for unemployment benefits dropped unexpectedly last week. Claims fell to 296,000, a five-week low. Economists say a weekly reading below 300,000 indicates a tight labor market. 

 But bond traders appeared to be more concerned with tomorrow`s jobs report. Both the 10 and 30-year treasuries lost ground. The 30-year bond down 23 ticks, pushing the yield up to 5.9 percent. 

 Joining us now with a preview of tomorrow`s big event, Joshua Feinman, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Asset Management. 

 Josh, welcome back. 

 JOSHUA FEINMAN, DEUTSCHE BANK ASSET MANAGEMENT: Hi. 

 BAY: Before we get to tomorrow`s numbers, what do you make about today`s numbers, do they suggest anything about the Fed`s efforts? 

 FEINMAN: I think today`s numbers are kind of consistent with what we`ve been seeing, some mixed readings on the economy. There does seem to be a slowdown on the consumer side, but it`s really unclear how long it`s going to last. 

 BAY: And what about manufacturing output, is that number expected to fall as the rate hikes filter through the economy? 

 FEINMAN: Well, it is expected to slow down along with the pace of consumer spending, but so far the manufacturing sector seems to be holding up fairly well. 

 BAY: All right, the big question, tomorrow`s report. 

 FEINMAN: Sure. 

 BAY: What will it tell us about this slowdown? 

 FEINMAN: Well, I think last month`s report was very weak. So we`re looking to tomorrow`s to see whether it corroborates that, or it goes the other way. 

 BAY: It was weak, but also a little bit confusing. 

 FEINMAN: It was confusing, in part because it was weaker than other indicators of the labor market that we look at or suggesting. So hopefully tomorrow will clear that up. 

 BAY: So what will you be looking for tomorrow? 

 FEINMAN: Well, I`m looking for a fairly strong report, some rebound from last month with more job creation and a dip in the unemployment rate. 

 BAY: Some rebound? 

 FEINMAN: Some rebound, but I think when the dust all settles, it will still suggest that the economy has cooled a little bit. 

 BAY: So what does the Fed need to see before it concludes this series of rate hikes? 

 FEINMAN: I think they need to see more concrete evidence that demand has really slowed down and that -- therefore, overheating pressures, which is really what they`re worried about, are starting to dissipate. 

 BAY: So specifically, what indicators will they be most focused on a month ahead? 

 FEINMAN: I think consumer spending on the one side to see if demand is really slowing, and on the inflation side, the labor cost picture to see whether the recent upcreep in labor costs is continuing. 

 BAY: Now, what`s your take, are we at the end, near the end? 

 FEINMAN: I think we`re getting close to the end, but I think it`s premature to conclude that we`re there yet. My own hunch is maybe we`ll see a little bit more from the Fed before the fall. 

 BAY: So maybe one more, maybe... 

 FEINMAN: Maybe one more, yes. 

 BAY: Josh Feinman from Deutsche Bank, thank you. 

 FEINMAN: Thank you, Willow. 

 BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, a warning of an electricity drought as the long hot summer drags on. We`ll tell you why the high-tech industry could be among the hardest hit. 

 Plus, airline workers show their anger over passengers out of control. Find out how they`re fighting the rising tide of air rage. 

 And the Wall Street bull who is forecasting a blue-chip high jump, we`ll speak with Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities after the break. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Topping tonight`s MONEYLINE "Movers," FirstWorld Communications (URL: http://www.firstworld.com/) lost more than 5 1/2, or 57 percent. The provider of high-speed Internet access warned of lower-than-expected second quarter sales because of increased competition. Its CEO also resigned today. Biomet (URL: http://www.biomet.com/) gained more than six. The medical equipment-maker declared a three-for-two stock split after beating the street by a penny, earning 42 cents a share in its fourth quarter. 

 And Affymetrix (URL: http://www.affymetrix.com/) fell nearly seven on news that PE Corporation, the parent of Celera Genomics (URL: http://www.celera.com/) , has filed a patent infringement suit against it. The suit involves several patents involving products used to speed up gene sequencing. This one-time biotech high-flier has fallen 50 percent from its high of $327. 

 Despite the dismal performance for stocks so far this year, one of Wall Street`s biggest bulls is keeping the faith. Prudential Securities` Ralph Acampora still predicts the Dow could hit 14,000 by the end of the year. As for the Nasdaq, he sees it at 6,000 by June of 2001. That would be some rally. The blue chip index would need to gain 30 percent in the next six months to reach the lower end of Acampora`s forecast. And the Nasdaq would need to post a 50 percent jump over the next year to reach 6,000 by the summer of 2001. 

 Joining us now with more is Ralph Acampora himself. Welcome back, Ralph. 

 RALPH ACAMPORA, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: Hi, Willow. 

 BAY: That is some rally you`re expecting. 

 ACAMPORA: Well, it`s a presidential election year, number one. 

 BAY: Usually a good sign. 

 ACAMPORA: Usually get a rally, absolutely. 

 BAY: OK. 

 ACAMPORA: And number two, whether it`s a Democrat or a Republican, Wall Street gives this new president a honeymoon. So I`m projecting between now and, let`s say, June of next year, an irregularly higher, trendy market. 

 BAY: Now, you brought along some evidence that`s going to convince us. 

 ACAMPORA: Well, it`s a pretty interesting chart I have. 

 BAY: Let`s take a look at this chart. And explain to us what it is. 

 ACAMPORA: First of all, it`s probably one of the basic tools we technical analysts look at. We literally, at the end of the day, figure out how many stocks went up and down, advances versus decline. And you net out the difference. What you see on that picture is you`ve seen that, for a period of time, it had been going down. 

 BAY: And now it seems as if it`s going up, but to me, it doesn`t look entirely convincing. 

 ACAMPORA: No, it doesn`t. But we don`t have whole picture, you know. You know, if you actually saw all of it, you`d see that that line had been going down for the last three, almost three and a half years; which means that most stocks on the New York Stock Exchange had been going down, not up. So, when people tell me the market`s overvalued, I`d say: Where is it overvalued? There are stocks in there that are bottoming  out, and they`re starting to pick up. And that`s internally rotating. That`s positive. 

 BAY: And what about on the Nasdaq? Would we seem a similar... 

 ACAMPORA: Not as pronounced as that. 

 BAY: Not as pronounced. 

 ACAMPORA: The Nasdaq is the large, you know, blue chip tech stocks. And some of them I still like. 

 BAY: Some of them you still like. For example? 

 ACAMPORA: Oh, Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) ; Intel, Sun (URL: http://www.sun.com/) , Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) . 

 BAY: Now, one of the things that you said the last time you joined us in May was that we`d make a Nasdaq low sometime in June, maybe in July. Been there done that? 

 ACAMPORA: I think we did. I think we did. We did it -- I think it was last month. 

 BAY: Now, you also said that you expected the final stage to be the high-flyers, the big names getting hit: QUALCOMM (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) , Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) . 

 ACAMPORA: Yes, sir, that`s right. We had that. 

 BAY: So all signs are good. 

 ACAMPORA: Well, we started early in this year. We started with the speculative biotechs. Then they got to the dot.coms. And then they  got to the last ones, like Microsoft. And I think the sell off is over. 

 BAY: OK, so what sectors do you like going forward? 

 ACAMPORA: I like technology. I love biotechnology. I`m talking about the Amgen (URL: http://www.amgen.com/) , the MedImmune (URL: http://www.medimmune.com/) , the Biogens -- my heavens, it`s just breaking out today. I love the hotels: Hilton Hotels (URL: http://www.hilton.com/) and Marriott. 

 BAY: You know, it`s interesting; and a couple upgrades in that sector today. Why is the outlook good for them for the second half? 

 ACAMPORA: I don`t know the fundamentals, but I can tell you that they`ve been under accumulation. People have been buying them for the last couple of months. That`s very positive. 

 BAY: Now, you also like the brokerages. 

 ACAMPORA: Yes. 

 BAY: What`s your take on Merrill today? 

 ACAMPORA: Well, I don`t know the exact reason for the six points up, but I suspect there`s talk of takeover. I think that`s behind it. I don`t want to be quoted, because I`m not sure. But it`s very good for  rest of the industry. And I think business will be good the second half of the year, so it`s good for (UNINTELLIGIBLE) stocks. 

 BAY: Good news from you indeed, Ralph Acampora, thank you. 

 ACAMPORA: Thank you, Willow. 

 BAY: Still ahead on MONEYLINE: Washington casts a wary eye on yet another telecom merger plan. Does NTT`s bid for Verio really pose a threat to U.S. security? We`ll have that story after the break. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking some of the stocks that hit 52-week highs today on the New York Stock Exchange: International Home Foods (URL: http://www.ihfonline.com/) ; Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) ; Scientific-Atlanta (URL: http://www.sciatl.com) ; Trigon (URL: http://www.trigon.com/) ; and UnitedHealth (URL: http://www.uhc.com/) . 

 Another multi-billion dollar, transcontinental telecom merger is facing scrutiny tonight, and this one from unlikely sources. The FBI and now a special committee within the Treasury Department are concerned the  proposed merger between Japan`s NTT (URL: http://www.ntt.co.jp) and U.S.-based Verio (URL: http://www.verio.com/) raise serious questions about national security. 

 Bob Beard reports in tonight`s "Tech Watch." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BOB BEARD, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): NTT Communications` proposed $5.5 billion acquisition of Web hoster Verio has hit a snag. 

 A source at the National Security Counsel confirmed to CNN the deal is now facing a 45-day review by an obscure government panel called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., chaired by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. The investigation was reportedly triggered by FBI concerns over its ability to conduct surveillance of digital communications. The FBI had no comment on the Verio case, but has been outspoken in defining its capability to monitor digital communications. 

 BRETT LAMBERT, DFI INTERNATIONAL: If we needed for some reason to acquire the ability to tap into or monitor activity at Verio, I think the FBI`s concern is that would be known to the parent company, in  this case the Japanese government. 

 BEARD: The Japanese government is the majority owner of NTT. Last week, the company extended its offer for Verio until mid-July, and stated flatly, "The proposed transaction does not raise national security concerns." This hitch in NTT`s plans is just latest in a series of troubled international deals. The WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) -Sprint (URL: http://www.sprint.com) merger faced regulatory opposition from both sides of Atlanta, and a third of U.S. Senate has rejected in  writing to a potential takeover bid by Deutsche Telekom (URL: http://www.dtag.de/) of Sprint. 

 (on camera): The panel looking into national security implications of the NTT-Verio deal could recommend that President Clinton kill it, but history is on NTT`s side for now. A presidential thumbs down has only happened once in such cases in recent years. 

 Bob Beard, CNN Financial News, Washington. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Taking a look at Verio. Its shares fell more than 1 1/2 today, but they are still up 133 percent from their April low. 

 Still to come, Amtrak  promises satisfaction guaranteed to millions of customers. And sibling rivalry is played out at Wimbledon. The details coming up in the "MONEYLINE News Digest." 

 BAY: A novel guarantee for those who ride the rails. Amtrak unveiled an unconditional guarantee for passengers. The initiative offers free travel certificates to any customers dissatisfied with Amtrak`s service. No word on the potential cost, but the railway says it will make up for any losses with increased customer loyalty. 

 A different kind of handout today for air travelers. Unions representing flight attendants and ground crews handed out fliers in cities around the globe, declaring a day of action against so-called air rage, demanding stiffer penalties against unruly passengers. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 DEBORAH WILK, ASSN. OF FLIGHT ATTENDANTS: The important thing is we need some sort of zero-tolerance program from both the government and from the airlines themselves. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: The union also wants airlines to provide training and restraint equipment to airline personnel. Complaints about disorderly passenger behavior, including refusal to put out cigarettes and grabbing flight attendants, increased from 66 in 1997 to more than 500 last year. For more news now outside the world of business, we go to Wolf Blitzer for the "MONEYLINE News Digest" -- Wolf. 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thanks, Willow. The Pentagon says conditions look good for tomorrow`s test of a controversial antimissile system. President Clinton is expected to decide within the next few months whether to order deployment of the so-called "national missile defense system." Tomorrow`s run-through will be the third for the program after one test succeeded and another one failed. Also in Washington, court documents out today show a spokesman for former independent counsel Ken Starr will go on trial next week. Charles Backly is charged with criminal contempt in connection with news leaks in Monica Lewinsky investigation. 

 And a final ruling today on crash of John F. Kennedy Jr.`s plane last year. Federal investigators say Kennedy became disoriented while flying at night off Martha`s Vineyard. He died in the crash, along with his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette. 

 In North Carolina, police say Indianapolis Colts running back Fred Lane has  been found dead of a gunshot wound. Lane`s body was discovered in his home. Police are calling it a domestic violence situation. 

 Finally, a winner in the Williams family showdown at Wimbledon. Venus Williams today beat her younger sister, Serena, in their historic semifinal match. 

 Those are tonight`s top stories. I`ll have much more ahead on "THE WORLD TODAY." Join us at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 on the West Coast -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thank you, Wolf. 

 Coming up in the next half hour, all today`s market headlines. Plus, Vice President Gore throws down the gauntlet over Medicare benefits. We`ll check out whether drug stocks may be vulnerable to election year reforms. And the battle lines are being drawn over the price of chip stocks. We`ll look at how the debate is shaping up on Wall Street. Plus, two tech powerhouses team up to take on the kingpin of data storage. What`s in store for a deal between IBM and Compaq? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, Wall Street locks horns over the fate of semiconductor stocks. Are the chips that power the new economy bound for a fall or set to keep climbing? And record heat is not the only challenge facing the nation`s utilities this summer. Could the growing use of computers be taxing the power grid past the breaking point? Plus, with  Internet stocks down sharply this year, we`ll check out how some Web upstarts want to shake off the dot.com label. 

 But first, more on tonight`s top story: Tech stocks put on their best showing in more than two weeks, driven by a rebound in some beaten-down chip names. The Nasdaq fought off some morning blues to come within a whisker of a triple digit gain, rising more than 97 points, or 2.5 percent. Blue chip shares also pushed higher, but then the Dow failed to carry its positive momentum into the close, ending down just over two points to 10,481. 

 One focus of heated conversation on Wall Street today: chip stocks. Intel surged 5. Xilinx (URL: http://www.xilinx.com/) gained more than 5. Vitesse (URL: http://www.vitesse.com/) jumped more than 4 3/4. Advanced Micro Devices (URL: http://www.amd.com/) rose better than 2 3/4. Micron Technology (URL: http://www.micron.com/) up 3. Also on the upswing, semiconductor equipment makers. Applied materials gained 3 1/4. Novellus Systems (URL: http://www.novellus.com/) rose 3 3/4. Lam Research (URL; http://www.lamrc.com/) picked up  2 3/4. ASM Lithography (URL: http://www.asml.com/) , edged up 1 3/4. 

 Well, quite a turnaround for the semiconductor shares, bouncing back from yesterday`s stunning sell-off after a downgrade by Salomon Smith Barney. Today`s rebound coming as other Wall Street brokers lined up in defense of the chip sector. 

 Allan Chernoff reports on the great semiconductor debate. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The debate begins with semiconductor shipments. For three months, the rate of growth has been declining. But they`re still growing by 30 percent. Salomon Smith Barney chip analysts say shipments are rolling over into a decline. Others, including Merrill Lynch, say there`s no sign of rolling over. 

 JOSEPH OSHA, MERRILL LYNCH: I think my competitor has chosen to interpret those facts as evidence of a real cycle-ending rollover. We have been calling for a while for what I call a midcycle correction, and that`s actually what I think is occurring. I don`t think this will last more than a couple of months. 

 CHERNOFF: There`s debate over flash chips, used in cell phones and PCs. They hold data after power is turned off. Prices in the market for immediate delivery are moderating, says Salomon Smith Barney. 

 CLARK WESTMONT, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: We think this may be the beginning of the transition to an oversupply condition in the next, you know, six to 12 months. 

 CHERNOFF: Merrill says Salomon`s price data are of questionable value, because most flash chips are sold on a contract basis. Those prices are holding up just fine. 

 Then there`s the question of corporate capital spending. Salomon Smith Barney predicts it`s peaking. While Merrill and others say capital spending is still growing. In fact, one of Salomon Smith Barney`s analyst conceded to MONEYLINE yesterday that the evidence is sketchy. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to go out an a limb a bit at this point, and that`s what we`ve chosen to do. 

 CHERNOFF: Salomon Smith Barney`s semiconductor equipment analyst is not on that limb. He`s supporting the equipment stocks, like Applied Materials and Lam Research. 

 GLEN YEUNG, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: The second half of 2000 into the first half of 2001, business is actually going to look pretty good for these companies. And so even though a semiconductor cycle, and ultimately an equipment cycle will happen, we think its far enough off into the future that investors will be more focused on what happens here in the second half and again into `01. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: Bottom line, Merrill remains positive on the chips. Other firms giving it thumbs up today, Prudential, DLJ and Bank of America. Salomon Smith Barney in turning negative on semiconductors was simply trying to be ahead of the curve, to forecast potential trouble ahead. So often, analysts are way behind the curve. But in this case, the majority of analysts are saying it still is too early to make the call for a downturn in the semiconductor sector -- Willow. 

 BAY: Allan, this was quite a ride. Did today`s rebound make up or erase yesterday`s downturn? 

 CHERNOFF: No, not entirely. Yesterday, you`d say exodus out certainly overwhelmed the rush back in today. 

 BAY: Allan, thanks. Today`s chip surge is much more than just a one-day advance. The semiconductor group has been on fire this year, and is one of the best performing sectors year to date. The Philly Semiconductor Index up 59 percent on the year. Checking some of the biggest gainers in 2000: Rambus up more than 500 percent. Advanced Micro Devices up 167 percent. Micron and PMC Sierra both up more than 120 percent. And though not as spectacular, chip bellwether Intel still posting admirable gains, up 66 percent so far in 2000. 

 And the chip rally is far from over, according to my next guest, who expects strong earnings from the group. Brian Finnerty joins us with more. He`s the head of Nasdaq stock trading at C.E. Unterberg, Towbin. 

 Brian, as always, welcome. 

 BRIAN FINNERTY, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: Hi, Willow. 

 BAY: You were in there buying yesterday afternoon. 

 FINNERTY: We were, Willow, and I think there`s a reason these chip stocks are up so much. It`s not if old 10 years ago when the end user was just really the PC was using silicon chips. Semiconductors -- there`s multiple end users. I mean, there in everything, you know, from all these compounds in your refrigerators to just everything across the board. Demand -- it`s way to early to call this slowdown. 

 BAY: So yesterday`s concerns -- were they unwarranted? 

 FINNERTY: Well, I think, as you did say earlier, he was trying to make a statement, give an early warning sign, but we see at Unterberg, Towbin, Carl Modie (ph), our analyst, sees at least four more quarters of good growth before you even have to think about any early warning. So we see a lot of momentum in the... 

 BAY: So where does he weigh-in in terms of this notion of cycle. Are there mini-cycles that we`re seeing? Are we seeing a little dip in the current cycle? 

 FINNERTY: Not much of a dip. The only issue out there, I think, was some people were saying, a possible peaking in cell phone, a lot of chips coming to the handsets. 

 BAY: That`s interesting, because from all accounts, cell phone sales are soaring, but there`s still concern about that. 

 FINNERTY: Four-hundred and thirty-five million cell phones this year are going to be sold. So I don`t know if that`s peaking, and that`s a huge number. A lot of chips have to go into those, so I think there`s a long way to go, and we don`t see it. 

 BAY: Now look, even at these numbers. I mean, Intel is a laggard, up 66 percent year to date. But PMC-Sierra up 120 percent. AMD -- I mean, I just  read that whole list. How much further do they have to go? 

 FINNERTY: Willow, don`t forget, I mean, PMC-Sierra (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com/) is a stock that right now is in the 170s, I guess, but the stock was 250, down to 112 at 

 the low, and now back up. So there are big swings in these stocks, but there is big earnings. That`s where the blowout numbers are going to be. 

 BAY: In the earnings. 

 FINNERTY: And we have even gotten through this preannouncement season of the disasters. 

 BAY: Do you think it`s over? 

 FINNERTY: Well, I think the preannouncements are, by and large, over, so that`s the bad news. 

 BAY: And your reaction in terms of the preannouncements? Better than usual? Worse than usual? 

 FINNERTY: Actually, better than last quarter. A couple of bombs went off. Computer Associates was definitely a bomb. It hit us hard. BMC Software. So the two software guys bombed us. But better than last quarter. 

 And now we`re set up for the good news. The good news starts next week when the actual earnings are going to come out. And the guy that didn`t warn us, they`re going to come out with the good news. So we`re going to have a couple weeks of volatility, but good news volatility. 

 BAY: Too bad you`re not in a cheery mood today. 

 FINNERTY: Well, it was a good day today. 

 BAY: Brian Finnerty, thanks as always. 

 FINNERTY: Thanks, Willow. 

 BAY: Taking a Look at the broader market today. The S&P 500 gained 10, to 1.456 on the Big Board. Advancers beat out decliners by a 5-4 margin: 68 stocks hit new highs; 29 fell to new lows. 

 And checking some of today`s big movers on the New York Stock Exchange: SBC Communications lost 2, Johnson & Johnson (URL: http://www.jnj.com/) down more than 1. Qwest Communications off nearly 3 1/4, while Merrill Lynch jumped 6. The Gap (URL: http://www.gap.com/) surged nearly 3 1/2. And on the Nasdaq, Oracle gained more than 3 1/4 after two days of sharp losses. Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) up nearly 3. And Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) rose almost 2 1/2. Adobe Systems (URL: http://www.adobe.com/) , it surged 7 1/4, but JDS Uniphase (URL: http://www.jdsunph.com/) slumped 5. 

 IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) and Compaq Computer (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) are joining forces for a bigger piece of the data storage systems market. The two companies said today they`ll invest more than $1 billion in the effort. Under the deal, Compaq will sell IBM`s storage servers and software. In turn, IBM will offer Compaq services. 

 Earlier on CNNfn, Compaq`s CEO talked about the opportunities. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 MICHAEL CAPPELLAS, PRESIDENT & CEO, COMPAQ: What you have is obviously the technology and the know-how between the two companies. What we`re trying to do, really, is to as we look forward, we know that storage will grow tremendously. We don`t want to make it easier for the customers that they need to interoperability, the ability to have their different component stocks for each other. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: The deal is a way for both companies to take on data storage leader EMC (URL: http://www.emc.com/) , as well as Sun Microsystems. But the move did not help Big Blue, which lost 2 1/4. Today, Bear Stearns lowered its second quarter earnings estimates because of slower mainframe software sales. And Compaq fell fractionally. 

 Coming up, a big threat to the summertime power supply. Could the booming new economy be in danger from something as simple as a blackout. That story when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: In tonight`s MONEYLINE "Focus," trouble looming for the country`s utilities. The Energy Department and a private watchdog group today said that dry conditions and summer demand could lead to electricity shortages. This as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said power failures in California and New England could be an ominous sign. And as temperatures rise above 100 degrees across the country, there is little immediate relief in sight. And there is more, a whole new challenge for the utility industry to keep up with: the demands of the new economy. 

 Bruce Francis has more. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Summer came early to northern California. Less than a month ago, the temperature in San Francisco soared above 100 degrees to levels not seen in 120 years. Residents sweltered and suffered rolling power blackouts. The power grid just couldn`t keep up with the demand, according to the organization that acts as the electricity traffic cop for the region. 

 PATRICK DORINSON, CALIFORNIA ISO: I don`t think anybody, whether they be 

 utilities or utility commissions, could have anticipated the kind of demand we have in California right now. It is really taking off here. 

 FRANCIS: That`s one reason why the Energy Department is warning of more power shortages. 

 RICHARD GLICK, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY: We`re most concerned about California, the Southwest and the Northeast. Those areas are the most susceptible to power outages. But there are other areas of the country that could very well have problems if there are extended heat waves, or if power plants go out unexpectedly. 

 FRANCIS: Both culprit and victim: the high-tech industry. Victim because for many commercial users of electricity, 99.9 percent reliability is just  fine. That means just eight hours of downtime per year. Computer intensive operations, however, need 99.99999999 percent reliability, or just 32 seconds of downtime per year. But the high-tech boom in Silicon Valley and elsewhere has also added to the demand. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Silicon Valley itself is drawing a lot of electricity. My understanding through talking with people down there, that these giant Internet server farms, chip manufacturing, are very intense users of electricity. 

 FRANCIS: But as demand mounts, there is little new supply on the horizon, and businesses are concerned. 

 JUSTIN BRADLEY, SILICON VALLEY MANUFACTURING GRP.: We will be getting more generation capacity, it`s a question of when. According to energy experts, the best estimate is that we won`t have significant new generating capacity for at least two years. That`s not soon enough for Silicon Valley and our economy here. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: At a time when some companies are running at full capacity, power outages cost plenty. The recent rolling blackouts in Silicon Valley cost some manufacturers as much as a million dollars an hour, and that can hurt -- Willow. 

 BAY: So, Bruce, is it increased use of the Internet that`s driving this? 

 FRANCIS: That`s one major factor. The estimates are that back in `95, the Internet maybe consumed 1 percent of the nation`s power needs. That`s up to 8 percent and rising today. That`s a big increase. 

 BAY: And so, again, the companies that are the types of companies that are most vulnerable here? 

 FRANCIS: If you make semiconductors or other very sensitive equipment that is very -- that power fluctuations hurt, you are going to be -- suffer some big losses. 

 BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, as Al Gore outlines his plan to prop up the Medicare system, we`ll take a look at what the upcoming presidential elections mean to the drug sector. That`s next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: America Online (URL: http://www.aol.com/)  about to hit the street with another public company. AOL has filed with the SEC to take its AOL Latin America unit public. The company is expected to trade under the ticker symbol AOLA, and will offer 25 million shares at between $15 and $17 apiece, raising up to $425 million. America Online has recently announced plans to merge with Time Warner (URL: http://www.timewarner.com/) , the parent company of CNN. 

 Other stocks making moves: Goldman Sachs lost 2 3/4 after announcing that it will sell an additional 40 million shares. It is the firm`s first sale since its IPO over a year ago. Borders Group (URL: http://www.borders.com/) fell nearly 2 1/2. The retailer said today it is no longer in discussions about a possible sale of the company. Its president said he still believes Borders is undervalued and that it will continue to explore other strategic alternatives. 

 And Visual Networks (URL: http://www.visualnetworks.com) plunged 14 1/4, or 54 percent, after warning it will miss Wall Street`s second quarter profit forecasts by as much as 5 cents a share. The management software maker has lost 85 percent  so far this year. 

 Drug stocks have had a banner year, but the pharmaceutical industry has taken a lashing from Vice President Al Gore. Gore hammered out his plan to bolster Medicare today. 

 Fred Katayama takes a look at how politics might affect your investment in the drug sector. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: My plan protects it; his plan does not. 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore bashed his Republican rival today as he outlined his prescription to provide drug benefits to seniors. 

 GORE: Here is Governor Bush`s plan, not one dime in his proposal for extending, strengthening, adding to Medicare. 

 KATAYAMA: Specifically, Gore said his plan would pay half the cost of prescription drugs, up to $5,000 a year with no deductibles, and offered discounts for those on Medicare. Cost to taxpayers: $253 billion over 10 years. 

 Governor George W. Bush said through a spokesman he "supports providing prescription drug coverage to America`s seniors." The spokesman did not elaborate, but added that Governor Bush would double Medicare funding over 10 years if he becomes president. 

 The drug industry trade group would not comment on Gore`s plan, except to say it would back drug coverage using private insurance plans. Neither candidate has proposed drug price controls, but analysts say investors fear that a Democratic administration might impose them. 

 Drug stocks have rebounded strongly from last year`s doldrums, when investors fretted about Medicare reform that never came. The drug sector is among the top performers this year, rising 51 percent. 

 Some analysts say Gore`s earlier charge of price gouging is troubling for drug stocks, but most on Wall Street do not expect to see any Medicare reform or prescription drug laws passed until well after the next administration takes office. 

 JEFF CHAFFKIN, PAINEWEBBER: Realistically, there`s less than 25 days in Congress. And so it`s difficult to see how they can get anything passed in time. I do think the real issue here is who wins the election and what platform do they push going forward. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATAYAMA: The drug-makers are not taking any changes. The consumer group Public Citizen reports that it has hired nearly 300 lobbyists to battle legislation that would cut drug prices. 

 BAY: And battling they are. 

 Fred, will the election outcome affect the investors, and how? 

 KATAYAMA: It will. Analysts say that a Bush victory would be better for drug investors because it`s more likely that Republicans would rely on the private sector to manage drug benefits. 

 BAY: Fred Katayama, thank you. 

 One company that seems to have run out of luck: GTECH Holdings (URL: http://www.GTECH.com/) , the world`s biggest operator of lottery systems. GTECH announced today the resignation of its two top executives and said its earnings would fall short of Wall Street expectations. The company gave no specific profit forecast, but Wall Street analysts were looking for earnings of 58 cents a share. GTECH shares today fell sharply on the news, down nearly three, or 13 percent 

 In other corporate news, long lines at the grocery store helped Safeway (URL: http://www.safeway.com/) boost its bottom line. The supermarket operator reported earnings of 55 cents a share, beating second-quarter estimates by two cents. And the healthy economy is helping the hotel industry rebound from its worst second quarter in seven years. That is good news for Marriott, where higher room rates and increased occupancy translated to a jump in earnings. The lodging company reported earnings of 50 cents a share, two cents better than estimates. Marriott stock climbed one; Safeway up more than 2 1/4 on the news. 

 Still to come: Last year, much of corporate America was caught up in dot.com fever. So why are some Web firms now shedding the letters that once symbolized the cyber economy; the story when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Trends come and trends go. And for a growing number of dot.coms, the dot.com is getting dot.lost. Once a sure thing for startup companies looking for venture capital money, the dot.com label is now being erased from the name of many Internet companies looking to change their image. 

 Ceci Rodgers reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CECI RODGERS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Blame it on the shake out in Internet stocks. For a growing number of dot.coms, the dot.com is dot.gone. Firms like JFAX.com (URL: http://www.jfax.com/) and LifeMinders.com (URL: http://www.lifeminders.com/) , whose share prices have sustained sharp losses, have dropped dot.com from their names. 

 ANTHONY ABBOUND, WILDMAN HARROLD ATTORNEYS: The concern perhaps is that we don`t want to be associated with dot.com. We`d rather have a more established name, a name that perhaps conveys some sense of history. 

 RODGERS: It was a far different story six months ago, before the bottom dropped out on Internet stocks. During the SuperBowl, companies crowded the airwaves to tout their dot.com status. But since March, dozens have dropped the dot.com moniker. InfoSpace  was one of the first. The wireless systems provider is pleased with the results. 

 NAVEEN JAIN, INFOSPACE: It`s the new investors who, in fact, were misled by the dot.com are in fact coming back to InfoSpace as they are realizing how wonderful a company InfoSpace is. 

 RODGERS: InfoSpace shares are up seven percent on the year. Compare that with the Dow Jones Internet Index, down nearly 29 percent in the same period. Analysts say there`s a silver lining to the trend away from dot.com branding. 

 BOB WALBERG, BRIEFING.COM: It`s -- no longer are people just attracted to a company simply because it has a dot.com at the end of the name. And that`s a good thing. Now the companies that have done a good job of executing and managing their businesses are being known for who they are. 

 RODGERS (on camera): So whether a company is selling on the Internet, at a bricks and mortar store, or over a wireless telephone, the basics of business are back in fashion. And the new economy stocks are being held to the same standards now as those of the old economy.

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Visual Networks Inc. plummeted 56 percent on Thursday with a warning from the Internet traffic management company that its earnings would fall far short of Wall Street forecasts. 

 Analysts at Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter downgraded the shares. 

 Visual Networks fell 14-1/2 to 11-3/4 in heavy early trade. The shares were far below their previous 12-month low of 23-1/2 and were the most active issue on the Nasdaq market. 

 Visual Networks said late on Wednesday that pro forma revenue and earnings for the second quarter and years 2000 and 2001 would be well below Wall Street estimates. 

 Chairman and Chief Executive Scott Stouffer blamed the second-quarter shortfall on management's focus on the acquisition and integration of Avesta Technologies Inc. The $415 million stock deal was completed in late May. 

 "The nearly doubling of the size of our company and the organisation of the combined sales force has proven more challenging than with our other acquisitions," Stouffer said in a statement. 

 The Rockville, Md., company said its second-quarter revenues would be about $32.2 million and earnings about 1 cent a share. 

 Research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' forecasts of corporate earnings, had put second-quarter earnings at 6 cents a share. 

 For the third quarter, the company foresaw a loss per share of 3 cents on revenues of $30 million. First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of 8 cents a share. 

 For the fourth quarter, Visual Networks expected break-even earnings per share on revenues of $32.5 million. First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted a profit of 11 cents a share. 

 For 2001, Visual Networks said it expected earnings per share of 37 cents on $165 million in revenues. First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of $1.02 a share. 

 Visual Networks will post its second-quarter results on July 13. 

 Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Visual Networks to market performer from its U.S. Recommended for Purchase list. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter downgraded the stock to outperform from strong buy. 

 Bear Stearns cut Visual Networks to neutral from buy.

 NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette said Thursday that analyst Jamie Kiggen cut his rating on Entrust Technologies Inc. to market perform from buy a day after its profit warning. 

 -Said the security software maker failed to close two large deals in the second quarter and will miss DLJ's estimated revenue figure of $33 million by roughly $3.5 million. 

 -Cutting the second-quarter revenue estimate to $29.5 million from $33 million, and reduced his EPS estimate to 2 cents a share from 8 cents. 

 -Said that although the two large deals are expected to close in the third quarter, DLJ is being cautious about the length of Entrust's sales cycle until it gets better visibility on the pipeline. 

 -Cut the 2000 revenue estimate to $148 million from $152 million, and cut its 2001 estimates by 6 percent. 

 -Cut 2000 EPS to 13 cents a share from 20 cents, and cut 2001 EPS estimates to 39 cents a share from 42 cents. 

 -Entrust shares rose 1-3/8 to 38.

 MARKETS TUMBLE UNDER WEIGHT OF TECHS: A flight of capital away from tech stocks pushed stock prices down across the board Wednesday, obliterating the gains achieved during the shortened trading day Monday. 

 The markets were closed Tuesday in celebration of Independence Day. The disenchantment with regard to the technology sector was a direct result of profit warnings issued by three computer companies as well as a downgrade of the semiconductor industry by Salomon Smith Barney. 

 Computer Associates and BMC Software watched as their share prices were beaten down unmercifully after both companies indicated last quarter's earnings missed expectations because of weakened sales. The stock of Computer Associates fell 22 points to close at 29-1/8. BMC fell 14-3/16 points to close at 21-5/16 for the day. Computer Associates has fallen 58 percent this year while BMC is down 73 percent. 

 Both companies indicated that the reason for the shortfall was reduced earnings on lower-than-expected sales of mainframe-computer software to businesses. 

 Wall Street took the lower profits to mean that there is an industry-wide slowdown in sales of large-scale corporate computer systems. The impact of that conclusion fell particularly hard on IBM, the world's leading seller of large mainframe corporate computer systems. IBM ended the day down 5-1/2 points at 104. 

 Also hurt in the decline of technology stocks was Entrust Technologies, which lost more than half its value after the company said delays in closing sales caused second-quarter earnings to miss estimates. 

 Entrust shares fell 40-1/2 points to close at 36-5/8 after the company said it expects to report profit from operations of 2 cents per share, well below the 8 cents per share consensus. The company, whose software is used to create computerized IDs for online business transactions, said the problem was one of timing, not lost sales. The warning, though, pushed down the shares of Entrust's rivals, including VeriSign, RSA Security and Baltimore Technologies. 

 The semiconductor group also took its lumps. Texas Instruments, Advanced Micro Devices and National Semiconductor lost ground after Salomon Smith Barney analyst Jonathan Joseph said semiconductor shipments will slow and prices will decline. 

 Joseph said part of the reason was that sales growth forecasts for cell phones have fallen in the past month and the chips that power them are cheaper and more plentiful after many months of shortages. He lowered his recommendation on Advanced Micro, National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments to "outperform" from "buy" and reduced Silicon Storage to "neutral" from "buy." According to Joseph, the companies' inventories are increasing and therefore he was reducing his ratings on the stocks. 

 As a result, Texas Instruments ended the day down 4 points to close at 64. Advanced Micro saw its share price lose 8-13/16 points to close at 75-7/16. Silicon Storage Technology slid 15-1/16 points to close at 83-15/16. Even Intel was not immune, and its share price fell 5-1/4 points to close at 131 5/8. 

 Oil company shares were hard hit after Saudi Arabia announced that it would increase oil supplies after conferring with its colleagues at OPEC. Apparently the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Algeria will likely join in with the Saudis to increase overall OPEC oil production by 500,000 barrel per day. As a result of the news, London Brent blend futures settled 20 cents lower at $29.35 per barrel while U.S. light crude was off $1.83 a barrel at $30.67. 

 Moody's Investors Service downgraded its ratings of Imperial Sugar. The ratings affected included Imperial Sugar's $310 million senior secured credit facilities, which were lowered to B2 from Ba3. Moody's also lowered Imperial's $250 million 9.75 percent senior subordinated notes, due 2007, to Caa1 from B2. 

 The downgrades reflect the impact of a continuing weak domestic sugar market and Imperial's ever increasing leverage that resulted from several large, debt-financed acquisitions including Savannah Foods and Diamond Crystal. The result for Imperial has been a combination of both reduced cash flow and considerably less financial flexibility.

CNNfn: In The Money
ITHM

 BILL TUCKER, CNN ANCHOR:  This Japanese telephone company wants to buy this American Internet service provider, but this law enforcement agency may get in the way.  Is national security really at stake? 

 DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR:  Thousands of hospital workers in Northern California walk off the job to make a point, but will patient care be jeopardized? 

 TERRY KEENAN. CNN ANCHOR:  Americans are wild about Harry.  We`ll look at two companies poised to profit from the new "Harry Potter" book. We`ll be live at an Amazon distribution center, and Scholastic is our "Stock of the Day." 

 KAGAN:  And it`s all in the family at Wimbledon`s Williams sister showdown. 

 ANNOUNCER:  From CNN and CNNfn, this is IN THE MONEY with Terry Keenan, Bill Tucker, and Daryn Kagan. 

 TUCKER:  All right, good morning, and welcome to IN THE MONEY. 

 Wall Street woke up to another set of earnings warnings today, and a lot of earnings concerns on Wall Street.  And you know, Terry, we saw IBM get hit hard yesterday off that news from Computer Associates, down better than $5, today the stock down almost $4 again today. 

 KEENAN:  That is right, and Bear Stearns is cutting earnings estimate, which is interesting because most of the concern at IBM was the sales growth in the second quarter, and now Bear Stearns, of course, cutting the earnings numbers, and that stock is weighing on the Dow 30.  The Dow has been in negative territory throughout the session, and it continues to add to yesterday`s decline.  We are now down 57 point. 

 The Nasdaq tried to start out higher, but, as you can see, that didn`t work, it is in the minus column as well. 

 Well, the feds are on the case of the proposed merger between Japan`s NTT and the U.S.-based Internet service provider Verio.  The FBI is concerned that national security could be compromised if the merger is allowed to proceed.  At the heart of this concern: the ability to maintain surveillance over telecommunications networks. 

 Our Bob Beard has been following this story and he joins us now with the latest from Washington. 

 Bob, good morning. 

 BOB BEARD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning, Terry.  Good morning, Bill. 

 This is an interesting case pitting national security against the recent rash of telecom mergers worldwide.  No comment from the FBI this morning.  We talked to them,  No comment from the Treasury Department, as well,  They say they are prohibiting from commenting about this case. 

 But a source at the National Security Council confirms to CNNfn today that an inquiry into the potential takeover of Internet service provider Verio of Englewood, Colorado, by Japan`s Nippon Telephone & Telegraph, NTT, is under way because of national security concerns.  The review is being done by a little-known government group called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  Now, it is joint task force coordinated by the Treasury Department, which includes the National Security Council, White House Budget Office, and the departments of State, Defense and Commerce. 

 What worries the FBI and Justice is maintaining access to Verio`s Internet backbone for investigative purposes, things like wire taps and subpoenas.  The government raised similar concerns in the merger of Bell Atlantic`s cellular division with Britain`s Vodafone AirTouch. 

 Now, the "Wall Street Journal," which first reported this story this morning, quotes a telecom lawyer, Stuart Baker (ph), as saying the FBI might, might block the deal, unless NTT agrees to conditions that let U.S. law enforcement monitor its Web backbone.  NTT says it will do everything necessary to meet the U.S. government concerns. 

 Now, in May, NTT offered $5.5 billion for Verio, which links companies to the World Wide Web.  And I have just been handed a statement from NTT saying it will extend that tender offer until July 14.  And it believes the proposed transaction does not not raise national security concerns --Terry and Bill. 

 KEENAN:  All right, thank you very much, Bob, Bob Beard. 

 We are going to be talking with an Internet security experts further on this a bit later in the program. 

 TUCKER:  Today`s story especially prescient, as already there are indications down in Washington that a number of senators are lining up to block any proposed merger between Deutsche Telekom and Sprint, even though such an offer hasn`t even been made yet,  Senator Fritz Hollings, and a number of other colleagues, have written the FCC saying that they think that deal could threaten national security as well. 

 Well, "Fortune" magazine`s Andy Serwer is here now, talking about the activity that we are looking at today in the telecom sector. 

 There are a lot of places to go with this one, Andy. 

 ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, "FORTUNE" MAGAZINE:  There are, I mean, there is such a swirl of activity in this global sector, it is really interesting.  Just a note about the NTT-Verio thing.  I can`t help but keep coming back to this point.  The U.S. government is in a battle with NTT right now, let`s not forget that, having to do with allowing U.S. carriers to access the last mile of service in Japan.  NTT is charging very high rates.  The U.S. government wants to knock those down.  I have to believe this investigation of this merger has something to do with that. 

 Now, Prime Minister Mori will be meeting with President Clinton next week to help negotiate this NTT battle.  I say, the FBI goes poof away after they settle this problem with NTT and the last mile. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, and you raise a really good concern as well because there would appear to be more behind this letter to the FCC than just meets the eye as well, perhaps some positioning by Congress, saying, you allow us some access into your markets and we`ll get this... 

 SERWER:  Yes, I mean, exactly.  It really is tit for tat.  And also a word about the FBI.  I don`t really believe that the FBI has any business regulating mergers, be they domestic or international.  That`s not their mandate, that`s not their charter.  They have to adapt their practices to the economy and the business environment, not the other way around. That`s my take on that one. 

 KEENAN:  Any companies that are going to benefit if, indeed, those costs come down in that last mile in Japan? 

 SERWER:  Well, yes, Terry, I think that U.S. carriers are the ones that will benefit, such as WorldCom and T.  T, of course, is in all kinds of trouble right now.  I mean, there are so many stories right now, telecom is now down from 55 to, where is it now, Terry? 

 KEENAN:  I was just going to -- let`s see. 

 SERWER:  I mean, it`s just -- it`s near 30, I know that. 

 KEENAN:  It was near 30 last time I looked -- 33. 

 SERWER:  The WorldCom and the Sprint situation -- 33.  So, anyway, a lot more to come; not the end, not the middle, just the beginning with all these stories. 

 KEENAN:  OK, lots going on, that`s for sure.  Thanks, Andy. 

 SERWER:  OK. 

 KEENAN:  OK, let`s take it down to the New York Stock Exchange where we have a continuation of yesterday`s selloff, and IBM calling the tune once again to the downside. 

 Susan Lisovicz is in the middle of all of the action there -- Susan. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Terry.  Well, the best thing I can tell you right now is that we are off our lows for the session.  But certainly if you were going to see why the Dow is under pressure today, you`d have to take a look at what IBM is doing, the fourth most actively traded issue on the big board today, continuing yesterday`s slide. 

 And we are hearing some comments from brokerages, Merrill Lynch saying that they knew the second quarter was going to be a tough one for IBM. They think there may be further risk.  Prudential saying that it`s seeing sales re-accelerate at both the high end and the low end, but investors choosing to go with yesterday`s negative sentiment.  Remember, IBM hurt yesterday by software warnings from two software companies: from Computer Associates and BMC Software. 

 I want to tell you about Aetna.  That`s one of the winners today, up just fractionally.  A couple of weeks ago this big health care giant said it was talking to Dutch insurance giant ING and others.  The "Financial Times" reporting today that there may be six other companies interested in getting a piece of the action on Aetna.  Aetna won`t confirm or deny. 

 And, finally, Goldman Sachs:  You remember 14 months ago, this brokerage giant went public in one of the biggest IPOs ever.  Now it`s doing a secondary offering of 40 million shares, all of it being sold by institutional investors or former partners who have equity ownership, so none of it will benefit the company.  But it is selling off, one of the biggest losers on the big board, down more than 4.  Some analysts say it may just simply be poor timing.  Capital market stocks may be in for a bumpy ride in the next few weeks -- Terry and Bill. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you, Susan.  Susan Lisovicz. 

 TUCKER:  All right, the pain continues at the Nasdaq.  After opening higher and struggling to stay above break-even, they`ve given up the ghost, the Nasdaq now down 41 points on a percentage basis that`s twice the losses we`re looking at in the Dow. 

 Charles Molineaux is following the action down at the Nasdaq marketsite. 

 What do you have for us, Charles? 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  And, Bill, well, the Nasdaq was higher and semiconductor stocks were higher earlier in the day, up by almost 1 1/2 half percent.  Now they`re down.  So that didn`t last very long at all, no real rally.  But this is what happens when you send in a nasty profit warning. 

 Visual Networks provides network computer services.  It says it`ll miss the market`s expectation for the rest of this year and for next year because its management focus has been on its recent merger with business infrastructure from Avesta Technologies instead of day-to-day operations. Well, down that one goes, $14 or 56 percent.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have both cut their ratings on this one. 

 Here`s some good news, though.  Biomet is up by $3 or 8 percent after it beat the expectations.  It made 28 cents a share in the fourth quarter, a nickel better than the market had expected, and it announced a three-for-two stock split. 

 FirstWorld.com, however, yet again, same story, down by 5 bucks or 60 percent.  More warnings and a shakeup at the top.  It`s now anticipating its Q2 revenues will be short and its CEO, Sheldon Ohringer, is resigning. Deutsche Bank Alex Brown has downgraded it. 

 And the Nasdaq composite still down near its sessions lows, off by 34 points, Bill, at 3828. 

 TUCKER:  All right, thank you, Charles. 

 And we`ll be talking more about the technology sector a little bit later in the program with a guy who runs money for a technology fund., 

 KEENAN:  I`ll be interesting what he has to say. 

 And coming next on IN THE MONEY, we have a winner in Wimbledon`s great sister series. 

 TUCKER:  And CNN`s Dan Ronan is in the middle of the Harry Potter frenzy -- Dan. 

 DAN RONAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Bill, every box contains a book.  I`ll have the story live from Amazon.com where the Harry Potter saga continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  Our "Wake-up Call" this morning goes out to all you taxpayers out there.  It seems that thousands of Americans are overpaying their income taxes.  According to an independent audit, the IRS should have refunded or credited $25 million to individual taxpayers.  The accounting mistakes have been attributed to IRS computer problems. Taxpayers who failed to file late tax returns forfeited their rights to $335 million. Maybe we all have a refund on the way. 

 TUCKER:  We can always dream that it is in the mail, I think. 

 Well, it`s time now to check on some other stories making news today. And. of course, at the top of the news, it`s the WWSS, the Wimbledon Williams Sisters` Showdown. 

 And Daryn`s got the latest on that big match. 

 Good morning, Daryn. 

 KAGAN:  I did not know that was officially the name of the match, whatever works.  Good morning, Bill and Terry. 

 TUCKER:  Good Morning. 

 KAGAN:  It is a bittersweet moment for the Williams family as one sister defeats the other and moves into the Wimbledon Finals.  Just minutes ago, Venus Williams beat her younger sister in a showdown that captured the imagination of many tennis fans around the world.  Venus advances today after a 6-2 7-6 win.  It`s the fourth time in five matches that the 20-year-old Venus has beat her 18-year-old sister, who happens to be the defending champion of the U.S. Open. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 SERENA WILLIAMS, TENNIS PLAYER:  No, I just didn`t play well today. It just didn`t go right for me today.  I didn`t feel it and I -- you know, I just didn`t play well at all.  And I`m very disappointed in the way I performed. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KAGAN:  Venus Williams will next meet the winner of the match between Lindsay Davenport and Jelena Dokic, that match, will be the final match, will be on Saturday.  We`re awaiting a news conference at Wimbledon and hope to bring that you that when it begins, or at least comments from that. 

 Meanwhile, back here in the U.S., 10 hospitals in Northern California are severely understaffed today because of a one-day strike by nearly 4,000 workers.  Hospital employees are protesting staff cuts and increased workloads.  Hospital officials are calling the strike a "potential public health crisis" and they have canceled elective surgeries scheduled for today.  The Bay Area walkout comes as more than 1,700 nurses continue their 4-week-old strike against two Stanford hospitals. 

 Authorities in Colorado have released more 911 tapes from the worst school shooting in U.S. history.  The edited tapes include calls from frantic parents and calls from inside Columbine High School during last year`s shooting spree: 

 (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) 

 911:  You`re in the room 1, 2, 3 -- is that correct? OK. 

 CALLER:  Southern most part of the school. 

 911:  Southern most part of the school and you have one faculty member that`s been shot? 

 CALLER:  Yes -- has been shot -- and is apparently bleeding out at the mouth so they cannot apply direct pressure. 

 911:  OK, is he conscious? 

 CALLER:  Yes, he is conscious. 

 (END AUDIO CLIP) 

 KAGAN:  That teacher later died, as did 12 students shot by the two teenage gunmen.  By the time authorities stormed the building, both gunmen were also dead of self-inflicted wounds.  The 911 tapes were released under court orders because of lawsuits accusing authorities of responding too slowly to the emergency. 

 Crash investigators with the NTSB tell CNN that pilot error, in effect, was the cause of John F. Kennedy Jr.`s plane crash.  The finding comes nearly a year after the crash off of Martha`s Vineyard that killed Kennedy, his wife and his sister-in-law.  An official NTSB report is due out today.  It is expected to say that no mechanical problems were found with Kennedy`s Piper Saratoga.  The night sky was hazy, and the plane was over water, those are conditions that reportedly contributed to what is described as Kennedy`s spatial disorientation. 

 Airline employees are rallying against rowdy passengers today.  They are calling this a "day of action against air rage." Many passengers today will be getting leaflets, putting them on notice about unruly behavior. Flight attendants are demanding a number of measures against violent passengers, including higher fines.  On Tuesday, a passenger on a Continental flight allegedly threw a can of beer at a crew member and bit a pilot on the arm. 

 Euan Blair, who is the 16-year-old son of the British prime minister Tony Blair, has been arrested on a charge of public drunkenness.  A spokesman for Blair says an officer spotted the boy lying on the ground in Leicester Square.  Authorities say an ambulance was called but the boy was not taken to the hospital.  The incident is an embarrassment to the prime minister who recently called on police to crack down on what he called "drunken yobs." 

 Not a good moment for the first family of Britain. 

 But now we go back to Bill and Terry in New York, more just ahead in the hour. 

 KEENAN:  And not a good role model, Daryn, for little Leo. 

 KAGAN:  No. 

 TUCKER:  Uh-oh, the sibling rivalry in the Blair household, looks like it`s coming down the line. 

 Coming up on IN THE MONEY:  It may be the most anticipated release of the summer, and it`s not a movie.  It`s a children`s book called "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." We`ll have a live report on the rush to get it to readers. 

 KEENAN:  And before you judge this book by its cover, you may want to know more about the U.S. publisher.  Coming up, Scholastic is our "Stock of the Day." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  You are looking at a live picture of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  We are off our lows for the Dow industrials, still down 50 points.  Techs is the reason why, IBM down 3 1/2, Hewlett-Packard down 2 1/2. 

 TUCKER:  All right, many kids are counting down the minutes until midnight tomorrow when bookstores around the country will open their doors and start selling the fourth installment in the "Harry Potter" series. Harry Potter, the wizard kid, worked his magic on thousands of children, and adults, luring them away from video games and into reading rooms. And some lucky kids got a sneak preview of the latest, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire." A Wal-Mart store in New Jersey sold two of the books Friday.  Wal-Mart says they were mistakenly put on the floor.  Last week, another 31 books were sold off a display at a Wal-Mart, again, this time in Richmond, Virginia. 

 KEENAN:  Well, for the rest of us, "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" by J.K. Rowling, 3.8 million copies will be sold for $25.95 each. 

 TUCKER:  That is right.  And Dan Ronan is at the Amazon.com distribution center in Atlanta, where "operation Harry Potter" is under way -- Dan. 

 RONAN:  Bill, it is under way in a big way, in a big way.  And you were talking about security.  I want to tell you that the books, the copies that we`ve got, are all taped and boxed.  So when we were talking earlier about the idea of taking a peek at the books, the officials from Amazon.com said the publisher is very, very concerned that they don`t wanted additional copies to get out. 

 Now the books will be costing about $15, $16, that ones that will be sent out.  This copy here is being sent to a David L. Breeze (ph), Summerfield, New Jersey.  So your copy is on the way, Dave.  And it is in good hands, Summerfield, North Carolina. 

 This operation has been going on now since about 6:00 this morning. Several hundred workers have been coming in here.  They have been taking the books, they have been taking care of that, and wrapping them, and getting them on the way.  Each box has a book. 

 And I`m joined now by Kristin Schaefer.  Kristin is a spokeswoman for Amazon.com. 

 Kristin, why all the security here? what`s the big deal with the security? 

 KRISTIN SCHAEFER, AMAZON.COM SPOKESWOMAN:  Well, as you know, Scholastic has embargoed the "Harry Potter" book completely until it is available in stores this Saturday, July 8.  So we are complying with the embargo, we are keeping it under tight security, making sure that nobody sees it until it is available to the public. 

 RONAN:  Now, for Amazon.com, as an e-retailer, how big of a deal is this, in terms of actual volume? in terms of the cost, in terms of pulling it all together? 

 SCHAEFER:  Well, it has been -- We have received, as of this morning, I don`t know what the current count is, but over 319,000 pre-orders for this book, which is about seven times our greatest pre-order to date. So it has definitely been a huge project for us, a very important one, and we are very excited about it.  We`ve got resources at all of our distribution centers across the country to make sure that we get customers these books on time.  The first 250,000 orders will be delivered this Saturday, July 8th via FedEx, and beyond that, it is per the shipping method that the customer selected. 

 RONAN:  First come, first serve. 

 SCHAEFER:  Exactly. 

 RONAN:  OK, Kristin Schaefer from Amazon.com.  That is the operation here, Bill and Terry, and it has been big one, busy all day, and it will be busy like all through the weekend. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks a lot, Dan, our Dan Ronan. 

 TUCKER:  And I was going to ask Dan if he could look through and find one for Christian because he`s got one coming in the mail. 

 KEENAN:  On Saturday morning. 

 TUCKER:  Could have had Dan maybe pick it up and send it up a little early. 

 KEENAN:  I don`t think they are going to let him do that. 

 TUCKER:  I don`t think so. 

 KEENAN:  It will be there Saturday morning. 

 TUCKER:  Exactly.  Well, if you are looking to invest in the "Harry Potter" trend, consider our "Stock of the Day": Potter`s book publisher, Scholastic.  It`s no stranger to big titles, but Scholastic has been hurt before by mis-estimating demand.  So, some wonder if "Harry Potter" mania can make Scholastic a best-selling "Stock of the Day"? 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," book four in the "Harry Potter" series comes out this weekend, and publisher Scholastic is thinking big, really big.  The world`s top children`s book publisher has a first run of 3.8 million books.  It needs the sales because Scholastic don`t own licensing or movie rights, and the publisher is being careful to avoid the bump it took with its once popular "Goosebump" series. 

 Falling victim to the changing whims of youth, Scholastic took a huge charge for book returns, and its stock sank.  Some three years later, Scholastic stock has yet to fully recover, still down six percent in the last three years. 

 However, Scholastic has a full bookshelf, selling 250 million books a year through stores, book clubs and fairs.  Its library includes "Clifford the Big Red Dog" and "The Magic School Bus." Its $400 million buyout of reference publisher Grolier adds a strong direct sales and reference book business. 

 While books account for 60 percent of its revenue, it also publishes magazines, text books and videos.  And that has helped to turn the page on a flat 1997.  With $37 million in profits last year, and over $1 billion in revenue. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  All right, now Scholastic is trading up three-eighths at 62 1/2, about 56,000 shares have traded. 

 For more on Scholastic, let`s talk to Ed Hatch, analyst with SG Cowen. He joins us from the American Stock Exchange. 

 Ed, thanks for being on IN THE MONEY. 

 ED HATCH, SG COWEN:  Hi, you are welcome. 

 TUCKER:  How much does Scholastic stand to benefit from this? could this be a substantial revenue stream for them? 

 HATCH:  The "Harry Potter" book might be five percent of sales, or five percent of profits, it could certainly becomes a big franchise, but not necessarily the reason to go out and buy Scholastic stock. 

 KEENAN:  What would be the reason?  I mean, what does this company have to do to really finally become a growth story? 

 HATCH:  Well, Scholastic has a terrific franchise in the children`s publisher and entertainment business.  They are the dominant leader in the school book club business and book fairs.  And they have got a great brand name, and great trust with both the teachers and their kids. 

 TUCKER:  I was going to say, any of us who have kids get those little flyers home all the time.  It seems that they are the franchise operation. What ails the stock here? 

 HATCH:  Well, I don`t think there`s a real problem with the stock.  I think one has to put, you know, Scholastic in perspective.  Sales are going at about a 10 or 12 percent annual rate.  I think that the addition of Grolier looks very positive.  But, again, this is a broad-based children`s publisher that does capitalize very well in its plans through licensing, through new television series, and other products. 

 KEENAN:  Does Scholastic have the dibs on the next "Harry Potter" book as well, whenever that comes out? 

 HATCH:  That`s a good question.  I know that they do have the publishing rights, "Harry Potter" has been hugely successful, but it`s not clear, you know, how long those rights go for. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Ed, thank you very much.  We have been speaking with Ed Hatch, SG Cowen, appreciate it. 

 KEENAN:  OK, now that you have heard about Scholastic, go to the bottom of our CNNfn Web page, and tell us whether you think we should add the publisher of the "Harry Potter" books to our portfolio. 

 Now, you told us what you thought about Computer Associates.  The software company was yesterday`s "Stock of the Day," and a controversial one.  The shares plunged yesterday after the firm issued a very severe earnings warning.  Forty-eight percent of you voted to buy Computer Associates.  That`s not enough.  We still give it a red light in our IN THE MONEY indicator.  We are not going to buy any new shares for our portfolio. 

 And just a little bounce, the stock up nine-sixteenths right now, just at $30 a share. 

 TUCKER:  I don`t know about you, but I was surprised by that vote.  I actually thought it would be much more negative than that.  I was surprised 47 percent of the viewers thought maybe we ought to gamble on it. 

 KEENAN:  I guess a little bargain-hunting there, but we are not going to buy it anyway, so.., 

 TUCKER:  All right, there are now just two days left until we can get our hands on the "Potter" books. 

 KEENAN:  Tomorrow on IN THE MONEY, we are going to count down the days with the book`s publisher.  Scholastic`s CEO, Richard Robinson, will be our guest, and we will try to squeeze some juicy secrets out of him about the Harry Potter`s latest adventure, and of course ask him what Potter news means for his profits.  And we will of course have the results of your vote on whether you like Scholastic stock. 

 TUCKER:  That is right.  Just ahead on IN THE MONEY:  home ownership is the cornerstone of the American dream. 

 KEENAN:  But a new housing scam called flipping has stuck some first- time home buyers with some overpriced shanties.  That story coming up next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  All right, beautiful shot of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor.  The ships may have been gone -- been here and gone away, but the lady still stands at the entrance to New York. 

 KEENAN:  Yes, and it is the nicest day of the week. 

 Welcome back, everyone, to IN THE MONEY.  It`s half past the hour. I`m Terry Keenan. 

 TUCKER:  And it`s another down day for the market as profit warnings are scaring investors again. 

 KEENAN:  Let`s bring you up-to-speed on the numbers.  The Dow is off its worst levels of the session, down 41 points, but it continues to be hurt by problems with IBM.  That stock too is off its lows; traded as low as 100 a bit earlier in the morning, but now is trading down 3 7/16 at 101 9/16 -- Bear Stearns cutting its earnings forecast for the full year for Big Blue.  The Nasdaq, under bit of a pressure, down 18. 

 TUCKER:  Well, the FBI, as we have mentioned earlier in the program, is concern that a plan merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm could harm national security; the FBI asking the Treasury Department to look into its concerns.  The deal in question is Japan`s Nippon Telegraph and Telephones agreement to buy Verio, an rMD-IT_Internet service provider based in the U.S.  The FBI is worried that overseas ownership of Verio will inhibit its ability to maintain surveillance over Verio`s telecom network. 

 The FBI requires access to obtain wiretaps for serving subpoenas its investigations.  The moves by the FBI over Verio come as 30 senators are moving to block the acquisition of Sprint by any other overseas company, perhaps such as Deutsche Telekom. 

 To hear more about what security and antitrust issues may arise as a result of overseas companies owning U.S. firms, we are bringing in someone who advises both companies and governments.  Joining us now is Brett Lambert.  He is a consultant with DFI International. 

 Brett, thank you for being on IN THE MONEY 

 BRETT LAMBERT, VICE PRESIDENT, DFI INTERNATIONAL:  Sure. 

 TUCKER:  Can you layout for me exactly what the national security concerns could be in this case? 

 LAMBERT:  Well, there`s an organization called CFIUS, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States.  It`s been around for quite some time, and was part of actually the Exxon-Florio Bill in 1988.  That committee is responsible for evaluating companies trying to acquire U.S. companies to see if there are national security concerns.  In this case, as major provider of web hosting to over 400,000 U.S. companies, both large and small, there is obviously raised some concern about the fact that NTT is a majority-owned company by the Japanese government. 

 And so, it would in effect, be the U.S. -- or the Japanese government owning a pretty large strategic asset in the United States. 

 TUCKER:  I`ve got two reactions to that.  One is, I don`t know a lot of people that would be too upset to think maybe the FBI couldn`t survey the telecom network as closely as perhaps the FBI would like to.  And second of all is, ownership in the United States, wouldn`t it still fall under U.S. law anyway? 

 LAMBERT:  Sure, it absolutely would.  I think the question that was raised by Justice in this process was, do we want the owner of this company, in this case the Japanese government, to have information about what we are surveilling if do we need to surveill something?  So I think there can reach an accommodation on the issue.  It`s a question of whether NTT is willing to come back to the table, which they apparently have said they are, and whether the Justice Department feels, in this case, it can be resolved amicably and the deal can move forward. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Brett, thank you very much.  We`ve been speaking with Brett Lambert.  He is security consultant and vice president at DFI International. 

 And Brett, thank you. 

 LAMBERT:  Sure. 

 KEENAN:  In other corporate news this morning, as many as six companies are reportedly considering strengthening their financial health by buying parts of Aetna, the largest American health insurer. Aetna had been in exclusive sale talks with the Dutch Insurance Giant, ING.  Those talks broke down last month over price.  The "Financial Times" is reporting that the companies believe that they have the right prescription for Aetna. And those companies include Citigroup.  Neither Citigroup nor Aetna would comment.  Aetna shares are trading up a half. 

 And the latest mortgage rates are out, and they`re down from last week.  Here is a look at the numbers:  The 30-year fixed rate mortgage is at 7.84 percent, down from 7.94 percent last week; 15-year coming in at just above 7 1/2 percent; while a one-year adjustable rate mortgage will cost you 7.21 percent. 

 TUCKER:  All right, a controversial method of selling homes is spreading through some of the nation`s biggest cities. 

 KEENAN:  That`s right, it`s called "flipping," and too often it leaves low-income buyers with crumbling homes and very high mortgages. 

 Kathleen Koch reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATHLEEN KOCH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Cecilia Banks bought this Baltimore rowhouse for $82,000 and was promised it would be completely refurbished.  She didn`t know the seller four months earlier had paid just $19,000 for the home. 

 CECILIA BANKS, HOMEOWNER:  What I was getting was large payments, a house that was slowly falling apart, and nobody else to talk to about where to go. 

 KOCH:  The same thing happened to first-time homeowner Denise Green. She paid $39,000 for this home and then found out it had been condemned. 

 The seller never made any of the promised repairs. 

 DENISE GREEN, HOMEBUYER:  When I called him up and kept telling him that the problems hadn`t been fixed, he said, you`re a homeowner now. You just deal with it. 

 KOCH:  Critics call it "flipping." They say investors, backed by lenders and real estate agents, purchase and quickly resell dilapidated homes at inflated prices to unwary, low-income homebuyers.  And 2,000 homes, they claim, have been sold that way in Baltimore alone over the past four years. 

 Housing activists say those homes often end up in foreclosure. 

 KOCH:  A spokesman for those accused of flipping denies wrongdoing and says a change in laws could backfire. 

 IRA COOKE, ATTORNEY:  My view is: buyer beware, period.  I think the last thing you need are to pass new laws and regulations which would make it even more difficult for people to get mortgage money. 

 KOCH:  So critics say the FHA needs to do more to stop flipping.  The agency is launching a program in Baltimore to help affected homeowners repair their credit and hold lenders accountable. 

 WILLIAM APGAR, FEDERAL HOUSING ADMINISTRATION:  If there`s a clear instance of a flipping situation, we`re going to go back to the lender and ask the lender to make it right for the borrower. 

 KOCH:  But that won`t help victims who`ve already lost hope. 

 GREEN:  He destroyed my dreams.  I don`t know when I`ll own a home again. 

 KOCH:  Kathleen Koch for CNN, Washington. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  All right, coming up, girls just wan to have funds?  Boy, have things changed.  Coming up, we`ll talk to the author of an investment book written for women. 

 KEENAN:  And could adopting a few healthy habits save your life?  We will have some heartening details. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Crude oil down 29 cents a barrel at $30.45 here in New York trading and that`s helping ExxonMobil move up better than $2 a share. Tech stocks remain under pressure, Hewlett-Packard and IBM, Dow components, lower.  Nasdaq, as you can see, also lower, both markets off their lows of the session. 

 KEENAN:  And as Bill mentioned, high-tech stocks have been under pressure lately.  Will they continue to slide or return to their previous position as the economic growth leaders? 

 Joining me now from Milwaukee to talk about this, James Houlton of the Strong Funds.  He runs a tech fund there. 

 And, Jim, welcome.  Nice to have you with us. 

 JAMES HOULTON, FUND MANAGER, STRONG FUNDS:  Thank you, Terry.  Nice to be with you. 

 KEENAN:  Last couple days have been kind of tough for tech investors. We`ve gotten some warnings coming out of the software industry, in particular, one big brokerage firm raising some questions about the semiconductor stocks.  Is now a time, perhaps, to lighten up on some of your tech holdings? 

 HOULTON:  Well, I really think that we at the Strong Internet Fund try to look at -- take a long-term view of these things.  There`s some bumps I think that we can anticipate near-term as people are concerned about the second quarter earnings reports, especially with the problems in the software space yesterday, and the Salomon downgrade of the semis yesterday as well. 

 But I think, you know, for the general investor, we need to think longer term.  And that`s what we try to do.  We try to look for the best managed, highest quality Internet companies.  And we think that over the next month or so, it will be a great time to be buying because we`re very bullish on the Internet over the next 12 months, 24 months. 

 KEENAN:  Well, as you look out there in the Internet space, what are some of your favorites? 

 HOULTON:  Well, we like -- we really think that the build-out of the phone system -- in other words, we have a 100-year-old phone system here in the States and it`s never really been upgraded.  And we`re going through kind of a revolutionary change now as everyone from corporations to consumers wants, you know, access, and high-speed access, to the Internet. And the phone companies know that if they aren`t the ones that step up and provide this Internet access, other companies will be formed to do that. 

 KEENAN:  So you like some of the big phone names, the regional Bell companies? 

 HOULTON:  Well, actually, what we -- we`re focusing on the arms merchants, the guys who are providing the equipment and the infrastructure, like Cisco Systems is one that we like.  And we also like some of the emerging optical component companies.  These are companies that, as the demand for the Internet increases at the consumer end, at the home level, the demand for bandwidth increases dramatically higher at the core.  So people are employing optical systems now made by Nortel and Lucent.  But we like the people who supply to those guys. And JDS Uniphase is a terrific company and they`ve just emerged -- merged with E-Tech Systems... 

 KEENAN:  Right. 

 HOULTON:  ... and we think that there`s a great future for them. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks a lot, Jim. 

 HOULTON:  Oh, you`re welcome. 

 KEENAN:  Jim Houlton of the Strong Funds. 

 TUCKER:  All right, it is time now to check on some other stories making news today.  And for that, we check back in with Daryn on the latest on those stories. 

 Hey, again, Daryn. 

 KAGAN:  Bill, we`ve been having some fun watching tennis here today. The victory goes to Venus, as in Venus Williams, who has won her much ballyhooed showdown with her younger sister, Serena, today at Wimbledon in the semifinal match.  It is the fourth time in five matches that the 20-year-old Venus has beaten 18-year-old Serena, who is the defending U.S. champ.  She`s no slouch herself.  With her today, the final score was 6-2, 7-6, the win today.  Venus will now move into the finals. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 VENUS WILLIAMS, WIMBLEDON FINALIST:  It was very difficult because the pressure was always on and we`re both shot makers.  It was a tough match. It was a very powerful match. 

 QUESTION:  What about the dynamics of being sisters, being on the court together? 

 WILLIAMS:  Maybe I knew her game more. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KAGAN:  That she did. 

 Venus, next, will meet the winner of the Lindsay Davenport-Jelena Dokic match for Saturday`s title match at Wimbledon. 

 In other sports news, Germany has been named host nation for the 2006 soccer World Cup final tournament.  Germany narrowly beat out the expected favorite, South Africa.  The decisive vote came in the last of the three rounds of voting.  Morocco and England were eliminated in the first two rounds.  Big surprise there, a lot of folks thinking that was going to South Africa. 

 In health news today, eating right, exercising and not smoking may be even more beneficial to your heart than you ever imagined.  A new study is showing that combining healthy habits can reduce the risk of heart disease in women by more than 80 percent.  Harvard University researchers followed more than 84,000 women for 14 years.  Their findings indicate healthy habits could virtually wipe out heart disease. Researchers say that by adopting a healthy lifestyle, men could also reduce their risk of heart disease. 

 Overseas, officials are calling it Japan`s worst case of food poisoning in decades.  Tainted milk has sickened more than 11,000 people in western Japan.  The outbreak has been traced to a milk plant where bacteria accumulated in a production line valve.  The plant has been shut down and police are investigating the possibility of criminal negligence. 

 Now for a look at who Americans believe should get credit for the current economic conditions, we turn to our Gallup Poll Editor in Chief Frank Newport. 

 Frank, good morning. 

 FRANK NEWPORT,  EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, GALLUP POLL:  Good day, Daryn. Indeed, that`s the question:  Who gets the credit?  A lot of analysts have been saying Al Gore should be benefiting from having been part of the administration that had this very robust economy for the last number of years, but the polls show, so far at least, he`s not been able to pull ahead of George W. Bush. 

 We asked Americans, first of all, who should get the credit? when we listed several different entities.  We listed the high-tech computer industry, and you can see there 56 percent of Americans say it`s that industry that should get a great day of credit for the positive economy; the Federal Reserve, 34 percent say it should get a great deal of credit; and then the administration, only 29 percent.  Congress is even lower than that, so you can see where it comes in. 

 In fact, we asked Americans to choose between the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, in terms of its impact versus the Clinton administration.  You can see the results: 53 to 38.  The average American says that it`s the Fed and Greenspan more responsible for the economy than the Clinton administration. 

 All of that may help explain what we`ll show you here, is when we came down to it and just said to Americans a week or two ago:  Who would be most able to continue the robust economy, George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore? Bush, you can see, edges out Gore by about 5 points, further evidence of the fact that, at least so far, the vice president has not been able to capitalize on having been part of this very good economy, the administration that was captain of the ship, so to speak, during this very good economy. 

 That`s where Americans stand.  Daryn, back to you. 

 KAGAN:  Frank, thank you very much. 

 One final story for you:  The NTSB is out with its final report on the plane crash that took the lives of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law.  Basically they`re saying it comes down to pilot error. We`ll have more on that story at the top of the hour here on CNN. 

 For now, back to Bill and Terry in New York. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks a lot, Daryn. 

 Well, in a growing number of American households, women are taking an increased role in making investment decisions.  In many households, they have the full role. 

 Our next guest says that most women, though, don`t know the basics of investing, so she did something about it.  She wrote a book with tips on making investing fun.  Susannah Goodman is the author of "Girls Just Wanna Have Funds," and she joins us now. 

 Susannah, welcome.  Why did you write this book particularly for women, because there`s a lot of men out there that don`t know the first thing about investing either. 

 SUSANNAH GOODMAN, AUTHOR, "GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUNDS":  Right. Well, in my conversations with women, I found that some fundamental information was needed, and the statistics bear that out.  Of the elderly poor in this country, most of them are women, and so I wanted to do something to make a contribution, to help educate women to become better investors.  And then I decided to have fun writing it and make it as girlie as I could. 

 In the book, I say that shopping for a stock is like shopping for the perfect summer sun dress.  And if you think about it, it`s true.  You go into a store, you`re going to buy the perfect sun dress, you see the price, it`s 50 percent off, so the price is right.  You try it on, it fits, it`s got great value.  So it`s good value, good price, good value. That`s what you`re looking for in a stock, that`s what you`re looking for in a sun dress. 

 TUCKER:  Well, it`s nothing gender-specific about the advice that you give out here, right? 

 GOODMAN:  Absolutely not.  I mean, a stock doesn`t know who owns it. Money is money wherever you go.  But a little lower on the sports analogies, a little higher on the shopping analogies.  I had fun with it. 

 KEENAN:  And you`re speaking my language. 

 (LAUGHTER) 

 But, you know, a lot of people, though, you may keep your eye on a dress and wait for it to go down and get really excited when you can pick it up at 30 percent off. 

 GOODMAN:  Right. 

 KEENAN:  But a lot of people when they see a stock go down, they`re less likely to buy it.  And when they see a stock shooting up -- Qualcomm a great example late last year -- everybody wanted to buy it at the high. 

 GOODMAN:  Right.  It`s one of the great ironies of the investing world.  When things going on sale, people don`t want to buy them because they get spooked.  And that`s the time we have to listen to the words of Warren Buffett, that you`re going to buy a good company.  And if we`re right on the company, the stock will take care of itself.  You look at Qualcomm, you see if the fundamentals are there, you buy it whether the market`s running away from it or not. 

 TUCKER:  How about we get some of your tips really quickly here? 

 GOODMAN:  OK, basically, for young women especially, starting out, got to max out your 401(k), your retirement plan.  A lot of people are strapped for money, but you`ve just got to do it. 

 KEENAN:  And put it all in stock? 

 GOODMAN:  Put it all in equities, all in stocks, better than bonds, better than real estate, really, if you are young, it is a great way to make the most of your retirement money, your retirement dollars, and you are saving money in taxes. 

 And then Roth IRA is a great investment.  Make sure you do that. 

 Be adequately insured because one bad accident and you can wipe out all of your savings.  You want to make sure you`ve got good health insurance. 

 And you want to invest for long-term.  You know, you want to make sure that the dips and crashes in the market don`t spook you too much.  And so I advise investors, when the market crashes, and we see our stocks tumble in value, take a bubble bath. 

 KEENAN:  OK, and look at it as if it was a sample sale. 

 GOODMAN:  Exactly. 

 KEENAN:  Thanks, Susan, Susannah Goodman. 

 TUCKER:  Well, coming up on IN THE MONEY:  Amtrak wants to put its customers on the fast track to better service. 

 KEENAN:  After the break, we`ll talk with the head of Amtrak about its new service guarantee, and what the future might hold for all you Amtrak passengers. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Amtrak is now offering an unconditional guarantee, promising to compensate riders who are unhappy with their travel expenses on America`s national railway. 

 KEENAN:  The move comes as Amtrak`s much-hyped, high-speed service between Washington and Boston -- that was supposed to start at the end of last year -- is still not up and rolling. 

 And joining us to talk about Amtrak`s future is its president and CEO, George Warrington. 

 TUCKER:  Welcome to IN THE MONEY, sir.  Nice to have you here. 

 GEORGE WARRINGTON, PRESIDENT & CEO, AMTRAK:  Good afternoon, very pleased to be here.  Thank you for inviting me. 

 TUCKER:  Unconditional happiness is kind of hard to ignore.  Why are you making this kind of promise? 

 WARRINGTON:  This is because we have complete and total confidence in our employees, our products, and our services.  This really is about distinguishing Amtrak in the marketplace, a very competitive marketplace, and really about putting a stake in the ground around quality and value and what we stand for.  And it really is an effort to put customers first, and we have confidence that our, as I said, products, services and employees will deliver a very positive experience for customers all across America. 

 One of the things that you know is going on today is that the traveling public is really increasingly fed up with the airway saturation and highway gridlock.  And what Amtrak is uniquely positioned to do is offer a practical choice, a quality choice, and an efficient choice for the traveling public. 

 And we are very proud of the service that we operate.  We`ve seen extraordinary growth over the last number of years, in particular the last six months, as we`ve introduced service improvements across this system. 

 So our prospects looking forward are very positive and, in large measure, to our commitment to stand behind our product and satisfy customers` wants and needs. 

 KEENAN:  And you know, it is just that congestion, both in the air and on highways, that has everybody here in the Northeast very anxious for your Acela train to get up and running.  When can we expect it? 

 WARRINGTON:  Well, I`m as anxious as you all, we are all as anxious as you are.  It is going to be an extraordinary powerful force around the Northeast and in the economy of the Northeast, and to Amtrak`s bottom line. I can`t give you a precise date today, but in the very near future. 

 KEENAN:  Before the end of the year? 

 WARRINGTON:  Absolutely, absolutely.  I would say within the next month to two months we should begin seeing our Acela Express service launched between Washington, New York and Boston.  Between Washington and New York, we will see today`s three hour travel time reduced, in some case, to two hours and 30 minutes; and between New York and Boston, we will see today`s five hour trip reduced to just about three hours. Very competitive and very positive force for the regional economy. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Mr. Warrington, thank you very much for being here, president and CEO of Amtrak. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you very much.  And don`t forget to join us tomorrow, as we continue our countdown to the new "Harry Potter" book. We`ll talk to the CEO of Scholastic, the book`s publisher.  And don`t forget to vote.  It was our "Stock of the Day." 

 TUCKER:  That`s right.  that does it for today`s edition of IN THE MONEY.  We will see you all tomorrow.

 Texas Instruments, chip shares fall on report Texas Instruments Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and National Semiconductor Corp. fell yesterday after SalomonSmithBarney Inc. analyst Jonathan Joseph said semiconductor shipments will slow and prices will decline. Texas Instruments dropped $5.13 to $63.88 and Advanced Micro tumbled $9.56 to $74.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Silicon Storage Technology Inc. slid $15.06 to $83.94. Joseph said inventories are rising and cut his ratings on the stocks. Intel Corp., the world's biggest chipmaker, fell $5.25 to $131.63. 

 Chipmakers' shares had risen 35 percent this year before yesterday making the Standard & Poor's Electronics Semiconductors group the fourth-best performer in the S&P 500 Index. Joseph said sales growth forecasts for cell phones have fallen in the past month and the chips that power them are cheaper and more plentiful after months of shortages. Computer Associates plunges on profit warning Computer Associates International Inc. shares fell as much as 44 percent yesterday after the No. 4 U.S. software maker warned that fiscal first-quarter profit missed analysts' estimates because of sluggish sales in Europe and in its mainframe-computer software line. The shares plunged $21.69 to $29.44 in late afternoon trading after falling as low as $28.50, erasing almost two years of gains. The volume was the most in U.S. markets and six times the company's three-month daily average. 

 The company said it failed to win several large contracts late in the quarter ended June 30. Sales were weak in France and Germany, company President Sanjay Kumar said in a conference call. Total sales increased slightly from the year-ago quarter, although they didn't grow as much as analysts expected. U.S. economy: Soft landing likely The U.S. economy is on track in the second half of this year to achieve the "soft landing" desired by Federal Reserve policy-makers, slowing just enough to hold inflation in check, according to economists surveyed yesterday by Bloomberg News. Growth will probably average a 3.7 percent annual rate in the final six months of the year, according to the median forecast of the 33 economists. That's down from a 5.5 percent first-quarter growth pace, and close to the consensus forecast of a 3.5 percent rate for the second quarter that ended Friday. 

 The second-half forecast is in line with the Fed's growth estimate for all of 2000, and poses no threat to end the record nine-year expansion. After six interest-rate increases in the past year from Fed policy-makers, retail and auto sales have fallen for two straight months. Yesterday, the Conference Board reported its index of leading U.S. economic indicators fell 0.1 percent in May after being unchanged in April. 

 The New York-based group's index is intended to be a gauge of economic performance over the next six to nine months, and the second straight month without an increase reinforces expectations of slower growth. Entrust drags down Web-security makers Entrust Technologies Inc. shares lost more than half their value yesterday, dragging other Internet-security software makers lower, after the company said delays in closing sales caused second-quarter earnings to miss estimates. Entrust shares plunged $41.69 to $35.44 in late trading, erasing about $2.2 billion in market value. 

 The company said it expects to report profit from operations of 2 cents a share, below the 8-cent average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial and unchanged from a year ago. The company, whose software is used to create computerized IDs for online business transactions, said the problem was one of timing, not lost sales. The warning, though, pushed down the shares of Entrust's rivals, including VeriSign Inc., RSA Security Inc. and Baltimore Technologies Plc. Bonds gain strength on rate expectations U.S. Treasuries rose yesterday, driving yields to their lowest level since April, as signs of slower growth and inflation boosted optimism the Federal Reserve is near the end of a cycle of interest-rate increases. The most-actively traded two-year note rose 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to a price of 100-6/32. Its yield dropped 3 basis points to 6.26 percent, the lowest since April 14. 

 The current five-year note rose 2/32 to 102-21/32, as its yield fell 2 basis points to 6.1 percent. The most active 30-year bond rose 3/32 to 105-15/32. Its yield fell 1 basis points to 5.86 percent. Evidence this week of falling oil prices, cooling growth and lower prices paid by manufacturers, along with signs of tame personal income and spending last week, has helped drive the two-year yield down more than a quarter-point since June 23 as traders and investors trimmed expectations for rate rises by the Fed. Yen falls against dollar and euro The yen fell to a three-week low against the dollar and sank against the euro yesterday on speculation a report today will show Japanese consumer spending remains feeble, casting doubt on the strength of the economy. Japan's currency fell a second straight day, even after the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey Tuesday showed large Japanese businesses are increasingly optimistic about their prospects. The focus turns now to the report on May household spending, for signs domestic demand is reviving enough to allow the central bank to raise interest rates from near zero percent. In trading yesterday, the yen weakened to 107.19 per dollar, from 106.10 late Tuesday, reaching its lowest since June 12. Against the euro, it had its biggest percentage loss since May 31, falling to 102.12 per euro from 100.89. Comverse Technology to buy Exalink for $437M Comverse Technology Inc., one of the largest sellers of telephone-messaging systems, yesterday agreed to buy Exalink Ltd. for about $437 million in stock to add software used to deliver Internet content to wireless devices. Comverse will exchange about 5.26 million new shares for closely held Exalink, based in Herzelia, Israel. 

 Comverse, based in Woodbury, N.Y., will assume an undisclosed amount of options and warrants. This is Comverse's third acquisition in the past month to add to its products for mobile-phone service companies, which generate 80 percent of its sales. Comverse, founded in 1984 in Israel, offers voice-mail and Internet-based services that can put messages, faxes and e-mail in a single mailbox. Cordiant Communications acquiring Lighthouse Cordiant Communications Group Plc, owner of Bates Worldwide, yesterday said it will buy Lighthouse Global Network Inc., a marketing services company, for $592 million in stock and debt to expand in businesses growing faster than traditional advertising. Cordiant will offer 75 million new shares, worth $421 million at Tuesday's closing share price. It will also assume $171 million in Lighthouse debt. 

 Lighthouse, whose clients include America Online Inc. and Microsoft Corp., is owned by its management and two Chicago-based private equity firms: GTCR Golder Rauner LLC and Frontenac Co. The acquisition boosts Cordiant in areas such as packaging and public relations, which are growing faster, and are often more profitable, than developing ads for television or magazines. Telefonica concluding buyout of Peru unit Spain's Telefonica SA has wound up a mostly successful share swap to buy out its Telefonica del Peru SA unit, leaving a local market hungry for trade and bereft of a benchmark to replace Peru's largest phone company. 

 Telefonica del Peru shareholders turned out in large numbers to swap their shares for the Spanish parent's U.S.-traded stock, according to the coordinators of the exchange. The results of the swap may be released today, they said. Local traders said shareholder acceptance of the Telefonica del Peru exchange will probably be similar to swaps in Brazil and Argentina, where 85 percent and 90 percent of holders respectively accepted the offer.

 Computer Associates Leads Technology Sector Lower --- Business Software Maker Issues  Profit Warning ; Shares Tumble Over 40% --- Firm Blames Weak Sales in Europe and a Change at IBM   

A Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup

 NEW YORK -- Shares of Computer Associates International Inc. fell more than 40% on Wednesday in the first day of trading after the company warned that its quarterly results would fall far short of Wall Street expectations.   

 The news pulled the technology sector sharply lower. An analyst's cautious outlook on the semiconductor industry added to the technology sector's woes.   

 "The damage is fairly well concentrated in the technology stocks," said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. "It's feeding on itself."   

 "The Nasdaq composite index fell 128.83, or 3.2%, to close at 3,863.10, its worst performance since May 23. The European technology sector also fell in the wake of the news. The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell 2.7 points to 379.15, with technology and oil shares leading losses.   

 Computer Associates has never been one of Wall Street's darlings. Its array of nearly 800 products has confounded investors. Its cutthroat pricing and slash-and-burn acquisitions have irked some industry players. And its stock has foundered for the past two years, trading at a steep discount to its peers, vexing shareholders.   

 That discount got even wider Wednesday after the Islandia, New York, company warned it would badly miss fiscal first-quarter estimates. After closing at 51 3/8 on the NYSE Monday, the shares closed Wednesday at $25.875, down 44%. The drop cut Computer Associates' $30.4 billion market cap nearly in half, leaving it at $17.5 billion.   

 Just after midnight Monday, Computer Associates issued a press release warning it would miss expectations. The details came later, in an early morning conference call Wednesday in which it seemed that President Sanjay Kumar couldn't apologize enough.   

 Nevertheless, analysts raced afterwards to lower their ratings on Computer Associates. Some even downgraded the stock before they had finished crunching new estimates. By 11 a.m., six analyst had downgraded the stock, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.   

 The magnitude of the shortfall -- a 25% miss on the revenue line and as much as 80% short of consensus earnings expectations -- is what spooked investors. Mr. Kumar said the company expects June earnings of 11 cents to 16 cents a share, excluding goodwill and special items, compared with estimates of 55 cents. He put June revenue at $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, compared with views of $1.6 billion.   

 Although most of this quarter's eye-catching earnings warnings have come from consumer products makers, big-cap tech firms, too, are starting to show signs of weakness. Xerox Corp. warned again last week and concerns have surfaced for several computer makers, including Compaq Computer Corp. Earlier in the quarter, a slew of computer services firms, including Electronic Data Systems Corp., Computer Sciences Corp. and Unisys Corp., each came out with negative pronouncements.   

 "I think that was in the back of everyone's mind," said Jordan Klein, analyst at UBS Warburg. "We should have read more into it, though it's tough to get a good read from" the services firms because some have large federal contracts and others rely on key customers.   

 But Merrill Lynch analyst Chris Shilakes said that although those companies' business is also related to mega contracts, their revenues "have not necessarily moved in lockstep with the software vendors."   

 As for Computer Associates, it blamed weak demand for mainframe software (which accounts for 40% to 45% of its business), continued sluggishness in Europe and several large deals that didn't close late in the quarter. But unbeknownst to Mr. Kumar, it wasn't alone.   

 Before Mr. Kumar had started explaining his company's troubles and analysts could finish warning that Computer Associates' woes could spell trouble for other players, BMC Software Inc. chimed in with an earnings warning and its stock fell about 40%, $14.1875, to $21.3125, losing $3.2 billion in market capitalization.   

 Early Wednesday, BMC echoed its larger rival. It blamed a weak mainframe market and a delay in large deals getting done. BMC warned earnings would be 18 cents to 21 cents a share, below views of 46 cents. It, too, projected about a 25% revenue miss.   

 Analysts said they were concerned because the weak demand in the mainframe market -- which they say is caused in part by indecision by corporate customers that are waiting for IBM's new mainframe product cycle -- is unlikely to improve any time soon. IBM's new G7 line of mainframes is expected to be out either late in the third quarter or early in the calendar fourth quarter.   

 "Both of these companies (Computer Associates and BMC) really have their backs against the wall for the next couple of quarters," said Mr. Klein.   

 Added Merrill's Mr. Shilakes: "The mainframe weakness will persist into the fall and possibly the December quarter" when IBM's new products move into full swing.   

 "We're not expecting a one-quarter phenomenon from CA or BMC, given the magnitude of the misses and the uncertainty of the outlooks from both management teams," he said. "They were fairly guarded for the September and December quarters. Going forward, I don't think anyone has the answers at this stage as to what's going on in the sector."

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, the No. 3 software maker nearly cut in half after a sorry story on profits. What went wrong at Computer Associates (URL: http://www.cai.com) ? 

 That warning and a few other profit scares sap the strength of tech stocks and send the Nasdaq to its worst showing in six weeks. 

 And oil prices take a sharp dive on Saudi Arabia`s plans to pump up the volume, but will the rest of OPEC go along for the ride? 

 Plus, CBS once again sticks real people together to produce drama on the set. Will it change the balance of power in the war over broadcast ratings? 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening. Stuart is off tonight. 

 The July 4th holiday ended with some major fireworks on Wall Street as another round of tech profit warnings sent investors running for  cover. Computer Associates led the pack, but it certainly wasn`t the only company to raise the red flag today. Other software makers weighed in with their own predictions for second-quarter disappointments. 

 The reaction on Wall Street: fast and furious. Shares of Computer Associates hammered, the stock tumbled more than 42 percent, losing nearly $13 billion in market cap. 

 Steve Young now on the latest profit fears to plague Wall Street. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Computer Associates warned Wall Street about three weeks ago that its European sales were weak. But the Street still expected the company would report earnings of 55 cents a share for the quarter ending in June. Then the company sounded an earnings alarm two minutes before midnight Monday with analysts gone for the holiday. 

 PAUL RODRIGUEZ, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: I don`t believe it was sneaky. I think, you know, once they -- it takes a certain amount of time to tabulate  results, and once they do that, they try to get it out as quickly as possible. 

 YOUNG: Still, Wall Street was stunned when Computer Associates said today that earnings would plunge to just 11 to 16 cents, and the stock suffered a one-day crash, falling 21 1/2 to 29 1/2. 

 CA cited three reasons for its earnings shortfall: that weakness in Europe; failure to close numerous $10-50 million deals before the quarter closed, and a purchase slowdown by customers using IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) system 390 mainframe computers. 

 That took nearly six points out of "Big Blue," even though IBM analysts believe IBM`s mainframe business is OK. 

 After the CA earnings warning, another software developer, BMC (URL: http://www.bmc.com/) , which  also makes applications that run on IBM mainframes, issued its own earnings warning, and that stock was clobbered too. 

 JIM MENDELSON, WIT SOUNDVIEW: They`re still heavily oriented to the IBM mainframe, and they`re a lot of questions about how relevant they are to this boom in e-business that we`ve been seeing. And these results only underscore that issue more dramatically. 

 YOUNG: While analysts said they weren`t surprised by the disappointing news from CA, they acted as if they were. Analysts from Prudential, Bank of America (URL: http://www.bankamerica.com/) and Dain Rauscher Wessels downgraded CA, BMC or both. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: One analyst, who didn`t want to be identified, told me, "It`s embarrassing if you drop your earnings forecast, and the company manages to hit the original target. Better for the company to be blamed than the analysts" -- Willow. 

 BAY: Steve, still, wouldn`t it have been better for analysts to have warned investors more effectively, let`s say, than they did?. 

 YOUNG: I think that you could make a good argument for that. They claim they weren`t blindsided. They should have gotten word out. 

 BAY: Steve Young, thanks. 

 The profit warnings from those software companies took their toll on other tech issues today. The Nasdaq composite posted its worst drop in six weeks, since May 23rd. Back then, the composite index dropped nearly 200 points, hitting its low of the year at 3,164. Since that time, the Nasdaq has rebounded, but today it took a step backwards, losing 128 points, a loss of more than 3 percent, to close at 3,863. 

 Checking some of the big tech losers today: Entrust Technologies (URL: http://www.entrust.com/) plummeted 40 1/2 after the software maker announced its own second-quarter profit warning. Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) down nearly eight on today`s software woes. It fell nearly $4 on Monday after its president resigned. Other tech losers: Applied Materials (URL: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/) , Akamai Technologies (URL: http://www.akamai.com/) and JDS Uniphase (URL: http://www.jdsunph.com/) . 

 The Dow industrials also lower today. The selling accelerated in the final hour of trading to close down 77 points to 10,483. 

 A big drag on the big board today, chip stocks. Rhonda Schaffler has been following the action all day, and she joins us now live from the New York Stock Exchange with more -- Rhonda. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Willow, chip stocks tumbled after Salomon Smith Barney downgraded the entire semiconductor sector to neutral from outperform. The firm warned of a slowdown in growth ahead, citing chip price declines and rising inventories as two warning signs. 

 Within the group, Salomon downgraded rating and price targets for four specific stocks. The ratings for Advanced Micro (URL: http://www.amd.com/) , National Semiconductor (URL: http://www.national.com/) and Texas Instruments (URL: http://www.ti.com/) were cut to outperform from buy. Salomon cuts its rating on Silicon Storage Technology (URL: http://www.ssti.com/) to neutral from buy. All of those stocks got pounded today, as did chip industry bellwether Intel. 

 Salomon did not cut earnings estimates on these companies. And in fact today, PaineWebber (URL: http://www.painewebber.com/) raised its earning outlook for Intel. 

 But the Salomon downgrade today only added to the pre-earning season angst that`s troubling traders. The Computer Associates shocker is just another company being added to a growing list of corporations that have warned. Goodyear (URL: http://www.goodyear.com/) , First Union (URL: http://www.firstunion.com/) and Unisys (URL: http://www.unisys.com/) among those who`ve recently said profits won`t be as rosy as first expected. Stocks of all these companies are trading near their 52-week lows. 

 But earnings watchers say these are the exceptions. According to earnings tracking firm FirstCall, profits for the quarter should rise about 19 percent -- Willow. 

 BAY: OK, Rhonda Schaffler, at the big board, thank you. 

 Those chip stocks that Rhonda just mentioned were also behind the Nasdaq`s losses today. The Philadelphia semiconductor index plummeted more than 9 percent. 

 John Metaxas has more on today`s Nasdaq nosedive from the Nasdaq marketsite -- John. 

 JOHN METAXAS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Willow, definitely a tech wreck when you have the software stocks and the semiconductor stocks both sharply declining: the Nasdaq down 128 points, a loss of 3 percent on the day. But the volume was a little bit on the light side, 1.3 billion shares changing hands. 

 The Nasdaq, however, never in positive territory, down throughout the day, and the selling only intensified as we moved toward the close. Semiconductors on that Salomon Smith Barney downgrade, the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down some 9 percent. Intel, not specifically downgraded, but that stock is a leader, of course, down some 3.8 percent on the day. 

 I want to show you a chart of the Philadelphia semiconductor index, which is in red versus the Nasdaq in yellow, because some of the analysts were saying that the semiconductor stocks had gotten very extended. From the October lows to the March highs, the Philadelphia semiconductor index was up 160 percent, dwarfing the Nasdaq`s 80 percent gain. And even with the pullback, the semiconductors stocks were sharply ahead of the Nasdaq. 

 Some say this volatile period that we`ve seen over the last four months may continue for the semiconductors, though Prudential disagreed today with Salomon. Prudential remains bullish, and they say that the drop in the semiconductors is a buying opportunity. 

 The computer sector, which includes the software stocks, was down 4 percent today. Entrust Technologies, the biggest loser, down 52 percent. 

 But not all the sectors were down today. There was one major exception: The biotechs were up 4 percent today on the Nasdaq: a number of stocks with specific news. But in general, most of the stocks doing very well. 

 Immunex  (URL: http://www.immunex.com/) up 5.8 percent. They`ve got a deal with UroCor (URL: http://www.urocor.com/) to license rights to UroCor`s proteins. These proteins are used to fight prostate cancer. 

 But a negative session. Decliners ahead of advancers by a 3-2 margin here at the Nasdaq. 

 Back to you. 

 BAY: John Metaxas at the Nasdaq markestie, thanks. 

 IBM, a huge tech loser today and the biggest drag on the Dow. Big Blue continuing a slide that actually began last week. The concern today: Second-quarter weakness at Computer Associates and other software firms could reflect similar problems at IBM. 

 Terry Keenan takes a look "Behind the Numbers" at a Big Blue backlash. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Willow, normally sales problems at software makers such as Computer Associates wouldn`t produce much collateral damage, but as today`s trading shows, Wall Street is becoming increasingly nervous about Big Blue`s second- quarter numbers, due out on July 19th. 

 The problem started to escalate in April when IBM shocked the Street with a 5 percent drop in sales. Then last week, a number of analysts began cutting revenue figures for the quarter just ended. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter now says it expects sales to be flat. Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) says second-quarter results will be mediocre and puts sales growth at 1 percent at best. 

 Now, here comes Computer Associates with its earnings bombshell and a finger pointed squarely at what it says is weakness in IBM`s mainframe business. 

 VINCE FARRELL, SPEARS, BENZAK, SALOMON & FARRELL: We sold two- thirds of our IBM position last week not because we had a specific worry about what exactly was going to happen, but just that it`s a slower-growth company in the tech sector and all around it bombs are going off in their businesses. 

 So I think that even though IBM might report an OK number, it`s going to be caught up in the malaise of what`s going on with tech land. 

 KEENAN: When we called IBM today, it would not comment on its mainframe business in the recent quarter, but there seems to be little doubt that like Computer Associates, Big Blue is also facing a weak business environment in Europe. 

 Merrill Lynch`s Steve Mulonivich (ph) cited the weak euro as one of the reasons he sharply reduced his revenue numbers. 

 As for profits, Big Blue is expected to earn a dollar a share in the second quarter: on mark with Wall Street estimates. But come July 19th look for increased scrutiny of just how Big Blue gets to those results. 

 Since 1995, IBM has spent more than $32 billion buying back its own stock, a move expert numbers cruncher Jim Grant says lifted earnings from continuing operations 17 percent above where they would have been without all the financial engineering. IBM recently authorized another buyback, so it has plenty of ammunition to juice earnings per share going forward. But with Wall Street increasingly on to the maneuver, real and sustainable sales revenue growth is going to become even more important -- Willow. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Thanks, Terry. 

 And still to come on MONEYLINE, oil prices sink on word Saudi Arabia is set to boost output. But will it be enough to relieve pressure at the pump? 

 Plus, Germany`s biggest telecom company making headlines from Wall Street to Washington. A look at what Deutsche Telekom (URL: http://www.dtag.de/) could be eyeing now. 

 And the downfall of yet another dot-com. APBNews.com files for bankruptcy protection. 

 The details and more, when MONEYLINE returns. 

 ANNOUNCER: From CNN`s New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Oil traders had their first chance today to react to Saudi Arabia`s announcement from Monday that it plans to raise crude oil output. 

 Fred Katayama was there. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sell orders ruled the oil  pits on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil futures plummeted more than $1.80 in the first trading session following Saudi Arabia`s announcement that it would boost production to slash oil prices. 

 SCOTT HESS, G&H COMMODITIES: Basically, on Friday we were looking for possibly higher prices, maybe even getting into the mid- 30s. And then this surprise announcement over the weekend, the traders are basically mindful of what OPEC says and invariably ends up doing. 

 KATAYAMA: Details are fuzzy. Reports now say the United Arab Emirates and Iran will likely join the Saudis to boost oil production by an additional 500,000 barrels a day. But neither the OPEC group nor any member nation has publicly pronounced it. And an OPEC source says Kuwait has not been contacted by Saudi Arabia. 

 WILLIAM RANDOL, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: We think rather than actually putting more physical barrels on the market, other than cheating, really what the Saudis are trying to do is talk down the price. 

 KATAYAMA: The Saudi announcement came a little more than a week after OPEC had agreed for the second time this spring to boost output, first by 1.7 million barrels, then again by 708,000. Both moves failed to contain the price spike. 

 The latest Saudi move, if it comes, will not do much to lower gas prices this summer, since it can take months for the new stocks to reach U.S. ports. But it could still come in time to put downward pressure on home heating oil prices, which rose 10 percent last month. 

 (on camera): Back at the pits, traders believe the latest decision to boost output will likely lower oil to $28 a barrel over the next few months. Demand, they say, is too strong to push prices much lower. 

 Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Oil prices fell sharply today. Light sweet crude lost $1.83 a barrel. The fall in oil prices pulled oil stocks lower. BP Amoco (URL: http://www.bpamoco.com/) dropped nearly 4 1/2. Chevron (URL: http://www.chevron.com/) fell more than 3 1/2. ExxonMobil (URL: http://www.exxon.mobil.com/)  and Texaco (URL: http://www.texaco.com/) both down more than two. And Royal Dutch Petroleum lost more than 1 1/2. 

 Checking tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers," Immunex gained more than three on news that it bought the licensing rights to UroCor`s cancer proteins, which  it will use to develop prostate cancer treatments. 

 Datastream Systems (URL: http://www.dstm.com/) lost 2 3/4, or 24 percent. The software maker warned it will report a second quarter loss of 25 to 30 cents a share. Analysts were looking for a nine cent loss. 

 And SanDisk (URL: http://www.sandisk.com/) fell more than five after announcing its $75 million investment in Israeli chip maker, Tower Semiconductor. Under the agreement, SanDisk will own 10 percent of Tower and will have representation on the company`s board. Since hitting a high of $169 earlier this year, SanDisk stock has fallen 69 percent. 

 Despite today`s handful of profit warnings and the markets` downturn, our next guest remains very positive about the coming earnings season. 

 Joining me now is Patricia Chadwick, president of Ravengate Partners. 

 Patricia, welcome back. 

 PATRICIA CHADWICK, RAVENGATE PARTNERS: Thank you. 

 BAY: You`re very positive. The market today, however, was not. Let`s talk about some of the news today. First of all, the warnings from the software companies. Are you not concerned that that`s sign of more to come? 

 CHADWICK: Well, I actually don`t think it`s a sign of a lot more to come. Very frankly, if you look at the companies that have preannounced with  negative news, they`re companies that have done some of that in the past. These are not the fastest growing, most dynamic parts of the market that are talking about negative news. 

 BAY: Do you think that the market overreacted in terms of IBM, pulling that stock down as well based on concerns about mainframes? 

 CHADWICK: Well, there may be some slow down in the short run, and there`s been a lot of talk about some excess inventory building in a variety of areas, be it semiconductors that maybe PCs are backing up, et 

 cetera, et cetera. So there may be a very short term back up here, which, in a highly volatile market and with, you know, stocks selling fairly high, is going to hit stocks. But I don`t think it says anything negative about the outlook for the next year, two years or three years. 

 BAY: So but perhaps a negative outlook for this particular quarter or at least a little more negative. 

 CHADWICK: For some sectors, perhaps. 

 BAY: And the upshot for the rest of the year? 

 CHADWICK: I think the upshot for the rest of the year for earnings in general, as well as for technology companies, is very good. And, in fact, I think most technology companies will do very well in the second quarter. 

 BAY: Now we`ve been hearing a lot of positive comments about the health care sector. It`s done well so far this year. But I understand that you`re a bit concerned, nervous about that sector. Why? 

 CHADWICK: Well, I`ve been nervous about it for really about 18 months or so. And it really has to do with the political environment. As you heard, you know, Vice President Gore has been really slamming the drug companies, talking about price gouging, et cetera, et cetera. And I think any time there`s a risk that the government starts to get involved in the mechanisms or the economics of an industry, I find that very troubling. 

 I don`t think it will necessarily happen. I`m sure it won`t happen  in the legislature this year because we`re too close to the election. But for a candidate to be out there bashing the industry says something about what his attitude towards that industry is. 

 BAY: Patricia Chadwick, thanks for joining us tonight on MONEYLINE. 

 CHADWICK: Thank you. 

 BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, Washington shatters a Cold War symbol on the Great Plains. 

 We`ll tell you about that in our "News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: The White House today calling a crucial summit meeting on peace in the Middle East. More on that from Wolf Blitzer in the "MONEYLINE News Digest -- Wolf. 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNNfn ANCHOR: Thanks, Willow. 

 President Clinton today announced the leaders of Israel and the Palestinian authority have accepted his invitation to a summit beginning next week. After nearly seven years of negotiations, the two sides are still deadlocked on a peace deal. Mr. Clinton wants a breakthrough by the September 13 deadline agreed to by both the Israelis and the Palestinians. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The negotiators have reached an impasse. Movement now depends on historic decisions that only the two leaders can make. I will be there with them, and I intend to  do all I can to help them in this endeavor. But to delay this gathering, to remain stalled, is simply no longer an option. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BLITZER: Two parties in Israel`s fragile coalition government are threatening to quit over the summit. It`s set to begin on Tuesday at Camp David in Maryland. 

 Also today, a relic of the Cold War destroyed on the plains of North Dakota. The U.S. Air Force blew up one of 150 Minuteman-3 nuclear missile silos being dismantled under the START II treaty with Russia. 

 And in Los Angeles, the host committee for next month`s Democratic National Convention says it will refuse donations from tobacco companies. The Republicans, who have no such ban, are dismissing the announcement as pure politics. 

 Finally, the hottest sister act in U.S. Tennis will face off at Wimbledon. Venus and Serena Williams will meet tomorrow for the Grand Slam semifinal on the grass courts of the All-England club. 

 Those are the top stories we have right now. I`ll have much more ahead on "THE WORLD TODAY." Join me at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 on the West Coast -- Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Wolf. See you then. 

 In tonight`s "Tech Watch," an unusual bid for life by a dot-com in critical condition. APBNews.com today filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11. A company spokesman says APB has $7 million in debt and has already burned through $27 million from investors. By filing for protection from creditors, the award-winning crime news site hopes to stay alive long enough to raise the $15 million it needs. Early last month, APB news ran out of cash and laid off its employees. Some stayed on out of loyalty, even after the paychecks stopped coming. Two weeks later, the company found enough money to hire back a small staff. 

 Still ahead on MONEYLINE, CBS launches "Big Brother" tonight, its new reality show. As we watch people try to live together under the watchful eye of a TV camera, are we also watching a seismic shift in network television programming? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: As you might imagine, several stocks hit 52-week lows today, including BMC Software, Computer Associates, Crayfish, Kmart (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) and Unisys. 

 Word today that 33 "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" books are on the loose ahead of Saturday`s 12:01 a.m. release date. The latest slip up at a Wal*Mart (URL: http://www.wal-mart.com/) store in New Jersey happened on Friday when two books were sold. Wal-Mart says the books were mistakenly put on the floor. 

 Last week, another 31 books were sold off a display at a Wal-Mart in Richmond, Virginia. An unprecedented 5.3 million copies of the book will be released in the U.S. and Britain this weekend. Advanced orders of the book have already pushed it to the No. 1 slot on Amazon.com`s (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) best-seller list. 

 Still to come on MONEYLINE, a profit warning from Computer Associates triggers a tech tumble. What lies ahead? We`ll talk to the senior software analyst at SG Cowen, who saw signs of trouble a few weeks before the company`s bombshell. 

 Plus, Deutsche Telekom steals the headlines, but will the German telecom giant ever make a play for a U.S. firm? We`ll take a look. 

 And second half hopes: Investors focus their attention on the rest  of 2000 after a troubling first half. 

 That`s when MONEYLINE RETURNS. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, Computer Associates leads a string of software disappointments. Three companies raise the red flag and investors raise a ruckus. 

 The tech tumble didn`t end there. Chip stocks caught in the downdraft after Salomon Smith Barney says it sees signs of a slowdown. 

 Plus, the latest reality TV shows hits CBS tonight, but will it be enough to lure viewers back to the network for good? 

 But first, more on tonight`s top story, tech stocks take a turn for the worst. As the markets got back to business after the July 4th holiday, Wall Street was rocked by a barrage of earnings warning. The Nasdaq fell 128, or more than 3 percent, its worst showing in six weeks, as Wall Street bet that we haven`t seen the end of profit scares. 

 The Dow also slumped 77 points to 10483, hit by poor showings in some high-tech heavyweights. 

 Allan Chernoff has more on the day. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Technology tremors are shaking the stock market. Sectors that analysts had argued were virtually immune to an economic slowdown now appear terribly vulnerable. 

 Software stocks melted, as three firms confessed earnings would be nowhere near expectations. Computer Associates and BMC software, makers of programs that run corporate computer systems, and Entrust Technology, a Web security firm. 

 CLARK YINGST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: There does appear to be a weakness in the software business throughout the mainframe universe. 

 CHERNOFF: Investors bailed out of other software names. Oracle, the shining star this year, suffering its second straight sell-off after Monday`s announcement that the company`s president would be leaving. 

 No technology sector was spared. 

 DOUG CLIGGOTT, J.P. MORGAN: We think technology is likely to underperform the broader market over the next six to 12 months. And part of the reason will be earnings disappointment. 

 CHERNOFF: Chip companies and semiconductor equipment makers were short-circuited, as Salomon Smith Barney argued the semiconductor cycle is showing signs of peaking, slowing shipments and scattered price declines. 

 But the firm`s semiconductor analyst confirmed to MONEYLINE he could be wrong. 

 CLARK WESTMONT, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: It`s controversial call, to be sure. I think that the problem, of course, you have is by the evidence -- by the time the evidence is fully in hand, of course the stocks will have fully incorporated that information by that point. So you have to go out on a limb a bit at this point, and that`s what we`re choosing to do. 

 CHERNOFF: Also taking a hard fall, oil stocks. The price of crude tumbled $1.83 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange on Saudi Arabia`s pledge to boost oil production. Lower oil prices could mean lower profits for oil marketing and drilling firms. The beneficiaries: major users of fuel, like airlines. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: It`s a dramatic reversal for big winners of the first half. Semiconductor stocks had been up 60 percent as measured by the Philadelphia semiconductor index. Oh, how quickly the beloved can fall out of favor -- Willow. 

 BAY: That is for sure. But this semiconductor downgrade was somewhat controversial, wasn`t it? 

 CHERNOFF: Look at what he just said. He`s really taking a guess here. Wall Street tries to be ahead of the curve. Sometimes they`re right, and sometimes they are wrong. 

 BAY: Wall Street is not in the mood for any bad news these days. 

 CHERNOFF: That`s right, and... 

 BAY: Or even bad questions. 

 CHERNOFF: And really, the way the market responded shows you that. Because if you look at the report, they`re saying, we see the signs, the beginning of the signs, of the end of the peak of that cycle. And this is how the market responded, a complete sell-off. 

 BAY: Allan Chernoff, thanks. 

 Checking some of today`s other market movers on the Big Board, IBM lost nearly six, Hewlett-Packard off 4 3/4, ExxonMobil slipped more than  2 1/2, Corning slumped 19. 

 But on the up side, 3M jumped almost 4 1/2. 

 Over on the Nasdaq, Oracle sank nearly eight, Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) down 2 3/4, JDS Uniphase lost nearly 9 1/4, Yahoo! off more than 7. 

 But Amgen (URL: http://www.amgen.com/) bucked the trend to jump more than 5 1/4. 

 Turning to the broader market, the D&P 500 dropped 23 points to close at 1446. Advancers beat out decliners by a narrow margin. Sixty-eight stocks hit new highs, while 21 fell to new lows. 

 The catalyst for much of today`s sell-off: that profit warning from Computer Associates. The confession came at an odd hour, just before midnight on Monday. The company said its earnings would come out only one-fifth of expectations, posting profits of 11 to 16 cents a share, well off forecasts for 55 cents a share. The stock sank 21 1/2, or 42 percent, on the news. The trouble started a few weeks ago, when some analysts emerged from a meeting with the company with a measured perspective on the company`s prospects. 

 SG Cowen issued a statement on June 13. Quote, "The current quarter sounds like it may be a little tight. To be clear, management made no specific comments to that effect." 

 Well, after that meeting the stock dropped more than $9. So what, if anything, did the company signal at that meeting? 

 We`re now joined by the author of that SG Cowan report, Drew Brosseau. 

 Drew, welcome. 

 DREW BROSSEAU, SG COWEN: Hi, thanks. 

 BAY: So after those comments of yours, is it fair to say you saw signs of trouble? 

 BROSSEAU: Well, usually when you`re with a company in a meeting and they`re feeling good about business, they usually tell you. You hear things like, business is great, the quarter`s going well. We didn`t hear that from Computer Associates, and that tone and body language gave me the sense that things might be a little tighter than usual. 

 You couple that with the fact that they had just completed an acquisition and had realigned their sales organization, and it added some risk to what is always a tough quarter for the company. 

 BAY: So you did see some signs of trouble. Now one of the things that -- one of the other things you mentioned in your notes, that after that meeting you noted, "Poor mainframe shipments and sluggish growth in Europe have dampened growth and may keep a lid on the stock in the short run." 

 Well, in fact, that`s exactly what happened. The company cited weakness in the mainframe business and weakness in international sales. In hindsight, did you do an effective job of alerting investors to these potential problems? 

 BROSSEAU: Well, the risks are always there. We obviously weren`t as aggressive as perhaps we should have been in warning that business could have been worse. But these companies are very tough to predict. They close a lot of business in the last couple of days. And at that point, it was impossible for anyone to know, including frankly, management, as to whether they would make the quarter, have a good quarter or have a quarter as bad as it turned out to be. 

 BAY: But what about the size of the shortfall? And expected 55 cents, now they may post earnings of 11 cents. Does a gap that large emerge in two weeks? 

 BROSSEAU: Believe it or not, it can. These companies often close as much as 60 percent of their revenues in the last month of the quarter and as much as 30 percent in the last week. So it is a very difficult business model to manage, and, of course, their costs are fixed. So if they miss at the top line, it all falls to the bottom line. 

 It works the other way as well, which is why these companies also have tremendous quarters sometimes when business is going better than expected. 

 BAY: Now you kept a buy rating on the stock despite your concerns after that June 13 call. Will you change your rating? 

 BROSSEAU: Well, it`s a little early to say. I`m still finalizing our new model and having additional discussions with the management team. 

 I will say that as you look at the company you have to keep in mind two things. One, the stock is a lot lower today than it was yesterday. And, two, you have to think about your time frame. If you`re thinking short term, you`re probably not going to make much money, and you might want to move on. 

 BAY: What does that mean you think will happen to the stock from here? Short term it`s not going to go anywhere? Might things get worse? 

 BROSSEAU: No, I think it will probably trade sideways for a while. The stock has actually gone back to its lows of the past five years, so it`s a very cheap stock at this point and unlikely to go down much more. However, it`s not likely to move up much either in the very short-term. 

 BAY: Drew Brosseau, SG Cowen, thanks for joining us tonight. 

 BROSSEAU: You`re welcome. 

 BAY: Coming up, a German phone giant goes shopping for a U.S. partner. We`ll check out which firm may be the target of Deutsche Telekom`s grand ambitions. 

 The details, when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) is fighting tonight to save its deal with Telewest Communications (URL: http://www.telewest.co.uk/) . Today, it told MONEYLINE it`s negotiating with the European Commission. Microsoft is planning to buy MediaOne`s (URL: http://www.mediaonegroup.com/) near 30 percent stake in the British cable operator for $3 billion. The deal would give Microsoft joint control of Telewest with Liberty Media (URL: http://www.libertymedia.com/) . 

 But the European Commission has expressed concern about the deal. It must rule by August 4th. 

 Shares of Microsoft lost 1 1/2 today. 

 One deal that is now widely expected to fall through: the $115 billion merger of Sprint and WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) . A source tells CNNfn that an announcement could come in a few days. The deal was all but dead after the Justice Department sued to block the merger last week. If those two disconnect, it would clear the line for Deutsche Telekom, which is aggressively looking to enter the U.S. market. 

 Greg Clarkin has more on the ambitions of a German giant. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He has a Ph.D. in mathematics and was a high-ranking executive for Sony. But now Ron Sommer`s facing one of his toughest challenges: how to get Germany`s biggest telecom company into the U.S. 

 Sommer`s chairman of Deutsche Telekom, and as the WorldCom-Sprint deal unravels, DT is widely seen to be waiting in the wings. 

 ANTHONY FERRUGIA, A.G. EDWARDS: We think Sprint is probably the most likely choice for Deutsche Telekom. They don`t have European backbone assets. They divested themselves on the Global One asset that they had. They have a brand name in the U.S. They have a very extensive, one of the best -- arguably the best -- wireless footprint here in the U.S. 

 CLARKIN: Analysts say Deutsche Telekom is loaded and eager to buy. It just raised $14 1/2 billion selling corporate bonds, adding to an estimated war chest of more than $100 billion. And Sommer has made it clear he wants a piece of the U.S. market, recently boasting that there is no American company out of his reach. 

 But before he makes inroads in the U.S., he`ll need to make friends in Washington. 

 JAMES LINNEHAN, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS: I think the Germans are a little 

 spooked by the U.S. market right now. They understand that their market is fairly closed. The German government owns -- is a majority shareholder in Deutsche Telekom, and the U.S. has already issued, you know, sort of a warning shot that any deal by the Germans in the U.S. would be very closely scrutinized. 

 CLARKIN: That warning shot came from 30 U.S. senators who on Monday expressed concern over a possible buyout of Sprint by Deutsche Telekom, which is 59 percent owned by the German government. DT shares are up better than 150 percent since going public in 1996, but the stock has been under pressure recently. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And that could change with a big U.S. deal, such as Deutsche Telekom buying the 90 percent of Sprint it doesn`t already own. Another option to gain a presence in the U.S. would be a bid for  Qwest. Or a deal could come from overseas, where there`s speculation DT is interested in Britain`s Cable & Wireless -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg, we know they have money, we know that have interest. Do we know if they have talked to anyone yet? 

 CLARKIN: At this point there is nothing official from any of the parties, but folks are saying that they believe that Deutsche Telekom is very interested in Qwest. They were interest in Qwest actually back in the spring. That didn`t come about. And also there is some -- some talk that they definitely are interested in Sprint if -- if and when that deal falls apart. 

 BAY: Interested meaning they have some sort of contact. 

 CLARKIN: Some sort of overture 

 BAY: Now, given all the complications of buying a U.S. company, doesn`t a European deal make more sense? 

 CLARKIN: It does, but at some point, analysts say if Deutsche Telekom wants  to be the global player that they proclaim they want to be, then they`re going to have to get into the U.S. in some way, shape or form. 

 BAY: So stay tuned. 

 CLARKIN: Exactly. 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin, thank you. 

 CLARKIN: Sure. 

 BAY: Taking a look at how those stocks fared today: In New York trading, Deutsche Telekom lost nearly two. Sprint fell almost one, but Qwest jumped 6 1/4. It was the most actively traded stock on the big board. It`s being added to the S&P 500 index tonight after closing its deal with US West. Cable & Wireless rose more than three. And WorldCom added nearly a half on the day. 

 In other corporate news, GlaxoWellcome is taking more time to develop a breakthrough diabetes drug. The company has agreed with the Food and Drug Administration to conduct two more years of clinical trials on the drug. 

 Separately, Glaxo Wellcome (URL: http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk) and SmithKline Beecham (URL: http://www.sb.com/) say they expect to complete their merger next month. 

 After the closing bell today, Goldman Sachs (URL: http://www.gs.com/) filed to sell another 40 million shares of its stock. The company says the secondary offering is aimed at broadening its investor base. News of the added supply could weigh on Goldman`s stock tomorrow. 

 Today, shares of Goldman Sachs picked up one, GlaxoWellcome`s stock fell almost two. 

 Still to come, forecasting the second half of the year: Will stocks turn around the lackluster performance of the first six months in 2000? We will take a look when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Other stocks making moves today. BP Amoco fell almost 4 1/2 after Merrill Lynch lowered its near-term rating to neutral. The brokerage said smaller integrated oil companies present a better opportunity for price appreciation. 

 Cell Pathways gained more than 1 1/4. The biotech company bought the U.S. marketing rights for Nilandron, a treatment for prostate cancer from Aventis Pharmaceuticals (URL: http://www.aventis.com/) . 

 And Converse Technology lost more than eight. The No. 1 maker of voicemail systems said today it will buy privately held software maker Exalink for $480 million in stock. 

 It has been a rocky ride for Converse (URL: http://www.converse.com/) investors so far this year. The stock has fallen 33 percent from its height of $133. 

 Today marked the first full trading day of the third quarter and the action gave little indication that the second half of 2000 would be any better than the first. 

 In tonight`s MONEYLINE "Focus," Peter Viles has the outlook for stocks for the remainder of the year. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The second half of the year started off the same way the first half played out. One step forward and then a bigger step back. 

 Today`s villain was a negative earnings warning, but analysts believe the second quarter will, for the most part, show solid earnings growth. 

 CHUCK HILL, FIRST CALL/THOMPSON FINANCIAL: As far as earnings to, the picture is extremely good for technology. The semis are expected to be up over 100 percent over last year`s second-quarter earnings. 

 VILES: The bigger question is whether profit growth will hold up later in the year and how investors will react if analysts cut future earnings forecasts. 

 LARRY WATCHTEL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) should be comparing  a very buoyant period in terms of earnings with a slackening period. I think that will be a cause of some concern. So it won`t be rates so much anymore as it is the course of earnings as the comparisons run through. 

 VILES: Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs expects a slowdown in earnings growth, but is sticking with her bullish forecast for the second half. Her year-end target for the S&P 500 is the 1,575, a gain of 8.9 percent from current levels. She says profit growth will decelerate but will be viewed as sustainable and long-lasting. 

 Sectors she likes: financial services, banks, insurance companies, and energy stocks. 

 Another prominent bull, Tom Galvin of DLJ (URL: http://www.dlj.com) , sees 15 percent upside for the S&P 500 and 25 percent for the Nasdaq. His favorite sectors: enterprise software, data storage, drugs, medical instruments, and biotech. 

 Wachtel sees a stock picker`s market where major indexes won`t tell the story. 

 WACHTEL: The market is not the Dow, it`s not the Nasdaq, which is led by 10 or 12 stocks. It`s all those 7,000 stocks swirling around. 

 If you`re smart enough to catch the proper group and the proper stocks in that group, you`re a winner, no matter what the averages are doing. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: One wildcard in the second half is the presidential election, which  typically dominates headlines from Labor Day to election day. Election years are usually good years for the stock market, with the strongest gains typically coming in the second half of an election year -- Willow. 

 BAY: Pete, a lot of "usually`s" in there, but how is the presidential election shaping up for the market? 

 VILES: Well, one thing different this year than, say, eight years ago, 12 years ago, investors are a bigger and more powerful group. It`s inconceivable that either of these candidates would deliberately say something the markets did not want to hear. So, that`s different. 

 BAY: Peter Viles, thanks. When MONEYLINE continues, CBS has its eye on the ratings with the launch of a new reality-based program. Will "Big Brother" give the network a big win? That story after the break. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Tonight marks the debut on CBS of another so-called "reality TV" show. This one is called "Big Brother." 

 Already the success of the reality-based format is changing the economics of network television. That format has helped stem the decline of network viewers in the second quarter. 

 Casey Wian has the story from Los Angeles. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CASEY WIAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Five men and five women spent their 4th of July moving into this house on a CBS television lot in Los Angeles. Three months from now, one will be left and take home half-a-million dollars. In between, five nights a week on television and around the clock on the Internet, the public will watch and hear their every move thanks to 28 cameras and five dozen microphones. 

 CBS hopes "Big Brother" will become the successor to its other reality TV hit, "Survivor." That show has become No. 1 in the ratings and helped CBS attract younger viewers, easily justifying the reported $20 million CBS paid "Survivor`s" Dutch creators for rights to the show. 

 MARK SCHWED, TV GUIDE: To the network, it`s lower-cost. It costs them a lot less money to make a reality show than it does to make a sitcom or a drama. To the viewer, how many more silly sitcoms do we need to see? I mean, we`ve seen everything 100 times over already. 

 WIAN: The latest wave of nontraditional network programming began with ABC`s wildly successfully "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" Fox has aired a handful of reality specials, including the notorious "Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" 

 Together, the shows have helped network television hold on to some of the audience it`s been losing to cable. 

 MICHAEL SCHNEIDER, "VARIETY": I think especially for the summertime, when the networks really start to bleed viewers, this has helped stop that erosion. I think long term it`s still tough to say. The networks still just got off not quite their lowest-rated season ever, but their second-lowest ever. 

 WIAN: In fact, the big four networks household share has slipped  2 percent to 52 percent so far this year. In the latest week, when seven of the top 10 shows were either "Survivor" or "Millionaire," the network share was just 44 percent. 

 While reality shows may not be a panacea, they have made enough of an impact that General Electric Chairman Jack Welch last week reportedly dressed down NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa for missing the reality show boat. 

 (on camera): Those reports prompted Sassa to send an e-mail to NBC employees reassuring them his job is not in jeopardy. NBC is counting on the Olympics for its summer ratings boost.

ABC`s parent company, Disney (URL: http://www.disney.com/) , lost a half. General Electric (URL: http://www.ge.com/) , which owns NBC, gave back one and change. Fox Entertainment, up more than three-quarters. And Time Warner (URL: http://www.timewarner.com/) , parent company of CNN, added 1 3/4.

 BAY: Checking on what could move the markets tomorrow: On the economic front, look for the May factory orders report. Economists are expecting a rise of 3.4 percent, up from last month`s drop of more than 4 percent. 

 One economist we spoke with says this number is just a small piece of the inflation puzzle. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 TIM O`NEILL, HARRIS BANK/BANK OF MONTREAL: Well, I think the numbers tomorrow don`t really tell us whether the tightening was enough by themselves. I`d take it in conjunction with other numbers. I think it`s very unclear whether the tightening was enough from the Fed`s point of view. From my point of view, given what we`re forecasting, I don`t think it`s nearly enough.

 RESEARCH ALERT-Goldman Sachs downgrades Entrust.

 (All figures in U.S. dollars unless noted) 

 NEW YORK, July 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Anne Meisner downgraded Entrust Technologies Inc. to market outperformer and removed it from its U.S. recommended list on Wednesday after the security software developer warned of a significant second-quarter profit shortfall. 

 Goldman Sachs, which had expected a second-quarter profit of 7 cents per share and sales of $32.8 million, said in its report that the warning "is quite surprising given the recent tone of business which appeared strong". 

 Plano, Texas-based Entrust said on Wednesday morning that it expects to post second-quarter earnings of 2 cents a share versus the consensus estimate of 8 cents a share carried by First Call/Thomson Financial when it reports its results on July 18. Entrust also said it expects revenues slightly above last quarter's sales of $29.1 million. 

 "We believe the shortfall was likely caused by a few deals that didn't close at the end of the quarter," the report said. 

 "We continue to believe that Entrust has established a leading position in an important segment of the Internet security market, however, given the pre-announcement we would expect to see significant weakness in the stock today, and we would be cautious on the stock at least until the issues in the quarter are better understood." 

 Entrust shares plunged nearly 51 percent on Wednesday, losing 39 to 38-1/8 on the Nasdaq to lead net losses as 8.4 million shares traded hands. 

 The Nortel Networks Corp. spinoff said its revenues were hurt by delays in closing deals, not lost business. 

 Entrust develops software called public-key infrastructure that can be used to identify and authenticate that computer users are who they purport to be. That is considered an essential step in any electronic commerce transactions.

 BMC Software Says Weak Mainframe Business Hurt 1st-Quarter Results

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of BMC Software Inc. tumbled after the software maker projected fiscal first-quarter earnings will be half as much as analysts had expected on weakness in its mainframe business. 

 Houston-based BMC (BMCS) said earnings, excluding acquisition-related expenses, for the first quarter ended June 30 will come in between $47 million and $51 million, or 18 cents and 21 cents a share, on revenue of $365 million to $375 million. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 46 cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter, BMC earned $105.3 million, or 42 cents a share, on revenue of $400.7 million. 

 BMC makes software that manages computer networks. "We depend each quarter on a high percentage of license revenue closing in the last days or day of the quarter," said Max Watson, chairman, president and chief executive officer of BMC. But the company couldn't sign up as many customers as it had hoped in the quarter's closing days. 

 "While I am disappointed in these results, I remain confident in our employees, our customers and our solutions," Watson said. 

 BMC's licensing revenue fell across all geographic regions, but recorded its sharpest drop in North America, where it plunged 20% to between $221 million and $229 million during the fiscal first quarter, Watson said. License revenue from outside North America fell 10% to 15% from a year earlier, he said. 

 Weak demand for mainframe software was the main culprit in the decline, Watson said. Mainframe licensing revenue fell 30% from the year-earlier period, while licensing revenue from distributed systems declined 5%. 

 The drop in licensing revenue more than offset increases in other areas. Watson said revenue from maintenance rose 13%, while service and financing revenue more than doubled. 

 Watson played down suggestions that market forces as opposed to internal execution issues were at work in the profit warning. "We've got some things we need to correct," he said. "I'm not going to lay this off an any other factors. I think we've got a lot of work to do." 

 Watson also dismissed suggestions that the pending release of new mainframe products from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) has hurt BMC's business, or will hurt revenue in the coming months. "I think we'll respond very well to it," he said. 

 BMC has grown rapidly through acquisitions, including the purchases last year of Boole & Babbage Inc. and New Dimension Software Ltd., and the purchases in May of closely held Web-site-monitoring company Evity Inc. for $100 million in stock and cash and Israeli mainframe software maker OptiSystems Solutions Ltd. for $70 million cash.

 N.Y. Stocks Hurt By Profit Woes Ahead Of 2nd Quarter Results

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In popular fiction, it's darkest before the dawn. On Wall Street, it's before actual earnings statements come out. 

 With a week to go before corporate America starts to unleash second-quarter profits, warnings that some of those results will show shortfalls hit with their usual ferocity in Wednesday's session. 

 Shares of Computer Associates, the Islandia, N.Y., business software developer, shed 21 1/2 to finish at 29 1/2 on the NYSE, after the company warned that it would miss its fiscal first-quarter profit targets. 

 BMC Software, a rival business-software maker, followed suit, warning that its second-quarter numbers would miss targets because of weak mainframe business. Its shares lost 14 3/16 to 21 5/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, with 37 million shares - 10 times daily average - changing hands. 

 That crunched software stocks in particular, and technology names in general, as fretting and recriminations dominated the session. 

 "We're in that part of the cycle," Adam Weisman, a trader at Wit SoundView said Wednesday. The after-effects of the recent holiday (markets closed Tuesday for Independence Day) lingered, lightening trading levels to some extent, he said. 

 "There are two weeks before the actual earnings come out - and I think those will be good numbers - and we get bad news on light volume," Weisman added. "This is what it does." 

 It took the Nasdaq Composite Index down 128.69, or 3.23%, to end at 3863.24. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10483.60, down 77.07. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,497 issues advancing, 1,448 declining and 417 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 979,733,100 shares, compared with 448,760,000 at the 1 p.m. EDT close Monday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 644.90, down 5.29. The average price per share fell 33 cents. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to contain its losses for the session to a milder 0.73%, falling 77.07 to end at 10483.60, thanks to improvements in cyclicals and consumer issues. 

 Eli Lilly rose sharply in a session of otherwise modest gains for drug makers, shooting ahead 5 3/4 to 104 1/2. Baxter International gained 3 5/16 to 74 5/16. 

 Watson Pharmaceutical rose 1 to 54. Genomic and other biotechnology stocks also improved, with Incyte Genomics, for example, shooting ahead 9 5/16 to 95 1/16 on Nasdaq, as investors, skittish about traditional technology, sought other investment options. 

 Some of that investment capital alighted on some names with old economy profiles, including Boeing, which is expected to sell 30 of its 777 planes to International Lease Finance, and gained 1 1/8 to 42 13/16 on the day. Emerson Electric, the St. Louis manufacturer, added 5/8 to 61 1/2, after some upbeat comment from Goldman Sachs. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, which agreed to buy Dynapro, a Canadian maker of touch-screen products, advanced 4 3/8 to 88 7/16. 

 Cyclical stocks just don't enjoy the profit-growth profile that high-technology names offer, experts said. But Wednesday's earnings worries from big software names, as well as a warning from encryption product maker Entrust Technologies, which fell 40 1/2 to 36 5/8, made cowards of technology investors. That despite the fact that earnings warnings are as predictable as the dawn, and haven't been as problematic as in previous quarters. 

 "With technology companies overall, we're hearing fewer preannouncements than we normally do," Charles Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson Financial. "That was true the first quarter of this year, and it will be true this quarter, as well." 

 Unfortunately for high-technology issues, Wednesday's session also featured some pessimistic comments about the semiconductor sector. 

 Shares of Advanced Micro Devices slid 9 9/16 to 74 1/2 on the NYSE, after Jonathan Joseph, a sector analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that the group faces challenges from both macroeconomic factors, such as capital spending, as microeconomic factors, such as pricing and inventory levels. 

 Other names Joseph highlighted weakened, as well. National Semiconductor fell 8 3/16 to 49 15/16. Texas Instruments fell 5 1/8 to 63 7/8 on the Big Board. Silicon Storage Technology shed 15 1/16 to 83 15/16 on Nasdaq. 

 Chip names sank across the board, with Altera down 13 at 92 7/16, KLA-Tencor off 8 1/4 to 50 1/16, Rambus dropping 10 3/16 to 99 1/2, and Linear Technology falling 5 11/16 to 58 11/16, all on Nasdaq. 

 Comverse Technology tumbled 8 1/8 to 83 1/8 on Nasdaq in a tough session for technology issues. The Woodbury, N.Y., maker of telecommunications systems and software reached agreement to buy Exalink, a supplier of wireless, an Israel-based provider of wireless technology, in a stock pact worth about $480 million, based on Comverse's closing price Monday of 91 1/4. 

 Oil stocks tumbled in the session, after Saudi Arabia said it was prepared to boost oil production, which would increase supply, if high oil prices didn't begin to decline. 

 BP Amoco lost 4 7/16 to 53 7/8, hurt by the group's weakness, and by a ratings cut from Merrill Lynch. 

 Chevron fell 3 5/8 to 82 5/16. Texaco gave up 2 3/8 to 51 7/8. 

 Amerada Hess fell 4 1/16 to 59 3/8, Kerr-McGree sank 3 3/8 to 56 15/16 and Burlington Resources dropped 2 13/16 to 35 5/8. 

 Phillips Petroleum lost ground, falling 3 3/4 to 47 1/4, despite an upbeat report from Merrill Lynch. Swift Energy eased 1 11/16 to 24 3/4, even though Lehman Brothers raised its earnings forecasts to reflect higher natural gas price expectations, and increased its target for the stock. 

 Airline stocks moved higher in a session highlighted by weaker oil prices and encouraging sales trends for air carriers. US Airways gained 1/2 to 39 5/8, after the airline said its traffic in June increased 11.5%. 

 Southwest Airlines gained 11/16 to 20 1/8. AMR increased 2 1/4 to 28 3/8. Delta Air Lines moved up 2 to 53 3/8. 

 McDonald's lost 9/16 to 31 15/16, falling back near its 52-week low, the 29 13/16 it sank to March 7. In a research note Wednesday, Bear Stearns said it remained apprehensive about the restaurant operator amid fears that the company faced stiff competition from rival Burger King in June, adding that choppy U.S. sales trends are a problem for the stock. 

 The American depositary shares of Diageo, the British consumer goods company that owns Burger King, increased 5/8 to 37. 

 CVS added 5/16 to 39 11/16. Bergen Brunswig agreed to sell the specialty pharmacy assets of its Stadtlander unit to the Woonsocket, R.I. drug chain's ProCare Pharmacy unit. Bergen, an Orange, Calif., wholesale drug distributor, said it will provide $2.5 billion in pharmaceuticals to CVS ProCare during the next five years under the agreement. 

 Bergen, a small-capitalization stock, ended 1 1/2 higher at 7 5/16. 

 Cordiant Communications' American depositary receipts fell 2 to 26. The British advertising and communications concern agreed to buy Lighthouse Global Network in a stock purchase valued at $592 million. Lighthouse, a U.S. communications and marketing concern, is privately held. 

 Walgreen gave up 1 3/4 to 30. The Deerfield, Ill., drug-store chain lost ground in the session, even though it posted same-store sales results for June that climbed 10.7%. 

 Inco dropped 1/2 to 15 1/2, near the 52-week low of 14 5/8 set June 22. Lehman Brothers cut its earnings forecast for the Canadian mining and metals company, citing declining nickel prices and rising energy costs.

 BMC Software Chairman: 1st Quarter License Revenue Fell 20% From Year Ago

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- BMC Software Inc.'s (BMCS) licensing revenue fell across all geographic regions during its fiscal first quarter, but most sharply in North America, where license revenue dropped 20% to 25%, said Max Watson, chairman, president and chief executive. 

 The license revenue shortfall led BMC to announce Wednesday that its earnings and revenue for the quarter ended June 30 fell below analysts' expectations. The news came close on the heels of a profit warning issued by BMC's larger rival, Computer Associates Inc. (CA). Both companies cited a softening in demand for mainframe computer software used by business customers, as well as the failure to close several large deals in the closing days of the quarter. 

 BMC said Wednesday it expected to report first-quarter earnings between 18 cents and 21 cents a share, well below the First Call/Thomson Financial analysts' consensus forecast of 46 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, BMC earned 42 cents a share. BMC will announce actual results July 25. 

 BMC's estimated revenue also plunged to between $365 million to $375 million from $400.7 million a year ago. In a conference call Wednesday, Watson said license revenue in the latest quarter fell 20% from a year ago to between $221 million and $229 million. License revenue from outside North America fell 10% to 15% from a year ago, he said. 

 The weak demand for mainframe software was the main culprit in the decline in BMC's overall license revenue, Watson said. Mainframe licensing revenue fell 30% from a year ago. Distributed systems license revenue fell 5% from a year ago, below expectations, Watson said. 

 The drop in licensing revenue more than offset increases in other areas. BMC's revenue from maintenance, services and financing operations was between $144 million and $146 million in the latest quarter, Watson said. Revenue from maintenance alone rose 13% from a year ago, while service and financing revenue soared 110%. Another positive trend was a sequential decline in operating expenses, compared with the fourth quarter, Watson said. 

 But like Computer Associates, BMC Software suffered from an outbreak of gun-shyness by its customers late in the quarter. "We usually have a back-end loaded quarter, and our results depend on the closing day or days of the quarter," Watson said. Both companies failed to convince customers to pull the trigger on new contracts in the quarter's closing days. 

 Watson played down suggestions that market forces - as opposed to internal execution issues - were at work in the profit warnings issued by both BMC and Computer Associates. "We've got some things we need to correct," he said. "I'm not going to lay this off an any other factors. I think we've got a lot of work to do." 

 Watson also dismissed suggestions that the pending release of new mainframe products from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) has hurt BMC's business, or will hurt revenue in the coming months. "I think we'll respond very well to it," he said. "I don't see that as a necessary threat to our revenue. Based on my knowledge of their new pricing, I'm not uncomfortable at this time about what that could do to our mainframe revenue."

 Higher Costs and Fed Rate Increases May Slow U.S. Firms'  Profit  Growth --- Economists Still Expect Strong Second Quarter but See  Warning  Signs --- Gas Prices Are Taking a Toll on Consumer Confidence

 NEW YORK -- The red flag is up this earnings season. 

 While second-quarter earnings are largely expected to be strong, analysts and economists see a number of signs that suggest U.S. corporate-profit growth will ease in the coming quarters, as higher costs on a variety of fronts put the brakes on economic growth. 

 "One of the reasons profits have been strong is because the economy has been strong," says Nancy Lazar, an economist at ISI Group in New York. Now, she says slower growth as a result of the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong crusade to boost U.S. interest rates is beginning to pressure a few bellwether sectors. She also notes that central banks around the world have tightened credit and it "looks like we'll have a global slowdown," which would hurt U.S. companies. 

 Signs of slower U.S. economic growth have already become evident in second-quarter profit warnings, particularly among firms in rate-sensitive sectors such as housing, banking and retailing. Consumers, their psyches perhaps unnerved by historically high gasoline prices and the rising cost of credit, are putting off purchases of big-ticket items, such as cars, and are becoming pickier when buying smaller items such as clothing. 

 Blue-chip companies Honeywell International Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., for instance, have lowered their second-quarter profit forecasts, blaming everything from high oil prices to a weak euro. Companies in other industries have indicated that the rising costs of labor and raw materials will hurt earnings. 

 But while profits may be lower than expected, they are still expected to fare well. "Second-quarter earnings are going to be terrific," says Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call/Thomson Financial in Boston, a firm that tracks earnings estimates from securities analysts on Wall Street. 

 First Call says it expects companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to report higher third- and fourth-quarter earnings, compared with a year earlier. But the size of the increases is expected to shrink each quarter. Most of the U.S.'s largest companies will begin reporting second-quarter results in two weeks. 

 First Call says that 57% of the earnings pre-announcements it has tracked so far for the second quarter reflect lowered expectations, up from 44% in the first quarter and ahead of 56% a year ago. Mr. Hill says the second-quarter pre-announcements don't seem worse than normal, but more companies will probably revise their outlooks downward before announcing second-period earnings. 

 Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, says he'll be watching the second-quarter reports for guidance on the rest of the year. "There are many concerns about what earnings will be like if the economy continues to slow," he says. He also believes that if economic data in the coming months provides more evidence of a U.S. slowdown, third- and fourth-period earnings could show "a substantial squeeze" on margins. 

 Some industries, of course, will face softer markets sooner than others. Residential real estate is a mixed bag, with existing home sales rising 4.3% in May even as other housing indicators ease. Any slowdown in new-home buying and construction weakens demand for sinks, carpets and other furnishings. Textile maker Burlington Industries Inc. and Masco Corp., a maker of faucets and cabinets, have both said their second-quarter results would trail estimates. Burlington blamed a drop-off in interior-furnishings shipments but also said its women's wear exports to Europe have been hurt by a weak euro, which makes U.S. products more expensive. Masco also cited a softening in home-improvement product orders. 

 Pamela Singleton, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, says expectations are generally heading lower for textile firms. "May was a little disappointing, and June doesn't seem to be responding with as much gusto," she says. 

 Meanwhile, there are further indicators that U.S. consumers are showing some signs of restraint. The Commerce Department, for example, said retail sales pulled back in both April and May, with automobiles accounting for most of the May decrease. 

 While a number of smaller chains are lowering estimates for the quarter, analysts are trimming forecasts for bigger retailers. "When the economy slows, it shows up with retailers first because consumers stop spending," says Dan Barry, senior retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch who recently cut his second-period profit estimates on Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates Macy's, J.C. Penney Co. and Kmart Corp. Apparel companies in particular, he says, will suffer the most from weaker sales. "The markdowns are much higher than last year," Mr. Barry says. 

 The 2000 second period is the first quarter in several years in which retailers have had noticeable estimate cuts, Mr. Barry says. "If the pattern is typical, that will show up in the third quarter at the manufacturers, as the retailers cut back" to reduce their inventories, he adds. 

 Economists also caution that the oil crisis's effects on profits and sentiment shouldn't be underestimated. Packaging companies such as Crown Cork & Seal Co., and some steel and chemical firms have lowered their second-quarter projections, weighed down partly by higher raw-material prices. UBS Warburg says many companies have said their labor costs are also rising quickly. "Firms have had to pay more to keep workers, or to get them," says Jeffrey Palma, a UBS economist. 

 But perhaps the most worrisome sign is the U.S. banking industry. About two weeks ago, many financial stocks were roiled when Wachovia Corp., a dominant fixture in the Southeastern U.S., said its second-period profit wouldn't meet analysts' estimates. Banks are "one of the obvious places where higher interest rates start to have an impact right away," says Mr. Hill of First Call. 

 Wachovia's move has some economists fearing that banks may be getting bitten by relaxed lending standards of the past. Citing a rise in nonperforming consumer loans, the company set a $200 million charge to boost its loan-loss reserves. Mr. Skopec, the Mid-City Financial banker, sees other banks following suit, possibly signaling a reversal to the heady profits many banks have experienced over the past year.

 The Canadian markets were closed yesterday as Bay Street wrapped up the Canada Day long weekend. South of the border -- just like the TSE on Friday -- the markets posted a preholiday rally. 

 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.78 points to 10,560.67 on the strength of the financial services components. The interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks led the charge upward after the United States' National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said its manufacturing index registered a less-than-expected 51.8 reading in June. 

 Investment-services company J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. gained more than 5 per cent to $115.75 (U.S.). Banking giant Citigroup Inc. advanced 3.6 per cent to $62.44. American Express Co. moved ahead 0.5 per cent to $52.38. 

 Also, Dow construction and mining equipment company Caterpillar Inc. surged more than 6 per cent after announcing it had purchased the remaining 50 per cent of its underground mining equipment venture in Australia and plans to significantly expand the business. 

 The Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index advanced 25.82 points to 3,991.93. The gains came amid a sharp 4.6-per-cent decline by Oracle Corp. to $80.19. The world's second-largest software maker sank as investors reacted to Friday's announcement that Ray Lane is stepping down from his post as president and chief operating officer. 

 Oracle's fall was offset with gains by Cisco Systems Inc., JDS Uniphase Corp., Intel Corp., Yahoo Inc. and Digital Island Inc. 

 Informix Corp. was the most heavily traded Nasdaq issue. The California-based company plummeted by 37 per cent to $4.69 after warning that its second-quarter profit could be half of what it earned in the same period last year. 

 Nortel Networks Corp.'s stock price touched a 52-week high, advancing close to 6 per cent to $72.25. The Brampton, Ont.-based high flier said it has completed its acquisition of Internet software firm Architel Systems Corp. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 14.72 points to 1,469.32. 

 In New York, the markets closed at 1 p.m. EDT and will remain closed until tomorrow morning for the U.S. July 4 Independence Day holiday.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, Wall Street kicks off the new quarter in the plus column, but will the positive momentum make investors forget about a dismal first half of 2000? 

 Saudi Arabia sends a message around the globe. The world`s No. 1 petroleum producer wants to pump up the volume, but will that take the heat out of oil prices? 

 Turning south of the Rio Grande, a new era dawns in Mexico as a former Coca-Cola (URL: http://www.cocacola.com/) executive ends 71 years of single-party rule. 

 Plus, what would you do if you came into hundreds of millions of dollars? Some people who have still trudge into work every day and swear it`s worth the trouble: a MONEYLINE special report. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. Stuart Varney is off. 

 Wall Street got the third quarter started on the right foot today. In a shortened pre-holiday session, investors took heart from further signs of a slowing economy to send blue chips to a triple- digit gain. 

 As Greg Clarkin reports, investors are hoping the second half of the year will be smooth sailing. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For one day at least it was all about ships, not stocks in Lower Manhattan. Traders and tourists alike looked past today`s shortened trading session and toward tomorrow`s 4th of July celebrations. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Tomorrow we`re just going to like hang out and watch the tall ships over -- I live in Hoboken -- so from the coast there. We`ll watch the fireworks from the roof. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Enjoy the day tomorrow, you know, because it`s been hectic, and then the rest of the week will probably be a lot more since it`s a short week. 

 CLARKIN: The kickoff to the short trading week began with a bang: the Dow up 112 points, or 1 percent. The Nasdaq meanwhile jumped 25 points, or two-thirds of 1 percent. 

 ALAN ACKERMAN, FAHNESTOCK: We`re starting to near a period of more stabilization in the market. We`re through with guessing about what the Fed might do. We`re now looking forward to the flow of corporate earnings. They really come on full force in about a week. My feeling is we`re going to have positive surprises. So people are a wee bit more comfortable. 

 CLARKIN: Investors were comfortable with financial stocks after a report found manufacturing had slowed, easing interest rate concerns. Dow stocks  JP Morgan and Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) rose. And Sprint surged on reports Germany`s Deutsche Telekom (URL: http://www.dtag.de/) may bid for the company. Conseco (URL: http://www.conseco.com/) continued to rise since naming a new CEO. Shares of Sony (URL: http://www.world.sony.com/) jumped on word it`s working with rivals to develop digital TV. And tech stocks continue to find favor with investors. 

 STUART FREEMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: We are looking for opportunities to buy some technology stocks. We actually think it`s probably going to be in the fall time period. And -- and we`ll be looking again at some of the large-cap, quality, real names. 

 CLARKIN: Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) and Cisco (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) gained. But Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) lost on word it`s losing its president. And software maker Informix (URL: http://www.informix.com/) was battered after it said profits would be far below estimates, while JDS Uniphase (URL: http://www.jdsunph.com/) continued to win. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And while today`s economic numbers gave the markets a boost, traders say they were really just something of a warmup. There are a number  of economic reports due out later in the week, capped by the employment report for June. That`s released on Friday, and as always, has the potential to move the markets -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg, now last month`s report was a little bit puzzling, a little bit confusing. Will the markets be looking to Friday`s number to provide some clarity? 

 CLARKIN: Exactly. They`re looking for a real decisive figure here. The May employment report showed a softening job market. The economists are really split if that`s accurate or not. So they`re looking for some fresh economic data to really hang their hats on. 

 BAY: OK, Greg, thanks. 

 Stocks also got an unexpected boost late in the session as word started spreading that Saudi Arabia wanted to pull the plug on high crude oil prices. The world`s top petroleum producer today saying it would, along with its OPEC partners, pump up oil production by a half- million barrels per day. This on top of the 700,000 barrel increase agreed to at OPEC`s meeting last month. The Saudi boost is intended to bring down stubbornly high crude prices to about $25 a barrel. Oil prices have been on a wild ride this year, but still stand above $30. Much more 

 on this story in our next half hour. 

 Oil stocks gained on the day. ExxonMobil (URL: http://www.exxon.mobil.com/) , Chevron (URL: http://www.chevron.com/) and BP Amoco (URL: http://www.bpamoco.com/) all up more than one. Texaco (URL: http://www.texaco.com/) adding on one. 

 Checking the broader market, the S&P 500 up more than 14 to 1,469. Advancers beat out decliners by a more than 2-to-1 margin: 48 stocks hit new highs; 18 fell to new lows. 

 Among the big winners on Wall Street today, shares in Mexican companies benefiting from a changing of the guard in Mexico`s presidential election. Opposition candidate Vicente Fox, who once ran Coca-Cola`s operations in Mexico, won a dramatic victory yesterday, bringing an end to 71 years of single-party rule in the country. 

 The results could have sweeping impact, not just on Mexico`s political system, but on its economy as well. 

 Casey Wian has the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CASEY WIAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Victory never tasted sweeter for former Coca-Cola executive Vicente Fox. His election as president of Mexico has energized a nation, revolutionized Mexican politics, and calmed jittery financial markets. 

 For seven decades, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has had a firm grip on power. Previous election results have been suspect and have been followed by financial catastrophes, most recently after outgoing President Ernesto Zedillo took office six years ago. 

 MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, PIMCO: If you compare it to `94, the last time there was a presidential election, Fox is getting a very good economy. GDP is growing, inflation is coming down, the budget is under control, the central bank is independent, and most important, this is a country with a high level of reserves. 

 WIAN: With uncertainty over the election out of the way, Mexican financial markets rallied. The IPC stock index jumped 5 percent, and the Mexican peso gained more than 1 percent against the dollar. 

 Some analysts say the positive response to the pro-business Fox might have been greater if not for Monday`s quasi-holiday in the United States. 

 FERNANDO LOSADO, ING BARINGS: The dust of the election has not completely settled yet. What we are anticipating is that after Wednesday, the rally is going to continue. 

 WIAN: Longer term, Fox faces plenty of challenges, particularly accelerating the economic reforms started under Zedillo. Privatizing the electric power industry is seen as a must because it`s operating near full capacity and Mexico`s industrial north faces blackouts. Mexico`s tax system is also in need of an overhaul. 

 Perhaps most critical, how the new Fox administration is able to work with the still-powerful former ruling party. 

 JORGE SUAREZ, INVERLINK, USA: I think he will have the mother of all honeymoons, because after 71 years I think people were really looking forward to change. 

 WIAN: That change, one economist says, could bring $3-4 billion a year in new direct international investment into Mexico. 

 (on camera): Thousands of California residents who are also Mexican citizens flocked across the border Sunday to cast their votes. If Fox has his way, those crossings could become more frequent. He`s proposed an  agreement between the U.S. and Mexico that would allow workers to cross the border freely. 

 Casey Wian, CNN Financial News, Los Angeles. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: The election results gave a charge to Mexican stocks trading in New York. Telephone giant Telmex (URL: http://www.telmex.com.mx/) jumped 5 3/4. Grupo Televisa (URL: http://www.televisa.com/) , the broadcast empire, surged more than 5 1/2. Cemex, Femsa, and TV Azteca  also gained. 

 In Mexico City, stocks overall surged. The benchmark IPC index shot up more than 425 points, or more than 5 percent. And that brought the index into the black for the year, now up 3 percent so far in 2000. 

 Elsewhere in Latin America, Brazil`s BOVESPA down 1 percent year to date and Argentina`s MerVal  down 7 percent. 

 To talk about what`s ahead for Mexico and the ramifications of this historic vote, we are joined by Joyce Chang, director of emerging markets research at Chase Securities. 

 Joyce, welcome. 

 As we just reported, the Mexican market up 5 percent today. Were investors cheered simply by the notion of change or was it the specifics of Fox`s economic plans they were responding to? 

 JOYCE CHANG, CHASE SECURITIES: It was really a little bit of both. I mean, this was a watershed event for Mexico. Voter turnout was record. The ruling party accepted the defeat in a very conciliatory manner. And Fox also held back from some of his most aggressive comments and made statements stressing cooperation and cohesion in the government. 

 BAY: Which will be critical to his success. 

 CHANG: Absolutely. And I think he`s realizing the challenge that lies ahead in turning over the apparatus, which has been run at the federal level by PRI. 

 I also think that at the congressional level the changes are very significant, because the PRI is no longer the single-largest party in either the upper of the lower house. So very significant watershed changes. 

 I think that Fox is also perceived in the marketplace as slightly more free market-oriented, that he might proceed with privatization initiative a little bit faster than the PRI might have proceeded. 

 BAY: We have seen in the past after previous elections times of crisis following those elections. Is that a concern? 

 CHANG: I think that this election will go down in Mexican history, in memory as one of the points where they actually did handle the transition without a crisis. I expect that Vincente Fox will come out early with a budget, that he will stress fiscal prudence and actually try to reduce the fiscal deficit, and that he will continue to welcome foreign investment, and try to seek very strong relations with the  U.S. government. 

 BAY: There`s a long transition period, about five months. In your mind, what does he need to do during that transition period to set the right tone? 

 CHANG: I think that he needs to form some type of coalition government that includes some of the existing technocrats who are in the government, some of the members of the PRI. He will need to form  these alliances not just at the federal, but also at the local level, at the congressional level, because the support for Fox was much stronger than the support for his overall party, if you look at the local election results and the congressional election results. 

 So he does have his work cut out for him. But I think that the response so  far has been overwhelmingly positive, much more so than many people were thinking right before the election. 

 BAY: Joyce Chang, thank you for joining us tonight. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, the FBI looks into alleged payoffs by an oil company consultant to Central Asian power-brokers. Did money change hands for favors in one of the world`s richest oil fields? 

 Verizon (URL: http://www.verizon.com/) makes its Wall Street debut as Bell Atlantic (URL: http://www.verizon.com/) and GTE  GTE);  URL: http://www.verizon.com/> unite under their new name. We`ll tell you how the stock did today. 

 Plus, talk of another possible telecom suitor gives Sprint a boost. Wall Street may like the idea, but what are they saying in Washington? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Another kind of oil story making news today as federal authorities want to learn more about the financing of oil projects in Kazakhstan, a Central Asian country sitting on a vast stockpile of black gold. 

 Kitty Pilgrim reports about the alleged dealings of an American businessman that might have landed him in hot water. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Justice Department is investigating this man, James Giffen, an American and head of the Mercator Corporation, shown here in the late `80s at a U.S.-Russia business conference, but for much of the last decade, he`s helped broker oil deals in the Caspian Sea region, serving as a type of gatekeeper to Kazakhstan`s powerful president, Nursultan Nazarbayev. 

 Sources familiar with the investigation confirm that the feds are looking into whether Kazakh officials, including Nazarbayev, may have received payoffs. 

 WILLIAM RANDOL, BANK OF AMERICA SECURITIES: All these countries have different corporate cultures about bribery and money under the table and all this kind of stuff. So the companies have a balancing act. They`re trying to be good corporate citizens, but they`re also trying to discover oil and make money for their shareholders. 

 PILGRIM: The Justice Department won`t say whether the oil companies themselves are targets of any investigation, but Mobil today told MONEYLINE that it is cooperating fully with the investigation. Phillips Petroleum says it won`t comment at all. And BP Amoco did not respond to several telephone messages. 

 This oil is in the Caspian region. Up until 1991, these resources were shared by the Soviet Union and Iran. But since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have staked claims to that pool of oil. 

 Major American oil companies want to help tap this oil, potentially up to 100 million barrels of it. The competition for the pipeline contracts has been fierce. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 PILGRIM: The concern is Giffen may have potentially broken the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and some racketeering laws that prohibit representatives of U.S. companies from trying to get business by paying off or bribing foreign government officials. Now, it`s still unclear whether the oil companies were aware of his actions or merely the victims of it -- Willow? 

 BAY: Kitty Pilgrim reporting, thank you. 

 Still to come on MONEYLINE, as Medicare programs get costlier, more HMOs are opting to pull out. We`ll have that story and more, when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Hundreds of thousands of elderly Americans are starting to figure out what to do about their insurance coverage, that after two more HMOs joined the growing exodus from the government-run Medicare program late last week. 

 Humana (URL: http://www.humana.com/) and UnitedHealth Group (URL: http://www.uhc.com/) are pulling out of Medicare plans in more than 60 counties in 14 different states. The managed care industry says it`s a simple case of higher costs and lower government reimbursements. But some experts say the Medicare retreat is not all the government`s fault. 

 Bob Beard has the details. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BOB BEARD, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Over 700,000 older Americans on Medicare will be bumped from their HMO at year`s end given a choice: switch to another HMO or join traditional Medicare, usually at higher cost. The problem, say HMOs, reimbursements from Uncle Sam. 

 SUSAN PISANO, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH CARE PLANS: Most plans are actually getting what amounts to a less than 2 percent increase each year when costs for caring for Medicare beneficiaries are going up 6 to 8 percent. 

 BEARD: Set by the federal government, payments vary, from a high of $814 a month per recipient in cities like New York, to $400 a month in rural areas. For the third year in a row, HMOs are pulling out of Medicare, including Aetna (URL: http://www.aetna.com/) , CIGNA (URL: http://www.cigna.com/) , Humana, UnitedHealth Care, Foundation Health (URL: http://www.fhs.com/) , and Oxford Health Plans (URL: http:/www.oxhp.com/) . It`s happening in counties with low reimbursement rates. 

 HMOs say higher prescription drug costs at up to $2 million per company to comply with stacks of Medicare regulations are also reasons. 

 The AARP argues it`s not too little cash from Washington, but the fact managed care firms are now publicly traded. They weren`t when HMOs joined Medicare in the 1980s. 

 MARTIN CORRY, AARP: They not only have a responsibility to their patients, but they`ve also got a responsibility to their investors, and you`re seeing that tension played out in these pullouts. 

 BEARD: The HMO Exodus affects a small part of the Medicare program. Of 39 million Americans on Medicare, 27 million can choose managed care: 6.5 million have joined HMOs this year. 

 (on camera): The pullouts and the voting power of older Americans puts pressure on the Congress and the president to compromise on different prescription-drug plans that increase Medicare payments to HMOs. 

 Bob Beard, CNN Financial News, Washington. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Most HMO stocks fared well today. United Health Group gained more than 2 1/4. Humana was up nearly 1/2. Aetna rose one. Cigna added nearly 1 1/2, but Oxford Health Plans fell fractionally. 

 A telecom giant began trading today under a brand new name and symbol. Verizon Communications, VZ on the Big Board, is the company formed by the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. To celebrate, Verizon`s co-CEO`s rang the opening bell on Wall Street. 

 In tonight`s "Tech Watch," Louise Schiavone takes a look at the deal and at its impact on the industry. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 LOUISE SCHIAVONE, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The mammoth deal creates the nation`s largest local telephone company, now called Verizon. 

 SCOTT CLELAND, LEGG MASON: Oh, this is clearly going to be one of the titans. We`re going to have five to eight global telecom massive players, and Verizon will be one of them. 

 SCHIAVONE: Verizon Communications links Bell Atlantic`s 43 million local access lines with GTE`s 20 million, serving customers in 38 states. Verizon`s wireless operation will serve 25 million customers, reaching over 90 percent of the United States. Critics complain that, with approvals like this one, the Federal Communications Commission has not  lived up to the spirit of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 

 GENE KIMMELMAN, CONSUMERS UNION: They`ve really been spinning their wheels at a time where consolidation begets more consolidation, merger follows merger follows merger, and unfortunately, consumers won`t get the choices and the lower prices they were promised. 

 SCHIAVONE: But analysts say GTE delivers major growth opportunities. 

 CLELAND: What I see Verizon doing is becoming a better executing company, probably expanding even more globally, and probably trying to expand into data over time. 

 SCHIAVONE: To gain FCC approval, Verizon had to address the issue of GTE`s Internet backbone, which, for regulatory purposes, is considered long-distance service. The Internet component has been spun off as a new company, Genuity, in which Verizon will not be a majority player until it meets FCC long distance requirements. 

 (on camera): Analysts don`t expect this to be the last of Bell Atlantic`s acquisitions. Video programming and Web content may also lie in Verizon`s future, as well as an expanded presence on other continents. 

 Louise Schiavone, for CNN Financial News, Washington. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: In its first day of trading, Verizon Communications gained nearly 4 3/4 to close above 55. And Genuity, GTE`s Internet service provider, which was spun off just last week, that rose fractionally today, but it is trading below its offer price of $11 a share. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, a monumental improvement for a Washington landmark. We`ll have that story and more ahead, in our "News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: A high and mighty national treasure shows off its facelift, just in time for the Fourth of July. More about that now in our "MONEYLINE News Digest," from Joie Chen in Atlanta -- Joie. 

 JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Willow, just in time. 

 It has taken three years and $10 million, but the Washington Monument has a brand new look tonight; a ceremony in the nation`s capital today to show off the results of the renovation of the 555- foot monument. The exterior was cleaned and repaired with the interior set to reopen later this month after some last-minute touching up. 

 In the presidential race: George W. Bush met with Dick Cheney, who`s heading the Republican`s search for a running mate. Bush says he hasn`t decided when to announce his final choice. And as the White House praised the outcome of Mexico`s historic election, Bush and rival Al Gore also expressed their approval. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think it`s a very interesting statement of how far political reform has come in Mexico. And that`s a positive development. 

 AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I compliment the people of Mexico on an election that was apparently a model election in many ways. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 CHEN: Gore today promoted his $255 billion drug plan for seniors and accused Republicans of playing along with big pharmaceutical companies. 

 Finally tonight, a demolition team today brought down the 393- foot observation tower at the Gettysburg Civil War battlefield. It dated from the 70s, and was destroyed to help restore the original look of the 1863 site. 

 Those are tonight`s top stories. We`ll have more coming up on "THE WORLD TODAY." That`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 out on the West Coast. We hope you join us then -- Willow. 

 BAY: Joie, thanks, see you then. 

 A lot more still to come on MONEYLINE. Wall Street kicks off the second half with a bang. Will a summer rally finally take hold, or can investors expect more turbulence ahead? 

 A rocky ride for Oracle: Big changes at the top sends its stock deep in the red. We`ll have the very latest. And in a MONEYLINE special report: working millionaires, even billionaires. We visit with some entrepreneurs who continue to put in the long hours even after they`ve struck gold. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, Wall Street welcomes the third quarter on an up note. Will it set the tone for the markets to recoup their losses in the second half? 

 And another sign the U.S. economy is slowing down: Auto sales take a tumble, hit by rising interest rates and higher oil prices. 

 Plus, we`ll look at some people who love going to work. They must. Why else would billionaires bother to show up at the office every day? 

 But first, more on our top story, a surprise today from Saudi Arabia, and it could mean lower oil prices are finally on the way. The OPEC nation announced its intention to increase oil production by 500,000 barrels a day over the next few days. 

 Peter Viles has our story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As Americans were hitting the road by the millions, grumbling about high gas prices, Saudi Arabia made a surprise announcement, saying it wants to drive down oil prices by about $5 a barrel. 

 In an interview with the official Saudi press agency, the Saudi oil minister said, quote, "If the price does not decrease, Saudi Arabia, in consultation with other producers, will increase production by 500,000 barrels per day within the next few days." 

 Analysts took the statement at face value, saying the Saudis truly want lower prices because high prices encourage competition from other oil producers and eventually cut into demand for oil. 

 WILLIAM RANDOL, BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES: This decision, if it is implemented, reflects not only the fact that they think $33 is too high for, say, West Texas crude, but also the fact that they need money. They can sneak, you know, 500,000 barrels a day into the market, and that`s a lot of revenue incrementally for them. 

 VILES: Crude oil prices shot up 36 percent from early April through last Friday. Markets shrugged off OPEC`s announcement on June 21st it would boost production by 708,000 barrels a day. Analysts said that oil was already being produced by cheating on quotas, but another 500,000 barrels might be enough to drive prices lower. 

 RANDOL: I think it would clip the price by $2 to $3 a barrel easily, even though as a percentage of demand it`s not that great. VILES: The White House applauded the Saudi announcement, and on the campaign trail in Missouri, Vice President Al Gore jumped on the news. 

 AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I want to call on the big oil companies to let that pass through in the form of price reductions to the people who are filling their cars up at the gasoline filling stations. 

 VILES: But analysts expressed doubt that more crude in the market will quickly translate into lower prices at the pump. 

 ANTOINE HALFF, ENERGY INTELLIGENCE GROUP: Gasoline prices are high not so much right now because of a shortage of crude, they`re high because gasoline stocks are tight. And just increasing the supply of crude would not necessarily immediately increase gasoline supplies. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: There are plenty of unanswered questions tonight about the Saudi initiative, including whether the Saudis intend to act unilaterally, or win an endorsement from OPEC. Another question: Is it going to work? We should no more about that tomorrow, when trading resumes tomorrow in the oil markets in Europe -- Willow. 

 BAY: How about another question: Anything to the timing of this? Oil didn`t trade today. 

 VILES: Right, there is something to that. It didn`t trade in the United States. Gives traders longer to digest this material. What OPEC does not want is to pop the bubble and have a big drop in prices. 

 BAY: And what they`re been aiming for all along are incremental moves to see if they can moderate the price. Is that true? 

 VILES: They would like the price to come down a little bit, but not a whole lot. 

 BAY: Peter Viles, thanks. 

 The Saudi news started to filter through the market near the close, and that gave Wall Street a boost. Stocks and bonds gaining ground in a holiday-shortened session. Investors will return to work on Wednesday after the July 4th break. 

 It was a strong start to the third quarter after a dismal performance in the second quarter. The Dow industrials gained 112 points, or more than 1 percent to 10560. Nearly 452 million shares changed hands. 

 Among the winners on the Big Board: J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) up more than 5 1/2. Telmex surged 5 3/4 after the opposition candidate won the Mexican presidential election. Caterpillar, General Motors and ExxonMobil also advanced. A more modest move on the Nasdaq. It picked up 25 points to 3991. Winners there today included Intel, up nearly 3 1/4; JDS Uniphase, up more than 8 1/4. Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/) jumped nearly 6 3/4, but Informix sank 2 3/4 or 37 percent to a 52-week low after issuing a profitwarning. And Oracle slipped almost 4. We`ll have more on that stock later. 

 Traders did get a fresh piece of economic news today showing the growth in the manufacturing sector is slowing down. The National Association of Purchasing Managers` index fell to 51.8, much weaker than economists had expected. The bond market liked what it saw. The 10-years issue gained 9/32, the yield falling to 5.98 percent. The 30-year jumped nearly half a point. The bond market, of course, will be closed tomorrow. 

 The recent rise in interest rates, record gas prices and stock market declines contributed to the fall in U.S. vehicle sales last month. That, even as overseas manufacturers managed to make gains. Analysts expect the weak results from the Big Three U.S. automakers to pull down vehicle sales for the overall industry for the second straight month. 

 Taking a look at the numbers, GM (URL: http://www.gm.com/) today reported overall sales fell 5.5 percent. DaimlerChrysler`s (URL: http://www.daimlerchrysler.com) U.S. sales of American-branded vehicles, that dropped nearly 10 percent. And Ford`s sales slipped just over 3 percent. 

 So is the economy slowing enough to keep the Fed at bay? Joining us now from Albany, Hugh Johnson. 

 Hugh, welcome back to MONEYLINE. 

 HUGH JOHNSON, FIRST ALBANY: Nice to be with you, Willow. 

 BAY: So are the numbers today any more conclusive? Do we have any better sense whether this slow down is for real? 

 JOHNSON: You know, with every passing day, Willow, we get more and more evidence that particularly the consumer is starting to slow. So the economy is slowing from that 5 percent or plus pace to something closer to 3 percent. And I think the evidence now is extraordinarily strong. I think the important report, of course, will be this Friday`s employment report, which I think will really confirm that the economy is slowing to close to a 3 to 3.5 percent pace -- very good news. 

 BAY: So, Hugh, if, as you suggest and as the evidence indicates, the economy is slowing in a meaningful way, what does that mean for corporate profits, corporate earnings? 

 JOHNSON: Well, it means that corporate profits will start to slow down. Maybe not so much in the third quarter, but maybe in the fourth quarter. In other words, we`re not going to get the kind of robust growth rates that have driven the market, but at the same time the offset is we won`t get rising inflation and interest rates. And hopefully, profits will be rising enough to offset the bad news of stable to modestly higher interest rates. 

 So really, on balance, a slowdown in the economy is really good, just so long as it doesn`t slow too much. And I don`t think that it`s slowing too much. I think it`s slowing to a nice, no-boom, no-bust pace, and that`s what we all want. 

 BAY: Now you`ve said that the market will remain trendless and volatile for rest of the year. So what does that mean for investors? 

 JOHNSON: Well, it really means, trendless, it means really we`re not going to -- we`ll be in a trading range of somewhere between, say, on the Dow 10000 and 11000. I think, if the economy slows as I`m suggesting, then I think the Federal Reserve will not raise short-term interest rates any further, which probably means that although we`ll be in this 10000 to 11000 trading range on the Dow, which is about 10500 now, we`ll finish the year closer to 11000, maybe a little bit higher. 

 Believe me, it`s important that we have the economy slow and the Fed take its foot off the brake. If that happens, it will be a good second half for investors, as I think it will be. 

 BAY: So you -- how -- but then how do investors position themselves for this scenario? 

 JOHNSON: You buy the stocks of companies who`s earns are going to continue to do OK, regardless of what happens to the economy. If the economy slows, the earnings are going to continue to grow. That includes things... 

 BAY: For example? 

 JOHNSON: Well, in the health care area, drug stocks, for example, have been performing well, should continue to perform well, some electric utilities, consumer non-cyclicals, which include things like foods and food retailers, household products, beverage companies like PepsiCo (URL: http://www.pepsico.com/) . Those are the kinds of companies that, regardless of what happens to the economy, their sales and earnings continue to grow. And I would add that technology companies, it looks to me as though, generally speaking, their revenues and earnings are going to continue to grow regardless of what happens to the economy. So that`s the kind of thing you buy in this kind of an environment, which includes a slowdown in the economy. 

 BAY: Hugh Johnson, thanks for your advice and thanks for interrupting your vacation to join us tonight on MONEYLINE. 

 JOHNSON: Happy to be with you. 

 BAY: Still to come, a disappointing day for Oracle. Its stock slammed after the company announces a major management change. Find out why Larry Ellison could soon have more work cross his desk. 

 Plus, talk of another telecom suitor lights a fire under shares of Sprint, but Washington isn`t as excited. Why some lawmakers are already crying foul. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Investors today showed their disappointment over Oracle`s latest management changes. Raymond Lane, long rumored to be on the verge of leaving the company, resigned as president and chief operating officer of Oracle late Friday. The company announced this morning that Chairman and CEO Larry Ellison will assume Lane`s duties, and said Lane`s departure had nothing to do with news last week that Oracle had hired a private detective agency to investigate Microsoft allies in Washington. Lane joined Oracle in 1992 and is widely credited with helping Oracle turn around its stock price. Over the past year, shares of the  company have risen 324 percent -- that, despite falling nearly $4 today. 

 In other corporate news, Deutsche Telekom is reportedly in preliminary talks to take over Sprint, after U.S. regulators moved to block WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) from buying the company. But 30 senators on both sides of the aisle are saying, not so fast They argue that such a move is illegal and not in the best interests of the country. 

 Steve Young has the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly a third of the Senate says Germany`s giant communications company Deutsche Telekom should be barred from buying Sprint because of a 66-year-old law. The Communications Act of 1934 bars other governments from owning more than 25 percent of a licensed U.S. communications firm. 

 The law was passed to protect national security in the event of war, which came just a few years later. Today, the German government owns 59 percent  of Deutsche Telekom. But analysts say the law was written when there was just one U.S. telecom giant, AT&T, controlling a huge share of the communications business. Now there`s a growing number of U.S. powerhouses, including WorldCom, Global Crossing (URL: http://www.globalcrossing.com/) and Qwest Communications (URL: http://www.qwest.net/) . 

 TIM BURKE, EDWARD JONES: I mean, we`re talking about Sprint here, a very large company, a very good company. But at the end of the day, we really don`t see where concern over a foreign government buying just one company of a number of different competitors here in the U.S. would be cause for concern. 

 YOUNG: Thirty senators on both sides of the aisle have sent a letter to the chief of the Federal Communications Commission, asking him to pull the plug on any possible Deutsche Telekom-Sprint (URL: http://www.sprint.com) deal. 

 It says, "To allow a foreign government-owned corporation to purchase a U.S. telecommunications company would be putting domestic competitors at the mercy of a foreign government." 

 Analysts say the senators are weighing a possible Deutsche Telekom takeover in the wrong light. 

 BURKE: The question has to be whether or not they`re a good competitor and whether or not they`re going to be good to their customers and ultimately good to shareholders. And if they are, then we`re  all for the merger. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: The senators say they had no objection to the takeover of AirTouch (URL: http://www.vodafone-airtouch-plc.com/) by the British public company Vodafone (URL: http://www.vodafone-airtouch-plc.com/) or Deutsche Telekom`s 10 percent ownership of Sprint. Their opposition is a matter of degree -- Willow. 

 BAY: Sprint has one set of frustrations. What about WorldCom. Now is there the possibility that that long distance business might be in play? 

 YOUNG: There is speculation that WorldCom might sell its long distance business to, fill in the blanks, AOL Disney or Microsoft. 

 BAY: Is this a sector now that in these attempted mergers is likely to frustrate rather than to deliver? 

 YOUNG: Well, in terms of investor, I think you may need to take a more long-term vision. But the landscape is shifting around, the chairs are moving... 

 BAY: It sure is. 

 YOUNG: ... we`ll just have to see. 

 BAY: Steve, thank you. 

 Checking on how those stocks did today, Sprint rose more than 3 1/4 on the news. In New York trading, Deutsche Telekom fell nearly 1, and WorldCom fell three-quarters. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, a buy-out in the bridal business and a check on some of today`s big movers. That`s next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: May Department Stores (URL: http://www.mayco.com/may/) is tying the knot. The owner of Hecht`s and Filene`s is buying David`s Bridal (URL: http://www.davidsbridal.com/) for $436 million, or $20 a share. May says the acquisition will boost its new Internet wedding registry business, Weddingnetwork.com, which is expected to launch by the end of the month. Checking on their stocks, May Department Stores was up a half, David`s Bridal jumped more than 8 1/4. 

 Checking on some other movers tonight, Circle International (URL: http://www.circleintl.com/) , the freight transportation company, rose more than 2 1/4. It is being acquired by rival EGL (URL: http://www.eagleusa.com/) for about $543 million in stock. 

 Roslyn Bancorp (URL: http://www.roslynsavings.com/) jumped more than 2 1/2, or better than 15 percent. The bank holding company is replacing CCB Financial (URL: http://www.ccbonline.com/) in the S&P mid-cap 400 Index. 

 And Akamai Technologies gained more than 7 1/2, or nearly 6.5 percent. Chase H&Q reiterated its buy rating on the stock, after Akamai said it plans to introduce at least one additional service per quarter. Akamai went public in October. It is trading more than 386 percent higher than its offer price of $26 a share. 

 Still ahead on MONEYLINE, meet the entrepreneurs who never have to work another day in their lives but wouldn`t dream of quitting. A MONEYLINE special report, next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: If you`re taking time off this holiday weekend, spare a thought for one of the business world`s rarest species: the entrepreneur rich enough to never work again and dedicated enough to stay on the job anyway. 

 Fred Katayama explains in this MONEYLINE special report. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Kenan Sahin shuffles through his schedule after a business trip to Europe. 

 KENAN SAHIN, PRESIDENT, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES: I have a global conference call, which will bring together some of the key executives of Lucent. 

 KATAYAMA: Sahin is president of Lucent Technologies software products group. Except for a few extravagances, like his Jaguar, he lives simply. SAHIN: I don`t have a driver. I don`t have a housekeeper except cleaners who come once a week. I take care of the other things. 

 KATAYAMA: But Sahin is not your regular salaried blue chip executive. He could afford those luxuries because he`s a billionaire: make that a working  billionaire. He could afford to live the rest of his life off his interest alone. But something keeps him going to work every day. 

 In 1982, Sahin, an immigrant from Turkey, started Kenan Systems to make billing and customer care software for communications companies. He sold it to Lucent Technologies in March last year for $1 1/2 billion. He owned 100 percent of the firm, so he became a billionaire overnight. 

 He`s one of a growing entrepreneurs who have sold their start-ups to technology giants like Lucent, Cisco and Intel, and yet stayed on as executives at the company`s that acquired them. 

 One of Sahin`s Lucent colleagues, Jung Kim, made "Fortune`s" list of 40 richest under 40 after he sold his data equipment company to Lucent 2 years ago for $1 billion. 

 Kim, now president of Lucent`s (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) Carrier Networks, made more than half a billion dollars in the sale. 

 And Andrew Jarecki, co-founder of the film-listing guide and ticketing service Moviefone, continues as CEO of his firm, now a subsidiary of America Online. 

 AOL bought Moviefone for more than $500 million in May last year. At the time, his family controlled more than 90 percent of the shares. 

 All of these executives could have retired early and hit the golf course or left to start another company. 

 (on camera): Normally, entrepreneurs are contractually required to stay with the company that bought their business for at least six months. But roughly 60 percent of them wind up leaving after two years, typically to start another new company. But Sahin does not have a contract with Lucent, so he`s free to leave at any time. 

 (voice-over): But he isn`t about to take a hike. 

 SAHIN: I can walk out any day, but I feel more committed than ever to pushing on. 

 KATAYAMA: What keeps the working rich to committed to their new employers even though they`re no longer in the driver`s seat? The answer: It`s new 

 challenges and opportunities, says this consultant. It`s not the money. 

 JOHN ENGLAND, TOWERS PERRIN: Something else drives them. They want to have value being created in their old company. They want to be part of it, and if they`re not, they can go make another company. 

 ANDREW JARECKI, CEO, AOL MOVIEFONE: What`s different about AOL from a lot of companies is that you are in the process of fundamentally changing the way people get information and services. And so the impact that you have is something that gives you a lot more satisfaction. 

 KATAYAMA: Sahin has more responsibilities. He went from overseeing 750 people at Kenan to 3,200 people at Lucent, where he also founded a center aimed at developing and selling software faster, making it more profitable and marketable. 

 SAHIN: It`s sense of joy to see them really succeed and (UNINTELLIGIBLE). 

 KATAYAMA: Sahin`s former boss, Dan Stanzione, now adviser at Lucent. 

 DAN STANZIONE, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES: People want interesting and exciting work. They want to know they`re making a difference not just in the work they`re doing but in the marketplace. 

 KATAYAMA: Sahin recently made an even more meaningful deal. He got engaged to his girlfriend at the company`s year-end party. But he`s not totally married to his work. He limits himself to putting in 11 to 12 hours  a day. 

 One thing sure for now: He`s not ready to walk out the door just yet.

The Trader
 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 It Was a Down First Half -- by 9.1% -- for the Dow 

 By Andrew Bary

 The world's most famous stock-market barometer didn't exactly sparkle in the just-concluded first half of 2000. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1,050 points, or 9.1%, to 10,447 so far this year, trailing the two other major market averages, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. The Dow did gain 43 points last week, helped by a 49-point rise on Friday, but the index once again trailed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. 

 The S&P added 13 points, a 0.9% rise, to 1454, in the week, narrowing its year-to-date loss to 1%. The Nasdaq rose nearly 121 points, or 3.1%, to 3966, leaving it with a decline so far this year of 2.5%. 

 Bedeviling the Dow this year has been its sizable weighting in the weak group of economically sensitive stocks. Big Dow losers include International Paper, DuPont and Caterpillar. These three stocks hit or came close to reaching new 52-week lows on Friday amid apparent quarter-end window dressing by institutional portfolio managers, who sold the poorly performing cyclicals and banks while buying marquee technology stocks like Cisco Systems, Oracle, Intel and Sun Microsystems, which each had gains of two to three points Friday. 

 The Dow also has been hurt by company-specific problems like those at AT&T, which continued its slide last week. Ma Bell fell 2 1/2 to 31 13/16 in the five sessions after hitting a new 52-week low of 31 1/4, bringing its loss for the year to 38%. AT&T has now lost half its value in the past three months, despite the initial public offering of a tracking stock for its cellular business, AT&T Wireless, which highlighted the low valuation on the rest of the company. The Dow's biggest loser, Procter & Gamble, declined 47% to 57 3/16 on back-to-back quarterly profit disappointments. P&G did rise more than three points Friday. 

 Dow components Honeywell and McDonald's also failed to meet Wall Street's expectations and paid the price. Microsoft, which declined 31% to 80, was pressured by antitrust and profit concerns. 

 General Motors quickly went from champ to chump, rising to a late-April high of 94 5/8 amid enthusiasm for the company's big exchange offer for GM Class H, the tracking stock for Hughes Electronics. But GM has collapsed since the offer ended May 19, closing Friday at 58, down 3 11/16 on the week and off 20% in 2000. Some GM holders are peeved that a group of GM executives took advantage of the arbitrage-related strength in GM during the exchange offer to sell appreciable amounts of GM stock in May. These sales, at around 90, were clearly well-timed but showed little confidence in the company's outlook. GM trades for just six times projected 2000 profits and still owns Hughes stock worth over $20 per GM share, but investors fear that GM's profits have peaked. 

 One apparently smart thing that GM did last week was to not gain the upper hand in the bidding for the insolvent Korean car maker, Daewoo. Rival Ford Motor won the advantage with a preliminary bid of $6.9 billion for the company. Even Ford's Street fans were dubious about it paying such a high price for Daewoo, especially with depressed Ford shares, at 43, fetching only seven times estimated 2000 profits. 

 Just nine of the 30 Dow stocks rose in 2000 and only two, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, made a significant positive contribution to the index's performance. Intel rose 62% to 133 11/16, while H-P was up 40% to 124 3/8. 

 Through Thursday, the Dow's performance would have ranked it in the 97th percentile among diversified U.S. equity mutual funds, meaning that it beat just 3% of all funds, whose average showing was positive 3.2%. If the Dow were an actively managed fund, its portfolio manager might be worrying about job security given performance pressures in the industry. The Dow's poor showing in 2000 follows a solid 1999; its 25.2% gain beat the S&P 500, which was up 19.2%. Yet with many Dow stocks trading with depressed valuations, the index could shine in the year's second half if value-oriented strategies come back into vogue. 

 -- The S&P 500, the benchmark index for institutions, may have moved little in 2000, falling 1% through Friday, but there were ample opportunities to make and lose a lot of money in individual stocks. There also was extraordinary market volatility, at least until the past month. 

 As the table on the following page shows, there was a big disparity in the performance of the top 20 stocks in the S&P in the first half. Intel fared the best, followed by Oracle, Pfizer and EMC, while Microsoft registered the worst showing. 

 The contrast between the modest change in the S&P and the large swings in many major stocks reflects the constant rotation within the market as institutions move from sector to sector and stock to stock but keep their portfolios pretty close to fully invested. 

 -- Philip Morris rose 3 1/8 to 26 1/2 last week as investors reacted favorably to the company's announcement that it plans a sale in early 2001 of a 10%-15% stake in its food business. The sale would include its Kraft division as well as Nabisco Holdings, which Philip Morris agreed to purchase for $55 a share in cash last week. 

 Some analysts and investors think the food business could be worth nearly as much as Philip Morris' current stock price. Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello values Philip Morris at around $62 a share on a sum-of-the-parts basis. The stock now trades for less than half its late 1998 peak of 60 and for under seven times projected 2000 profits as the company continues to suffer from litigation worries. 

 Unisys plunged 10 1/2 to 14 1/2 after warning that its second-quarter profits would fall way below Street expectations, reflecting a shortfall in its services and consulting business. Unisys follows EDS and Computer Sciences, which also have cited a slowdown in services revenues after strong late-year spending in 1999 related to the Y2K bug. Unisys trades for less than a third its 52-week high and for just 10 times estimated 2000 profits. 

 Some large companies apparently began scaling back their e-business initiatives following the Nasdaq's March plunge, resulting in lower services spending. Traditional retailers, whose stocks have been crunched this year on fears of slower consumer spending, may also be cutting back in e-commerce spending now that their Internet rivals are cash-constrained. This could boost the bottom line of such retailers as Federated Department Stores, whose stock is down 33% to 33 3/4 this year and trades for just eight times projected 2000 profits. 

 Things aren't looking good for Reliance Group Holdings, the beleaguered insurer formerly run by onetime corporate raider Saul Steinberg. Reliance last month agreed to sell itself to Leucadia National at a seeming fire-sale price of $2.55 a share, a tiny premium to Reliance's then-current price. But Reliance has fallen since then, declining 9/16 to 3/4 last week amid concerns that Leucadia will walk away from the deal. 

 There were rumors last week that Leucadia doesn't like what it sees in Reliance's books and will pass on buying the insurer. Reliance's debt was downgraded by Moody's on Friday to a low junk rating, jeopardizing the company's ability to make it on a stand-alone basis. Reliance's current stock price suggests that investors are assigning a reasonable likelihood to a complete wipeout for Reliance shareholders. Steinberg owns 29 million Reliance shares, much of which has been pledged against bank loans. The Reliance situation once again shows how book value can be misleading for troubled financial companies. The company's quarter-end book likely stood at around $12 a share, but its financial losses might overwhelm that. 

 -- The summer has barely begun and there already have been spot shortages of electricity around the country and surging prices for power in the deregulated open market in places like California. 

 The electric utility sector has done reasonably well in 2000 after a dismal 1999, but, as with the rest of the market, there have been big disparities in the performance of individual issues. The Dow Jones Utility Index is up 8%, boosted by big gains in its two gas components, Enron and Williams Cos. The pure S&P Electric Index of 28 utilities is up a more modest 3%, led by Reliant Energy, PG&E and PECO Energy, the former Philadelphia Electric. Losers include CMS Energy, Edison International, TXU (parent of Texas Utilities) and Consolidated Edison. The average utility has a dividend now of 5.5%. The Dow Utility Index was crunched on Friday, losing more than 2%. 

 Steve Fleishman, utility analyst at Merrill Lynch, says there is apt to be continued variance in performance among the stocks. So far this year, companies with substantial generating capacity have tended to perform well, and he expects that trend to continue. Likewise, those utilities that have exited the generating business and are exposed to the now-brutal open market for power have underperformed in 2000. Fleishman remains cautious on this group. 

 Fleishman likes PECO, which is set to merge with Unicom, the former Commonwealth Edison, in September. At 40 1/4, PECO trades for 11 times projected 2000 profits. He notes that PECO has sizable nuclear generating capacity, which puts the company in a good position in the face of surging natural-gas prices. 

 His other favorites include Dominion Resources, Public Service Electric & Gas and Reliant. 

 Fleishman half jokingly told Barron's in late 1999 that electric companies were back-door Internet plays because the rising use of computers meant higher electric consumption. He has been right; electric consumption is up around 4% this year after rising just 2%-2.5% in prior years. California consumption is particularly robust, up 5% so far this year with blackouts already occurring in the San Francisco area. The California power situation is very tight because the state is short on generating capacity and needs to import power. 

 Fleishman is concerned about companies that could end up being short power this summer, including CMS Energy, Cinergy, Con Edison, DTE Energy, GPU (parent of General Public Utilities), Ipalco and Sierra Pacific. 

 One former highflyer, Avista (the old Washington Water Power), has been hammered because of its exposure to soaring power prices in the Northwest. Its 2000 profits, once estimated at over $1 a share, now are expected to be breakeven at best. Its shares, at 17 1/2, are down six points since its June profit warning. The stock peaked at 68 in January when investors were excited about its fuel-cell division and e-business units. 

 -- Asset-management companies are commanding record prices these days, with BankAmerica last week paying $950 million, or a whopping 12% of assets, to acquire the half of Marsico Capital Management that it didn't already own. 

 The high valuations of money-management firms could benefit Alleghany. The company is a low-profile New York conglomerate that owns Alleghany Asset Management, which manages $48 billion. Alleghany's thinly traded shares finished Friday at 168, down 8% this year. The company has 7.4 million shares outstanding, valuing it at $1.3 billion. 

 "The way we look at it, you're effectively getting the asset manager inside Alleghany for nothing," says Peter Russ, analyst at Fairholme Capital, a Short Hills, New Jersey, money manager. Russ values Alleghany at around $245 a share. 

 Alleghany, run by a 32-year company veteran, John Burns, has slimmed down considerably in the past two years, spinning off its title insurance operation, Chicago Title, to shareholders in June 1998 and selling its reinsurance operations to Swiss Re in April. The company's principal assets now consist of 18 million shares of Burlington Northern, the railroad operator, worth around $60 per Alleghany share, roughly $55 a share in cash and another $60 a share in other assets, including insurance and minerals operations and some real estate in California. 

 Russ conservatively values the asset-management arm -- its principal division is Montag & Caldwell, a successful manager with strong equity performance in recent years -- at around $500 million, or roughly 1% of assets. That's about $70 per Alleghany share. Alleghany Asset isn't worth as much as some money managers because its asset base is skewed toward lower-fee institutional accounts. 

 But if Alleghany Asset were valued at five times revenues, the average price in recent transactions, it would be worth $840 million, or $115 per Alleghany share before taxes. 


Russ believes Alleghany may make a cash distribution and buy back a
sizable amount of stock using the proceeds from the sale of the
reinsurance business. There has been some speculation that Alleghany
might liquidate itself because Burns is 68 and the company's chairman,
F.M. Kirby, is 80. Various members of the Kirby family control 35% of
Alleghany stock. But Burns, who has a small cult following on Wall
Street, has indicated no interest in retiring. He told shareholders at
the annual meeting that Alleghany "is once again in a position to
redefine itself." What that means remains to be seen.

 Unisys Warns that Profit Will Trail Forecasts --- Computer Company's Shares Plunge on Lowered Expectations

 Unisys Corp. expects its earnings to be sharply below analysts' expectations and revenue to decline for the second quarter, news that sent its stock price plunging amid further questions about its turnaround under Chief Executive Lawrence Weinbach.   

 Unisys shares fell 38%, or $9.0625, to $14.5625 on the news late Thursday but rose to $15 on Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   

 "They've missed four quarters in a row," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "You can only make so many excuses."   

 The Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, computer maker and computer-services company expects second-quarter revenue will be $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion, down 13% to 15% from last year's strong $1.89 billion. It blamed deferral of several large contract awards, weak sales to U.S. government agencies and a negative currency-translation impact of 3% to 4%, mostly due to the weak euro.   

 Unisys expects earnings, before a small charge, will fall to 18 cents to 20 cents a share, down from 37 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected Unisys to report earnings about equal to last year's level.   

 Mr. Weinbach said that second-half results will beat year-earlier levels, but revenue and earnings for the full year will trail 1999 by "a mid-single-digit percentage."   

 Donald Young, an analyst with Paine Webber, said "last year was an artificial peak. Now we've returned to the ugly reality." He said that many customers bought Unisys computers early last year because they wanted to make sure they had their equipment ready for the year 2000 computer bug. The company no longer enjoys that sales boost.   

 Mr. Weinbach took over as CEO in 1998, and building on his experience as head of Andersen Worldwide's computer-services business embarked on a course to de-emphasize hardware and push strongly into computer services. He also slashed debt as the stock price rose, and led debtholders to convert their holdings into stock.   

 But the services business -- now about 70% of overall company revenue, up from 60% two years ago -- is much less profitable than Unisys's big computer systems, which are used by clients such as banks and airlines. And growth in computer-services contracts has been disappointing for large companies that are losing ground to fast-growing Internet-commerce specialists like Scient Corp., Viant Corp. and Digitas Corp. Earlier this month, another big computer-services company, Electronic Data Systems Inc., issued a profit warning, causing its stock to fall sharply.   

 Adding to Unisys's problems is a reorganization of its sales force. Mr. Weinbach told analysts that retraining the sales force continues.   

 "We'd hoped the fundamental improvement in services would start this quarter. But there are still basic structural issues like retraining the sales staff," said Richard Jacobs, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott.   

 Mr. Jacobs said the performance problems and low stock price are likely to revive speculation about a possible takeover. "Certainly the company is a valuable enterprise with a number of extremely attractive franchises," he said.

AMERICAN GREETINGS CHIEF QUITS 

American Greetings Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer Edward Fruchtenbaum resigned Monday, effective immediately, while board member James C. Spira has been named vice chairman, a new position. The greeting card company said it was the appropriate time for Fruchtenbaum, a 27-year veteran, to move on to interests outside American Greetings. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Morry Weiss will take Fruchtenbaum's responsibilities. "While we can't get into specifics at this time, the company, Morry and Ed decided it was the right time for Ed to move on," said Jeff Petit, vice president of communications. 

GAS PRICES FINALLY DIP 

Gasoline prices fell 10-14 cents last week, enough to buy a little relief for Northeast Ohio motorists. On average, area residents Monday paid $1.86 per gallon, down from $1.95 per gallon the previous Thursday, according to the Cuyahoga County auditor's office. Prices dropped further during the week. After paying $2 for a gallon of regular two weeks before, even a slight drop was cause for cheer. Service-station owner Pat LaVecchia, president of the Ohio Petroleum Retailers and Repair Association, said increased gasoline supply was allowing prices to fall through July 4. 

FED LEAVES RATES ALONE 

Federal Reserve policy-makers, meeting Monday and Tuesday, left U.S. interest rates unchanged and warned the economy is still growing at a pace that threatens accelerating inflation, suggesting the Fed could increase borrowing costs by August unless further signs of slower growth emerge. The Federal Open Market Committee's decision to leave the overnight bank rate at 6.5 percent follows recent economic statistics showing a drop in new-home construction and a rise in the nation's unemployment rate to 4.1 percent in May. 

REIT CUTS DIVIDEND 

Associated Estates Realty Corp. slashed its dividend by a third Tuesday. The move by the Richmond Heights real estate investment trust isn't likely to please shareholders, at least some of whom have held onto its stock because it has paid an extremely high dividend rate - more than 21 percent. The company had to cut dividends, it said, because it hasn't been earning enough to pay its heretofore high dividend in recent quarters. In the first quarter, Associated reported funds from operations of 25 cents. That's how much the company's quarterly dividend will be, effective Aug. 1, to shareholders of record on July 14. It's down from 37.5 cents previously. 

CWRU LOSING STAR 

A noted Case Western Reserve University geneticist whose work attracts more federal medical research money than any other academic scientist in Ohio is leaving for Johns Hopkins University, where he will oversee a new institute for the study and treatment of genetic diseases. The departure of Aravinda Chakravarti, announced Wednesday, is a blow to CWRU's School of Medicine. The university will lose not only Chakravarti's capabilities in the study of genetic diseases but grant-winning skills that brought in $5.1 million in 1999 from the National Institutes of Health. He will be director of Hopkins' McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine and take his lab staff with him. 

MINORITY OPPORTUNITY 

The Rev. Jesse Jackson's Ninth Street Project, which seeks to improve opportunities for minorities at big corporations in the Cleveland area, focuses on 10 companies. A number of the targeted companies said Wednesday they didn't know enough about the project to respond, though most generally embraced its goal. "I welcome the opportunity to discuss the subject with them," said Ed Crawford, chairman at Park-Ohio Holdings, one of the 10. The others are: American Greetings, Cole National, Diebold, B.F. Goodrich, NACCO Industries, OfficeMax, Sherwin-Williams, Steris and Timken. The companies have no minorities on their boards of directors, except for American Greetings, which recently added Cuyahoga Community College President Jerry Sue Thornton, who is black. 

LONDON FLIGHTS ARE HOT 

In the year since Continental Airlines launched nonstop Cleveland- London service, it filled 80,000 seats on the daily flights. Despite strong demand, travelers longing to replace the flight's one-aisle Boeing 757 with a wide-body plane may have a long wait. Continental doesn't expect to have a jet available for a few years. Continental has filled about 65 percent of seats since the flight's start last June 30. Rolfe Shellenberger, a senior consultant with Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm specializing in travel, said 60 percent is considered reasonable when an airline starts a new route. "We couldn't be more pleased," said John Slater, Continental's senior director of sales for the Midwest. 

GOODYEAR PROFIT WARNING

Akron-based Goodyear Tire &Rubber Co.'s decision to raise tire prices will flatten its bottom line and likely pump up rivals. It said Thursday it expects to earn 37 cents per share when it releases second-quarter results on July 24, an unpleasant surprise to Wall Street analysts, even though it's about level with last year's second- quarter results (minus one-time charges). The analysts that Nelson Information service surveyed had pegged earnings per share this time at around 64 cents but lowered estimates to 59 cents. "It was what we feared and more," said Olde Discount Corp. stock analyst Edgar Faler. Executives said sales slumped during the quarter after tire dealers refused to accept price increases and shifted orders to cheaper competitors.

  It Was A Down First Half -- By 9.1% -- For The Dow
  By Andrew Bary



The world's most famous stock-market barometer didn't exactly sparkle
in the just-concluded first half of 2000.


 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 1,050 points, or 9.1%, to 10,447 so far this year, trailing the two other major market averages, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. The Dow did gain 43 points last week, helped by a 49-point rise on Friday, but the index once again trailed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. 

 The S&P added 13 points, a 0.9% rise, to 1454, in the week, narrowing its year-to-date loss to 1%. The Nasdaq rose nearly 121 points, or 3.1%, to 3966, leaving it with a decline so far this year of 2.5%. 

 Bedeviling the Dow this year has been its sizable weighting in the weak group of economically sensitive stocks. Big Dow losers include International Paper, DuPont and Caterpillar. These three stocks hit or came close to reaching new 52-week lows on Friday amid apparent quarter-end window dressing by institutional portfolio managers, who sold the poorly performing cyclicals and banks while buying marquee technology stocks like Cisco Systems, Oracle, Intel and Sun Microsystems, which each had gains of two to three points Friday. 

 The Dow also has been hurt by company-specific problems like those at AT&T, which continued its slide last week. Ma Bell fell 2 1/2 to 31 13/16 in the five sessions after hitting a new 52-week low of 31 1/4, bringing its loss for the year to 38%. AT&T has now lost half its value in the past three months, despite the initial public offering of a tracking stock for its cellular business, AT&T Wireless, which highlighted the low valuation on the rest of the company. The Dow's biggest loser, Procter & Gamble, declined 47% to 57 3/16 on back-to-back quarterly profit disappointments. P&G did rise more than three points Friday. 

 Dow components Honeywell and McDonald's also failed to meet Wall Street's expectations and paid the price. Microsoft, which declined 31% to 80, was pressured by antitrust and profit concerns. 

 General Motors quickly went from champ to chump, rising to a late-April high of 94 5/8 amid enthusiasm for the company's big exchange offer for GM Class H, the tracking stock for Hughes Electronics. But GM has collapsed since the offer ended May 19, closing Friday at 58, down 3 11/16 on the week and off 20% in 2000. Some GM holders are peeved that a group of GM executives took advantage of the arbitrage-related strength in GM during the exchange offer to sell appreciable amounts of GM stock in May. These sales, at around 90, were clearly well-timed but showed little confidence in the company's outlook. GM trades for just six times projected 2000 profits and still owns Hughes stock worth over $20 per GM share, but investors fear that GM's profits have peaked. 

 One apparently smart thing that GM did last week was to not gain the upper hand in the bidding for the insolvent Korean car maker, Daewoo. Rival Ford Motor won the advantage with a preliminary bid of $6.9 billion for the company. Even Ford's Street fans were dubious about it paying such a high price for Daewoo, especially with depressed Ford shares, at 43, fetching only seven times estimated 2000 profits. 

 Just nine of the 30 Dow stocks rose in 2000 and only two, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, made a significant positive contribution to the index's performance. Intel rose 62% to 133 11/16, while H-P was up 40% to 124 3/8. 

 Through Thursday, the Dow's performance would have ranked it in the 97th percentile among diversified U.S. equity mutual funds, meaning that it beat just 3% of all funds, whose average showing was positive 3.2%. If the Dow were an actively managed fund, its portfolio manager might be worrying about job security given performance pressures in the industry. The Dow's poor showing in 2000 follows a solid 1999; its 25.2% gain beat the S&P 500, which was up 19.2%. Yet with many Dow stocks trading with depressed valuations, the index could shine in the year's second half if value-oriented strategies come back into vogue. 

 -- The S&P 500, the benchmark index for institutions, may have moved little in 2000, falling 1% through Friday, but there were ample opportunities to make and lose a lot of money in individual stocks. There also was extraordinary market volatility, at least until the past month. 

 As the table on the following page shows, there was a big disparity in the performance of the top 20 stocks in the S&P in the first half. Intel fared the best, followed by Oracle, Pfizer and EMC, while Microsoft registered the worst showing. 

 The contrast between the modest change in the S&P and the large swings in many major stocks reflects the constant rotation within the market as institutions move from sector to sector and stock to stock but keep their portfolios pretty close to fully invested. 

 -- Philip Morris rose 3 1/8 to 26 1/2 last week as investors reacted favorably to the company's announcement that it plans a sale in early 2001 of a 10%-15% stake in its food business. The sale would include its Kraft division as well as Nabisco Holdings, which Philip Morris agreed to purchase for $55 a share in cash last week. 

 Some analysts and investors think the food business could be worth nearly as much as Philip Morris' current stock price. Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello values Philip Morris at around $62 a share on a sum-of-the-parts basis. The stock now trades for less than half its late 1998 peak of 60 and for under seven times projected 2000 profits as the company continues to suffer from litigation worries. 

 Unisys plunged 10 1/2 to 14 1/2 after warning that its second-quarter profits would fall way below Street expectations, reflecting a shortfall in its services and consulting business. Unisys follows EDS and Computer Sciences, which also have cited a slowdown in services revenues after strong late-year spending in 1999 related to the Y2K bug. Unisys trades for less than a third its 52-week high and for just 10 times estimated 2000 profits. 

 Some large companies apparently began scaling back their e-business initiatives following the Nasdaq's March plunge, resulting in lower services spending. Traditional retailers, whose stocks have been crunched this year on fears of slower consumer spending, may also be cutting back in e-commerce spending now that their Internet rivals are cash-constrained. This could boost the bottom line of such retailers as Federated Department Stores, whose stock is down 33% to 33 3/4 this year and trades for just eight times projected 2000 profits. 

 Things aren't looking good for Reliance Group Holdings, the beleaguered insurer formerly run by onetime corporate raider Saul Steinberg. Reliance last month agreed to sell itself to Leucadia National at a seeming fire-sale price of $2.55 a share, a tiny premium to Reliance's then-current price. But Reliance has fallen since then, declining 9/16 to 3/4 last week amid concerns that Leucadia will walk away from the deal. 

 There were rumors last week that Leucadia doesn't like what it sees in Reliance's books and will pass on buying the insurer. Reliance's debt was downgraded by Moody's on Friday to a low junk rating, jeopardizing the company's ability to make it on a stand-alone basis. Reliance's current stock price suggests that investors are assigning a reasonable likelihood to a complete wipeout for Reliance shareholders. Steinberg owns 29 million Reliance shares, much of which has been pledged against bank loans. The Reliance situation once again shows how book value can be misleading for troubled financial companies. The company's quarter-end book likely stood at around $12 a share, but its financial losses might overwhelm that. 

 -- The summer has barely begun and there already have been spot shortages of electricity around the country and surging prices for power in the deregulated open market in places like California. 

 The electric utility sector has done reasonably well in 2000 after a dismal 1999, but, as with the rest of the market, there have been big disparities in the performance of individual issues. The Dow Jones Utility Index is up 8%, boosted by big gains in its two gas components, Enron and Williams Cos. The pure S&P Electric Index of 28 utilities is up a more modest 3%, led by Reliant Energy, PG&E and PECO Energy, the former Philadelphia Electric. Losers include CMS Energy, Edison International, TXU (parent of Texas Utilities) and Consolidated Edison. The average utility has a dividend now of 5.5%. The Dow Utility Index was crunched on Friday, losing more than 2%. 

 Steve Fleishman, utility analyst at Merrill Lynch, says there is apt to be continued variance in performance among the stocks. So far this year, companies with substantial generating capacity have tended to perform well, and he expects that trend to continue. Likewise, those utilities that have exited the generating business and are exposed to the now-brutal open market for power have underperformed in 2000. Fleishman remains cautious on this group. 

 Fleishman likes PECO, which is set to merge with Unicom, the former Commonwealth Edison, in September. At 40 1/4, PECO trades for 11 times projected 2000 profits. He notes that PECO has sizable nuclear generating capacity, which puts the company in a good position in the face of surging natural-gas prices. 

 His other favorites include Dominion Resources, Public Service Electric & Gas and Reliant. 

 Fleishman half jokingly told Barron's in late 1999 that electric companies were back-door Internet plays because the rising use of computers meant higher electric consumption. He has been right; electric consumption is up around 4% this year after rising just 2%-2.5% in prior years. California consumption is particularly robust, up 5% so far this year with blackouts already occurring in the San Francisco area. The California power situation is very tight because the state is short on generating capacity and needs to import power. 

 Fleishman is concerned about companies that could end up being short power this summer, including CMS Energy, Cinergy, Con Edison, DTE Energy, GPU (parent of General Public Utilities), Ipalco and Sierra Pacific. 

 One former highflyer, Avista (the old Washington Water Power), has been hammered because of its exposure to soaring power prices in the Northwest. Its 2000 profits, once estimated at over $1 a share, now are expected to be breakeven at best. Its shares, at 17 1/2, are down six points since its June profit warning. The stock peaked at 68 in January when investors were excited about its fuel-cell division and e-business units. 

 -- Asset-management companies are commanding record prices these days, with BankAmerica last week paying $950 million, or a whopping 12% of assets, to acquire the half of Marsico Capital Management that it didn't already own. 

 The high valuations of money-management firms could benefit Alleghany. The company is a low-profile New York conglomerate that owns Alleghany Asset Management, which manages $48 billion. Alleghany's thinly traded shares finished Friday at 168, down 8% this year. The company has 7.4 million shares outstanding, valuing it at $1.3 billion. 

 "The way we look at it, you're effectively getting the asset manager inside Alleghany for nothing," says Peter Russ, analyst at Fairholme Capital, a Short Hills, New Jersey, money manager. Russ values Alleghany at around $245 a share. 

 Alleghany, run by a 32-year company veteran, John Burns, has slimmed down considerably in the past two years, spinning off its title insurance operation, Chicago Title, to shareholders in June 1998 and selling its reinsurance operations to Swiss Re in April. The company's principal assets now consist of 18 million shares of Burlington Northern, the railroad operator, worth around $60 per Alleghany share, roughly $55 a share in cash and another $60 a share in other assets, including insurance and minerals operations and some real estate in California. 

 Russ conservatively values the asset-management arm -- its principal division is Montag & Caldwell, a successful manager with strong equity performance in recent years -- at around $500 million, or roughly 1% of assets. That's about $70 per Alleghany share. Alleghany Asset isn't worth as much as some money managers because its asset base is skewed toward lower-fee institutional accounts. 

 But if Alleghany Asset were valued at five times revenues, the average price in recent transactions, it would be worth $840 million, or $115 per Alleghany share before taxes. 


Russ believes Alleghany may make a cash distribution and buy back a
sizable amount of stock using the proceeds from the sale of the
reinsurance business. There has been some speculation that Alleghany
might liquidate itself because Burns is 68 and the company's chairman,
F.M. Kirby, is 80. Various members of the Kirby family control 35% of
Alleghany stock. But Burns, who has a small cult following on Wall
Street, has indicated no interest in retiring. He told shareholders at
the annual meeting that Alleghany "is once again in a position to
redefine itself." What that means remains to be seen.

                     HOW THEY FARED
  -- Here's the performance of the top 20 stocks in the S&P 500 Index
in the first half of 2000. Tech leaders Intel, Oracle, EMC and Nortel
scored big gains after large increases in 1999. Pfizer was up sharply,
pacing the strong drug sector. Former top 20 members AT&T, Home Depot
and America Online fell off the list after declining in the first
half.

 Cap Gemini says has not changed profit outlook.

 PARIS, June 23 (Reuters) - French computer firm Cap Gemini, hit by rumours of a profit warning, said on Friday it had not changed its outlook since a May analyst meeting but could not comment further on future profits so close to half-year results. 

 "We cannot officially comment because we are in the middle of working out our half-year earnings," a spokeswoman for Cap Gemini told Reuters, as the share slid five percent. 

 "But we gave our profit outlook for 2000 at an analysts' meeting in May and no different indications have been made or complimentary information given since then," she said. 

 Cap Gemini shares were down 4.57 percent at 188.0 euros at 1107 GMT, while the CAC-40 index was off 0.38 percent, with traders citing jitters that the company might issue a profit warning given the difficult climate in the IT sector. 

 The stock had the seventh highest bourse turnover with 144.6 million euros traded. 

 Cap Gemini said at the May meeting it expected revenue to grow 12-14 percent in the full-year 2000 and an operating margin in the 10-11 percent range. 

 Board member Paul Hermelin told a French weekly at the time that consolidating Cap Gemini's newly acquired consultancy arm Ernst & Young would be neutral on margins but should bring 5-10 percent extra sales growth per year from 2001. 

 In the first quarter of 2000 Cap Gemini alone posted sales of 1.079 billion euros, up 2.7 percent, while Ernst & Young Consulting saw sales grow by two percent. 

 An industry source said Friday's rumours may have been sparked by an expected delay to the company's half-year earnings announcement which the spokeswoman said was due to the extra time needed to integrate Ernst & Young. 

 The spokeswoman said Cap Gemini would be later than usual with reporting first-half earnings due to the extra workload, but said the figures would come within the legal deadline. 

 BROKER DOWNGRADE ALSO WEIGHS 

 Earlier on Friday, UBS Warburg downgraded Cap Gemini to "buy" from "strong buy" citing general concerns over earnings in the IT sector rather than any specific worries over the firm. 

 The investment bank also cut its 2000 and 2001 earnings per share forecasts to 4.2 and 5.3 euros per share from 4.5 and 6.3 euros respectively, UBS Warbury analyst Will Wallis said, noting that the previous 2001 estimate had been on the high side. 

 "It's largely the fact that we've had a series of profit warnings in the IT sector so we are a little cautious all round," Wallis told Reuters. 

 "We are not signalling any specific concerns on Cap Gemini. Even if the numbers came out in line with our new forecasts that would not constitute a profit warning." 

 Recent profit warnings in the IT sector include Britain's ICM Computer Group, Computacenter, and Compel Plc, and U.S. firms eMachines and Systemax, amid a slower-than-expected recovery in the sector following millennium bug fears at the end of 1999.

 WEST BEND, Wis., June 23 (Reuters) - Construction and agricultural equipment maker Gehl Co. said Friday it expects lower earnings for the second quarter and full year due to unfavourable market conditions in North America and higher interest rates. 

 Earnings per share for the second quarter are currently expected to be in a range of 87 cents per share to 89 cents, and for the full year could be 24 percent to 27 percent below 1999's earnings of $3.17, the company said. 

 The profit warning sent shares of Gehl down 3-3/8 to 14-5/8 in morning trade on Nasdaq. Earlier, shares hit a fresh 52-week low of 14. 

 A poll of Wall Street analysts by First Call/Thomson Financial pegged Gehl's second quarter earnings per share at $1.21 and full-year 2000 earnings at $3.63 a share. 

 In the year-ago second quarter, Gehl earned $1.01 a share. 

 Gehl also said it expects sales in the second quarter of 2000 will be 9 percent to 11 percent lower than the second quarter of 1999. For the full year 2000, It expects sales will be 2 percent to 4 percent less than the full year 1999. 

 "We have reacted quickly to these market conditions by reducing production levels in an attempt to achieve appropriate inventory levels for this economic environment" said William Gehl, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "In addition, we have continued to focus on improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and cost control. We intend to stimulate retail sales in the second half of the year through the use of competitive sales and promotional programmes," he said in a news release. 

 In its agricultural equipment business, Gehl said factors contributing to an expected 12 to 13 percent decline in second-quarter sales from a year-ago include milk prices falling below $10 per cwt in six of the past seven months, higher interest rates and regional weather conditions. 

 Gehl also said it expects construction equipment sales to decline 7 to 8 percent from year-ago in the second quarter due in part to the effect of higher interest rates on construction activity, especially in the U.S. housing sector, and low equipment rental rates.

 Nasdaq tanks with Internet firms - wipes week's gain.

 (Reuters is combining its twice daily Nasdaq stock reports into its more regularly updated overall U.S. stock reports, starting July 1, 2000. This will mean no change in frequency. The U.S. market reports will still be available on the Reuters terminal shortcut codes .N and .O.) 

 NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq ended the week on a sour note as big Internet names tanked and Wall Street analysts made harsh comments about No. 1 Web retailer Amazon.com. 

 The Nasdaq composite fell 91.50 points, or 2.32 percent, to 3,845.34, hard on the heels of a three percent loss Thursday, as funds flowed into "Old Economy" sectors. 

 The decline effectively wiped away all this week's gain and left the index about 15 points below where it started Monday. The Nasdaq is now off 5.5 percent off year-to-date after flirting with the break-even level earlier in the week. 

 And while the blue-chip Dow Industrial average rose 28.63 points to close at 10,404.75, the Nasdaq 100 index of top stocks shed 118.81 points, or 3.12 percent, to 3,685.30. 

 Amazon shares, which at one point fell to a new 52-week low of 32-15/32 for a percentage loss of nearly 23 percent, finished the day 8-1/8 down at 33-7/8 on volume of 51.8 million shares, which made it the volume leader Friday. 

 The decline followed comments from analysts who raised doubts about the firm's credit-worthiness and revenue growth. 

 The slide pressured other Internet companies like e-media firm Yahoo! Inc., Web auctioneer eBay Inc. and Priceline.com Inc.. Yahoo fell 6-3/8 to 125-5/16, eBay 4-5/16 to 53-7/8 and Priceline 3-1/2 to 41-13/16. 

 Internet routing equipment maker Cisco Systems, the Nasdaq composite's most heavily weighted stock, fell 1-15/16 to 62-5/8. Oracle Corp. eased 2 to 79-1/2. 

 Friday's trading activity was on the thin side, with 1.38 billion shares changing hands, continuing this week's trend. Although Fridays tend to be lower volume days, traders said this trend was also pegged to the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, keenly awaited by market players. 

 The Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has gone on a spate of rate increases since last June in a bid to stem inflation. Despite unanimity, the U.S. central bank is not likely to raise rates at this meeting, investors are concerned about what chairman Alan Greenspan will say about the economy and the implications for rates longer-term. 

 "The market is captive to the Fed," noted Williams Capital Group in a report Friday. 

 "Even if there is no rate increase, another harsh, strident statement of guidance from the FOMC could still spook the equity market. If this does not happen, then the equity market should rally," it added. 

 Agreed Bill Meehan, Cantor Fitzgerald's chief market analyst: "You probably are not going to see a lot of major players take a lot of action until we get towards Wednesday. 

 "If we continue to see signs the economy is slowing, one can safely conclude that you are not going to be faced with a very aggressive Fed, which has been hanging over the market." 

 Among other declines, software giant Microsoft Corp. MSFT.O and Siebel Systems Inc., a maker of customer service software, fell on some profit-taking, dealers said. Microsoft fell 2-3/16 to 77-11/16 and Siebel 6-9/16 to 145-1/8. 

 Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of network software, fell 4-1/16 to 18-11/16. The company said its founder and Chairman Edward Iacobucci had resigned as part of a management shake-up following the firm's recent profit-warning. 

 Biotechs gave back early gains, with the sectoral index .IXB) closing 9.21 points, or 0.78 percent off at 1,172.38. 

 Although some biotech firms held in the black, many of the bigger names fell, including Immunex Corp., 5-9/16 to 50-3/8, Genome Therapeutics Corp., 2-7/16 to 29-3/4 and Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. 4-15/16 to 119-9/16. 

 But on a more positive note, the semiconductor sector finished higher. The Philadelphia semiconductor index finished the day 6.97 points, or 0.58 percent, up at 1,217.28. Intel Corp., the leading chipmaker, closed in the black but off highs, 5/16 up at 134-3/8. 

 Heavily-traded Rambus Inc. piled on the gains, closing 17-9/16 up at 114-11/16 on volume of 28 million shares, continuing to draw fuel from reports the semiconductor technology firm had settled patent lawsuits with Japan's Hitachi Ltd.. Rambus' price target was raised sharply by investment house UBS Warburg to $165 from $115. 

 "They (semiconductor firms) are the most important leadership group in the important leadership sector, which is technology. I would expect them to be pretty strong to the end of the quarter," Cantor's Meehan told Reuters. 

 Taking a technical view of the market, Meehan said any violation of the 3,800-3,900 area in the Nasdaq composite could open the way for a dip to fill a big upside gap between the June 1 and June 2 highs of 3,583.27 and 3,814.50.

 Agricultural-Equipment Maker Gehl Issues 2nd-Quarter  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Agricultural and construction-equipment manufacturer Gehl Co. Friday announced it expects to report second-quarter earnings below analysts' expectations, citing unfavorable market conditions and higher interest rates. 

 For the quarter ended June 30, Gehl (GEHL) expects to report earnings of between 87 cents and 89 cents a share. The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of $1.21 a share. Gehl reported earnings of $6.8 million, or $1.01 a share, on sales of $83.9 million in the year-earlier period. 

 Gehl expects to post a second-quarter sales decline of 9% to 11%. a full-year sales decline of 2% to 4%. 

 Gehl Co., based in West Bend, Wis., said it expects a 12% to 13% decline in agricultural-equipment sales because of a drop in milk prices during six of the last seven months. The company said dairy farmers enjoying higher prices in 1998 and 1999 spurred higher equipment sales in those periods. 

 The company also said construction equipment sales in the quarter will fall 7% to 8%. Gehl plans to introduce more products for both the construction and agricultural markets early in 2001. 

 For the second quarter and full year, Gehl expects higher-than-previously forecasted interest expense, as a result of debt and interest rate levels being higher than planned. 

 On Wednesday, shares of CNH Global NV plunged after the Dutch-American maker of agricultural and construction equipment warned their second-quarter results would also fall below expecations. 

 The company, formed last November through New Holland NV's $4.3 billion acquisition of heavy-quipment maker Case Corp., cited weak markets in North America and Latin America. 

 CNH, the world's largest maker of tractors and combines, said weak commodity prices and uncertainty over this year's harvest in North America hurt sales of four-wheel drive tractors and combines.

Abreast of the Market
 Intel, PMC-Sierra, Xilinx Drop As Chip Sector Spoils Nasdaq Run

 NEW YORK -- Bullish investors' hopes of turning back the clock -- pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index back up to where it started the year -- fizzled as market averages took a solid drubbing.   

 Semiconductor issues, the engine of the recent recovery, played the role of spoiler. Intel lost 4 15/16 to 134 1/16, while PMC-Sierra fell 13 1/16 to 190 5/16, and Xilinx lost 9 1/8 to 88 13/16, all on the Nasdaq Stock Market.   

 Micron Technology fell 6 1/16 to 84 13/16 on the New York Stock Exchange, ahead of the chip maker's quarterly profit statement, due out after the close of the session. Traders said investors anticipated that any good news had been priced into the shares, which reached a 52-week high Wednesday. The Boise, Idaho, company swung to a profit in the fiscal third quarter as sales more than doubled.   

 Internet stocks also hurried to the downside. Yahoo! dropped 11 1/8 to 131 11/16 on Nasdaq. The stock has been the source of some controversy on Wall Street. Lehman Brothers, for example, took a pessimistic view of the issue in a report Wednesday. Yesterday, Merrill Lynch weighed in with support, saying the Internet search engine's core business remains strong, but it wasn't enough to forestall a decline.   

 To be sure, the session wasn't a washout across the board, even within technology. Alteon WebSystems gained 9 3/8 to 91 7/8 on Nasdaq, after Lehman Brothers raised its estimates on the Web-products maker. Qualcomm ended 3 3/4 higher at 68 1/4 on Nasdaq, after reaching 73 7/8 intraday, on speculation, thus far unwarranted, that Nokia might bid for the wireless-systems developer. Qualcomm declined to comment on the speculation.   

 Still, losers outnumbered winners on the Nasdaq Stock Market by a wide margin; breadth there finished about 8-to-5 to the negative. So the Nasdaq composite, which came into yesterday needing a little more than five points to get back to where it started the year, couldn't make the leap.   

 The index finished 127.17 points weaker, off 3.13%, at 3936.84.   

 "We were bound to run into a capitulation day once this week," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies. "But I think that, overall, we'll start seeing more support as we move closer to the FOMC meeting next week for the summer rally," he added, referring to next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.   

 Energy stocks weakened, even as crude-oil prices rallied again, a gain that, on the face of it, seemed counterintuitive, inasmuch as Wednesday's decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production might have suggested commodity prices should dim on supply-demand considerations.   

 Still, Chevron fell 1 11/16 to 89 9/16, Exxon Mobil lost 1 1/4 to 82 11/16, and Texaco declined 1 1/2 to 56 1/4. Some traders believed the production increases won't be sufficient to rebuild depleted inventories of energy products in the second half of the year, when demand generally strengthens.   

 Amerada Hess lost 1 7/8 to 65 7/8, while Kerr-McGee declined 1 7/16 to 59 13/16, and USX-Marathon eased 7/16 to 27 3/16.   

 Drug makers, which had been popular safety stocks recently when investors worried that slowing economic expansion would hurt profit gains for growth companies, fell. Pharmacia fell 3 5/8 to 51 3/4. Pfizer declined 1 1/8 to 45 3/4. Schering-Plough dropped 2 to 46 15/16. Merck gave up 1 1/16 to 71 1/4.   

 Among blue chips, consumer issues proved to be one of the few groups that rallied. Coca-Cola moved ahead 2 5/8 to 56 1/8. Adolph Coors advanced 1 1/4 to 62 11/16. Anheuser-Busch gained 1 1/4 to 76.   

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a loss of 121.62, or 1.16%, to 10376.12.   

 Cyclical stocks, under pressure this week after some prominent names warned of earnings shortfalls, continued to decline. Deere fell 2 3/16 to 37 1/16, even though Bear Stearns said in a research note that trends in the Moline, Ill., farm-machinery-maker's operations suggested that sales and earnings should climb. CNH Global, a rival equipment maker that sank to a 52-week low Wednesday on a profit warning, scrambled back, added 3/8 to 9.   

 Honeywell, which sank to a 52-week low Tuesday following a profitwarning of its own, lost 1 13/16 to 35, after UBS Warburg cut its rating on the Morris Township, N.J., maker of home and industrial controls, aerospace systems and specialty chemicals.   

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter dropped 2 7/16 to 83 3/16. The New York brokerage firm reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street's forecasts. However, those profits dropped below its first-quarter total, hurt by declines in the value of its portfolio of investments.   

 Other brokerage issues followed suit. Merrill Lynch fell 5 13/16 to 115 3/16. Lehman Brothers shed 2 9/16 to 89 5/8. Goldman Sachs Group declined 2 3/8 to 84 1/4.   

 Fisher Scientific lost 9 9/16 to 28 7/16. The Hampton, N.H., science-equipment distributor agreed to acquire PSS World Medical in a stock pact valued at about $840 million. PSS World Medical fell 2 13/32 to 7 15/32 on Nasdaq. Analysts said the stocks declined because investors were disappointed with PSS World's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, also released yesterday, and by the lower-than-expected takeover premium for the acquisition.   

 Nabisco Holdings fell 1 7/16 to 51 9/16, as suitors Philip Morris and a joint venture of Danone SA and Cadbury Schweppes submitted final bids for the New York food market that could reach $55 a share, or $14.57 billion. The stock pulled back as investors recognized that the dwindling number of bidders may mean Nabisco won't command the higher prices anticipated by some analysts.   

 Meanwhile, parent company Nabisco Group Holdings, which owns nearly 81% of the food company, declined 11/16 to 24 1/4, after analysts at Goldman Sachs and Prudential Securities cut ratings on the stock.   

 Philip Morris lost 1 1/4 to 23 3/4.   

 The American depositary shares of Danone declined 1 3/8 to 25 5/16, while the American depositary receipts of Cadbury Schweppes fell 1/8 to 26 3/8.   

 Associates First Capital lost 1 1/2 to 21 3/4.

 BRUSSELS, June 22 (Reuters) - Weakness in the U.S. market for enterprise resource planning (ERP) software is raising investor concerns that Belgium's Real Software will fail to meet its 2000 sales targets, analysts said on Thursday. 

 Shares in Real Software had dropped by 8.1 percent over three days before rising slightly on Thursday. 

 Real Software was up 0.45 percent at 67.30 euros at 1437 GMT, after earlier trading as low as 66.00 euros, matching a more than five-month low set in late May. 

 Trading volumes have been lower than average in recent weeks. 

 "People are cautious and rightly so," Fortis Bank analyst Luc Van der Elst said. 

 Real Software officials could not be reached immediately for comment. 

 ERP software, which is used by companies to manage internal affairs, such as inventory, purchasing, accounting and other managerial functions, is one of Real Software's main products. 

 One analyst said news about a lack of U.S. interest for ERP software has been making investors nervous. 

 "It is a very, very weak market in the United States," the analyst said, estimating that the U.S. generated about one-third of Real Software's total revenues. 

 Earlier on Thursday, Belgian software and consulting Arinso International said its revenues and pre-tax profits would be below its own forecasts due to a lack of interest in its ERP software in North America. 

 Arinso said companies had begun looking at Internet applications instead of ERP to perform the same functions, and as a result were not yet buying either product. 

 Last month, Real Software forecast revenues from its U.S. operations rising from $10 million in the first quarter to $12 million in the second quarter, $24 million in the third, and $48 million in the fourth. 

 Fortis's Van der Elst said 30 percent of Real Software's first-quarter U.S. sales came from ERP software. 

 Real Software will release second-quarter results in September. 

 Last November, Real Software had issued a profit warning, citing a slowdown in millennium-related business and a failure of ERP sales to recover as had been expected.

 UPDATE 2-Roche warns on H1 drug sales. 

 By Michael Shields

 ZURICH, June 22 (Reuters) - Roche Holding AG warned on Thursday of slowing drug sales in the first half, sending its shares tumbling even as it tried to soothe investors by saying it would still meet projected first-half profit forecasts. 

 Roche certificates fell 6.6 percent to a year low of 15,555 francs before recovering to close 4.98 percent lower at 15,830. The Dow Jones EuroStoxx healthcare index .SXDP), of which it is a constituent, fell 0.9 percent. 

 The Swiss drug firm said first-half sales growth would be in single-digit percentages due to a weak U.S. showing and slower-than-expected turnover for its anti-obesity drug Xenical. 

 Chief Executive Franz Humer had said in April that Roche saw sales of Xenical, the company's third-biggest selling drug, accelerating after it generated 250 million Swiss francs ($152.5 million) of sales in the first quarter. 

 "If they had seven percent pharma growth in the first quarter and they are saying low single digit growth for the first half, then something has gone quite wrong in the second quarter," said Simon Conway, an analyst at Williams de Broe in London. 

 Analysts have said second-quarter Xenical sales would suffer by comparison to the same period of last year, when sales of the drug, which blocks the body's ability to absorb fat, raced ahead after its launch before settling down. 

 DEEPER PROBLEMS 

 But others said Xenical may face deeper problems and that a massive direct-to-consumer marketing campaign in the U.S. market appeared to be floundering. 

 "People appear to be using the drug once and not returning. There are side effects like diarrhoea and others may simply not be getting the results they want," a Paris-based analyst said. 

 The Paris analyst now forecast 2.5 percent sales growth in constant currency terms for Roche's drug unit during the second quarter compared to 8 percent growth during the first quarter. 

 He also expressed concern that with the exception of 'flu treatment Tamiflu, Roche's core drugs unit risked producing below-par sales growth and did not have a strong enough pipeline of new and safe drugs. 

 RELEASE PROBED 

 The Swiss Exchange meanwhile said it was checking with Roche on the way it released the sales warning, a bourse spokesman said. 

 "We are now analysing what happened and have established contact with the issuer. We will have to clear up in detail what actually happened," he said. 

 Roche had first spoken to selected financial analysts about its new sales outlook. 

 "What happened this morning is that investor relations called up some key analysts to say we anticipate for the half year a low-single-digit local-currency growth rate for the pharma division," Roche spokesman Daniel Piller said. 

 "It is specific on the U.S., where (prescription) sales are below the still very high market growth. And there is a slower-than-expected growth of Xenical," he added. 

 He gave no absolute numbers and said more details would emerge at the mid-year news conference on August 17. 

 He said Roche was issuing a sales rather than a profit warning. "Roche expects that the net income for the half year will meet the consensus expectations of analysts. There is no profit warning," Piller said. 

 Analysts are generally expecting first-half net profit to rise some 10 to 15 percent. 

 DISAPPOINTED 

 Asked if it was not odd to issue such a price-sensitive warning to only a few analysts, Piller said: "I leave this for you to comment." 

 "I was surprised and disappointed," said Bank Julius Baer's co-head of broker research Kevin Lyne-Smith. 

 "I always understood that this type of information should not be distributed on a privileged basis. It should be distributed in a free and open manner." 

 Lyne-Smith said Roche has told him they were trying to lower the market's expectations on drug sales "but the didn't expect the decline to be quite so sharp. They said they had been doing that for a month or two." 

 He was reviewing his estimates for Roche "which is basically going to show disappointment in Q2, a risk in Q3 and Q4, and below-market (drugs) sales growth for 2001," he said. 

 "They say they will meet full-year consensus estimates for EPS and for the first half as well, so they are obviously managing the cost line or the financial expense line to achieve that."

 Europe Stock Focus: H&M Seen No Long-Term Fashion Victim

 STOCKHOLM -(Dow Jones)- Hennes & Mauritz AB (S.HEM) is unlikely to stay out of fashion for too long. 

 Analysts reckon shares in the Swedish clothing retailer could stage a recovery toward the end of this year as investors warm to its U.S. activities. 

 The company's recent fall from grace may also draw in buyers previously deterred by its high valuation following the share's three years of gains. 

 "At the moment the market is focusing on the negative cost situation," said Elisabeth Kruth, who watches H&M for Swedish brokerage Aros Securities. 

 "But there will be positive news flow from the U.S. and if investors are impressed with profits there, then they should be happy with expansion plans for that market." She recommends investors hold. 

 There's little short-term incentive to buy. 

 Wednesday the share plummeted 16% to SEK187, a fresh year low, as investors fretted over a six-month earnings report that showed profits fell below the already low levels the market had expected. 

 H&M, accustomed to surprising markets with its earnings, but in a pleasant way, blamed rising costs. 

 Investors weren't impressed either with something resembling another profits warning. H&M said a poor product mix, large inventories and price cuts would likely hit its bottom line in the coming quarter. 

 Chartists say H&M shares could drop to SEK150 in the coming month. 

 In the past three months, the shares have fallen 44%, compared with a 7.9% decline by the blue-chip OMX index. 

 The trigger was a first-quarter profit warning March 23 and resignation of chief executive Fabian Maansson, which sliced 35% from the value of the shares in one day. 

 Kruth has a target price of SEK225, "although that price doesn't include long-term growth potential." 

 Most analysts put fair value at around SEK230, which would still give the stock a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 57. 

 The U.S. is the big hope. H&M only starting selling its wares in the U.S. in March, but sales there totaled SEK195 million, exceeding the firm's expectations. 

 Set-up costs were steep, but new chief executive Rolf Eriksen is promising that its cost-awareness program will take full effect in the coming half year. 

 Kruth says it's also crucial that H&M maintain its high U.S. sales, to show its success there isn't temporary. 

 "That will show investors they've reason for their aggressive expansion plans," she said. 

 Cheered by strong U.S. sales, H&M doubled its expansion plans to 10 new U.S. stores this year and set a target of 75 new stores within three years. 


   Share Could Fall Further, But Present Level Attractive



Jan Villars, an analyst with Swedbank Markets, predicts the share will
drift until H&M can show a profit turnaround.



"People will probably get back in just ahead of the third-quarter
report, although it's going to take at least one full quarter for H&M to
recover from the bad product choices they've made," he said.



"I would add H&M to my portfolio at the SEK150 level and if it touches
SEK100, I would see that as a buy signal."



On the other hand, the share has sunk to a level that could lure
bargain-hunters. "It's fallen from very high levels and people who've
wanted to get into the stock, but stayed out because it was so highly
valued, will use this opportunity to do just that," said Aros' Kruth.

 N.Y. Stocks End Weaker; Nasdaq Composite Fails Key Test

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Nasdaq Composite Index's effort to turn back the clock to where it started the year turned as flat as glass of New Year's champagne, after technology stocks succumbed to a pretty solid drubbing on Thursday. 

 Semiconductor issues, the engine of the recent recovery, played the role of spoiler. Shares of Intel lost 4 11/16 to 134 5/16, while PMC-Sierra fell 13 1/16 to 190 5/16, and Xilinx lost 9 1/16 to 88 7/8, all on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares of Micron Technology fell 6 1/4 to 84 13/16 on the NYSE, ahead of the chip maker's quarterly profit statement, due out after the close of the session. 

 Traders said investors anticipated that any good news included in the statement, expected to show the company at least lived up to forecasts, had been priced into the shares, which reached a 52-week high Wednesday. 

 Internet stocks also hurried to the downside in the session. Yahoo!, for example, dropped 11 1/8 to 131 11/16 on Nasdaq. The stock has been the source of some controversy on Wall Street. Lehman Brothers, for example, took a pessimistic view of the issue in a report on Wednesday. On Thursday, Merrill Lynch weighed in with support, saying the Internet search engine's core business remains strong, but it wasn't enough to forestall a decline. 

 To be sure, the session wasn't a washout across the board, even within technology. Alteon WebSystems, for example, gained 9 3/8 to 91 7/8 on Nasdaq, after Lehman Brothers raised its estimates on the Web products maker. Shares of Qualcomm ended 3 3/4 higher at 68 1/4 on Nasdaq, after reaching 73 7/8 intraday, on speculation, thus far unwarranted, that Nokia might bid for the wireless systems developer. Qualcomm wouldn't comment on the speculation. 

 Still, the losers outnumbered the winners on the Nasdaq Stock Market by a wide margin; breadth there finished about 8-to-5 to the negative. So the Nasdaq composite, which came into the session needing a little more than 5 points to get back to where it started the year, and thus in the black for 2000, couldn't make the leap. 

 The index finished the session 127.11 points weaker, off 3.13%, at 3936.90. It wasn't enough to stem the enthusiasm of market participants who have applauded the recent recovery, which has carried the index some 500 points higher in the span of three weeks. 

 "We were bound to run into a capitulation day once this week," Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies, said Thursday. "But I think that, overall, we'll start seeing more support as we move closer to the FOMC meeting next week for the summer rally," Hogan added, referring to next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10376.12, down 121.62. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 999 issues advancing, 1,863 declining and 506 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,010,242,550 shares, compared with 996,689,290 Wednesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 641.54, down 7.44. The average price per share fell 46 cents. 

 Energy stocks weakened in the session, even as crude oil prices rallied again, a gain that, on the face of it, seemed counterintuitive, inasmuch as Wednesday's decision by OPEC to increase production might have suggested commodity prices should dim on supply/demand considerations. 

 Still, Chevron fell 1 11/16 to 89 9/16, Exxon Mobil lost 1 1/4 to 82 11/16, and Texaco declined 1 9/16 to 56 3/16. Some traders believed the production hikes won't be sufficient to rebuild depleted inventories of energy products in the second half of the year, when demand strengthens. 

 Amerada Hess lost 1 7/8 to 65 7/8, while Kerr-McGee declined 1 7/16 to 59 13/16, and USX-Marathon eased 7/16 to 27 3/16. 

 Shares of drug makers, which had been popular safety stocks recently when investors worried that slowing economic expansion would hurt profit gains for growth companies, suffered losses Thursday. Shares of Pharmacia fell 3 5/8 to 51 3/4. Pfizer declined 1 1/8 to 45 3/4. Schering-Plough dropped 2 to 46 15/16. Merck gave up 1 1/16 to 71 1/4. 

 Among blue chips, consumer issues proved to be one of the few groups that rallied successfully. Shares of Coca-Cola moved ahead 2 9/16 to 56 1/16. Adolph Coors advanced 1 1/4 to 62 11/16. Anheuser-Busch gained 1 1/4 to 76. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed out the session with a loss of 121.62, a decline of 1.16%, to finish at 10376.12. 

 Cyclical stocks, under pressure this week after some prominent names in the sector warned of earnings shortfalls, continued to decline. Deere fell 2 3/16 to 37 1/16, even though Bear Stearns said in a research note that trends in the Moline, Ill., farm-machinery maker's operations suggested that sales and earnings should climb. CNH Global, a rival equipment maker that sank to a 52-week low Wednesday on a profitwarning, scrambled back, added 3/8 to 9. 

 Honeywell, which sank to a 52-week low Tuesday following a profitwarning of its own this week, lost another 2, falling to 35, after UBS Warburg cut its rating on the Morris Township, N.J., maker of home and industrial controls, aerospace systems and specialty chemicals. 

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter dropped 2 7/16 to 83 3/16. The New York brokerage firm reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street's forecasts. However, those profits dropped below its first-quarter total, hurt by declines in the value of its portfolio of investments. 

 Other brokerage issues following suit. Merrill Lynch fell 5 3/16 to 115 3/16. Lehman Brothers shed 2 9/16 to 89 5/8. Goldman Sachs declined 2 3/8 to 84 1/4. 

 Fisher Scientific lost 9 9/16 to 28 7/16. The Hampton, N.H., science-equipment distributor agreed to acquire PSS World Medical in a stock pact valued at about $840 million. PSS World Medical fell 2 13/32 to 7 15/32 on Nasdaq. Analysts said the stocks declined because investers were disappointed with PSS World's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, also released Thursday, and by the lower-than-expected takeover premium for the acquisition. 

 Nabisco Holdings fell 1 11/16 to 51 9/16, as suitors Philip Morris and a joint venture of Danone SA and Cadbury Schweppes submitted final bids for the New York food market that could reach $55 a share, or $14.57 billion. The stock pulled back as investors recognized that the dwindling number of bidders may mean Nabisco won't command the higher prices anticipated by some analysts. 

 Meanwhile, parent company Nabisco Group Holdings, which owns 80.6% of the food company, declined 3/16 to 24 3/4, after analysts at Goldman Scahs and Prudential Securities cut ratings on the stock. 

 Philip Morris shares lost 1 1/16 to 23 15/16. 

 The American depositary shares of Danone declined 1 3/8 to 25 5/16, while the American depositary receipts of Cadbury Schweppes fell 1/8 to 26 3/8. 

 Associates First Capital lost 1 1/2 to 21 3/4. The Justice Department is preparing a civil lawsuit against the Dallas home equity lender, alleging the company discriminated against blacks in extending credit in the subprime market, according to an article in Thursday's edition of The Wall Street Journal. Associates First said Thursday it disagrees with the conclusions drawn by the Federal Trade Commission in its investiagion of the issue. 

 Household International declined 7/8 to 43 3/16. The Prospect Heights, Ill., consumer lender said in a statement it is not the subject of any proceeding with the Justice Department. 

 Burr-Brown shot up 27 3/8 to 100 on Nasdaq, reaching a 52-week high. Texas Instruments agreed to buy the Tucson, Ariz., chip maker for $7.6 billion in stock; the acquisition would allow Texas Instruments to expand its business with makers of video and audio electronics. 

 Texas Instruments, however, lost 2 3/8 to 79 5/8. 

 VA Linux Systems moved ahead 6 15/16 to 45 3/16 on Nasdaq. Chip-maker Intel unveiled its Internet-access appliance, called Dot.Station, which will use the open-source Linux operating system. 

 Excite@Home gained 1 15/16 to 20 7/8. The Redwood City, Calif., broadband media service provider's shares benefitted from an appeals court ruling overturning a lower court's decision that threatened its exclusive access to AT&T's cable lines. 

 AT&T added 1 to 36. 

 Tibco Software climbed 5 7/8 to 88 7/8 on Nasdaq. The Palo Alto, Calif., Internet software concern reported fiscal second-quarter earnings late Wednesday that beat Wall Street's projections, prompting Bear Stearns to raise its price target on the stock  to 100 from 75.

 LIONVILLE, Pa., June 21 (Reuters) - West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. on Wednesday warned of "sharply" lower-than-expected second quarter and full year earnings, citing soft business conditions for its contract manufacturing and packaging unit. 

 The company also said it will take a second quarter charge of $1.5 million and cut an unspecified number of jobs as part of a plan to change a plastic plant in Lewes, England to a medical devices and consumer products facility. 

 West forecast second quarter earnings per share of about $0.35. That compares with analysts' expectations of 50 cents per share for the second quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 For the full year, the company is likely to report earnings in the range of $1.80-$2.00 per share, West said. Analysts were expecting $2.16 per share, according to First Call. 

 West shares finished unchanged at 23-1/4, on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has a 52-week high of 40-7/16 and a 52-week low of 22-9/16.

 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - Shares in Tyson Foods Inc. , the world's largest poultry producer, dropped as much as 6.5 percent on Wednesday after the company said its earnings would be lower than analysts had expected. 

 The Springdale, Ark.-based company, which warned in May it might have trouble meeting Wall Street fiscal year forecasts because of heavy poultry production and low prices, said late on Tuesday that third quarter earnings should range from 18 cents to 20 cents per share. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had on average expected 26 cents. 

 The profit warning prompted brokerage Merrill Lynch to cut its near-term recommendation on the stock to neutral from accumulate, though its long-term rating remains accumulate. It also reduced its third-quarter earnings estimate for Tyson to 18 cents per share from 26 cents. Prudential Securities reduced its third-quarter earnings estimate to 19 cents per share from 26 cents. 

 Tyson shares fell as much as 5/8 to a low of 8-7/8, just above a 52-week low of 8-1/2. They were last traded down 9/16 at 9 in New York Stock exchange trading. 

 Tyson blamed weak chicken prices due to oversupply for the profit warning. Food industry experts say that the revival of the red meat industry has exacerbated the problem for chicken producers. 

 "The shortfall remains from the oversupply of protein in the market. We anticipate the beef oversupply will be corrected by fiscal year 2001 in which we see 4.5% less beef," Prudential said in a statement.

 Stocks seen off at open as tech stocks backtrack.

 NEW YORK, June 21 (Reuters) - Stocks were seen opening softer on Wednesday as investors digested Tuesday's substantial gains in technology stocks and anxiously awaited the results of a key meeting of oil-producing nations. 

 High-tech shares were expected to feel a pinch from a mixed earnings report by Oracle Corp. that disappointed Wall Street, although positive news from computer chip giant Intel was seen softening the blow, market analysts said. 

 In the meantime, investors were on edge as OPEC leaders met in Vienna to discuss how much they will boost crude supply to tame runaway oil prices and cut fuel costs in the West. 

 "We'll definitely taking our lead from earnings and earnings pre-reports, but the three biggest stories are Intel, Oracle and the OPEC meeting," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. 

 "All those things remaining the same, it's probably going to put a lid on the market in early going, and we seem to be a little soft coming into the open," Hogan added. 

 With more than an hour to go before the opening bell, the Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for September were off 3.30 at 1495.70, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures dangled 50.50 points lower at 3,957.00. 

 As the markets' vigil on the fate of oil prices drew to a close, OPEC was expected to lift crude supply for the second time this year after extra exports in March failed to rein in rising prices. 

 At about 8 a.m. EDT (1200 GMT), as OPEC oil ministers adjourned talks, a Saudi oil minister said markets can expect more oil on the market next month. The ministers will convene formal talks at noon EDT (1600 GMT). 

 Wall Street will also be tuned in for remarks Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday, just a week before the central bank is scheduled to announce its next decision on interest rates. The Fed has boosted rates six times since last June. 

 On Wednesday, Greenspan will testify before the Senate Banking and Agriculture committees on the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). 

 "We're probably in a narrower trading range than we have been in the past as investors look for the Fed's action or inaction," said John Davidson, chief investment officer, Orbitex Management. 

 Once again, earnings will be in the market's sights as the trickle of corporate reports begins to grow. 

 Investors got a taste of corporate earnings results from the high-tech sector on Tuesday when Oracle Corp., the world's biggest database software maker, released its latest scorecard. 

 Oracle said it had posted a fourth-quarter profit that soundly beat Wall Street estimates. But the lukewarm sales growth of its core database software disappointed investors. 

 Oracle's stock was down at 81 in pre-opening trade after a Tuesday close of 86-3/64. 

 Intel, however, said on Tuesday it would book a second quarter charge of about $200 million, or 2 cents per share, to cover the estimated remaining costs associated with replacing circuit boards found to have a defective chipset. 

 The company also said because of higher-than-expected realised gains on the sale of stock investments, its sees interest and other income for the second quarter to be about about $2.3 billion, up from its previous guidance of $725 million. 

 On Tuesday, high-tech shares soared as investors bet that technology companies will deliver good results despite a slowing economy, leaving blue-chip stocks in the dust. 

 The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC) posted its fourth higher close in row to end above the 4,000 mark for the first time since April 11. It climbed 23.53 points, or 0.59 percent, to 4,013.36, leaving it off 1.37 percent for the year. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI), however, lost 122.68 points, or 1.16 percent, at 10,435.16, with Honeywell International Inc., the diversified conglomerate, again largely to blame. The damage to Honeywell's stock from a profit warning on Monday continued, with Honeywell falling 3-7/8 to 36.

 Tyson Sees More Earns Weakness If Oversupply Persists

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN), which has already issued a third-quarter profit warning, says that if poultry prices do not climb back up and the supply and demand of chicken does not strike a better balance, future earnings could be affected. 

 Louis Gottsponer, director of Tyson's investor relations, told Dow Jones Newswires that fourth-quarter profits could "certainly" be affected if supply continues to handily outpace demand and chicken prices continue to fall. Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Leonard Teitelbaum even downgraded the stock to an intermediate neutral from accumulate, writing in a morning research note to clients that "until we see a change in industry conditions we believe a neutral stance ... is warranted." 

 "We're certainly not thrilled to be in this spot," Gottsponer said. He would not provide specific guidance on the fourth quarter. Analysts currently expect Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., to earn 31 a share in the year-ending quarter, according to a First Call/Thompson Financial consensus. 

 This potentially negative outlook comes on the heels of a third-quarter profit warning from Tyson. The company announced after the close of the market Tuesday that third-quarter earnings would be in the range of 18 cents to 20 cents a share, down from analysts' previous estimate of 26 cents. The company blamed an oversupply of chicken. 

 This doesn't come as too much of a surprise to Wall Street, which has largely been aware of the oversupply problem since September. At that time, and in an effort to strike a chord between supply and demand, Tyson cut production by 3%. Other industry poultry producers like Conagra Inc. (CAG), Pilgrim's Pride Corp. (CHX) and Sanderson Farms Inc. (SAFM) did not follow suit. 

 The result? Continued inventory glut. 

 Poultry producers have taken advantage of cheap grain prices and have produced more chicken than demand has called for. American consumers continue to eat the same amount of chicken as they always have - an overall good thing - and poultry producers have felt the export pressure. With the collapse of Russia, for example, chicken makers have not seen as much international demand. 

 All this has pinched profits and singed stock prices of all major industry players. Pilgrim's and Sanderson trade near their 52-week lows. 


NYSE-listed Tyson shares recently traded at 8 15/16, down 5/8, or
6.5%, on composite volume of 387,000 compared with average daily volume
of 340,000. The stock hit a 52-week low of 8 1/2 on March 15.

 Honeywell continues its slide  - Shortfall unexplained, stock falls 9.7% more

 Shares of Honeywell International Inc. were under siege for a second straight day as analysts downgraded the company's outlook because of a profit warning on Monday. 

 The stock fell $4.25, or 9.7 percent, to $36.00 on the New York Stock Exchange as investors questioned Chief Executive Michael Bonsignore's leadership and credibility with Wall Street. The shares have fallen 25.5 percent in the past two days and are down 37 percent year-to-date. 

 It didn't calm investors, either, when Honeywell announced yesterday it won't explain the specific reasons for the profit shortfall until a meeting with analysts on July 10 in New York. The Morris Township-based aerospace and industrial controls company has missed two of the last three earnings targets and has said little about how it will fix its problems. 

 ''The lack of clear-cut information was almost more disconcerting to investors than the magnitude of the earnings disappointment itself," said Prudential Securities analyst Nick Heymann. 

 Honeywell was downgraded yesterday by Prudential, SalomonSmithBarney and Bank of America Securities. 

 Honeywell is having trouble delivering aerospace electronics to its major customer, Boeing, and its chemicals business is suffering from the high cost of oil during the past several months, Heymann said. Honeywell has yet to realize the savings expected from its combination with AlliedSignal last year. 

 ''We sense there'll be other disclosures as well regarding glitches, shortfalls and higher-than-anticipated costs as the company offers further insight into its problems over the next few weeks," said Heymann, who predicted it will take at least a year for the stock to reach $48. 

 Some analysts said the plunging stock price is an opportunity for bargain hunters. 

 ''I don't think now is a smart time to be selling the stock," said Quinten Nufer of UBS Warburg, who still has Honeywell on his list of top stock picks. "You might get a little bounce up because it's selling for just 11 times earnings." 

 Still, it could be a long 21/2 weeks for Bonsignore, who helped arrange the acquisition of his company last year by AlliedSignal, which was run by now-retired Chairman Larry Bossidy, a disciple of General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch. 

 Bonsignore's laid-back style is in sharp contrast to Bossidy's in-your-face managerial approach, resulting in a culture clash over how to run the company's diverse business units, said people who are familiar with the company. The Bossidy faithful, people say, take no prisoners when it comes to meeting their projected numbers, while the Bonsignore camp takes a conservative approach. 

 Bossidy, for example, quickly reassigned executives when AlliedSignal missed its earnings target by a penny a share in the third quarter of 1997. Wall Street gave the stock a beating at first but rallied to Bossidy's tough-guy style in fixing the problem. 

 Under Bonsignore, who ran Honeywell before the acquisition, the company missed its forecast in the fourth quarter before meeting projections in the first quarter. Now, it will miss again in the second quarter, even though Bonsignore was telling analysts just two weeks ago the company was on target. 

 ''Everybody thinks July 10 is a little too late, and that's why the stock is getting hammered," said Matthew Collins, a stock analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis. "That puts management's credibility into question, and it will take time to rebuild that." 

 Bonsignore said in a statement the company will discuss actions under way to accelerate productivity, reduce costs and implement strategic actions. He also promised to provide an update on the financial outlook for the rest of the year. 

 Honeywell spokesman Tom Crane said Bonsignore will address Wall Street's concerns during next month's meeting. 

 ''Mike has a commanding leadership position here. He clearly sees the need to rebuild credibility, and he is focused on doing so," Crane said. 

 Wall Street is becoming increasingly impatient with companies that can't make their numbers. Procter & Gamble fired Chairman Durk Yager earlier this month after he failed to improve profitability at the consumer products giant. Chief executives Jill Barad of Mattel, Douglas Ivestor of Coca-Cola and Richard Thoman of Xerox have been forced out in recent months after surprising investors with poor results. 

 When Lucent Technologies missed its earnings forecast in January, Chief Executive Richard McGinn quickly held a conference call with analysts to explain the problems. Some analysts who follow Honeywell still haven't had a return phone call from the company. 

 Analysts might as well use Honeywell's aircraft collision avoidance systems to predict its earnings, because they're flying on their own in bad weather. 

 ''The bottom line is that people have lost a lot of confidence in management," said Stuart Kalter, analyst for Global Capital Markets of Syosset, N.Y. "Investors have to ask themselves the question, 'Do I want to be in a stock where nothing is going to happen for six to 12 months?'" 

 Most on Wall Street said Bonsignore had better offer a specific plan to boost earnings and sell off no-growth operations during their briefing next month. 

 ''People had expected this stock to be in the $70s," Kalter said. "I'd say you give Bonsignore six months, and if things don't turn around, people will scream for him to resign."

 Belgium's Arinso seen falling further.

 BRUSSELS, June 20 (Reuters) - Shares of Belgian software and consulting firm Arinso face further falls after tumbling a total of 21.7 percent since issuing a profit warning last week, analysts said on Tuesday. 

 Arinso on Tuesday closed down 5.26 percent at 27.00 euros, after trading as low as 26.80 euros. 

 Arinso has lost 29 percent of its share value since going public at an issue price of 40 euros, barely three months ago. 

 The share had closed at 34.50 euros on June 14 before the company warnings of difficult market conditions in the United States. 

 "This is a kind of profit warning and it might continue to put pressure on the stock for the next few months," analyst Sylvie Van Houtte at KBC Securities said. "The confidence of the investors has been shocked." 

 One analyst said the company's statement was a poor omen after having gone public so recently. 

 Arinso officials were not immediately available for comment. 

 Bank Degroof on Tuesday cut its rating to "hold" on Arinso and reduced its 2000 and 2001 earnings estimates, blaming U.S. market conditions and uncertainties about growth prospects in France. 

 According to Degroof, North America contributed to 22 percent of 1999 sales and France accounted for 24 percent of 1999 turnover. 

 KBC and Petercam Securities both said they would also revise their earnings forecast for the firm. 

 Arinso had forecast 2000 net turnover at 100 million euros and pre-tax profits at 21 million euros.

 PlanetRx.com shares take ill after  profit warning .

 LOS ANGELES, June 20 (Reuters) - Shares of online drug store PlanetRx.com Inc. fell 22 percent on Tuesday after the company warned late Monday its second-quarter and full-year 2000 sales would fall short of estimates. 

 Shares of the South San Francisco, California-based company were down 7/16 at 1-9/16 on Nasdaq. The stock has a 52-week high of 36-1/2. 

 "There have been signs that their top line would be soft. There has been a lot of promotional stuff on the site - 20 percent discounts and $100 free travel vouchers," said Caren Taylor, an analyst at E*offering Corp. 

 The analyst lowered her 2000 revenue projection for PlanetRx.com to $40 million from $66 million and dropped her 2001 estimate to $70 million from $210 million, but still rates the stock as a "buy." 

 "They are in a cash crunch and need to cut spending drastically. They are cutting spending on marketing and advertising, but that was driving traffic to the site," Taylor said. 

 The company said in Monday's statement that second quarter sales would total near $9 million, due mostly to systems integration and marketing issues associated with an agreement it has with Express Scripts Inc. , a pharmacy benefit management company that helps control prescription drug costs and distribution for health plans. 

 PlanetRX.com also said it will no longer make fixed payments to Express Scripts, as the current agreement between the two companies requires. 

 In October 1999, Express Scripts acquired a 19.9 percent ownership in PlanetRx.com, making the Web site the exclusive Internet pharmacy serving Express Scripts' plan members for five years, with a potential five-year extension. 

 PlanetRx.com was to pay Express Scripts annual fees in excess of $11.6 million for access to its membership and $3 million for the further development of Express Scripts' other Internet operations for five years. 

 Under the restructured agreement, which is scheduled to take effect on July 5, Express Scripts will retain its stake in PlanetRx but it no longer has an obligation to market PlanetRx aggressively to its membership. 

 St. Louis-based Express Scripts said in a release that it would take a $145 million charge against second-quarter earnings to reflect the restructured deal and the current market capitalisation of PlanetRx.com. The company's shares fell 2-1/16 to 55-5/8 in Nasdaq trading on Tuesday. 

 PlanetRx.com said it expected to report a pro forma net loss for the second quarter of 62-63 cents a share, or slightly narrower than previous estimates. 

 "They did reduce the loss-per-share estimate. That is mostly a factor of the reduced cash burn rate," Taylor said. 

 PlanetRx.com also said it has hired investment banker Goldman, Sachs & Co. "to explore various strategic and financial alternatives." 

 "I doubt they will be able to find a buyer. They will probably merge with a bricks-and-mortar pharmacy or even a Drugstore.com - that would make a lot of sense," Taylor said.

 Analyst Had Early Sense Of Gadzoox Networks' Shortfall

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It seems Morgan Keegan & Co. analyst Robert Montague saw the bad news coming before other analysts. 

 Gadzoox Networks Inc. (ZOOX), a San Jose-provider of hardware and software products for storage area networks, said unusually late Monday that it would miss analysts' first-quarter revenue expectations. 

 But even before the company announced its revenue warning, Montague beat other analysts to the punch by downgrading Gadzoox to market perform from outperform early Monday. Thereafter, Gadzoox shares fell 26%. 

 The company said the shortfall came from lower-than-expected movement of inventory through the distribution channel to end customers. Revenue will be as much as 33% below the prior quarter's revenue of $15.1 million, the company said. 

 Montague says a variety of external sources gave him the impression that Gadzoox had weaknesses in its channel. However, he declined comment on who those sources were. 

 He also added that the company's new switching platform may not be taking hold as they planned. 

 "I think our downgrade put pressure on Gadzoox to go ahead and release the profit warning," Montague told Dow Jones Newswires. "I did not have prior knowledge of the warning." 

 Gadzoox wasn't immediately available for comment. 

 On the heels of Gadzoox's news, other analysts downgraded the stock. On Tuesday, C.E. Unterberg Towbin cut its rating to neutral from strong while Chase H&Q cut its rating to market perform from buy. 

 Gadzoox's announcement seemed to surprise analysts from those firms. 

 In a research note Tuesday, Chase H&Q analyst William Lewis wrote that last week Gadzoox management "reiterated comfort" with his estimates for the quarter that ends in June, including a revenue estimate of $18.7 million. Now, the "outlook is uncertain," Lewis wrote. "Even after sell-off, the stock is likely to languish over credibility concerns." 

 Lewis wasn't immediately available for comment. 

 On Monday, C.E. Unterberg Towbin analyst David Chiang told Dow Jones Newswires that he thought the company "was shaping up in line with expectations for the quarter," and that he expects Gadzoox, which has posted losses for the past three quarters, to be profitable next year.' 

 Chiang declined additional comment Tuesday. 

 But one thing hasn't been so surprising, though. Shares of Gadzoox fell 33% percent Tuesday in the wake of its revenue warning. They recently changed hands at 13 1/2, down 6 13/16, on volume of 5.9 million shares. Average daily volume is 666,400 shares.

Profit before taxation, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation increased to #43.8 million. Turnover increased by 7% to #233 million. Overseas sales increased by 12% and, at #151 million, now represent 65% of overall Group sales. Sales to other European countries, notwithstanding the weakness of the Euro, also increased by 5%. Earnings per share, before exceptionals and before amortisation of goodwill, increased by 5% to 8.41p. Each one of the preceding absolute figures is a new record for the Group.



The Chief Executive, Mr Stephen O'Shea, said:



"Halma has again reported record sales and record profits. During the year we developed many new products and made a number of excellent acquisitions. Each of these has reinforced our market strength in our chosen sectors. We made further substantial progress towards our objective of simplifying our activities into a small number of specialist world class businesses. In each case these are globally organised, with widespread production and sales facilities heading up to a specialist senior executive. These changes and



developments have created opportunities for further significant growth.



"Our specialist business groupings now are:



		  Fire and Gas detection
		  Water leak detection and UV treatment
		  Elevator Electronics
		  Bursting discs and sequential locking for Process Safety
		  High power electrical Resistors
		  Ophthalmic Optics



"For the first time the Group is reporting separate sales and profit figures



for each sector. This segmental analysis is set out below.



"The key characteristics of the above business groupings are that they are predominantly electronics, they are based on advanced technology and offer strong potential for further growth. Each has built up national or international market leadership in its specialist field.



"These comments about the Group's global strength can conveniently be illustrated by taking one sector as an example. Halma is now substantially the largest world player in the rapidly growing field of elevator sensors and communications. All the Group's companies in this sector come under the direct control of one senior executive with many years' experience in this field. This business group performed very encouragingly with a profit increase of 14%.



"Memco, some years ago, was the originator of electronic sensors for elevator doors. These can detect the presence of an obstruction before the door closes onto it and are progressively replacing the more old fashioned mechanical sensors. Memco, with its fellow subsidiary Janus in the USA, has maintained overall leadership as the market has grown. During the year this position was further strengthened by the acquisition of T L Jones and the Group now supplies almost 50% of the total world market for this product. "From this strong position the Group has also developed to become the world market leader in an allied product field, emergency telecommunications for use in elevators. New regulations have come into force requiring the use of these products in territories other than the USA. The Group was already strong in this field through Electronic Micro Systems and within the last twelve months has purchased two more specialists, E-Motive in Singapore and Vandal-Proof Products in the USA.



"Elevator Electronics is an excellent example of the Halma Group's current operating philosophy. Equally compelling examples of product strength and market dominance exist in each of the other business groupings and these are reviewed below.



"Fire and Gas, the largest product grouping, was the only one not to report a profit improvement during the year. A strong performance by fire detection companies was more than offset by a downturn within the gas detection companies. These suffered from a lack of large scale projects and in this context it is pleasing to report that Telegan has recently been awarded a #1.2 million contract from Centrica to equip its technicians with our newly-developed gas monitoring instruments.



"The water-related companies in aggregate recorded a 13% profit increase, with another exceptional performance from Palmer Environmental. This company is the world leader in advanced equipment for water leak detection and its new Permalog product is capturing substantial repeat orders.



"Resistors had an outstanding year with a 16% profit increase. At the year end this business was very substantially strengthened by the acquisition of the resistor activities of Cutler-Hammer from Eaton Corporation.



"Bursting discs and locking systems increased profits by 7%, largely as a result of the acquisition of Oklahoma Safety Equipment Co. ("OSECO") in the USA. The sequential locking companies continued to be affected by a lack of petrochemical contracts but made good progress in their other markets.



"Optics and Specialist companies reported a 14% increase in profits.



"The fastest growing geographical sales territory was the USA with a 19% year on year gain. Despite the strength of Sterling, Far East and Australasia sales recovered from the previous year's downturn with a gain of 14% and European sales, excluding the UK, grew by 5%.



"During the year and since the year end we have made the following



acquisitions to strengthen our key business groups.



Elevator Electronics	 T L Jones based in New Zealand with a manufacturing
				   base in China
				   E-Motive Display based in Singapore
				   Vandal-Proof Products based in the USA

High Power Resistors	 Cutler-Hammer resistor business based in the USA
				   and in the UK

Bursting Discs		 OSECO based in the USA

Water			    Hydreka based in France



"Four smaller businesses within the Group which offered insufficiently



attractive long-term prospects were closed or sold during the year at a net cost well within the original estimate.



"The steady, persistent and determined growth of the Halma Group is sometimes under-estimated by the casual observer. It is worth noting that over the past five years, for example, we have spent almost #70m on acquisitions. These acquisitions, funded entirely by internally generated cash, have added very substantial intellectual capital to our carefully selected activities. "These activities and our progressively increasing product strength are the means whereby we sustain our consistently high performance ratios. Over the past eight years the average net margin on sales has never been below 18% and the Group's overall return on capital employed has been in excess of 40% for 17 successive years. The strong cash flow resulting from this allows us to grow our businesses, to make acquisitions and to increase our dividend. I trust that the remarkable fundamental strengths of the Group will continue to be recognised by shareholders and will be increasingly reflected in our share price."



The Chairman, Mr David Barber, said:



"The Directors again recommend an increase of 20% in the dividend per share. The total dividend is covered 2.1 times by profit before exceptionals and amortisation of goodwill but after taxation and preference dividends. If approved this dividend, amounting to 2.423p per share, will be paid on 21 August 2000 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 21 July 2000.



"Tremendous strides have been made in strengthening the Group and equipping it to be a formidable competitor in what is becoming an ever more demanding market place. We now have worldwide strengths in product development, material procurement, production and marketing. The management effort and financial cost of achieving this have been well spent. I believe that the current financial year will demonstrate very real progress towards our long-term goals."



OPERATING REVIEW



FIRE AND GAS



One of Halma's key strengths is detecting hazards to life and the Group is a world leader in electronic detectors that protect people from the twin dangers of fire and gas.



APOLLO is the clear market leader in Europe for commercial quality fire detectors, and it has a significant share of the global market with sales to more than 70 countries. This year, the company sold record numbers of detectors, installed across the world in commercial, industrial and public buildings. This company has consolidated its European leadership with the launch of new, microprocessor-based "intelligent" detectors, while an increasingly sophisticated range of electronic add-on products helped to expand its global presence.



Halma reinforced its fire detection focus in March 1999 with the acquisition of AIR PRODUCTS AND CONTROLS. Several new products have enhanced this company's position as North America's leading brand of smoke detectors for air-conditioning ducts. Record sales and profits were achieved in its first full year in the Group.



Toxic and flammable gases are a common threat to life and Halma companies specialise in instruments that detect gases, measure them and warn users of an immediate danger.



Electronic gas detectors from CROWCON provide a vital early warning to personnel who may be exposed to gas hazards, such as firefighters, chemical workers and people in confined spaces. Excellent results in the previous year were partly due to three major overseas contracts to equip telecoms engineers; a record achievement which has not been possible to repeat this year. Also, a downturn in the oil and gas industry has caused several customers to defer capital projects. Substantial orders for permanently installed fire and gas safety systems will be received later than expected. However, recent sales growth in the USA and two new products are expected to have significant impact in 2000/2001, when full profit recovery is expected.



TELEGAN has recently won a major contract with Centrica, worth over #1 million, to supply all British Gas service engineers with a new instrument for checking the safety and measuring the energy efficiency of gas boilers. This prestige contract should provide a strong stimulus for sales to independent gas engineers. Record sales and profits were reported by PERMA PURE whose unique products remove unwanted moisture from gas samples. This success is due to continued growth in its core markets, which include instruments to monitor the breathing of intensive care patients in hospital. New products for bio-medical and fuel cell applications are expected to build on this success in the coming year.



WATER



Worldwide demand for clean drinking water is rising continuously due to economic development. At the same time, industrialisation and urbanisation are putting water resources under pressure through pollution and increased consumption.



Halma companies specialise in water technologies that meet the global need for cleaner, safer water. The Group has world-class water technology products - electronic instruments for measuring water quality and locating leaking pipes, and water treatment systems based on ultraviolet light.



In an increasing number of markets, growth in demand for water technology is reinforced by legislation. Improving water quality standards, and regulatory limits on pollution and tolerated wastage drive demand for Halma products.



Regulation of wastewater discharged into rivers has created strong demand for instruments that accurately and quickly analyse water. PALINTEST, which produced record sales and profits, makes electronic instruments, advanced chemical sensors and test reagents for testing water quality and monitoring industrial effluents. In the past year, excellent growth was achieved in sales of its world-leading lead analysis system which has recently been approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency. New electronic sensors are being developed for measuring metal pollutants in water, anticipating increased regulation, particularly from the EU.



Two Halma companies have developed an extremely strong position in the European market for ultraviolet light water treatment equipment. Demand for this technology is rising due to increasing pollution of water supplies and improving standards for drinking water and wastewater discharges. Market growth is also coming from high technology manufacturing processes, such as semi-conductors and pharmaceuticals, that require water of exceptional biological and chemical purity. BERSON, based in The Netherlands, launched several new patented products, including a wastewater treatment system. HANOVIA reported record order intake, record sales and record profits, supplying over 100 treatment systems to the electronics sector alone. There has been strong demand for a new treatment system that de-activates the Cryptosporidium organism in drinking water.



Precise measurement and location of leaks in water pipes has important economic, environmental and health consequences and is a market in which Halma companies offer world-class technology. PALMER ENVIRONMENTAL is the global leader in advanced electronic instruments that detect and locate underground leaks and it reported record profits. Last year's launch of Permalog, a radically new leak detection product, has produced significant UK and overseas sales. This new product may transform leak location technology throughout the world. The purchase of HYDREKA (France) in March 2000 extends the Group's technology portfolio into water flow auditing. It also provides a marketing platform for the sale of Group products to the major international water utilities headquartered in France.



ELEVATOR ELECTRONICS



Elevators are the safest form of transport and Halma dominates the world market for elevator safety systems. The Group's primary products in this sector are the electronic devices that prevent elevator doors from closing onto passengers. These employ the latest developments in electronic infrared sensor technology. The most advanced systems sense passengers between doors or approaching an elevator. Demand patterns for these products depend primarily on building construction growth in national markets. However, worldwide population drift towards cities is forcing up land values making high-rise buildings viable and creating increasing demand for elevators.



The new-build market consists of about 300,000 new elevator installations each year plus continual safety upgrading of the world's installed base of about 7 million elevators. The Group believes it commands almost 50% of the world market for elevator passenger protection systems.



MEMCO is the world's largest manufacturer of elevator door safety systems. Access to new markets, through intragroup trading, should help to deliver profit growth this year. A unique product will soon be launched that will detect and stop anyone attempting to ride on the top of elevator cars, a growing problem known as "elevator surfing".



In October 1999, the Group strengthened its dominant position in elevator safety with the purchase of T L JONES, a major supplier of safety systems to elevator constructors and contractors in Australasia, China and west coast USA. To extend market share in China, this company has recently opened a third sales office supported by an established production facility in Shanghai.



Halma is also a global force in elevator emergency communication systems. The Group now enjoys market leadership in telecoms networks for elevator cars in the USA. ELECTRONIC MICRO SYSTEMS achieved record sales and profits. Demand for its electronic telecoms products is growing in most countries, and new European legislation requiring emergency communication systems should boost sales next year.



The Group has recently bought VANDAL-PROOF PRODUCTS to extend its emergency telecoms range and enter new public access area markets like train stations, airports and college campuses. From a Singapore base, the Group also supplies high quality elevator visual displays and messaging systems though E-MOTIVE, purchased in July 1999.



That company is extending sales beyond its home territories in south-east Asia through joint marketing activities with other Halma Group companies, benefiting from their well-established relationships with elevator manufacturers in North and South America and Europe.



PROCESS SAFETY



A common theme running through Halma Group activities is the detection of hazards and the protection of life. In the process safety sector, the Group is a world leader in systems that prevent workers from coming into contact with dangerous machines and in products which eliminate the risk of catastrophic explosions.



Manufacturing processes are becoming faster and more complex. As a result, the potential risk of industrial workers being injured or killed continues to rise. Around the world, governments are imposing increasingly stringent safety regulations to reflect the rising dangers and changing social attitudes to acceptable risk. This background provides momentum for sales of products that protect people and prevent damage to industrial plant.



While the global process safety sector has long-term growth potential, investment cutbacks in petrochemicals have adversely affected sales of safety control systems in that market. With an increase in the oil price and a restoration of processing capacity, sales to this sector should rise again.



Halma's businesses dominate the world market in sequential locking systems, a principal area of process safety. These products control access to dangerous machinery. Because most production processes pose some risk to the operating staff, safe access control systems are essential throughout manufacturing industry. CASTELL SAFETY INTERNATIONAL is the world leader in this branch of industrial safety and maintained its historical level of profitability last year despite the impact of Sterling's strength on exports. OSECO, which was purchased in July 1999, achieved record sales and profits post-acquisition. This company is a major US manufacturer of process plant protection devices called bursting discs. These products are fitted to pressurised pipes in almost all chemical processing facilities in the world. Excessive pressure causes bursting discs to rupture in a safe and controlled way, avoiding the possibility of a devastating random explosion.



ELFAB is the largest UK manufacturer of bursting discs and during the year launched a series of innovative new products. These combine electrical sensors for status reporting and new types of disc for use in hygienic processes, such as biotechnology and pharmaceutical production.



RESISTORS



The Group is a major international supplier of high power resistors. These products are used by many industries, and their role is to safely absorb excess electrical power or to control the quality of an electrical supply. They are widely used to protect electricity generating plants and power distribution networks from damage and also to prevent supply interruption.



At first sight, the global market for power resistors appears to be mature. However, continued industrialisation and increasing electrical power generation will grow the size and value of this market for the foreseeable future. Allied to this, many industrial power consumers are demanding an improved quality of supply, in both electrical and continuity terms.



In recent years, Halma companies have created entirely new markets and applications for power resistor technology. Fast response by POST GLOVER to an emerging market in the protection of electrical supplies for internet service providers ("ISPs"), where continuity of supply is crucial, has enabled them to dominate this new market. ISPs buy resistive systems to control electrical faults and allow equipment to operate during a fault condition until it is repaired. The company set new sales records last year and raised profits significantly after a decline the previous year.



An important safety-critical power resistor application is in speed control of locomotives and mass transit vehicles, where our resistors are used for braking.



In March 2000 the Group purchased from Eaton Corporation the CUTLER-HAMMER resistor business, which has facilities in the USA, the UK and Canada. Combined with Halma's existing market share, this acquisition makes the Group the key world supplier of locomotive braking resistors.



When it was acquired in 1998, traction resistor specialist MOSEBACH had negligible earnings from exports. At the end of its first full year within the Group, the company had achieved exceptional results in growing its export business, to the extent that overseas sales made up over one third of turnover.



Recovery in its key Latin American export market enabled IPC RESISTORS to report record profits and sales. New products that detect and signal electrical ground faults in industrial plants, already well received by the market, will create significant new sales opportunities.



As a whole, the Group's resistor businesses made record sales and close to record profits last year. Prospects for exceeding these figures this year are very promising. A single order for braking resistors for the Long Island Railway (New York, USA) will be shipped this year valued at over #1 million.



OPTICS AND SPECIALIST



Today, Halma focuses its activities in six core markets, including optics. However, the Group also has several highly successful businesses operating in specialist sectors such as pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences.



The Group is one of the world leaders in precision optical products for diagnosing and treating eye defects. An exciting new product currently being launched by KEELER uses miniaturised video technology to help the partially sighted to become more independent. VOLK is the US market leader in high precision ophthalmic lenses used by opticians and doctors. In the past year, the company reported a new sales record and launched VolkStore, the Group's first direct sales e-tailing web site. This company's research and development investment delivers a continuous stream of innovative new products, such as lenses for new types of laser treatment.



Miniature, precision flow control devices are another of the Group's successful specialist products. These measure and control flows of very valuable or hazardous gases or liquids in biotechnology processes and scientific instruments. Halma's miniature valves are built into the gene sequencing machines used by scientists working on the human genome project. The Group's micro-pumps can also be found in blood analysis machines controlling antibiotic dosing, chemical reagents and aggressive solvents.



SUMMARY



This review has been illustrated with a few examples from Halma's large portfolio of world-class products. Overwhelmingly, the Group's products prevent injury and preserve human life. These products are often used in safety-critical applications where people's lives depend on them. Halma businesses mainly operate in sectors where they are, or can become, market leaders.



The Group's successful approach to product development and innovation is to supplement original ideas generated by internal research and development with leading-edge technology bought in via acquisitions. Acquisition prospects are selected from businesses operating in the same markets as existing Group companies, or with closely complementary products and technologies.



Using this strategy, Halma has established an ever-increasing range of valuable products focused in a narrow range of core markets, which puts the Group in a powerful position for both immediate and long-term growth.

 ROCK-TENN TUMBLES AFTER PROFIT WARNING: Shares of Rock-Tenn (ticker symbol RKT) fell almost 8 percent Monday after the packaging company warned of lower-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings. 

 Excluding plant closing costs, the company said it expects to earn between $5.8 million and $7 million, or 17 cents to 20 cents a share, in the period that ends June 30. 

 Five analysts surveyed by the First Call/Thomson research organization reported a mean forecast of 27 cents a share for the Norcross-based company. 

 Rock-Tenn manufactures packaging, 100 percent-recycled paperboard and laminated paperboard products. It has more than 70 operations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Chile. 

 The company attributed the shortfall to three basic causes: 

 A third-quarter charge of $1.8 million to $2.2 million --- equal to 5 cents to 6 cents a share --- due to higher-than-expected inventory valuation costs. 

 A previously announced charge of $3.4 million to $3.7 million ---or 10 cents to 11 cents per share --- related to plant closings. 

 "Softening business conditions" in its paperboard operations and continued increases in the cost of energy and recycled fiber. 

 However, the company indicated conditions will improve in the fourth quarter, although earnings will be less than last year if current business conditions continue in the paperboard unit. 

 On the plus side, the company said its fourth-quarter inventory valuation charge "will be less significant than in the third fiscal quarter." The company also said it is experiencing "substantial volume increases" in its promotional display business. 

 For the year-ago fourth quarter, it earned $12.2 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $357.78 million, including charges of $600,000, or 2 cents a share, from plant closings. 

 Rock-Tenn's shares closed Monday at $9 per share, down 75 cents, on higher-than-average volume of 77,800 shares. 

 Elsewhere, shares of WestPoint Stevens (WXS), a West Point manufacturer of bed and bath textiles, traded at a 52-week low of $9.38 after First Union Securities analyst Bryan C. Hunt downgraded his rating to "hold" from "strong buy." Hunt lowered his earnings projection for 2000 to $1.89 per share from $2.10, and to $2.15 from $2.40 for 2001. 

 WestPoint Stevens shares closed at $9.63, down 44 cents, on more than double the daily average volume. 

 Wachovia (WB), a regional bank with major Georgia operations, slightly recouped some of last week's losses of almost 19 percent, rising $1.06 to $57.50. 

 The Winston-Salem, N.C., bank shocked the industry last week with its warning of lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings due to the impact of rising interest rates. 

 Argus Research analyst Robert K. Becker downgraded Wachovia shares on Monday to "hold" from "buy." Last week, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Diane L. Merdian downgraded her rating to "neutral" from "outperform," and Legg Mason Wood Walker analyst Christopher M. Mutascio lowered his rating to "market perform" from "strong buy." 

 The market rewarded a plan by Atlanta-based Crown Crafts (CRW) to boost its share price after it fell below the New York Stock Exchange's requirements. The company said Friday it had begun initiatives to cut costs by more than $15 million a year. 

 With 8.6 million shares outstanding, the company said it needs a price of at least $1.75. The stock traded at a 52-week low of $1.19 on April 11. It closed Monday at $1.38 with a gain of 6 cents, or almost 5 percent. 

 A "buy" rating and higher share price target did not prevent Scientific-Atlanta (SFA) from dropping $1.63 to $70.31. Josepthal & Co. analyst Lawrence M. Harris reiterated the "buy" rating for the Norcross-based manufacturer of set-top cable boxes and raised his 12-month target to $90 per share from $83.

Abreast of the Market
 Intel Receives an Outlook Boost And Takes Tech Sector With It

 NEW YORK -- An upbeat outlook for chip maker Intel helped push that stock sharply higher in the session, leading the broader technology sector higher.   

 Shares of the chip-making giant climbed 10 7/16 to 136 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after Lehman Brothers semiconductor analyst Dan Niles set a sharply higher price target for the stock.   

 Meanwhile, rival Advanced Micro Devices climbed 8 to 91, after the chip maker unveiled a new line of low-end microprocessors that compete with Intel's Celeron product line.   

 Asyst Technologies, which had fallen 21% Friday on worries that the Fremont, Calif., chip-equipment maker's relationship with Applied Materials, an important customer, had deteriorated, snapped back yesterday, gaining 7 7/16 to 35 7/16 on Nasdaq, after the company refuted the speculation, and Lehman Brothers called the stock at current prices a superb buy.   

 The sharp gains, coupled with a recovery in financial stocks, which had weakened Friday on some earnings worries, allowed market averages to snap back crisply from ragged performances last week, when earnings woes hit home.   

 In fact, more earnings worries cropped up, as Honeywell, responding to intraday market speculation, confirmed that it won't meet earnings forecasts. The disappointment drove shares down 8 11/16 to close at 40 1/16, reeling to a 52-week low.   

 Nevertheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 108.54, or 1.04%, higher to close at 10557.84.   

 Stocks of other manufacturers also lost ground in the session, with Tyco International off 1 1/8 to 46 7/16, Deere down 1 3/16 to 40 3/16, and Pentair falling 1 3/8 to 35 5/16. The weakness, a symptom of Honeywell's warning, hit the broader cyclical category, a sector considered exposed to any slowdown in economic expansion.   

 Heavy industries -- such as United Technologies, which lost 1 1/2 to 57 3/8, and basic materials, such as International Paper, which fell 1 to 32 and sank to a 52-week low intraday, as well as Alcoa, which lost 1 to 30 1/16 -- also declined.   

 Oil stocks, which resisted any declines last week, succumbed amid some worries about a move by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets later this week, to opt for increased production in the face of rising prices for crude-oil products. Chevron fell 1 3/8 to 91 3/8, while Texaco lost 1 9/16 to 56 1/4, and Exxon Mobil eased 3/8 to 84 1/16.   

 But banking and financial issues, which logged big declines last week amid worries about earnings shortfalls, snapped back handily. Shares of First Union, which slid to a 52-week low Friday, gained 2 3/16 to 29 1/2. Wells Fargo gained 1 13/16 to 40 3/16. Suntrust Banks, after trading near a 52-week low last week, moved up 15/16 to 50 7/16. Even Wachovia, which sparked some of last week's profit jitters with a warning that upcoming earnings wouldn't live up to forecasts, posted a gain yesterday, rising 1 1/16 to 57 1/2.   

 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange/Keefe Bruyette & Woods bank sector index, a measure of the performance of larger banking names, ended the session with a gain of 22.40, up 2.97%, to 777.46.   

 That, however, proved chump change compared with the dramatic gain scored by some technology measures. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index soared 76.5 points, up 6.6%, to 1234.8.   

 The Nasdaq Composite Index, bolstered by the strength in technology, moved ahead 129.27, up 3.35%, to 3989.83.   

 To be sure, some technology stocks posted losses -- in some cases, sharp losses.   

 S1, an Atlanta application service provider, lost 6 1/16 to 22 on Nasdaq, sliding to a 52-week low, after First Union cut its rating on the stock.   

 Centillium fell 3 31/32 to 50 29/32 on Nasdaq, despite some upbeat comments from Wall Street. Credit Suisse First Boston, which helped bring the Fremont, Calif., maker of digital subscriber-line technologies public last month, initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating. The firm said it believed the company could break even by the end of 2001.   

 But more typically, technology issues posted sharp gains in the session, many on upbeat outlooks. Inktomi climbed 21 13/16 to 138 1/4 on Nasdaq, after company officials appeared on Tech Talk, Merrill Lynch's online investment program held each Monday, and said in response to a question that the Foster City, Calif., applications-software developer should be able to maintain its recent quarter-over-quarter growth rates.   

 Oracle climbed 4 1/8 to 86 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston said that it anticipated the Redwood Shores, Calif., database-software developer, expected to issue its fiscal fourth-quarter profits after the close of trading today, would beat analysts' published consensus estimates of 25 cents a share.   

 Rambus added 7 7/8 to 91 1/4 on Nasdaq. The Mountain View, Calif., developer of semiconductor technology, extending the gains notched Friday, when the company said it would license memory technology to Japanese chip maker Toshiba.   

 Kana Communications rose 5 7/8 to 53 1/4 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston started coverage of the Palo Alto, Calif., provider of Internet software with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of 70.   

 Sonus Networks climbed 14 to 113 on Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan started coverage of the Westford, Mass., telecommunicationssoftware developer.   

 Harcourt General climbed 12 13/16 to 54 13/16. The Chestnut Hill, Mass., educational-products maker hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of the company.   

 Seagram gained 1 3/4 to 63 1/4. French conglomerate Vivendi has set final financial terms for its $33 billion merger with the Montreal entertainment and spirits concern.   

 Eli Lilly gained 1 11/16 to 86 5/8. On Friday of this week the Indianapolis drug maker is expected to present Phase III data on an osteoporosis treatment, Lehman Brothers said in an upbeat research note.   

 Idec Pharmaceuticals climbed 15 11/16 to 120 1/4 on Nasdaq. Banc of America Securities reiterated its strong buy rating on shares of the San Francisco pharmaceuticals maker, saying that after meeting with company management Friday, the firm had gained increasing confidence that sales of key products will live up to forecast.   

 Maytag gained 2 9/16 to 38 1/4. Despite weakness in the broader category of consumer cyclicals, the Newton, Iowa, maker of home appliances rallied amid some expectations, perhaps misguided, that the company may be the subject of a takeover. Maytag officials said no announcements are scheduled for this week.

Shares of Chesapeake Corp. fell 11 percent yesterday after the Richmond-based company said its second-quarter earnings will be lower than expected.

The maker of specialty packaging said it expects earnings of 10 to 15 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of about 33 cents.

Chesapeake, the largest North American producer of temporary and permanent point-of purchase displays, also reduced its full-year earnings per share estimate to between $1.85 and $2.05, down from an initial projection of $2.20 to $2.35.

The company said it revised its outlook because several of its U.S. customers have delayed promotions and product launches, which has hurt Chesapeake's point-of-purchase sales and operating margins.

The company did not disclose which customers had delayed purchases, but President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas H. Johnson said orders are starting to strengthen now and the company expects better results in the second half of the year.

Chesapeake shares fell $3.375 to $29.1875 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company plans to announce second-quarter results July 20.

MICROSTRATEGY ASSURES INVESTORS IT WILL GROW

HERNDON -- gut wrenching" accounting problem that sent shares plunging and new data-management software products will fuel revenue growth.

Vienna-based MicroStrategy Inc. held its first shareholder meeting since revised revenue figures in March sent its shares tumbling more than 92 percent in two months.

The company recorded substantial revenue from multiyear software contracts in the first year, violating Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Dozens of shareholder suits were filed.

Chief Executive Michael Saylor apologized for the mistake and said company officials had "done a lot of soul searching" to prevent a similar "gut-wrenching experience." He spent most of a three-hour shareholder meeting detailing new product offerings and assuring investors that the company would grow.

"This is the most upbeat stockholder meeting I've ever been to," said Bill Shahda, an investor who holds about 600 shares.

Several dozen shareholders attended the meeting at a Hilton hotel near Washington Dulles International Airport.

Before the meeting, the company announced that it raised $125 million from the sale of convertible preferred stock, causing its shares to rise as much as 27 percent.

Shares of MicroStrategy rose 10 percent, or $3.875, to close at $42.4375 on the Nasdaq stock market.

HONEYWELL ISSUES EARNINGS WARNING

MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- Honeywell International Inc., a maker of automated controls and one of the largest employers in Richmond, Va., warned that second-quarter profit will be below forecasts because of lower sales, higher costs and a parts shortage.

The company's shares had tumbled as much as 18 percent before trading was halted on the New York Stock Exchange prior to the profit warning. Honeywell didn't comment on the decline.

Honeywell cited an unexpected shortage of parts at its aerospace unit, higher-than-expected raw material costs in its performance materials unit and rising interest rates for the shortfall. The company expects to earn 73 cents to 77 cents a share, below the 78-cent average estimate of analysts survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.

Revenue is expected to rise 7 percent to 8 percent.

Shares yesterday closed at $40.25, down $8.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

BANK TO BUY BRANCHES

Bank of Lancaster plans to purchase three branch offices in Callao, Heathsville and Kilmarnock from First Virginia Bank and First Virginia Bank-Hampton Roads.

The addition will give the bank seven locations in the Northern Neck, including its main office in Kilmarnock.

The purchase is subject to regulatory approval.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, investors greet the new week in a mood to buy. Tech stocks blast ahead, pushing the Dow and Nasdaq to triple-digit gains. One holdout: Honeywell. The Dow component warns of a second-quarter shortfall and investors punish the stock, hammering Honeywell to a new low. 

 On the eve of Seagram (URL: http://www.seagram.com/) and Vivendi unveiling their mega-merger, we look at the media moguls behind the deal to find out which titan will  land on top. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 MICHAEL SAYLOR, CEO, MICROSTRATEGY: I deeply sympathize with all the shareholders. I think we`ve all gone through a pretty gut- wrenching period. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: A contrite Michael Saylor says I`m sorry for what`s happened to MicroStrategy`s (URL: http://www.microstrategy.com/) stock. We`ll bring you the surprising  reaction from shareholders. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, everyone. Stuart is off tonight. 

 Wall Street kicked off Monday on a strong note, powered by a big jump in big-name tech stocks, especially Intel. Investors gaining confidence that second-quarter earnings will be strong and that the Federal Reserve won`t raise interest rates at its meeting next week. 

 The Nasdaq gained more than 3 percent; the Dow, more than 1 percent. Blue chip stocks advancing despite a stiff warning from an old economy powerhouse. 

 Susan Lisovicz has more on today`s triple-digit rally. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Honeywell is the latest high-profile company to bear the consequence of an economy forced to slow down: Higher interest rates cited by the Dow component is one reason why it will miss profit estimates this quarter. And while Honeywell shares plummeted nearly 18 percent, the Dow rallied 108 points, driven by optimism that earnings overall will actually improve. 

 CHUCK HILL, FIRST CALL: Well, I think it`s in the bag to be an excellent quarter. We think final numbers for the S&P earnings growth over last year will be between 22 and 23 percent. That`s slightly less than the 23.6 in the first quarter but certainly close to it. 

 LISOVICZ: Counterbalancing Honeywell`s weakness, a resurgence in blue chip financials. American Express (URL: http://www.americanexpress.com/) finally rebounded after regional Bank Wachovia`s (URL: http://www.wachovia.com/) profit warning last week. Other winners included Bank of America (URL: http://www.bankamerica.com/) and Chase Manhattan (URL: http://www.chase.com/) . 

 Intel soared on favorable growth comments, which spurred a charge in semiconductor stocks that boosted share prices in Advanced Micro Devices (URL: http://www.amd.com/) and Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/) . And that helped lift the Nasdaq, which rose  129 points, or more than 3 percent, for the session. 

 BERNIE PICCHI, FEDERATED INVESTORS: This market is saying that it really wants to go higher. It just -- it just has that feel to it, that even in the face of the preannouncements of earnings disappointments by Wachovia and Union Bank of California and Honeywell today that there`s so much cash on the sidelines, and at the same time, so many companies are coming in with earnings which are actually significantly better- than-expected. 

 LISOVICZ (on camera): And the expectation is that tech companies will be among the best performers in terms of quarterly profits. That sentiment and the growing sense that the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates alone next week helped power the Nasdaq to its highest close in more than two months. 

 Susan Lisovicz, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Today`s rally brought the Nasdaq within 90 points of where it started the year. One big source of support of the Nasdaq: a dramatic rise in Intel. After today`s rally, it`s up a stunning 66 percent year to  date. 

 For more on today`s action, we go to Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq marketsite -- Charles. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Willow, it wasn`t a broad rally. Stocks going up barely outnumber those going down, and volume was weak again. But today`s positive analyst comments on Intel sure lit a fire to the semiconductor stocks. They were up 6 1/2 percent as a group. 

 KLA-Tencor (URL: http://www.tencor.com/) took off on a rocket ride. So did Rambus after analysts gave it bullish comments on news of a series of new licensing deals. National Semiconductor (URL: http://www.national.com/) and Novellus Systems (URL: http://www.novellus.com/) both look great. And Asyst (URL: http://www.asyst.com/) was one of the best-performing stocks on the Nasdaq after it denied rumors of trouble in its relationship with Advanced Micro Devices. 

 Biotechs took off to 6 1/2 percent with some eye-popping rallies by Incense -- Insight (URL: http://www.insight-com.com/) rather and OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. (URL: N/A)  . 

 Financial names gained ground. Some strategists called that a snapback on sentiment that it got a little oversold last week. Check out T. Rowe Price (URL: http://www.troweprice.com/) and Northern Trust (URL: http://www.ntrs.com/) . 

 And Internet stocks did gain as a group but generally missed out on the strength. Infrastructure play Inktomi (URL: http://www.inktomi.com) gave them a nice boost, up by 18 percent. But DoubleClick (URL: http://www.doubleclick.net) got nuked after analysts cut their projections for its revenues. And online bank S1, which is both financial and Internet, got pulverized after bearish analyst comments on its revenues. 

 Market watchers say enthusiasm is building for a strong second- quarter earnings season while the consensus keeps building that the Federal Reserve will do nothing to interest rates at its next policy meeting, or 

 at worst just raise rates 25 basis points at one of its next two, and then stop raising rates -- Willow. 

 BAY: Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq, thank you. 

 Now, we head over to the big board where investors kept the faith despite a first-alert from Honeywell. 

 Rhonda Schaffler is at the New York Stock Exchange -- Rhonda. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Willow, one reason why buyers came back to the big board today despite that high-profile warning is that investors are worrying a bit less about what the Fed`s going to do at next week`s policy-making meeting. The consensus on Wall Street is that there`s enough evidence that the economy is slowing. MONEYLINE surveyed 13 top economists and asked, "Will there be a rate hike in June?" The answer: a resounding "no." 

 But the problem here is that relief over a possibly inactive Fed this month could give way to more worries about what lies ahead. MONEYLINE also asked those economists if the Fed would boost rates in August, and most of the economists we talked with think the Fed will resume boosting rates at that meeting. Only two economists think the Fed will take the entire summer off. And of those expecting an August rate  hike, there was no consensus on just how much interest rates would be pushed higher. 

 What Wall Street has to figure out is whether the potential for higher interest rates a few months from now makes stocks less attractive at the moment. For today at least, investors looked beyond stocks like Honeywell, and decided overall-profits are growing fast enough to counter the Fed -- Willow. 

 BAY: Rhonda Schaffler at the Big Board, thank you. 

 The unveiling of a megamedia deal is now just hours away. The boards of Vivendi and CANAL+ (URL: http://www.cplus.fr/) today unanimously approved their $33 billion merger with Seagram. Seagram`s board also met to vote on the deal, and an announcement is set for tomorrow morning. 

 As this story unfolds, we turn to Robert Thomson, our colleague at the "Financial Times," for the latest. 

 Robert, what do we know so far? 

 ROBERT THOMSON, "FINANCIAL TIMES": Well, that`s right, Willow. Expect an announcement tomorrow morning. It`s pretty certain that this deal will go through. As you say, it`s going to be called Vivendi Universal. That will be the new name. 

 The deal is for 0.7 of each Vivendi share for each Seagram share, with a little allowance there in case the Vivendi share price should happen to fall in the next few weeks and months. 

 Also, Seagram is going to renounce the hard liquor. It`s selling the drinks business for an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion. 

 BAY: Robert, as you mentioned, there going to spin off the liquor business, but in general, what does this mean for the Bronfman family? 

 THOMSON: Well, Edgar Bronfman Jr. is likely to be the vice chairman of the new company. The Seagram people will have an estimated five of the 18 seats on the new board. But basically, the power of this company is going to be in Paris. 

 This is a company that`s going to need subtitles. 

 (LAUGHTER) 

 BAY: What is Edgar Bronfman Jr.`s area of responsibility likely to be? 

 THOMSON: It`s a little bit unclear. Obviously, he`s interested in the movie and music business. That`s the glamour side to be in. But the people at CANAL+ reckon they know that trade as well. So the potential for cultural disagreement there, and commercial disagreement even more importantly, is quite profound. 

 BAY: Robert, it`s going to be a busy day in Paris tomorrow. Publicis(ph) also calling a press conference to announce its purchase of Saatchi & Saatchi (URL: http://www.saatchi-saatchiplc.com/) . 

 THOMSON: That`s what we here. It looks like a $2 billion price tag on this one. That Gallic charm is irrepressible at the moment. 

 Saatchi & Saatchi, based in London, 75 percent of its profits last year, though, came from U.S. business. And Publicis, a very aggressive advertising company. And this deal reflective of the consolidation in the advertising industry generally. 

 BAY: Robert Thomson, thank you for those updates. 

 Coming up, we`ll check out the marriage plans for the "Baby Bells": an interview with the CEOs of Bell Atlantic (URL: http://www.bellatlantic.com/) and GTE (URL: http://www.gte.com/) about the government`s stamp of approval for Verizon. 

 And later, skyrocketing prices at the country`s gas pumps: Can help be on the way? We`ll look at what OPEC may have in store. 

 Plus, a troubled software firm faces shareholders at its annual meeting, but how will MicroStrategy explain the accounting scandal that rocked its stock? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: AT&T Wireless today expanding its reach in deals worth a total of $3.3 billion. AT&T Wireless is buying wireless phone systems in San Francisco, San Diego and Houston from competitors, Vodafone (URL: http://www.vodafone-airtouch-plc.com/) AirTouch, GTE Wireless and Bell Atlantic. 

 The deals will give AT&T Wireless (URL: http://www.attws.com/) an additional 1.3 million customers, and are expected to gain federal approval by the end of the year. AT&T Wireless, public for just a few months, has not lived up to its high expectations. Since peaking right after its $10.6 billion IPO, AT&T Wireless has fallen more than 20 percent. Today, it gained nearly a point. 

 The moves today by AT&T Wireless play a supporting role in the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE. The companies needed to sell off some assets to win regulatory approval for their deal. The two "baby bells" got the nod from the FCC late Friday for a merger that will create the nation`s largest local telephone company. 

 The new company, Verizon Communications, will have a market cap of more than $150 billion, annual revenue of $60 billion and will serve 63 million local phone lines in the U.S., nearly a third of all U.S. households. 

 Joining us now to talk about this $65 billion merger are Bell Atlantic Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg and GTE Chairman and CEO Chuck Lee. 

 Gentlemen, welcome. 

 IVAN SEIDENBERG, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BELL ATLANTIC: Good evening. 

 CHARLES LEE, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, GTE: Good evening. 

 BAY: I would imagine that your first task: new name Verizon, new logo. And, Ivan, you say that we`re going to see Verizon setting a new standard. Is this really your critical -- besides execution -- your critical challenge, to establish a strong brand identity for Verizon? 

 SEIDENBERG: Well, absolutely. In this marketplace, what you need is a big master brand, one that people recognize all over the world. So that`s the first task, is to get people comfortable with new name. 

 BAY: So what does Verizon offer to customers that Bell Atlantic and GTE didn`t? 

 SEIDENBERG: The new company will accelerate the deployment of advanced technologies. So it`s access to the Internet, it`s broadband, it`s national one-rate calling with wireless services, and it`s bundled services. It`s a single bill, which most people would like. So the new company... 

 BAY: So one bill for... 

 SEIDENBERG: One bill. 

 BAY: ... local, long distance, wireless -- whatever you need. It`s all going to come on that one bill? 

 SEIDENBERG: That`s the plan. 

 BAY: Chuck, you said we`re going to be global leader. Now are you suggesting that you plan to expand your reach even further? And does that mean that you actually have an eye toward further acquisitions? 

 LEE: Willow, what we`ve said for a number of years is that the telecommunications industry is going to evolve into four or five global players. Now that may take five or it may take 10 years. 

 In order to be big global player, you have to be a leading national player, a leading position in the United States. As Ivan just described, we have created that with this historic merger between GTE and Bell Atlantic. And we need to continue to evolve our international strategy, international connectivity. 

 There are varies ways to meet that goal. It doesn`t necessarily mean buying something. It may mean developing joint ventures. It may be leasing or reselling activities. But we`re going to be a global company. We`re in some great international markets now. And we`re going to continue to grow and develop our international business in the years ahead. 

 BAY: One of the moves I know that we can expect is a spin-off of Genuity, which you`re required to do. This is considered one of the gems in this merger. Is it important to you that you get it back? 

 LEE: Willow, it is absolutely critical in our process with regulators, which they were sympathetic to, and that we have a path to get it back into  course. Now they gave us one very large hurdle is Bell Atlantic must be able to provide long distance service or be in the long-distance business in all of its 14 locations. New York is the only that it`s allowed in so far. 

 But having Genuity, which is the telecommunications Internet protocol, Internet service and products -- it is the way of the future and we must 

 have it back. 

 BAY: They`ve done it in New York. I mean, is it likely that you`ll work these 13 others out? 

 SEIDENBERG: Sure. New York is done, as you said. We expect to move in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania by the end of this year. The rest  of states in 2001. We have five years to do it. We think we can do it in two. 

 BAY: Quick question: when does that start trading, Genuity? 

 SEIDENBERG: Say July 1st, around. 

 BAY: Around July 1st. 

 Gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us tonight. 

 SEIDENBERG: Thank you. 

 LEE: Thank you, Willow. Great to be here. 

 BAY: Still to come, America Online takes on Microsoft. This time, it`s all about television. The story when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Shares of AOL (URL: http://www.aol.com/) fell fractionally today. The leading Internet provider today announced it will launch an interactive television service, AOLTV next month. 

 It`s the latest move to bring e-mail, instant messaging, and Web browsing to TV screens. And AOL, which has announced plans to merge with Time Warner, parent of this network, is drawing on its already huge customer base to give it a leg up on existing competition. 

 Bruce Francis reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The competition is fierce. The players are wealthy and powerful. But is the audience paying attention? 

 America Online is introducing AOLTV, a set-top box that let`s you check e-mail, chat with online buddies and a lot more while you watch TV. 

 But America Online is standing by the PC as the principle way consumers will log on to their service. 

 ROBERT PITTMAN, PRESIDENT AND COO, AMERICA ONLINE: The idea`s making TV experience better. It`s not for all 23 million accounts we have. But it`s for some sub-set of it that really do enjoy it and really do understand the value. 

 FRANCIS: AOLTV includes a personal video recorder which uses a computer hard drive, not tapes, to record and play back TV shows. An online-program guide attempts to make that easier. 

 Some versions are also bundles in with satellite receivers. Prices start at around $250. The service costs up to $24.95 a month, less if you already have AOL. Microsoft`s WebTV just introduced a new version that includes similar features called Ultimate TV. WebTV is estimated to 

 have just a million customers in over three years. 

 Jupiter Communications estimates that interactive TV devices, including those like WebTV and AOLTV, will grow from a small base now to 29 million homes in 2004. But the PC will remain the more popular way to connect. Jupiter says America Online understands consumers better than Microsoft. 

 DAVID CARD, JUPITER COMMUNICATIONS: AOL TV is a little bit late, but it is AOL. So we think it will actually have a reasonably significant impact on the marketplace. 

 FRANCIS: Consumer electronics expert Stewart Wolpin of eTown.com thinks AOL gets points for branding, but consumers will remain unimpressed. 

 STEWART WOLPIN, ETOWN.COM: There`s going to be a lot of people not using these. I think we`re talking very expensive door stops, at least for the time being. 

 FRANCIS: Clearly AOL and Microsoft disagree. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: Both Microsoft and AOL are making their set-top online services add-ons to more established consumer needs, like program recording, a recognition that perhaps that chat, e-mail and Web browsing on your TV aren`t enough to lure consumers -- Willow. 

 BAY: Service starts next month? 

 FRANCIS: And we`re off to the races. 

 BAY: Bruce Francis, thank you. 

 Still ahead on MONEYLINE, a new computer virus is wandering the Web. Is it lurking in your e-mailbox? We`ll have that story ahead on our "News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Oil prices today stepped back from their dramatic rise on expectations  that OPEC would agree later this week to raise production. 

 Checking prices, benchmark light, sweet crude fell 64 cents, but it may take a while before you notice any relief at the pump. 

 Lisa Leiter looks at the economic impact on one area hit hard by soaring gas prices: Chicago. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 LISA LEITER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The recent spike in gas prices has already sliced away profits at this branch of Connie`s Pizza, where delivers provide 40 percent of business. 

 IVAN MATSUNAGA, CONNIE`S PIZZA: We provide our own vehicles to our drivers, so they`re company-owned. So it`s affected us to the tune of about $40,000. Our operating costs have never been higher. 

 LEITER: Connie`s is combating those costs by raising its delivery fee from $3 to $4. Beyond Connie`s, gasoline is the talk of the town, where the average price for a gallon of regular is $2.15, 50 cents above the national average. 

 The price spike will take a billion dollars out of the local economy, as people spend less at restaurants and retail stores and more on gas, that`s according to a study published today in "Crain`s Chicago Business." 

 The economic impact was one of the topics today at hearings called by area congressman to determine why Chicagoans are paying so much to fuel up. 

 JUDITH ROUSSEL, ILLINOIS SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION: Those whose main line of business involves moving goods or passengers are finding their narrow profit margins evaporating, we believe, almost as quickly as gasoline itself evaporates when exposed to air. 

 LEITER: There was a lot of finger-pointing about who`s to blame for soaring prices. Some say its the tight supplies of oil exaggerated in the Midwest by a recent pipeline break in Michigan. Some stations near Detroit even ran out of gas at the end of last week. 

 Some blame the cost of complying with federal clean air rules. Others say high local and state taxes are the culprit. And then there are accusations that oil companies are overcharging drivers. 

 DAVID SYKUTA, ILLINOIS PETROLEUM COUNCIL: Allegations of price gouging are nonsense. It`s been studied dozens of times. It always comes down to something much more mundane like taxes or regulations. We`ll take our chances with a fair investigation. 

 LEITER: The Federal Trade Commission on Friday said it will launch an(ph) investigation into gas prices. 

 (on camera): In the meantime, drivers are unlikely to get any immediate relief. Even if OPEC agrees to increase output at its meeting in Vienna this week, analysts say it would will take about six weeks for any increase in production to affect retail prices.

 BAY: Time now for a look at the day`s top stories outside the world of business. 

 Joie Chen with the "MONEYLINE News Digest" -- Joie. 

 JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Willow, thanks. 

 The investigation into the disappearance and the reappearance of those computer hard drives at the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory is narrowing tonight. With the FBI interviewing lab employees, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says the focus is now on a few individuals, all individuals who had access to the high-security area where the drives were found on Friday. 

 An appeal today from Attorney General Janet Reno to high-tech companies to join Washington in fighting cybercrime. Reno asked executives at a cybercrime summit for ideas, and she promised confidentiality, an appeal to companies that are reluctant to admit they`ve been hit by a virus  or cybercriminal. 

 All this comes as a new computer virus made its way around the Internet today. The vbs.stages.a bug is not as destructive as last month`s ILOVEYOU computer worm, but it is harder to spot. Among the clues, the message in your e-mail subject line reads: jokes text, funny text, or life stages. 

 A controversial decision today from the Supreme Court: Based on a case in Texas, the justices ruled that students cannot lead prayers before high school football games. Republican presidential candidate and Texas Governor George W. Bush expressed his disappointed. 

 Finally, actress Nancy Marchand, who played Livia on the hit TV series "The Sopranos" has died after a battle with cancer. Marchand would have been 72 years old tomorrow. 

 And those are tonight`s top stories. We`ll have more on "The World Today," coming up at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific. We hope you join us then --Willow. 

 BAY: Thanks, Joie. 

 And MONEYLINE will be back right after this. 

 Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, Honeywell takes a brutal hit on Wall Street, rocked by revelations the company won`t meet profit forecasts. 

 And all but the finishing touches for a French-Canadian mega-merger, as Viveni gears up to buy Seagram. We`ll profile the power players behind the deal. 

 Plus, the latest stumbling block on the golden road to cyberspace. Concerns that the money train, advertising revenue, has run out of steam. 

 But first, more on our top story: a tech comeback ignites a buying wave on Wall Street. A surge in biotech and chip stocks propels the Nasdaq to its highest level in more than two months, and that strength spread over to the Dow. Both averages posted a triple- digit advance, as investors shrugged off yet another profit warning and instead embraced a positive boost for Intel. 

 The Dow industrials up more than 108 points on the day after sinking more than 265 points on Friday. The blue-chip average now stands at 10,557. Over on the Nasdaq, the gains were even bigger in percentage terms, up more than 3 percent to 3,989. The composite index now just 79 points from climbing back in the black this year. 

 Kitty Pilgrim has more on today`s stellar start to the week. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There were two major comeback stories in the market on Monday: high finance and high techs. Financials, beleaguered by worries over credit last week, started the day on the downside but recovered to post respectable gains. Morgan Stanley (URL: http://www.msdw.com/) , J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) , American Express, Chase Manhattan, and FleetBoston (URL: http://www.fleetbankbostonmerger.com/) all posted gains. 

 Some Wall Street veterans are continuing to see financial stocks as a good bet, based on the theory that interest-rate hikes may soon be over. 

 BILL MEEHAN, CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO.: We`re gaining some of those devastating losses in the bank stocks back today. I still think that`s a little bit difficult area to deal in, but I have liked the brokerage stocks for awhile. And if we do get a decent summer rally, I think they`ll perform well. 

 PILGRIM: But while the rebound in financial stocks was encouraging, big-cap tech stocks were the true market leaders. Intel led the advance after Lehman Brothers projected a higher price 12 months down the road. That gave Intel a more than 10-point gain. IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) , and Unisys (URL: http://www.unisys.com/)  all followed suit. 

 The market shrugged off an early jolt from Dow component Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) , which lost nearly 18 percent after issuing an earnings warning. 

 LOUIS HOLLAND, HOLLAND CAPITAL MGMT.: I think this is fairly a risky environment, because I really do believe that the economy is slowing down a little bit. However, the other side of it is that the breadth of the market is really terrific. Over 50 percent of all New York Stock Exchange stocks are above their 200-day moving average, as contrasted to about 20 percent several months ago. So, we have more stocks participating in the advance. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 PILGRIM: Today`s tech-powered rally brings the Nasdaq less than a dozen points within breaking back above 4,000. Now, if the index can pull off another triple-digit rally tomorrow, the Nasdaq will actually be higher for the year 2000, though not by much -- Willow. 

 BAY: Kitty -- if -- thank you. Today`s strength not just on the Dow and Nasdaq. The broader market also benefited from the buying spree, the S&P 500 soared to close at 1,486, the index now back in the plus column this year. Advancers beat out decliners by a slim margin, 77 stocks hit new highs, while 67 fell to new lows. 

 One of those stocks hitting a 52-week low today: Honeywell, the stock slammed after the company issued a second quarter profit warning. The most actively traded stock on the big board, Honeywell plummeted more than $8.50 to close just below 40. 

 Fred Katayama now, on a tumultuous day for an old economy giant. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The maker of everything from flight control systems for planes to building controls could not slam the breaks on its stock. Honeywell shares nose-dived as much as 21 percent as word leaked that the company would issue an earnings warning. 

 ROBERT FRIEDMAN, S&P EQUITY GROUP: I don`t see a huge snap back in the stock because I think that management has temporary lost credibility due to the fact that they waited so long to come out with earnings problems. 

 KATAYAMA: The stock got slammed out of the gate as those rumors spread. It stopped trading at 12:17 p.m. Eastern at 41 3/16. The rumors were confirmed as an earnings warning crossed the news wires at 12:54. The stock reopened half an hour later at $41. It finished the day at a new 52-week low, losing nearly 18 percent at 39 7/8. 

 Honeywell now expects to earn 73-77 cents a share in the second quarter, falling short of Wall Street`s forecast of 78 cents. It also expects revenues to rise 7-8 percent instead of 9-10 percent. 

 In a cryptic news release, the company known for its earnings consistency laid the blame on an unexpected shortage of aerospace parts, higher than expected prices for raw materials such as oil, and higher interest rates. 

 The warning stunned analysts who questioned why the company was hit by a parts shortage. The other aspects, higher interest rates and rising commodities prices, could portend a slowdown for other companies as well. 

 LIAM DALTON, AXIOM CAPITAL MGMT.: They don`t have, I think, an easy time going forward, and that`s really the case for a lot of companies now. I mean, they`re facing a lot of challenges because of some of these things that are going to weigh on profit margins. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATAYAMA: Today`s warning covered only the current quarter. Honeywell, which had earlier predicted earnings growth of 20 percent for the year 2000, would only say that it is evaluating its forecast for the full year -- Willow. 

 BAY: Fred -- evaluating -- so we should expect more news and perhaps more bad news? 

 KATAYAMA: More explanation in a few weeks. 

 BAY: Fred Katayama, thank you. 

 MicroStrategy shareholders could certainly sympathize with Honeywell investors, as its stock has cratered in recent months, but today was different. The company jumped 10 percent on news it secured $125 million in private funding. MicroStrategy shares gained nearly 4 today to close just below 42 1/2, but that`s still way off the lofty level  it hit in March before the company restated its financial results. 

 Today, MicroStrategy`s chairman and CEO Michael Saylor faced shareholders for the first time since the damaging setback, and today, Peter Viles was at the company`s shareholder meeting in Virginia. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Software billionaire Michael Saylor loves to talk, so much so he once said his idea of heaven is a microphone and a captive audience. But this was hardly heaven, apologizing to shareholders for an accounting debacle that destroyed investor confidence and wiped out 80 percent of his company`s market value. 

 MICHAEL SAYLOR, CHAIRMAN & CEO, MICROSTRATEGY: I deeply sympathize with all the shareholders. I think we`ve all gone through a pretty gut- wrenching period over the past 12 weeks. 

 VILES: MicroStrategy, which makes software for businesses, shot above $300 a share before it restated earnings and revenue for 1998 and `99. In the weeks that followed, it fell below $20 a share before bouncing back slightly. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The way I read it in the "Washington Post," basically stated that you were making profits based on future deliverables, which in  my opinion, is a Accounting 101 mistake. 

 VILES: Saylor blamed what he says are complicated rules for booking software revenue, and some shareholders supported him. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to commend you, your management staff, everybody in the company for the great job you`re doing, keep it up. 

 VILES: Saylor, who has lost more than $8 billion himself on paper, held court for nearly two hours on everything from why no one`s been fired... 

 SAYLOR: When we write a piece of software, if there`s a bug in the software, we don`t find the engineer that put the bug in the software and  shoot them. 

 VILES: ... to how he hopes to save lives with software. 

 SAYLOR: If you`re a cardiovascular surgeon, and you wanted to see the 10 books on cardiology read by other heart surgeons in the past month, where the heart surgeon said, this book might save the life of your next patient -- that`s us. 

 VILES (on camera): Saylor said that no top executives have left the company since the problem surfaced, which he called a vote of confidence in the company`s future. But MicroStrategy still faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and shareholder lawsuits now consolidated into a single class-action suit.

 And we`ll check out the latest legal wrinkles in Microsoft`s battle to stay  in one piece. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: It`s now a done deal for Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. They closed their $90 billion merger today after the Federal Trade Commission gave a green light to the creation of the world`s largest pharmaceutical company. What`s left? Divestiture of two drugs by each company and a 30-day period for public comment. 

 Shares of both companies lower on Wall Street today. Pfizer (URL: http://www.pfizer.com/) down nearly a point, Warner-Lambert (URL: http://www.warner-lambert.com/) dropped almost one and quarter on its final day of trading. 

 The megamedia marriage between Seagram and Vivendi is now just hours away. Today, the Vivendi board unanimously approved the company`s $33 billion buyout of the entertainment and beverage giant. According to our colleagues at "The Financial Times," an announcement of the deal is set for tomorrow morning. The new company would be named Vivendi Universal. 

 The "FT" reports that the all-stock offer values 0.7 Vivendi shares for every Seagram share, and once the deal is complete, Vivendi could sell off Seagram`s $8-10 million liquor business. 

 On Wall Street today, Seagram shares jumped another $1 1/2 to close above 63: the stock now just slightly below its 52-week high of $65 per share. 

 And as Greg Clarkin reports, this blockbuster merger has some colorful players at the center of the deal. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He`s known as J2M, and he`s gone from running a French water company to building an international media empire in just four years. He`s Jean Marie Messier, and he`s on the brink of owning one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Universal Studios, as well as some of the biggest names in music, including Shania Twain and even liquor brands, such as Chivas Regal. 

 They`re all part of the Seagram empire, soon to be part of the Vivendi empire, run by Messier. With this deal, he adds them to his stake in Europe`s pay-TV company, CANAL+. 

 JEAN MARIE MESSIER, CEO, VIVENDI: It`s definitely clear that the combination between Vivendi, CANAL+ and Seagram would create a lot of value and would create one of the very, very, very few groups around the world able to undertake this winning strategy in the coming decades. CLARKIN: Analysts say another potential winner in the deal is Barry Diller. Seagram owns more than 40 percent of Diller`s USA Networks. Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr. has reportedly used that to stifle Diller`s deal-making. 

 KYLE POPE, INSIDE.COM: A couple of years ago, he tried to buy NBC and got very close to a deal, went to Bronfman, and Bronfman nixed it and said essentially that any deal like that would dilute Bronfman`s stake in Seagram and then he couldn`t do the deal. Diller has been incredibly frustrated, and the two are hardly on speaking terms. 

 CLARKIN: Diller now would take such a proposal to Messier, known to be a more aggressive deal-maker. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And analysts suggest Diller may even team with Liberty Media`s John Malone in an attempt to buy back the stakes in USA he doesn`t own. 

 Now, as for the 45-year-old Edgar Bronfman Jr., word is he`ll end up as vice chairman of the new company, focusing on Universal Music, the world`s largest music company. And the Bronfman family, well, it looks they will end up with about 8 percent of the merged company -- Willow. 

 BAY: And again, Greg, we should expect an announcement of that deal from Europe tomorrow. 

 CLARKIN: Exactly, out of Paris. 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin, thanks. 

 In other corporate news tonight, "The Financial Times" is reporting that French advertising group Publicis is set to announce an all-stock purchase of London-based Saatchi & Saatchi in a deal worth $2 billion. 

 Saatchi confirms it has been approached but would not comment on the suitor. Saatchi & Saatchi has a huge U.S. client base, including Procter & Gamble and General Mills. Publicis has scheduled a news conference tomorrow in Paris. 

 And Textbook publisher Harcourt is looking for a buyer. With $4 billion in market cap, Harcourt is one of the largest publishers of educational material in the world. Possible buyers include competitors McGraw-Hill, Pearson, Houghton Mifflin, and media companies Bertelsmann and Thomson. 

 Taking a look at those stocks, Harcourt closed at a 52-week high of more than 54 3/4, and shares of Saatchi & Saatchi surged 7 3/4 in (UNINTELLIGIBLE) trading.

 BAY: A victory today for Microsoft and its fight to appeal the judge`s breakup order. But as Steve Young reports, it`s a victory that may not last for long. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Court of Appeals today handed Microsoft a win with a shelf life of possibly a single day. This court, which has been friendly to the company before, says it will hear Microsoft`s appeal of the order from district Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson breaking up the company, even though the Justice Department has asked the appeals court to slow down while it tries fast-tracking the case to the Supreme Court. 

 DAN WALL, ANTITRUST ATTORNEY: The Court of Appeals has gone out of its way to get involved in this case, and the logical reading for that is that they`re saying to the Supreme Court: "We`re on this; we want a shot at deciding this appeal, so stay your hand." 

 YOUNG: Microsoft later filed a brief telling Judge Jackson why the appeals court should rule first. But now the judge is expected to deliver the case straight to the Supreme Court to see if it will take it directly, forcing the appeals court to back off. 

 While this maneuvering continued, Microsoft critics were taking notice of the company`s announcement that the successor to Windows 98, called Windows ME, will go on sale in September for prices up to $209 a copy. 

 KEN WASCH, SOFTWARE INFORMATION INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION: Over the last five years, the price of every other component that goes into a computer has been falling. The only component that has been rising in price has been the price of Windows, the one component that has no competition. 

 YOUNG: But Microsoft still doesn`t accept the finding that it`s abused its market power. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: It plans to appeal every major point in Judge Jackson`s final judgment, even his ruling that Microsoft is a monopolist, never mind a predatory monopolist -- Willow. 

 BAY: Steve Young, thank you. 

 Microsoft`s stock today gained 1 1/8 to 73 11/16. 

 Other companies making moves today: Gateway gained more than 3 1/2. Well-known tech analyst Dan Niles making positive comments on the PC retailer. 

 Magic Software lost 3 3/4. The software company warned that second-quarter sales and profits will fall short of analyst expectation. It cited slower-than-expected sales of its customer management software. 

 And Rambus gained nearly eight. Several analysts made positive comments on the chip technology company and raised its price target following its announcement Friday of a licensing pact with Toshiba. 

 Over the past two trading sessions Rambus shares have skyrocketed 61 percent. 

 In tonight`s "Sector Focus," banking stocks. The bank index gained nearly  3 percent today after losing more than 8 percent last week. But there are other worries about the banking business. 

 As Allan Chernoff reports, the nation`s banks may not be fully prepared for an economic slowdown. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Warning signs to the nation`s biggest banks are just beginning to emerge -- corporate bond defaults on the rise; junk bond defaults climbing even faster; non- performing loans increasing; and Internet businesses going bust -- all while the economy is slowing in the face of rising interest rates. 

 Yet banks have their loan-loss reserves at the lowest level since the mid-`80s in an effort to maximize their earnings. The mid-point for the nation`s bank only 1.44 percent. That`s $1.44 cents set aside for every $100 in loans, about half the reserve level of 1990. 

 DAVID BERRY, KEEFE, BRUYETTE & WOODS: In some sense, when you get into a slowdown or a recession, what hurts you are the loans that you made during the boom times. And, of course, we`ve been living through boom times, so one would imagine we have made some loans that are going to run into trouble if we have a recession. I think that`s baked in. 

 CHERNOFF: Federal regulators are watching closely. The head of credit risk at the office of the comptroller of the currency told CNN, "I would expect this would be the time that banks would start to look at reserves and start to take care of their problem loans." That`s what Wachovia Corporation did last Thursday, boosting reserves by $200 million. Union BanCal followed suit on Friday, and there could be more coming. 

 Institutions with reserves well below the median include J.P. Morgan, North Fork Bancorp, Dime Bancorp, Charter One Financial and Golden West Financial. This does not necessarily signal trouble. Banks with low- risk loans keep their reserves low. But when the economy weakens, credit quality inevitably deteriorates. 

 ROBERT ALBERTSON, PRESIDENT, PILOT FINANCIAL: Credit is going to now get worse. It`s going to continue to get worse for years and years and years until we get to a recession, and hopefully that`s a ways away. It`s gradual. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: But it can hit the stocks very quickly, as demonstrated last week, when Wachovia boosted its reserves, hurt its earnings, devastating its stock and taking the entire sector down with it. So investors in financials need to be prepared. Today, J.P. Morgan cut  earnings estimates for Bank of America, First Union, and FirstStar -- Willow. 

 BAY: Tricky times for these stocks. Allan Chernoff, thanks. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, as dot.coms slash their ad budgets, is the lifeblood being drained out of DoubleClick? 

 Terry Keenan will look "Behind the Numbers," when Moneyline returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Today, shares of online advertising powerhouse DoubleClick opened sharply lower. The stock was hit hard by an analyst`s report detailing a tough online ad environment in the coming months. It`s a trend that could spell serious trouble for dozens of other dot.coms as well. 

 Terry Keenan takes a look "Behind the Numbers." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, it`s the latest shoe to drop in the land of dot.coms, increasingly persistent signs that the Internet advertising market is now slowing. The first red flag came last week, when NBCI, the Internet arm of the Peacock Network warned that it would miss sales targets for this year. With advertising accounting for 80 percent of its revenue, a soft ad environment was clearly to blame. 

 Today, Robertson Stephens` cut its revenue estimates for DoubleClick, saying it sees a softer Internet ad market this quarter and next. Here`s the issue: Although the Internet advertising pie has doubled since 1998 and is still growing, many sites have been extremely dependent on other dot.coms for their advertising dollars. But with many of these cites strapped for cash, advertising spending by Internet companies has been the first to go. And the dot.com daisy chain has begun to be broken. 

 LOWELL SINGER, ROBERTSON STEPHENS: Some of them are really running out of cash, and those that aren`t running out of cash are getting much more conservative with how they spend their money. So they are turning to the most efficient forms of advertising. 

 KEENAN: Internet portal Alta Vista is typical. After failing to go public in April, the company is speeding up its push to profitability by cutting its advertising and marketing budget by 33 percent. 

 Singer expects the Internet advertising business to pick up by year`s end, fueled by the holiday shopping season. Still, the advertising slowdown in the dot.coms own backyard will hammer the marginal players. Already, 90 percent of all advertising dollars goes to the top 50 Web sites, leaving a relatively small slice for the hundreds of others of dot.coms to divide -- Willow. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Thanks, Terry. 

 After plunging more than $5 intraday, DoubleClick fought its way back, ending the day down nearly 1 1/2.

 WRAPUP-U.S. stocks rally, bonds fall on steady Fed view.

 NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - Stocks rallied but bonds fell on Monday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady next week, now that inflation seems to be under control. 

 The yen rose broadly against the dollar and Europe's single currency on hopes of a Japanese economic recovery and an interest-rate hike later this year. In New York, crude oil for July delivery settled above $31 a barrel again after signs that OPEC members will agree to increase production at their meeting this week in Vienna. 

 The technology-stacked Nasdaq composite index pulled off its highest close in more than two months, finishing just shy of the 4,000 mark as computer chip powerhouse Intel Corp. jumped 10-7/16 to 136-1/2. 

 "I think the market is expecting the Fed to do nothing this time around," said Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management in Garden City, N.Y. 

 "The stocks are pretty much trading on their fundamentals and the big rally in techs kind of shows that tech earnings are going to be very strong. We really don't have too much economic data this week to sidetrack us right now," he said. 

 The central bank meets again on June 27-28. Since June 1999, the Fed has raised interest rates six times. 

 The Nasdaq shot up late in the session to end up 129.27 points, or 3.35 percent, at 3,989.83. It was the index's highest close since the composite ended at 4,055.9 on April 11. 

 The index, which was sent into a rout in April on concerns about overly-giddy technology stock prices, was off just 1.95 percent for the year. 

 Rambus Inc., which ran up sharply last week on positive corporate news and an upgrade from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, was the most heavily traded stock on the Nasdaq. The company, which develops technology to speed the performance of memory chips, climbed 7-7/8 to 91-1/4. 

 But much of the heavy lifting came from tech stalwarts like Intel and business software firm Oracle Corp., up 4-1/8 to 86. Networking equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. gained 1-1/8 to 68-15/16. 

 Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average marched up 108.54 points, or 1.04 percent, to 10,557.84 despite a profit warning from component Honeywell International Inc. 

 Honeywell stock dropped 8-5/8 to 39-7/8 after the diversified technology and manufacturing company said it sees second-quarter earnings below expectations on weaker revenues. 

 But Intel and other tech leaders like Hewlett-Packard Co.overpowered Honeywell's decline. H-P, the world's No. 2 computer maker, rose 4 to 117-13/16 after Nortel Networks Corp., the world's No. 2 telecoms equipment supplier, said it will join H-P in developing high-speed mobile Internet devices and services. The American Depositary Receipts of Nortel Networks, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, gained 1-3/8 to 68-15/16. 

 Gains in financial shares also buoyed the blue-chip Dow as the sector licked its wounds from last week's beating on interest-rate jitters and an earnings warning by southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp. The shares of Wachovia advanced 1-1/16 to 57-1/2. 

 "What you are seeing is the likelihood that interest rates will not go higher next week, making it easier to give these big-cap growth stocks high valuations," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc. "But you have to be aware that this rally will not broaden out." 

 Investors are awaiting a key meeting of oil-producing nations on Wednesday. 

 Ahead of that, traders will be tuned in for data on U.S. international trade on Tuesday. U.S. economists in a Reuters survey predicted that the trade gap narrowed slightly to a $29.29 billion deficit for April from a record $30.18 billion in March. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was off 8/32, or 1/4 of a full point, or $2.50 on each $1,000 of face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.90 percent from Friday's close of 5.88 percent. 

 The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 5/32, pushing its yield up to 6.00 percent from 5.98 percent at Friday's close. 

 Pushing to a 10-day high against the dollar, the yen rallied about half a percent against the greenback and more than a full percent against the euro. This allowed the dollar to gain more than three-quarters of a percent against the euro. 

 The euro settled at 95.65 cents, down from 96.46 cents late Friday. The dollar slid to 105.93 yen from 106.37 yen. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July crude oil slipped 64 cents to settle at $31.69 a barrel, after touching an intraday high of $32.15 a barrel. 

 Recent comments by Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries members have sparked speculation that the oil cartel will decide, during the OPEC meeting in Vienna this week, to increase supply by up to 1.0 million barrels per day at the start of the third quarter. A boost in supply, which would help put a cap on oil prices, could hurt oil shares, analysts said. 

 Overseas, London's blue-chip FTSE 100 index reversed Friday's 35-point gain to close down 35.8 points, or 0.55 percent, at 6,490.2. In Tokyo, The Nikkei index of 225 leading shares rose 273.04 points, or 1.67 percent, to end at 16,591.35.

 Wachovia delays bond, Fitch cites market factors.

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp. , the Southeast regional bank whose shares tumbled 19 percent on Thursday after it issued a profit warning, said on Friday it was postponing a $500 million global bond sale. 

 "The markets right now are in a little bit of turmoil," said Don Truslow, Wachovia's treasurer and controller. "From a timing standpoint, it probably makes sense to let things settle down a bit." 

 The postponement came a day after Winston Salem, N.C.-based Wachovia, blaming higher interest rates, said second-quarter and full-year profits would fall short of the $1.34 and $5.46 per share, respectively, forecast by analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Several investment houses on Friday cut their earnings estimates for Wachovia, and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter & Co. cut its rating on Wachovia shares to "neutral" from "outperform." 

 Wachovia, which has $69 billion in assets, this week had been expected to sell five-year notes yielding 115 to 120 basis points (1.15 to 1.20 percentage points) more than comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries. 

 On Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its outlook for Wachovia's senior debt, which it rates AA-minus, to "negative" from "stable." Moody's Investors Service on Thursday maintained its "negative" outlook for Wachovia's senior debt, which it rates Aa3. The ratings are the agencies' fourth highest. 

 Ian Jaffe, an analyst for New York-based rating agency Fitch, said the bond sale postponement reflects market reaction to Wachovia's profit warning rather than fundamental problems with the company. Fitch rates Wachovia's senior debt AA, roughly one notch higher than Moody's and S&P. 

 "Wachovia continues to be among the most conservative underwriters of corporate credit," he said. "It has been recognized that Wachovia has been running with a modestly more aggressive posture toward financial management during the last few years, similar to trends throughout the industry, but it is quick to recognize problems and take necessary action." 

 Wachovia said rising interest rates have slowed growth in its capital markets, mortgage and investment businesses and have cut lending margins. The company said it plans to take a $200 million second-quarter charge to increase its allowance for loan losses and coverage of non-performing assets. 

 Truslow said Wachovia is "still interested in pursuing a (bond) sale, and we'll have to watch market conditions. The market is still digesting the press release we issued yesterday." 

 The postponement of the bond sale, which Wachovia and Merrill Lynch & Co. were arranging, was the third postponement in the U.S. corporate bond market in eight days and the 14th since late February. 

 It came even though the market has seen a surge in bond issuance and investor demand, on optimism that the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates much more. The market has absorbed more than $34 billion of new bonds so far this month, more than half of which came from bank and finance entities. 

 Wachovia shares were down 2-1/16 at 55 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares fell 13-1/8 on Thursday.

 NEW YORK, June 19 (Reuters) - Stocks romped ahead on Monday, fuelled by hopes the Federal Reserve will hold its fire next week, which would brighten the outlook for interest-rate sensitive companies like big banks and highly-valued technology firms. 

 The technology-stacked Nasdaq composite index pulled off its highest close in more than two months, finishing just shy of the 4,000 mark as computer chip powerhouse Intel Corp jumped 10-7/16 to 136-1/2.

 The Nasdaq shot up late in the session to end up 129.29 points, or 3.35 percent, at 3,989.85. It was the index's highest close since the composite ended at 4,055.9 on April 11. 

 The index, which was sent into a rout in April on concerns about overly-giddy technology stock prices, was off just 1.96 percent for the year. 

 Rambus Inc. , which ran up sharply last week on positive corporate news and an upgrade from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, was the most heavily traded stock on the Nasdaq. The company, which develops technology to speed the performance of memory chips, climbed 7-7/8 to 91-1/4. 

 But much of the heavy lifting came from tech stalwarts like Intel and business software firm Oracle Corp. , up 4-1/8 to 86. Networking equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. , gained 1-2/16 at 68-15/16. 

 Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average marched up 108.54 points, or 1.04 percent, to 10,557.84 despite a profit warning from component Honeywell International Inc. .

 Gains in financial shares also buoyed the blue-chip Dow as the sector licked its wounds from last week's beating on interest-rate jitters and an earnings warning by southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp. . 

 J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. was up 2-10/16 at 120-9/16. And American Express Co. rose 2 to 53-1/2. Wachovia, not a Dow component, was up 1-1/16 at 57-1/2. 

 Broader measures of the market advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 21.54 points, or 1.47 percent, to 1,486.00. The Wilshire 5000 index , a gauge of nearly the entire stock market, was up 222.18 points, or 1.63 percent, at 13,856.79. 

 "What you are seeing is the likelihood that interest rates will not go higher next week, making it easier to give these big cap growth stocks high valuations," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc. "But you have to be aware that this rally will not broaden out." 

 Investors are awaiting a key meeting of oil-producing nations on Wednesday. 

 Recent comments by Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries members have sparked speculation that the oil cartel will increase supply by up to one million barrels per day at the start of the third quarter. A boost in supply, which would help put a cap on oil prices, could hurt oil shares, analysts said. 

 Ahead of that, traders will be tuned in for data on U.S. international trade on Tuesday. U.S. economists in a Reuters survey predicted that the trade gap narrowed slightly to a $29.29 billion deficit for April from $30.18 billion in March. 

 If the decline in the trade gap pans out, it could be another sign that consumer demand is starting to let up. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was off 3/32 with the yield rising to 5.89 percent from Friday's close of 5.88 percent. 

 A spate of merger news kept shares in certain sectors active. Canadian liquor and entertainment giant Seagram rose 1-10/16 to 63-1/16 after France's Vivendi looked poised to secure a $33 billion tie-up with announcements for Tuesday morning. 

 Drug companies climbed with the American Stock Exchange's pharmaceutical index up 1.02 percent to its highest close since mid April 1999. Among the Dow's drug components, Merck & Co. Inc. was up 1-1/16 to 72-1/16 and Johnson & Johnson gained 10/16 to 90-3/16.

 N.Y. Stocks Rally Intraday; Chips Roar; DJIA Up 1%

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- An upbeat outlook for chip maker Intel helped push that stock sharply higher in the session, leading the broader technology sector higher, and allowing market averages to score impressive gains Monday. 

 Shares of the chip-making giant climbed 10 7/16 to 136 1/2 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, after Lehman Brothers semiconductor analyst, Dan Niles, set a sharply higher price target for the stock. 

 Meanwhile, rival Advanced Micro Devices climbed 8 13/16 to 91 13/16, after the chip maker unveiled a new line of low-end microprocessors that compete with Intel's Celeron product line. 

 Asyst Technologies, which had fallen sharply on Friday, down 21%, on worries the Fremont, Calif., chip-equipment maker's relationship with Applied Materials, an important customer, had deteriorated, snapped back Monday, gaining 7 7/16 to 35 7/16 on Nasdaq, after the company refuted the speculation, and Lehman Brothers called the stock at current prices a superb buy. 

 The sharp gains, coupled with a recovery in financial stocks, which had weakened Friday on some earnings worries, allowed market averages to snap back crisply from ragged performances last week, when earnings woes hit home. 

 In fact, more earnings worries cropped up Monday, as Honeywell, responding to intraday market speculation, confirmed that it won't meet earnings forecasts. The disappointment drove shares down 8 7/16 to close at 40 1/16, reeling to a 52-week low. 

 "This is what investors have been struggling with," Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman Sachs, said Monday. "But we believe this period is transitory." 

 It is true, she said, the economy is growing more slowly, but, she would argue, sustainably. "When investors think about this, our conclusion is there will be a comfort level reached," Cohen added. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 108.54, or 1.04%, higher to close at 10557.84. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10557.84, up 108.54. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,503 issues advancing, 1,362 declining and 520 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 916,126,470 shares, compared with 1,207,765,580 Friday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 654.35, up 4.67. The average price per share rose 29 cents. 

 Stocks of other manufacturers also lost ground in the session, with Tyco International off 1 1/8 to 46 7/16, Deere down 1 3/16 to 40 3/16, and Pentair falling 1 3/8 to 35 5/16. The weakness, a symptom of Honeywell's warning, hit the broader cyclical category, a sector considered exposed to any slowdown in economic expansion. 

 Heavy industries, such as United Technologies, which lost 1 1/2 to 57 3/8, and basic materials, such as International Paper, which fell 1 to 32, and sank to a 52-week low intraday, as well as Alcoa, which lost 1 to 30 1/16, also declined Monday. 

 Oil stocks, which resisted any declines last week, succumbed amid some worries about a move by OPEC, which meets later this week, to opt for increased production in the face of rising prices for crude oil products. Shares of Chevron fell 1 3/8 to 91 3/8, while Texaco lost 1 9/16 to 56 1/4, and Exxon Mobil eased 5/16 to 84 1/16. 

 But banking and financial issues, which logged big declines last week amid worries about earnings shortfalls, snapped back handily. Shares of First Union, which slid to a 52-week low Friday, gained 2 3/16 to 29 1/2. Wells Fargo gained 1 13/16 to 40 1/8. Suntrust Banks, after trading near a 52-week low last week, moved up 1 1/8 to 50 7/16. Even Wachovia, which sparked some of last week's profit jitters with a warning that upcoming earnings wouldn't live up to forecasts, posted a gain Monday, rising 1 1/16 to 57 1/2. 

 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange/Keefe Bruyette & Woods bank sector index, a measure of the performance of larger banking names, ended the session with a gain of 22.40, up 2.97%, to reach 777.46. 

 That, however, proved chump change, compared with the dramatic gain scored by some technology measures. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index soared 76.5 points, up 6.6%, to close at 1234.8. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index, bolstered by the strength in technology, moved ahead 129.27, up 3.35%, to end at 3989.83. 

 To be sure, some technology stocks posted losses - in cases, even sharp losses - in Monday's trading. 

 S1, an Atlanta application service provider, lost 6 1/16 to 22 on Nasdaq, sliding to a 52-week low, after First Union cut its rating on the stock. 

 Centillium fell 3 31/32 to 50 29/32 on Nasdaq, despite some upbeat comments from Wall Street. Credit Suisse First Boston, which helped bring the Fremont, Calif., maker of digital subscriber line technologies public last month, initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating. The firm said it believed the company could break even by the end of 2001. 

 But more typically, technology issues posted sharp gains in the session, many on upbeat outlooks. Inktomi climbed 21 13/16 to 138 1/4 on Nasdaq, after company officials appeared on Tech Talk, Merrill Lynch's online investment program held each Monday, and said in response to a question that the Foster City, Calif., applications software developer should be able to maintain its recent quarter-over-quarter growth rates. 

 Oracle climbed 4 1/8 to 86 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston said that it anticipated the Redwood Shores, Calif., database software developer, expected to issue its fiscal fourth-quarter profits after the close of trading Tuesday, would beat analysts' published consensus estimates of 25 cents a share. 

 Rambus added 7 7/8 to 91 1/4 on Nasdaq. The Mountain View, Calif., developer of semiconductor technology, extending the gains notched Friday, when the company said it would license memory technology to Japanese chip maker Toshiba. 

 Kana Communications rose 5 7/8 to 53 1/4 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston started coverage of the Palo Alto, Calif., provider of Internet software with a buy rating and a 12-month price target of 70. 

 Sonus Networks climbed 14 to 113 on Nasdaq. J.P. Morgan started coverage of the Westford, Mass., telecommunications software developer. 

 Harcourt General climbed 12 25/32 to 54 13/16. The Chestnut Hill, Mass., educational products maker hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives, including the possible sale of the company. 

 Seagram gained 1 5/8 to 63 1/16. French conglomerate Vivendi has set final financial terms for its $32 billion merger with the Montreal entertainment and spirits concern, according to a report Monday on the Dow Jones Newswires. 

 Eli Lilly gained 1 11/16 to 86 5/8. On Friday, the Indianapolis drug maker is expected to present Phase III data on an osteoporosis treatment, Lehman Brothers said in an upbeat research note. 

 Idec Pharmaceuticals climbed 15 11/16 to 120 1/4 on Nasdaq. Banc of America Securities reiterated its strong buy rating on shares of the San Francisco pharmaceuticals maker, saying that after meeting with company management Friday, the firm had gained increasing confidence that sales of key products will live up to forecast. 

 Maytag gained 2 11/16 to 38 1/4. Despite weakness in the broader category of consumer cyclicals, the Newton, Iowa, maker of home appliances rallied amid some expectations, perhaps misguided, that the company may be the subject of a takeover.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Blue-chip stocks fell steeply yesterday after Xerox Corp. issued a profit warning and fears grew about profits in financial services. 

 The Dow plunged 265.52 points, or 2.5 per cent, to close at 10,449.30. It was the Dow's worst performance since a stunning 617-point drop on April 14. 

 Yesterday's decline left the Dow with a loss of 164.76 points for the week. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.21 billion shares, well ahead of 988.75 million traaded on Thursday. 

 Broader stock indicators held up much better than the blue-chip Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell only 14.14 points to close at 1,464.46, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 14.82 to 3,860.56. 

 A recent research note from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston has raised the possibility that many other banks will follow those that have issued profit warnings this week. Mellon fell $3.06 (U.S.) to $33.94 and the Bank of America dropped $5.56 to $46.50. 

 "There's not a great fundamental reason for the whole sector to be down so much," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. 

 "But it's a momentum-driven sector, and some people obviously feel that profits are going to come under pressure." 

 An additional sign that profits are being threatened came from Xerox, which fell $5.06 to $20.25 after the office-machine maker said its second-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street analysts' estimates. 

 Technology stocks showed some scattered strength, however. Qualcomm Inc. was up $4.31 to $65.75 after racking up two days of steep losses.

 Xerox Stock Hammered Again After  Profit Warning  Securities: Shares dive nearly 19% on news that quarterly earnings won't hit forecasts. Changes in sales force, Mexico problems cited.

 STAMFORD, Conn. -- Xerox Corp., the photocopier giant that ousted its CEO last month after a bungled reorganization, Friday warned that its second-quarter earnings would fall short of forecasts, amid fresh problems in Mexico and stubborn kinks in its sales-force realignment. 

 Shares of the Stamford, Conn.-based company tumbled almost 19% as Wall Street analysts said they were concerned by the latest round of problems at Xerox. It is struggling to transform itself from a company that makes free-standing copiers into one that sells digital printers connected to computer networks. 

 "It's definitely disturbing that the company has not been able to forecast the extent of the problem, and also to let us know rightfully when the problem is going to come to an end," said James Corridore, an analyst at Standard & Poor's Equity Group, after a conference call in which top managers tried to strike a contrite yet cautiously optimistic tone. 

 "This is going to be the third time in the last four quarters where earnings have disappointed, starting in the third quarter of 1999," Corridore said. 

 Xerox said its second-quarter earnings, before special charges, probably would be in line with the first quarter's 30 cents a share. Wall Street analysts on average had expected 42 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 After the warning, Xerox shares fell 18.5% on the New York Stock Exchange, closing off $4.69 at $20.63, barely off the year low of 20. Volume reached 17.5 million shares, compared with a daily average of 2.4 million. 

 Xerox, whose shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value in the last year, has been plagued by strategic missteps and stepped-up competition in recent months. 

 The company has struggled to reorganize its sales force along industry lines, rather than geographic boundaries, to compete more aggressively in the merging markets for digital copiers and printers. Xerox is trying to shift more of its revenue into high-growth Internet-related areas. 

 Friday, Xerox said the expected earnings shortfall partly reflected slower sales of high-end printer products and significant unexpected provisions in its $400-million-a-year business in Mexico. 

 It said customer relationships had been disrupted by its sales force realignment, hurting sales of its most profitable products. 

 The company did not elaborate on the problem in Mexico, other than to say it is related to customer receivables and could shave 5 or 6 cents off second-quarter per-share earnings. The Mexican woes are "isolated" and are not expected to affect other regions, Chief Financial Officer Barry Romeril said. He declined to say more until the company completes its review of the situation. 

 The warning came weeks after Xerox President and Chief Executive Rick Thoman resigned under pressure May 11 as his efforts to revive the company met with repeated profit disappointments, 

 Xerox did not time its earnings warning to coincide with last month's management change because it did not realize the full extent of the problems at the time, and because it was unaware of the Mexican situation then, a company spokeswoman said. 

 Despite the repeated setbacks, some analysts think Xerox's reorganization strategy is still sound but the execution needs to be sharper as competition intensifies. 

 "My sense is, net-net, there is a real franchise value here that is not being appreciated at current levels, but this is probably going to take longer to work through the short-term issues," said Gibboney Huske, an analyst at CS First Boston, who kept her "buy" rating on the stock. 

 But Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating of Xerox to "outperform" from "buy." 

 "There were high hopes that the second half [of 2000] was going to be the time where it would help turn things around, and those hopes have now been dashed," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, a Salomon analyst, said. 

 "The interesting thing is that there's actually a lot that's going on here that's right, and that's what's so frustrating about the situation," Rosenzweig said. 

 "Color was doing well," he said. "Sales force turnover is down; prices weren't getting any worse. 

 "It's largely a margin issue, because the high end [of the product line] is getting killed, which is where you have a lot of margin. The revenue growth itself is going to be fairly on track with what we were looking for." 

 Xerox Chairman and Chief Executive Paul Allaire conceded that most of Xerox's problems are of its own making. "It's now up to us," he said. "It's all in the execution, and that must and will improve. 

 "We're clearly disappointed about our news for the second quarter. You have our commitment and our determination to fix these issues, and we believe they are within our power to fix." 

 Allaire, who took over as chief executive when Thoman was ousted after a rocky 13-month reign, said he was confident of an improvement later this year, with a further uptick in 2001. 

 Xerox will not cut its dividend, Allaire said. The company is to pay a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 2.

 Dow, Nasdaq Edge Up Amid Uncertainty

 NEW YORK, June 15 -- Major stock indexes ended higher today after being pulled in different directions. Investors had to balance favorable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82; the Nasdaq composite index rose 48.33, to 3845.74; and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.06, to 1478.60. 

 Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications-equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion. 

 Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising 3-1/16, to 59-11/16. Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining 3, to 117, after the company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in Japan. 

 Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep dropoff in wireless-equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell 9-1/16, to 61-7/16. Chase H&Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for Qualcomm for the fourth quarter and next year. Bear, Stearns & Co. had cut its outlook for the company a day earlier. 

 Financial-sector stocks took a hit after Wachovia Corp., a respected banking company based in North Carolina, warned investors that its earnings would be hurt by rising interest rates. Wachovia shares tumbled 13 1/8, to 57-1/16. 

 "This is a bank that people have a lot of respect for, and that's got the banking stocks down on the day," said Charles White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates, a New York-based money-management firm. 

 But outside of the specific factors driving tech stocks higher and financial shares lower, White said the rest of the market was struggling in the wake of mixed data on the economy. 

 "It's still a market looking for a sense of direction," White said. "My sense is that it's going to take more convincing news on the economy before we can see any kind of volume in the market. With earnings pre-announcement season here, there's even more uncertainty ladled on top of it." 

 Stocks had waffled earlier in the session as traders digested data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial production. 

 The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May, but operating capacity was unchanged. 

 Separately, the Labor Department said 296,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a decline of 16,000. Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a tight labor market. 

 Coca-Cola gained 3-1/16, to 56-1/16, after the company said it reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit from current and former employees. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney upgraded its shares because efforts to localize the soft-drink giant's business are beginning to pay off.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, a bruising sell-off in bank stocks puts blue chips on a downward spiral. The Dow industrials take a triple-digit tumble, while chip stocks push the Nasdaq ahead. 

 Another troubling admission from Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) , its third profit warning in the past year, and investors bail out again. 

 Higher mortgage rates hammer away at the housing market. New home building slows to its weakest pace in a year. 

 Plus, from the second-best IPO in history to a dot.com disappointment for investors, can theglobe.com regain its popularity on Wall Street? We`ll have "The Bottom Line." 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, everyone. Stuart is off tonight. 

 The blue chip sell-off began with the opening bell and only intensified as the day wore on. The Dow ended the week with a triple- digit plunge, its worst point drop in two months. 

 Profit worries gripped the market, and once again it was bank stocks that dragged investors down. 

 Greg Clarkin reports from the New York Stock Exchange. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): There was no escaping the heat for NYSE traders today. Outside temperature soared. Inside stocks sold off at a rapid clip. Investors bailed out of the blue chips, especially the financials. 

 The Dow plunged down 265 points, or 2 1/2 percent, down 1 1/2 percent on the week. 

 Today`s banking bombshell came courtesy of Union Bank of California. It warned of lower profits just a day after Wachovia (URL: http://www.wachovia.com/) did, and that sent investors fleeing the sector. 

 MICHAEL YELLEN, AIM MANAGEMENT: All the signs pointing to a slow-down in economic growth are there. And so I think people are feeling much more comfortable what the Fed does not have to continue hiking rates, which has -- which has been great for stocks. 

 So the key concern shifts to what is this meaning for corporate profit growth. 

 CLARKIN: Investors aren`t sticking around to find out when it comes to bank stocks. The group was battered for a second-straight day as Wall Street grows increasingly concerned with the earnings outlook. 

 KATY ROSSOW, CHASE SECURITIES: It`s been coming for some time. I think you could also blame a very, you know, strong, a booming economy for eight years that has led banks to become a little bit more loose with their lending and a little bit -- having a little bit harder time anticipating trouble when it starts to grow. 

 Bank of America (URL: http://www.bankamerica.com/) , Chase Manhattan (URL: http://www.chase.com/) , and the Dow`s three financial stocks -- J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) , American Express (URL: http://www.americanexpress.com/) and Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) -- were all bloodied. Wells Fargo (URL: http://www.wellsfargo.com/) , Mellon One (URL: http://www.mellon.com/) , Bank One (URL: http://www.bankone.com/) also slid. UnionBanCal (URL: http://www.uboc.com/) was crushed on its warning, and State Street lost ground as well. 

 But there were bright spots. Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/) rocketed almost 50 percent on the day after doing a licensing deal with Toshiba, Rambus by far the biggest winner of the big-name tech stocks, helping the Nasdaq to post a modest 14-point gain. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: And while bank stocks and their earnings are receiving the attention now, some market watchers are growing increasingly concerned with what`s in store for technology companies, with some predicting a cooling economy may cool those corporate profits a little more than expected -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg, thanks. We`ll be checking back in with you later in the show. 

 Today`s most active stock on the big board: Xerox. Shares plunged after the company dropped another bombshell on investors, warning that quarterly earnings will fall well below what Wall Street expected. 

 Xerox dropped more than 4 3/4, or 19 percent, nearing a 52-week low. 

 Steve Young has the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Xerox didn`t just "Xerox" its last two profit warnings. It found some new things to worry about in its third red flag in the past 12 months. Second- quarter earnings will be about 30 cents a share, nearly 30 percent less than Wall Street expected. Investors bailed out, shrinking the price of the long-suffering stock another 20 percent: $29 billion in market cap has been lost since last May. 

 Analysts say a bungled reorganization of the Xerox sales force is the main problem. 

 JACK KELLY, GOLDMAN SACHS: They cut back too far, didn`t provide proper service. So as far as the customer was concerned, they maybe had a new salesperson and the back office person who dealt with them was also changed. And so their touch with the customer was really lost. 

 YOUNG: The product mix is another issue. Xerox sells too many inexpensive ink-jet printers with near-zero profit margins and not enough of big publishing systems, a market in which HP and Canon are king. They cost several hundred thousand dollars and earn profit margins as high as 40 percent. 

 Analysts say most of the stumbles came during the 13-month reign of CEO Rick Thoman, who was fired last month. But they note the new CEO, Paul Allaire, was the former CEO before Thoman and was still chairman during Thoman`s regime. 

 GEOFF HANSEN, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: We`re not fundamentally disagreeing with the strategies that they`re trying to emplace(ph). The execution of the change has been real poor for the past 18 months to two years. 

 YOUNG: Some of the earnings shortfall is because of customer receivable problems in Mexico. Some analysts say the company`s vague explanations could point to legal questions. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: Analysts say the company was so murky about what was going on in Mexico they don`t rule out anything, including criminal fraud -- Willow. 

 BAY: Steve, criminal fraud meaning that they perhaps committed a crime or were victims of it? 

 YOUNG: Very unclear. The company just says, Willow, that they`ve begun an investigation. We tried reaching Mexican authorities and weren`t able to find out if they`ve started any investigation of their own. 

 BAY: OK, Steve, thank you. 

 This week`s preannouncements have put investors on edge ahead of the release of second-quarter profit reports. Next week, some of the big names expected to roll out their results: tech heavyweights Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) and Micron Technology (URL: http://www.micron.com/) . In the financial arena, look for the latest profit results from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (URL: http://www.msdw.com/) and Goldman Sachs (URL: http://www.gs.com/) . And on the retail front, from Gucci (URL: http://www.gucci.com/) . 

 The profit concerns that dragged the Dow lower today were not enough to keep the Nasdaq underwater. The tech index managed to buck the downward trend, finishing the day up 14 points. For the week, it was down 14 points. 

 Since its low on May 23rd, the Nasdaq has managed a strong comeback, and by  some measures broken out of a bear market. 

 Since hitting a low of 3,164 in late May, the Nasdaq has jumped 22 percent. Some investors say a bear ends with a 20 percent rise from its low. Other analysts would prefer to see more. 

 Joining us now, Brian Finnerty, head of Nasdaq stock trading at C.E. Unterberg, Towbin. 

 Brian, welcome. 

 BRIAN FINNERTY, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: Hi willow. 

 BAY: So, OK, up 22 percent from its lows, but still down more than 20 percent from its highs. Is this a bear market? 

 FINNERTY: No, no, I don`t think it`s a bear market by any stretch, particularly in the Nasdaq, which is so tech-heavy. And I think the reasons for that are those strong earnings are going to be out soon. You mentioned a couple coming next week, but then don`t forget June 30th ends the second quarter. And we`re going to see some big, big earnings growth coming particularly out of the tech sector: semiconductors and fiber-optics in particular. 

 BAY: Now, interesting that you`re so positive, because some analysts are worried about the effects of a cooling economy on techs. But you don`t think we`re going to see that? 

 FINNERTY: Well, Willow, I think what we`re seeing right now is a situation where the Fed has been hiking rates up. Now, they`ve been doing it six times over the last year. Now, we`re seeing some real warning signs in the economy. 

 We saw slowing numbers all the month of June: the employment figures early in the month, the Producer Price Index last week, the Consumer Price Index this week, housing starts today. It`s all pointing toward sort of a soft landing in the economy, which is really what the Fed wanted. And it shows that they`ve done their job right now. 

 So I think the market thinks we`re at the end of those rate hikes and that we`re probably OK here, and that`s why I think we`re going to trade higher. 

 BAY: Probably OK, going to trade higher. Safe to say that we`ve hit -- that we`ve seen the worst? 

 FINNERTY: Safe to say that we have seen the worst in the Nasdaq marketplace for quite a while now, I think, Willow, because again strong earnings, rates not going any higher. And you know, the problem with the financial industry right now and some of the banks, that`s showing more softness in the economy. That`s probably -- that bodes well for the meeting June 27th and 28th of the Fed governor, where they`re going to make their decision. And I think they`re probably going to decide to stand pat right now. 

 BAY: Let`s go through a couple names. Still like Compaq Computer (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) ? 

 FINNERTY: Yes, we like Compaq Computer very much. Compaq`s finally starting to 

 (UNINTELLIGIBLE). It`s been sleepy. 

 BAY: Exactly. You`ve been liking Compaq for a while, and... 

 FINNERTY: We`re waking up. 

 BAY: OK. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- we`ll see. 

 What about Rambus, up 47 percent today after it expanded the Toshiba deal? Is that a sign of more to come for Rambus? 

 FINNERTY: Big move today. A sign of good things for the semiconductor industry as a whole. 

 BAY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) what you said... 

 FINNERTY: Yes. That`s where big, big growth is. 

 BAY: Other names you like? 

 FINNERTY: In the semiconductors, we like PMC-Sierra (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com/) very much. That`s going to be a big quarter coming up for PMCS. And (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 Those guys sell the chips to the fiber-optics makers and the handset wireless guys. Big, big demand there, Willow. So, that`s why we like those stocks very much. 

 BAY: Brian, we`ll leave it at that. Always good to have you with us. 

 FINNERTY: Thanks a lot, Willow. 

 BAY: Up next on MONEYLINE, the latest on America Online`s (URL: http://www.aol.com/) plan to include  the competition. The company promises instant messages for all. 

 The government gives the go-ahead to a wedding of "Baby Bells," but it comes with strings attached. 

 And is there any relief in sight for prices at the pump? We`ll ask Pulitzer Prize-winning author Daniel Yergin: all that and more when MONEYLINE returns. 

 Stay with us. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: America Online is floating a plan to open up one of its most popular features to competitors, its Instant Massaging system. The move comes just days after Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission both asked AOL for more information about instant massaging, and AOL`s almost total control of it as they review its proposed  merger with Time Warner, the parent of this network. 

 Bruce Francis has more the plan and the reaction from competitors. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): America Online is trying to make Avner Ronen and his Odigo instant message software just go away. Ronen an wants to link Odigo to AOL`s wildly popular Instant Massager software, used by 91 million people, most of them not even paying members of AOL. Messaging is free to anyone who has Internet access. 

 But AOL keeps blocking Odigo`s users, calling Ronen and others like him hackers who are illegally breaking into AOL`s computers. 

 But a new proposal from AOL to open up its system one day doesn`t impress Ronen. 

 AVNER RONEN, CO-FOUNDER, ODIGO: Nothing has changed. It remains the same amid the stalemate to fight AOL to provide access to our users. In its 19-page technical document, AOL has outlined how it proposes to allow various instant messaging systems to communicate with one another. 

 FRANCIS: AOL, which is merging with Time Warner, the parent of CNN, declined to comment, but said in a Web posting, "We think that this submission represents a significant first step toward developing the kind of full interoperability that we would all like to see." 

 Especially some 40 competitors who`ve complained to the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission that AOL is blocking messages from other services unfairly. Those agencies are currently reviewing the merger of AOL and Time Warner (URL: http://www.timewarner.com/) . Financial analysts say that AOL has an eye toward Washington with this move. 

 PAUL NOGLOWS, CHASE H&Q: Is it calculated? Yes. It`s calculated to a degree. But I do think at the end of the day, AOL does understand that Instant Messaging will have to be opened. 

 FRANCIS: Experts say AOL has to do something, but the current proposal isn`t enough. 

 ESTHER DYSON, ADVENTURE HOLDINGS: Does AOL want to be seen as exclusionary. Do they want to be seen as cutting other people off? I think here they`re trying to say, no, we want to be open, but they`re not actually committing to do anything yet or are they giving a timeline. It can`t happen fast enough for competitors like Odigo. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: The move comes as AOL prepares for a big week. On Monday, the European Commission is expected to either clear the AOL- Time Warner merger  or vote for an in-depth investigation. Also, AOL will officially unveil AOL TV, a competitor to Microsoft`s (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) Web TV. 

 BAY: AOL managing to dominate the headlines with all this news going on. Competitors said they wanted Instant Messaging to be more like e- mail. Will this proposal move instant messaging in that direction? 

 FRANCIS: It could have the effect. If the competitors say, look, they`re aren`t enough details in there right now. AOL, on the other hand, says, well, if we put the details out, all the spammers and the people who are trying to spread viruses around will have a road map about how to infect the whole world. So both sides are still very much at odds with each other about this issue. This is not an end solution. 

 BAY: Bruce Francis, thank you. 

 FRANCIS: Checking how AOL fared on Wall Street today: Its stock gained a quarter to nearly 54 3/4, but it is still down 43 percent from its 52-week high. 

 Checking tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers," Adobe fell 4 1/2, after warning it will not hit its $100 million revenue target for its new publishing software. Covad Communications (URL: http://www.covad.com/) plunged more than 6 3/4, or 27 percent. Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) downgraded the telecom company on worries its acquisition of Blue Star Communications will hurt its bottom line. 

 Regulatory approval tonight for two baby bells to form the nation`s largest telephone company. Late today, Bell Atlantic (URL: http://www.bellatlantic.com/)  and GTE (URL: http://www.gte.com/) won conditional FCC approval to merge in a deal worth $65 billion. The new company, Verizon, will operate in more than 30 states and serve more than 25 million wireless customers. But the much- anticipated approval comes with strings attached. GTE`s Internet assets must be spun off, which is set to happen as early as next week, and the new company must open up some local markets, which means it may compete with other bells. 

 In trading today, Bell Atlantic fell 1 1/2 and GTE fell 2 1/2. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, breaking news tonight on those lost hard drives. We`ll have latest on the discovery at the Los Alamos Laboratory. That`s in our news digest. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Despite today`s Big Board sell-off, several stocks hit 52- week highs, including Eli Lilly (URL: http://www.lilly.com/) , Pfizer (URL: http://www.pfizer.com/) , Power One , St. Jude Medical (URL: http://www.sjm.com/) and Warner-Lambert (URL: http://www.warner- lambert.com/) . 

 And this, just in time for Father`s Day, word that new dads spend a lot less time around the house once the new baby is born. Economists at the University of Washington found that men work far longer hours after the birth of their first child. But an even bigger surprise came when factoring in the gender of that child. 

 When it`s a boy, new fathers work an additional 122 hours per year. That adds up to more than three additional weeks at the office. If it`s a girl, men spend only an additional 56 hours at work. Well, one bit of good news in all this for the whole family: Fathers find their  earnings go up nearly 5 percent an hour, after becoming a dad. 

 For more news outside the world of business, we turn to Joie Chen at CNN center -- Joie. 

 JOIE CHEN, CNNfn ANCHOR: Willow, thanks. 

 We have late developments this hour on the security scandal at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory. The Energy Department says those two computer hard drives loaded with classified information and missing for weeks now have been found inside the lab. One source tells CNN that the drives were discovered behind a copying machine in the high security area where they were originally stored. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who came under fire this week in Washington for his handling of the disappearance, says he will continue to investigate the matter aggressively. 

 Also today, federal scientists say this past spring was the nation`s hottest yet. And so far this year, temperatures across the nation have surpassed all previous records. Forecasters believe there is no relief this summer for areas already facing drought. 

 And there`s concern at the White House about skyrocketing gas prices in the Chicago area. President Clinton pointed to a refinery shutdown and rising seasonal demand as two of the culprits responsible for the rise. But the president said the government was on the lookout for any signs of price gouging. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So we`ve got the Federal Trade Commission looking into that, and we`ve also had the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency looking into it. I`m very worried about it, but I`m hoping that we can break the logjam on it soon. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 CHEN: And in presidential politics, two polls today show Governor George W. Bush in the lead. A CNN survey found 49 percent of voters backing Bush, 45 percent supporting Vice President Gore. And a "Los Angeles Time" survey gives Bush an even bigger lead over the vice president, a full 10 points in that survey. 

 Those are tonight`s top stories. We`ll have more on the "THE WORLD TODAY" coming up at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 out on the West Coast. 

 Now back to you, Willow. BAY: Thanks, Joie. 

 In tonight`s "Tech Watch," Congress approves a measure which could revolutionize e-commerce. The Senate today passed legislation giving a person`s signature sent over the Internet the same legal weight as its pen-and-paper equivalent. The House cleared that bill earlier this week and President Clinton is strongly supporting it. The legislation would open the way for major financial agreements, including home mortgages and car purchases, to be sealed in cyberspace. 

 Coming up next, where will financier Martin Frankel finally land in jail: in Germany, or one back here in the U.S.? The extradition fight, when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking some of the stocks that hit 52-week lows today: Covads Communications, First Union (URL: http://www.firstunion.com/) , Loral Space & Communications (URL: http://www.loral.com/) , NBC Internet, and Revlon (URL: http://www.revlon.com/) . 

 An apparent bid to dodge extradition today by disgraced financier Martin Frankel, with a confession in a German court. The former money manager admitted that he failed to pay taxes on millions worth of diamonds, which he smuggled into Europe while on the run. U.S. authorities are trying to extradite Frankel, who faces fraud charges in this country for allegedly bilking clients out of more than $200 million. But Frankel is fighting extradition, saying the U.S. prison system is inhumane. 

 A German judge is expected to sentence the financier next week, after a formal plea is entered. He could get up to 10 years in prison. But prosecutors say that even if he`s convicted in Germany, Frankel might not be able to avoid trial in the United States, where he could face an even longer jail term. 

 Coming up in our next half hour, a special report on the return of big-time boxing to Los Angeles for the first time in a quarter century. But will the sweet science thrive in the City of Angels? And full coverage of the down day on Wall Street. We`ll check out what rocked the Dow and drove investors to worry over future profits and rising rates. Plus, as oil prices head sky high, we check whether to expect any relief coming down the pipeline. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues. Here again, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines, Xerox dumps another dose of bad news on Wall Street, prompting investors to vote with their feet again. 

 And the government reports a big drop in the pace of home building. Is it enough to make the Fed rest easy? 

 Plus, from red hot to not, "The Bottom Line" at theglobe.com. First more on our top story: an end-of-the-week bail-out. Investors rush out of blue chips on more concerns about corporate profits. The Dow industrials post their worst loss in two months on weakness in financial stocks like J.P. Morgan and American Express. By the close, it had lost 265 points, to close at 10,449. For the week, the Dow is off 164 points. 

 Despite the weakness, tech stocks managed to hold their own on the Nasdaq. The composite index gained 14 points on the day, but fell 14 points for the week. 

 Some of the biggest tech winners, Rambus. It soared 26. Immunex  (URL: http://www.immunex.com/) and Biogen (URL: http://www.biogen.com/) also higher today. And Veritas Software (URL: http://www.veritas.com/) gained 5 1/4. 

 A big loser on the Big Board, Xerox, down more than 4 3/4, after it issued its third profit warning in the past year. 

 Other losers: American Express down 4, Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) lost 3, and Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) International off more than 2 1/2. 

 Behind today`s stock market action, not just a profit warning from Xerox, but also a shuffle among the S&P 500 index. Standard & Poor`s is reweighting components of the index this evening. 

 And, as Allan Chernoff reports, institutional investors were busy trying to get ahead of the curve today. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The S&P shuffle hit the market right at the open and accelerated through the day, institutional investors anticipating that Standard & Poor`s would be rebalancing weightings of the S&P 500 components. And some big traders had figured out that the rebalancing would call for more stock to be sold than bought. 

 PETER BOCKVAT, MILLER TABAK: What adds to the balance are a lot of traders that try to anticipate what the index managers have to do to try to get a step ahead and buy before they buy or sell before they sell. 

 CHERNOFF: Index fund managers at firms like Vanguard try to replicate the S&P 500, so they must adjust their portfolios. S&P gives some an edge, issuing alerts on what stocks will be affected. These funds manage $300 billion, so they drive up stocks whose weightings are increased and depress stocks whose weightings are decreased. 

 DAVID BLITZER, STANDARD & POOR`S: You tend to be fairly -- to be watched very carefully. By our estimate, for stock in the index, 5 to 8 percent of the total shares outstanding are held by index funds. So that`s a reasonably large block. And even though that`s not going to change  a lot, it will change a little bit. And it will very easily tip the balance from buying pressure to selling pressure. 

 CHERNOFF: Savvy traders were selling these stocks, knowing their weight would be reduced in the S&P 500. General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) , Philip Morris (URL: http://www.philipmorris.com/) , J.P. Morgan, SBC Communications (URL: http://www.sbc.com/) and IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , all Dow components, contributing to the 265-point plunge. 

 But market breadth was only slightly to the down side. Many stocks ended in the plus column, thanks to index reshuffling. There were big buys in Cisco Systems (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) , Schlumberger (URL: http://www.slb.com/) , Eli Lilly, EMC (URL: http://www.emc.com/) Corporation and Applied Materials (URL: http://www.appliedmaterials.com/) . 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: Of course, today was also a trip-witching Friday, with index options, futures and options on individual stocks expiring. That usually gets more attention than rebalancing, but rebalancing often has a greater impact on the stock market, which certainly was the case today --Willow. 

 BAY: So, Allan, how often does the S&P rebalance like this? 

 CHERNOFF: They do it once a quarter, and it`s usually on the third Friday of the last month. So people know when this is coming, and they do plan ahead. 

 BAY: Allan Chernoff, thanks. 

 And the S&P 500 index has a few more changes up its sleeve. After the close  of trading today, Novellus Systems (URL: http://www.novellus.com/) Systems replaced Champion International, which is being acquired by International Paper. And Charter One Financial replaced MediaOne (URL: http://www.mediaonegroup.com/) Group on the index. MediaOne is being acquired by AT&T. 

 For a closer look at this week`s action on Wall Street, including the troubling times for financial stocks, we`re now joined by Greg Clarkin, live from the New York Stock Exchange -- Greg. 

 CLARKIN: Hi there, Willow. 

 It was a very tough week for a lot of bank stocks, and particularly the regional bank stocks. And what is happening here is there are a lot of concerns over the effect of higher interest rates on the banks` business. 

 Now regional banks are particularly vulnerable, because they typically lend -- rely more on lending money to make their money, and those rising rates make it more expensive to borrow money to lend. 

 Now also, those rising rates can also make it harder for some consumers to pay back loans, so naturally these banks have to increase their loan-loss reserves. That is something that came out from yesterday`s  press relieve from Bank Wachovia out of North Carolina. 

 Now a lot of analysts are saying that the second half could be particularly touchy for a lot of these regional banks, and that is why there are a lot of fears that these profit figures will be very, very weak in the second half of the year, in quarters three and four, for a lot of the regional banks. But we should point out, though, the big money center banks also have problems of their own with rising rates. Today we saw Deutsche Banc Alex Brown trimming their earnings estimates on Chase Manhattan Bank, saying that management at Chase is signalling that their consumer business, overall consumer business, is very sluggish, and they`re expecting to see weaker growth there. 

 So the bottom line is the rising rates really coming home to roost in the financial sector in a big way -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin, thanks. We`ll have more on the bank sector later in the show. 

 The most interest rate-sensitive sector of the economy continues to cool off. New home construction dropped almost 4 percent last month to its lowest level in a year, as higher mortgage rates continue to dampen demand. 

 From Chicago, Ceci Rodgers has the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CECI RODGERS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The sharp drop in home construction last month was paced by a more than 5 percent drop in starts of single-family homes. And the slowdown appeared likely to continue. Applications for building permits, an indication of future housing activity, fell to the lowest level in almost two and a half years. 

 HENRY WILLMORE, BARCLAYS CAPITAL: The housing sector is the one sector where I`m pretty convinced there has been a slowdown. Most of it is because of what`s going on with mortgage rates. We had about a 100-basis point increase in mortgage rates since a year ago. 

 RODGERS: The fall-off in construction should be welcome news at the Federal Reserve, now only 12 days away from its next policy meeting. The Fed has raised short-term interest rates six times in the past year in an effort to cool off consumer spending. Economists pointed to sharp drops in both starts and permits for single-family homes, which should result in weaker sales of furniture an appliances in the months ahead. 

 Another report just out, a key measure of consumer sentiment, fell in early June to the lowest level in six months. Wavering confidence and the dropping construction add to the latest evidence of a cooling economy. 

 WAYNE AYERS, FLEET BOSTON: Employment numbers, the purchasing manager`s numbers, the sales of existing and new homes -- all sending the message that the economy is at least in the early stages of a slowdown. And we`re seeing it first in the areas you would expect to see it, again, the interest-sensitive sectors. 

 RODGERS: Whether the slowdown persists is a crucial question. Former Fed Vice Chair Alice Rivlin said it`s too soon to know whether the economy is cooling to a more sustainable pace. (on camera): But the vast majority of economists say the slowdown is real enough to prevent the Fed from raising interest rates a seventh time at its next policy meeting  on June 8th.

 BAY: Today`s economic news encouraged bond traders, who were already betting the Federal Reserve will stand pat at its next policy meeting. The 10-year note up one-half of a point in price, pushing the yield down to the lowest level in two months. The 30-year bond jumped nearly three-quarters of a point. The yield tonight at 5.87 to percent 

 Just ahead, we`ll check out why gasoline prices are causing sticker shock across the country, and ask Daniel Yergin, a leading authority on oil, just what`s driving prices higher. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Other stocks making moves today, Genentech (URL: http://www.gene.com/) lost 4 1/2. The biotech company said its heart attack treatment drug did not perform as well as expected in early testing. 

 Perot Systems (URL: http://www.perotsystems.com/) fell three, or more than 21 percent. The provider of information technology services warned it expects second-quarter revenue and earnings to decline. It also said its fiscal 2000 revenue and earnings will be lower. 

 And Rupert Murdoch`s News Corporation gained nearly 2 3/4 on speculation that it will spin off its satellite television business as early  as next week. The spin-off could raise as much as $5 billion and would be the largest media offering. News Corporation shares are up 57 percent over the last 52 weeks. 

 In tonight`s "MONEYLINE Focus," a subject near and dear to millions of Americans: the price of oil. From Wall Street to Main Street, we`ve all noticed prices at the gas pump heading sky-high recently, and Washington has been buzzing with proposals to address the sharp rise. 

 Benchmark Light Sweet Crude has been on a wild ride this year, dropping after OPEC agreed to boost production, but rising sharply in recent weeks to close today above $32 a barrel. 

 So, how do today`s gas prices stack up from a historical perspective? For an answer, we`re joined by Daniel Yergin, chairman at Cambridge Energy Research and author of a recent study, "Gasoline and the American People." 

 Dan, welcome. 

 DANIEL YERGIN, CAMBRIDGE ENERGY RESEARCH: Thank you. 

 BAY: So you testified before Congress recently and said that despite the fact that it feels pretty awful when you`re shelling out all that money to pay to fill up your car, historically, we are not so terribly off, are we? 

 YERGIN: Yeah, we notice the prices are a lot higher than they were the last year or two, but if you adjust for inflation, which you do when you compare prices, they`re lower than they were throughout the 50s and 60s, and a good deal lower than they were in the first half of the 1980s, when the gasoline was as high as $2.50, the average price across the country. Now it`s about $1.60 across the country. 

 BAY: OK, small consolation. 

 What`s your take on why gas prices are up so high? 

 YERGIN: When you see a change in a market like this, it`s not for one reason. Obviously, the high crude prices are a reason. The very low inventories of gasoline are a reason. The new environmental regulations, which make it harder to move gasoline around the country to meet demand, are a reason. And of course, the other thing is, we`re driving more, Americans are -- it`s a strong economy you were talking about a few minutes ago.. 

 BAY: And how do you account for the disparity in gas prices across the country, which is so alarming folks? 

 YERGIN: Part of the reason is, in the Midwest, it`s kind of at the end of the system. And so, it needs to bring gasoline from other parts of the system. But you start to -- when you have a system that`s this tight, if you have an accident with a pipeline, you have some other kind of disruption in a shipping channel, it sends the price  up because it`s harder to move supply. And the new environmental regulations make it even more difficult, because you can`t move gasoline from the outskirts of Detroit into the center of Detroit. 

 BAY: We heard that the president is quite concerned about price gouging. Do you think that`s a possibility? 

 YERGIN: I think what`s driving this is the market, and we`re going to have it, you know, probably for several more weeks. It`s going to be a volatile market. 

 BAY: At OPEC`s next meeting, do you think they`ll increase output? 

 YERGIN: I think they will definitely increase output, and that will probably take three to six dollars out of those current high oil prices you mentioned. 

 BAY: And so, how long then for that to reach the pumps? 

 YERGIN: It will take a number of weeks. It will take longer than normal because of these very low inventories of gasoline that`s there. The question in Vienna and OPEC next week, is how much do they raise production by. 

 BAY: Dan Yergin, we`ll get an answer to that question next week. Thanks, as always. 

 YERGIN: Thanks. 

 BAY: Coming up, two more airlines talk about joining forces. But will the marriage of troubled carriers fly? 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking some other corporate news: Sources tell CNN that TWA is holding "preliminary" talks to merge with AirTran Holdings (URL: http://www.airtran.com/) , the carrier formerly known as ValuJet . Both airlines, which have been going through tough times, declined specific comment on the negotiations. 

 And investment management firm NVEST (URL: http://www.://www.nvestlp.com/) agreed to be acquired by French financial giant Caisse  Des Depots. The price tag: nearly $2 billion, or $40 per share. The Boston-based Nvest had about $135 billion in assets under management in the past quarter. 

 Checking those stocks: Nvest surged more than 17 1/2, and MetLife (URL: http://www.metlife.com/) , which has a  48 percent stake in Nvest, up fractionally. Meanwhile, TWA gained more than one-half, and Airtran up one-quarter. 

 More on today`s big sector bank stocks. Today several brokerages cut their profit estimates and ratings on a variety of banks, including Chase Manhattan. Deutsche Bank Alex Brown cut the bank`s 2000 earnings estimates, citing a slowdown in market-sensitive revenues. The group`s losses come after two regional backs, Wachovia and Union BanCal, issued second quarter profit warnings. 

 Checking how bank stocks fared today: Chase Manhattan lost more than two. Union BanCal fell 8 3/4. Wachovia lost more than 1/2 today, after losing more than 12 yesterday. Bank of America and Citigroup lower today as well. 

 Up next, one of the best stock debuts in Wall Street history: a dot.com darling. What went wrong with theglobe.com. We`ll have "The Bottom Line," when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Now it`s time for "The Bottom Line," our regular Friday feature on company`s out of crossroads. Tonight, theglobe.com, whose stock debut a year and a half ago blew away all others. Today, the IPO fanfare has long faded and the company`s stock price is floundering, today closing around $2 a share. 

 Peter Viles now on a company trying to recapture its image of success. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: If you wanted to put together a time capsule documenting early Internet euphoria, you might start with this picture: Stephan Paternot, the co-founder of theglobe.com, who at one point had about 60 million reasons to dance. His windfall came from theglobe.com`s 1998 IPO, a watershed event in Internet history. 

 RICHARD PETERSON, THOMSON FINANCIAL SECURITIES DATA: The fall of 1998 we were just coming out of the summer doldrums where there was a currency crisis in Asia, there was the political instability in Russia, and investors were just searching and groping for some good news out there. 

 VILES: They found it in theglobe.com, builder of a virtual city on the Internet made up home-made communities linked by e-mail and chat rooms. The stock jumped 606 percent on its first day: until then, the most spectacular IPO run-up in Wall Street history. 

 STEPHAN PATERNOT, CO-FOUNDER, THEGLOBE.COM: This was the most euphoric moment of our lives, where our stock shot up from $9 a share up to 97, which was the most surreal experience in our lives. 

 VILES: But that was then and this is now. The stock, adjusted here for a stock split, has lost 94 percent since its peak. Only one brokerage house now covers the stock. The company has also been looking for a CEO since January to replace co-CEOs Paternot and Todd Krizelman. 

 ANYA SACHAROW, JUPITER COMMUNICATIONS: Fundamentally, at the outset, theglobe had a flawed business model in that home-page publishing is not a stand-alone viable business. 

 VILES: Over the past two years, theglobe did deliver solid growth. Monthly visitors to the site have more than doubled since April of `98. The company cites 12-month statistics, which show a slightly stronger gain. And revenues have increased in ever fiscal quarter, hitting nearly 

 7 million in the first quarter. 

 But operating losses reached nearly $50 million last year before pulling back slightly in the first quarter. 

 YUSUF HAQUE, 123JUMP.COM: Right now, the company needs to ignore its stock price as much as it can and just work on its business model, work on the projects that it has going, develop itself, make -- push its brand name on a global scale. And it`s done a very, very good job so far. If they continue to do that, there shouldn`t be a problem. 

 VILES: The company has expanded beyond its original community model -- the games information network is considered one of the best on the Web -- direct sale of video games; and a business-to-business strategy to help other Web sites build their own communities, a strategy some analysts applaud. 

 SACHAROW: They let go of that whole notion of being a consumer site, putting marketing dollars into branding themselves for consumers, and are now more interested in actually being the back-end provider to help other companies build community, namely companies like Sportsline or "Rolling Stone." I think it`s a good move for them, and essentially at this point, was probably their only option. 

 VILES: In a letter to MONEYLINE, the company`s lawyer says -- quote -- "theglobe.com`s business model is strong, and the results to date have demonstrated that it is a scalable one. Management is convinced that this business model differentiates theglobe.com from Internet companies that are closing their doors." 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: The company has said it hopes to have a new CEO in place by the end of its second quarter, which means the end of June, which makes this a story and a company to watch over the next two weeks --Willow. 

 BAY: Peter, thank you. And an update on the biggest securities fraud crackdown in history. The top three defendants in the case appeared in court this afternoon for a bail hearing. Two of the three defendants will have to post $2 million each, and if released, they must wear electronic monitoring bracelets and are banned from using cell phones. 

 The third defendant is being held on $1 million bail. 

 Up next, we`ll tell you why boxing is suddenly very big business in Los Angeles. And "Ahead of the Curve": some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open again on Monday. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Earnings news should once again take center stage on Wall Street next week. Several financial giants expected to report, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs, and National Discount Brokers. Earnings also due from Oracle and Micron Technology. 

 On the economic front, April international trade figures are due out on Tuesday. 

 And also watch two-for-one stock splits from Apple Computer and Exodus Communications. And finally, GTE will be spinning off Genuity as part of the FCC`s conditional approval of its merger with Bell Atlantic. The $2 billion offering due to start trading on Wednesday. It`s expected to price between $12 and $15 per share. 

 Finally tonight, Los Angeles is angling for a knockout this weekend. Tomorrow night, Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley will fight for the WBC welterweight title. It`s the city`s first big-ticket bout since Muhammad Ali fought Ken Norton more than 25 years ago. 

 Casey Wian reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CASEY WIAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two self-described L.A. home boys -- Pomona`s Sugar Shane Mosley and East L.A.`s Oscar De La Hoya are bringing big-time boxing back to the "City of Angels" for the first time in a generation. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 SUGAR SHANE MOSLEY, BOXER: Sugar Shane will be making history. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 OSCAR DE LA HOYA, BOXER: I`m going to fight. I`m going to fight like I never fought before. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 WIAN: Most associate Las Vegas with big-money fights. Casinos guarantee huge pay-days for fighters because they attract high-rolling gamblers. 

 (on camera): Even though Nevada hosts the most big-money fights, California is by far the nation`s boxing capital, with about 120 sanctioned professional bouts a year: three times the number held in Nevada. 

 (voice-over): Tomorrow night`s bout is L.A.`s first attempt to snatch marquee fights from Las Vegas. It`s expected to generate ticket sales of about $7 1/2 million, easily the most ever in California. Nevada has hosted half a dozen richer fights in the past five years alone. 

 L.A. may not have Vegas-style casinos but it does have a huge Latino population, which Bob Arum, a promoter of Saturday`s fight, wants to cash in on. 

 BOB ARUM, PRESIDENT, TOP RANK: I think Los Angeles is a prime place to do big-time boxing, particularly when it involves one or more Hispanic fighters. Among Hispanics, boxing is the No. 1 sport. We`re preparing to bring big fights here in the future. 

 WIAN: Los Angeles also has a big disadvantage: taxes. The state and city take 8 percent of boxing ticket sales. For tomorrow`s fight, $600,000. In Las Vegas, it would be half that, which is Staples Center President Tim Leiweke wants lawmakers to cap the tax. 

 TIM LEIWEKE, PRESIDENT, STAPLES CENTER: It`s the difference between you and I talking about, remember that time we had a great boxing match in L.A. 10 years ago and De La Hoya fought here, and you and I going to two of these events every year. If it`s not capped, no one`s going to take the risk, because tonight the state walks out of here with more money than we do. So we risked 5 1/2 million; they risk nothing. 

 WIAN: Still, Leiweke says Staples Center will make a small profit on the fight, which is all but sold out. De La Hoya is guaranteed $15 million; Mosley, 5. Both could make substantially more if, as promoters hope, nearly a million people pay $50 each to watch on pay per view television.

 UPDATE 3-Xerox issues  profit warning , stock tumbles.

(c) 2000 Reuters Limited

 STAMFORD, Conn., June 16 (Reuters) - Xerox Corp., the photocopier giant that ousted its CEO last month after a bungled reorganization, on Friday warned its second-quarter earnings would fall short of forecasts, amid fresh problems in Mexico and stubborn kinks in its sales-force realignment. 

 Shares of the Stamford, Conn.-based company tumbled 19 percent as Wall Street analysts said they were disturbed by the latest round of problems at Xerox as it struggles to transform itself from a company that makes free-standing copiers into one that sells digital printers connected to computer networks. 

 "It's definitely disturbing that the company has not been able to forecast the extent of the problem, and also to let us know rightfully when the problem is going to come to an end," said James Corridore, analyst at Standard & Poor's Equity Group, after a conference call in which top managers tried to strike a contrite yet cautiously optimistic tone. 

 "This is going to be the third time in the last four quarters where earnings have disappointed, starting in the third quarter of 1999," Corridore said. 

 Xerox said its second-quarter earnings, before special charges, would likely be in line with the first quarter's 30 cents a share. Wall Street analysts on average had expected 42 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 After the warning, Xerox shares fell 19 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, closing off 4-13/16 at 20-1/2, barely off the year low of 20. Volume reached 17.5 million shares, compared with a daily average of about 2.4 million. 

 STRATEGIC MISSTEPS 

 Xerox, whose shares have lost more than two-thirds of their value in the past year, has been plagued by strategic missteps and stepped-up competition in recent months. 

 The office-equipment giant has struggled to reorganize its sales force along industry lines rather than geographic boundaries, to compete more aggressively in the merging markets for digital copiers and printers. Xerox is trying to shift more of its revenues into high-growth, Internet-related areas. 

 On Friday, Xerox said the expected earnings shortfall partly reflected slower sales of high-end printer products and significant unexpected provisions in its $400-million-a-year business in Mexico. 

 It said customer relationships had been disrupted by its sales force realignment, hurting sales of its most profitable products. 

 The company did not elaborate upon the Mexican problem, other than to say that it is related to customer receivables and that if could shave 5 to 6 cents off second-quarter per-share earnings. The Mexican woes are "isolated" and are not expected to affect other regions, Chief Financial Officer Barry Romeril said. He declined to say more until the company completes its review of the situation. 

 The warning came weeks after Xerox President and Chief Executive Rick Thoman resigned under pressure on May 11 as his efforts to revive the company met with repeated profit disappointments, 

 Xerox did not time its earnings warning to coincide with last month's management change simply because it did not realise the full extent of the problems of the time, and because it was unaware of the Mexican situation then, a company spokeswoman said. 

 MIXED VIEW FROM ANALYSTS 

 Despite the repeated setbacks, some analysts think Xerox's reorganization strategy is still sound, but that the execution needs to be sharper as competition intensifies. 

 "My sense is, net-net, there is a real franchise value here that is not being appreciated at current levels, but this is probably going to take longer to work through the short-term issues," said Gibboney Huske, analyst at CS First Boston, who kept her "buy" rating on the stock. 

 But Salomon Smith Barney lowered its rating Xerox to "outperform" from "buy." 

 "There were high hopes that the second half (of 2000) was going to be the time where it would help turn things around, and those hopes have now been dashed," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, a Salomon analyst, said. 

 "The interesting thing is that there's actually a lot that's going on here that's right, and that's what's so frustrating about the situation," Rosenzweig said. 

 "Color was doing well," he said. "Sales force turnover is down, prices weren't getting any worse." 

 "It's largely a margin issue, because the high end (of the product line) is getting killed, which is where you have a lot of margin," Rosenzweig said. "The revenue growth itself is going to be fairly on track with what we were looking for." 

 Xerox Chairman and Chief Executive Paul Allaire conceded that most of Xerox's problems are of its own making. "It's now up to us," he said. "It's all in the execution, and that must and will improve." 

 "We're clearly disappointed about our news for the second quarter," Allaire said. "You have our commitment and our determination to fix these issues, and we believe they are within our power to fix." 

 Allaire, who took over as chief executive when Thoman was ousted after a rocky 13-month reign, said he was confident of an improvement later this year, with a further uptick in 2001. 

 Xerox will not cut its dividend, Allaire said. The company is to pay a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share on July 1 to shareholders of record as of June 2.

 UPDATE 1-Wachovia postpones bond sale after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp. , the Southeast regional bank whose shares tumbled 19 percent on Thursday after it issued a profit warning, said on Friday it was postponing a $500 million global bond sale. 

 "The markets right now are in a little bit of turmoil," said Don Truslow, Wachovia's treasurer and controller. "From a timing standpoint, it probably makes sense to let things settle down a bit." 

 The postponement came a day after Winston Salem, N.C.-based Wachovia, blaming higher interest rates, said second-quarter and full-year profits would fall short of the $1.34 and $5.46 per share, respectively, forecast by analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Several investment houses on Friday cut their earnings estimates for Wachovia, and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter & Co. cut its rating on Wachovia shares to "neutral" from "outperform." 

 Wachovia, which has $69 billion in assets, this week had been expected to sell five-year notes yielding 115 to 120 basis points (1.15 to 1.20 percentage points) more than comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries. 

 On Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its outlook for Wachovia's senior debt, which it rates AA-minus, to "negative" from "stable." Moody's Investors Service on Thursday maintained its "negative" outlook for Wachovia's senior debt, which it rates Aa3. The ratings are the agencies' fourth highest. 

 Ian Jaffe, an analyst for New York-based rating agency Fitch, said the bond sale postponement reflects market reaction to Wachovia's profit warning rather than fundamental problems with the company. Fitch rates Wachovia's senior debt AA, roughly one notch higher than Moody's and S&P. 

 "Wachovia continues to be among the most conservative underwriters of corporate credit," he said. "It has been recognised that Wachovia has been running with a modestly more aggressive posture toward financial management during the last few years, similar to trends throughout the industry, but it is quick to recognise problems and take necessary action." 

 Wachovia said rising interest rates have slowed growth in its capital markets, mortgage and investment businesses and have cut lending margins. The company said it plans to take a $200 million second-quarter charge to increase its allowance for loan losses and coverage of non-performing assets. 

 Truslow said Wachovia is "still interested in pursuing a (bond) sale, and we'll have to watch market conditions. The market is still digesting the press release we issued yesterday." 

 The postponement of the bond sale, which Wachovia and Merrill Lynch & Co. were arranging, was the third postponement in the U.S. corporate bond market in eight days and the 14th since late February. 

 It came even though the market has seen a surge in bond issuance and investor demand, on optimism that the Federal Reserve may not raise interest rates much more. The market has absorbed more than $34 billion of new bonds so far this month, more than half of which came from bank and finance entities. 

 Wachovia shares were down 2-1/16 at 55 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares fell 13-1/8 on Thursday.

 U.S. blue chips stuck lower as Nasdaq crawls back up.

 NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - Technology stocks held modest gains in early afternoon trading on Friday as profit warnings sparked a shift out of interest-rate-sensitive shares. 

 Cash abandoned bank stocks on growing concern that higher interest rates are cramping corporate growth. A profit warning from printer giant Xerox Corp. sparked selling as well. 

 By early afternoon, the Nasdaq composite managed a gain of 29 points, or 0.76 percent, to 3,874 boosted by computer-chip and biotechnology names. 

 But technology leaders eased, adding to losses in other sectors to bring the Dow Jones industrial average down 121 points, or 1.13 percent, to 10,593. 

 Broader measures of the market slipped. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was off 5 points, or 0.35 percent, at 1,473. The Wilshire 5000 index fell 28 points, or 0.21 percent, to 13,709. 

 "It's just more of the same. More volatility. More pressure on the financial services, the Xeroxes, the P&Gs of the world and fewer Nasdaq stocks," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross. 

 "Everytime you have a Xerox implode, it's another reason to buy these overly inflated Nasdaq stocks, which we're seeing and that's why Nasdaq is exhibiting some better relative strength," Rice said. 

 Gains in shares of Rambus, the most heavily traded stock on Nasdaq, helped buoy the gauge. Rambus jumped 26 to 82-11/16 after Morgan Stanley said it raised its rating on the stock to a "strong buy" rating from an "outperform." 

 Qualcomm Inc. rose 4-5/8 to 66-1/16 while Conexant Systems rose 7 to 55. 

 But with the corporate confessional season in full swing, some of the most heavily traded stocks were on the downside following warnings about upcoming earnings reports. 

 Highlighting the market's earnings jitters was Xerox, which was in focus after saying its earnings for the second quarter will fall below market expectations. 

 Xerox shares fell 4-7/16 to 20-7/8. 

 An earnings warning from Wachovia Corp. on Thursday, which prompted a slew of downgrades and cuts in earnings forecasts by Wall Street analysts, sparked the bank share sell-off. 

 "Because Wachovia is a conservative bank, the fact that it had profit warnings is causing concern across the board for the financials," said Chris Dickerson, analyst at Global Market Strategists Inc. 

 "That has everyone second-guessing earnings at banks as a whole," Dickerson added. 

 Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Goldman Sachs, and UBS Warburg trimmed their earnings estimates on Wachovia after the southeast regional bank said its second-quarter and full-year profits would fall short of expectations. Morgan Stanley and Lehman cut their ratings on the stock. 

 Wachovia fell 2-3/16 to 54-7/8. 

 J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. dropped 6 to 120-1/2. Close on its heels was American Express Co., off 2-15/16 at 52-9/16. 

 Meanwhile, investors were on edge ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting set for June 27-28 after the week's economic data painted an ambiguous picture of the pace of the nation's growth and the potential for more interest-rate increases. The Fed has raised rates six times in the past year. 

 The "triple witching" options expirations at Friday's close made the session a volatile one. Such quarterly expirations often bring arbitrage activity that can whip the market quickly in either direction. 

 "The pre-announcement season and the Fed meeting is keeping investors from really getting aggressive, so we're kind of in the tight trading range that we've been in," said Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Holdings.

NEW YORK - Stocks ended mostly higher Thursday after being pulled in different directions. Investors had to balance favorable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.19 to 1,478.73, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 48.33 at 3,845.74.

Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion.

Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.063 to $59.688. Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $3 to $117 after the company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in Japan.

Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep dropoff in wireless equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell $9.062 to $61.438. Chase H&Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for Qualcomm for the fourth quarter and next year. Bear Stearns & Co. had cut its outlook for the company a day earlier.

Financial sector stocks took a hit after Wachovia Corp., a respected banking company based in North Carolina, warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest rates. Wachovia shares tumbled $13.125 to $57.063.

Stocks had waffled earlier in the session as traders digested data on unemployment benefits claims and industrial production.

The Federal Reserve said production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent in May, but operating capacity was unchanged.

Separately, the Labor Department said 296,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, a decline of 16,000. Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a tight labor market.

Coca-Cola gained $3.063 to $56.063 after the company said it reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit from current and former employees. In addition, Salomon Smith Barney upgraded its shares because efforts to localize the soft-drink giant's business are beginning to pay off.

Declining issues barely edged out advancing issues on the NYSE, where composite volume came to 1.12 billion shares, nearly unchanged from Wednesday.

The Russell 2000 index rose 2.58 at 512.25.

The price of the 30-year treasury bond was down 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 of face value, sending the yield up slightly to 5.92 percent late Thursday from 5.91 percent late Wednesday.

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.9 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.30 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 1.4 percent lower.

In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 106.59 yen, down from 106.65 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 9.8800 pesos, up from 9.7650. The peso fell to 10.1215 cents from 10.2407 cents late Wednesday. The euro was quoted at 95.350 cents to the dollar, down from 95.960 cents.

 N.Y. Stocks Socked By Bank Losses, Big Trading; DJIA Off

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Earnings worries snagged banking stocks in a death grip Friday, causing steep losses in some market averages in a hotly traded session Friday. 

 Shares of J.P. Morgan tumbled 8 9/16 to 117 15/16, while Chase Manhattan lost 3 3/16 to 45 5/8, and Bank of America dropped 4 3/16 to 47 3/4, as the worries about credit quality sparked by some earnings warnings earlier this week worked through the sector. 

 Shares of Wachovia, which on Thursday previewed weaker earnings because of what it described as a decline in asset quality, lost more ground Friday, easing 5/8 to 56 7/16. UnionBanCal, the San Francisco banking concern that followed Wachovia's lead with a warning about deteriorating asset quality, found itself saddled with pessimistic comments Friday from analysts; its shares sagged 8 3/4 to fall to 19 15/16, dropping to a 52-week low. 

 For many names in the sector, it proved the worst investment climate since the group, as a whole, bottomed out in March. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange/Keefe Bruyette & Woods Index, which enjoyed robust gains in May when the banking group won a short-lived following on Wall Street, has fallen 16% in just two weeks; Friday's loss alone totaled 5.6%. 

 "The Wachovia earnings warning just put a dent in these stocks, which had been acting pretty well," Jon Brorson, director of equities at Northern Trust in Chicago. "Now it's hitting the sector just across the board. 

 "But in this market, everything acts in the extreme, both to the upside and the downside," Brorson added. 

 Sharp volume tied to the quarterly closeout of options and futures likely took the spin the market had put on the day and just stretched that to an extreme, market watchers said. A total of 1.2 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, a big jump from Thursday's total of 988.7 million shares. 

 With blue-chip names especially hard hit, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled into the close, finishing 265.52 points weaker, a drop of 2.48%, to finish at 10449.30, ending on its low for the day. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10449.30, down 265.52. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,307 issues advancing, 1,584 declining and 482 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,207,765,580 shares, compared with 988,732,890 Thursday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 649.68, down 7.76. The average price per share fell 48 cents. 

 Cyclical stocks wrestled with their own demons in the session, as investors fretted that slowing economic expansion, something Wall Street celebrated the last two weeks because it suggested an end to the cycle of tight monetary policy, also carried a downside: weaker profit growth. 

 Shares of Honeywell dropped 2 1/8 to 48 3/4. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing gave up 2 to 84 7/16. General Motors surrendered 2 1/4 to 62 13/16. Whirlpool declined 1 7/8 to 51 1/2. 

 Investors seeking alternatives to the companies that might see profit growth shrivel in a slow-growth economy alighted, reasonably enough, on some names whose products consumers buy regardless of the economy's strength. Drug makers, for example, rallied again, with Warner-Lambert ahead 1 5/16 to 131, while American Home Products increased 2 3/8 to 58 1/2. 

 Energy companies also moved higher again, even though prices for crude oil products retreated in the session on some expectations that OPEC would once again increase production. Shares of Royal Dutch Petroleum gained 1 3/8 to 63 13/16. Amerada Hess rose 2 to 67 11/16. Texaco, identified in a report in the current issue of BusinessWeek as a potential takeover target - rumors company officials denied - added 7/8 to 57 13/16. 

 And miraculously, technology stocks came through the session unscathed by the earnings fears that dogged the blue-chip sector. Sure, investors made Xerox pay for another profit warning, sending the stock down 4 9/16 to 20 3/4. 

 But a host of technology issues made progress in Friday's trading, including Conexant Systems, which rose 5 7/8 to 53 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Exodus Communications, which jumped 10 1/8 to 103 1/4, also on Nasdaq, and EMC, which climbed 4 7/8 to 79. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index closed the session with a gain of 14.80, or 0.38%, to end at 3860.54. 

 For the week, the Dow industrial average surrendered a total of 1.5%, while the Nasdaq composite kept its loss to a modest 0.3%. 

 Lehman Brothers managed to dodge the selloff that afflicted the rest of the financial sector, gaining 7/8 to 90 3/8, after the New York brokerage concern reported earnings that topped forecasts, despite a rocky market environment in the period covered by the report. 

 Aetna lost 3 7/8 to 69 1/2. The Hartford, Conn., health insurance concern said it has begun talks with other interested parties about an acquisition of all or part of its financial services and international operations, though the company said its previously disclosed talks with ING Group about those properties are continuing. 

 Solectron eased 11/16 to 39 5/16. The Milpitas, Calif., contract electronics manufacturer said it agreed to buy some electronic computer-aided design capabilities from Nortel Networks. Terms of the pact weren't disclosed. Shares of telecommunications equipment maker Nortel Networks lost 1/8 to 67 3/8. 

 Shares of Boeing lost 1 11/64 to 39 13/64 in a session where many manufacturers suffered setbacks. The Seattle aircraft manufacturer said it is selling a parts-making operation based in St. Louis, a signal that the company is accelerating plans to divest itself of such operations throughout its military and commercial lines. 

 Circuit City fell 1 9/16 to 35 13/16. The Richmond, Va., consumer electronics retailer reported fiscal first-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street's targets, though those targets had been lowered by the company earlier this month. 

 Adobe Systems lost 4 1/2 to 120 1/4, halting a recent advance that built on expectations of strong earnings. The software developer's fiscal second-quarter earnings, turned in late Thursday, beat Wall Street's forecasts, though the company acknowledged weaker-than-expected sales of its InDesign page layout software.

 But outside of the specific factors driving tech stocks higher and financial shares lower, White said the rest of the market was struggling in the wake of mixed data on the economy. 

 "It's still a market looking for a sense of direction," White said. "My sense is that it's going to take more convincing news on the economy before we can see any kind of volume in the market. With earnings pre-announcement season here, there's even more uncertainty ladled on top of it."

 Bank stocks take a dive

 Stock in Wachovia of Winston-Salem got clobbered Thursday after the bank holding company announced that its quarterly and annual profits would fall short of expectations because of interest rate increases and a slowing economy. 

 Wachovia's tumble echoed through the financial industry, as bank stocks across the state and nation dropped, with investors worried that Wachovia's profit warning might be the first of a series spawned by economic and interest rate pressures. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in the past year . 

 In heavy trading, Wachovia lost $13.125 per share Thursday, closing at $57.063. First Union of Charlotte dropped $2 to $28.875, while Bank of America of Charlotte lost $3.25 to close at $52.063. BB&T of Winston-Salem closed down$2 at $26.875, Centura Bank of Rocky Mount finished the day off $2.125 at $36.875, and CCB Financial of Durham ended down $1.812 at $43.375. 

 Bank stocks have been falling almost this entire month, initially led downward in North Carolina by First Union and Centura. Most state- based banks lost $5 to $6 per share in the two weeks before Wachovia's announcement. 

 Wall Street is in a jittery mood, nervous about the economy and the ability of banks to maintain profit margins as their portfolios get squeezed by rising interest rates and their investment businesses slow as mergers and initial public offerings taper off. In that environment, investors are quick to sell off stock in any bank or financial company with the slightest hint of trouble. 

 "This is a bad-news market," said John Moore, banking analyst with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte. "We are all looking for bad news." 

 The fact that the bad news on Thursday came from Wachovia only heightened concerns about the banking industry in general, because Wachovia, with $68.8 billion in assets, is regarded as one of the more cautious big banks, with an enviable loan portfolio. But Wachovia said it had no magic formula for avoiding market downturns. 

 "We have always told everybody that we are not immune to market issues," said Robert S. McCoy Sr., Wachovia's chief financial officer. "We would just say that it has been Wachovia's history to recognize loan problems as soon as we can and get them behind us." 

 In its announcement, Wachovia said its commercial loans and its investment business were being pinched and would result in lower profits for the bank. Wachovia set aside $200 million to cover an expected rise in bad loans. Before the announcement, analysts had estimated that Wachovia would earn $1.34 per share for the second quarter and $5.46 per share for the year. 

 McCoy noted that Wachovia is in no real danger but would simply be making less money than expected - a fact that he said applied to the banking industry in general at the moment. 

 "You have to put this in perspective," McCoy said. "Banks are still going to grow earnings. But instead of 10 to 12 percent, we'll grow earnings at 6 to 8 percent. Banks are not going to lose money. It's a question of, will banks make as much money as we thought?" 

 Wachovia's announcement momentarily shifted focus away from First Union and Centura, which both have special circumstances that analysts figured would make them more susceptible to earnings downturns. 

 First Union's stock slide this month has been fueled by speculation that the bank is about to announce some unfavorable news following a lengthy internal review, possibly a major write-off or sale of The Money Store, a consumer finance company that First Union purchased for $2.1 billion in 1998 and has had trouble with ever since. First Union is the nation's sixth-largest bank with $253 billion in assets. 

 "If they decide to throw in the towel on The Money Store, you could be talking about a pretty big write-off," said David West, banking analyst with Davenport & Co., which recently cut its annual earnings estimate for First Union from $3.55 per share to $3.40. 

 For Centura, the concern is that the interest rate rise will have a bigger impact because of the bank's merger with Triangle Bancorp of Raleigh. Triangle had an investment portfolio more vulnerable to rising interest rates. 

 "Triangle magnified whatever effect the interest rate rise would have been on Centura anyway," said Centura Chief Financial Officer Steven Goldstein. 

 Wachovia Securities and BB&T Capital Markets this week both lowered their ratings on Centura from strong buy to long-term buy. Davenport previously lowered its estimate of this year's annual earnings for Centura from $4.30 to $4.35 per share to $4.10 per share. 

 Centura, which has $11 billion in assets, completed its takeover of Triangle this year, saying that most aspects of the merger went smoothly and according to plan. 

Wachovia's disappointing earnings news fed fears that the entire sector is due for rough times.

 STOCKS ended mostly higher yesterday after being pulled in different directions. 

 Investors had to balance favorable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.19 to 1,478.73, and the NASDAQ composite index was up 48.33 at 3,845.74. 

 Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion. 

 Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.06 1/4 to $59.68 3/4. 

 NBTY SHARES FALL AGAIN. NBTY Inc. shares fell for a second day, declining 36 percent yesterday after the maker and seller of nutritional supplements told analysts fiscal third-quarter same- store sales will be below expectations. 

 Shares of the Bohemia-based company fell $4 to $7.06 1/4 in trading of 16.3 million, more than 20 times the three-month daily average. The stock was the second-biggest loser on the NASDAQ Stock Market. 

 Matthew Patsky, an analyst at Adams, Harkness & Hill, cut his earnings forecast for the quarter ending June 30 to 15 cents a share from 17 cents following private briefings over the past two days. 

 U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Yudhi Bahl said the briefings were given privately to analysts by company officials. No press release was issued and a company spokesman wasn't available for comment. 

 QUALCOMM TO FEED THEATERS DIGITALLY. Wireless communications technology company Qualcomm Inc. said yesterday it had teamed up with Technicolor Digital Cinema Inc. to distribute movies digitally to cinemas. 

 The companies said they will form a joint venture to provide digital distribution of films along with support services and aim to begin trials of the delivery system in early 2001. 

 The move combines Qualcomm's experience in digital voice communications and encryption and compression technology and Technicolor's distribution in the entertainment industry, the companies said in a statement. 

 AT&T-MEDIAONE MERGER COMPLETED. AT&T has completed the acquisition of MediaOne Group, becoming the largest U.S. cable operator with 16 million customers, AT&T said yesterday. 

 The deal, valued at about $44 billion based on AT&T's closing stock price Wednesday of $33.50, was finalized with the filing of a certificate of merger with the Office of the Delaware Secretary of State in Dover, Del. The boards of the two companies approved the merger in May, 1999. 

 For a limited time immediately following the closing, MediaOne shareholders can elect to have their shares exchanged for cash, stock or a combination of both stock and cash. 

 NADER ATTACKS LENDING PROGRAMS. Ralph Nader, warning of a potential taxpayer bailout similar to the savings and loan crisis, urged lawmakers to cut government benefits to mortgage-market giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - which he called "poster children for corporate welfare." But some lawmakers said yesterday that acting hastily could raise the cost of buying a home by increasing borrowing costs for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are called government- sponsored enterprises. 

 Joining Nader in criticizing the two mortgage companies at a House subcommittee hearing was the head of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. 

 MICROSOFT URGES QUICK APPEAL RULING. Microsoft Corp. yesterday urged an appeals court to rule quickly on its request to stay restrictions on its business, firing another volley in a verbal shootout with the U.S. government over legal procedure in the antitrust case against the software giant. 

 In a filing with the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., Microsoft defended asking that court to stay a set of conduct remedies ordered by a federal judge who found the company guilty of breaking antitrust law. 

 On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department asked the appeals court not to consider Microsoft's request for a stay until the judge who tried the case had a chance to rule on it and until which court would hear the appeal was settled. 

 While the appeals court has said it would take the case, Justice has asked the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, to fast-track the appeal straight to the Supreme Court, which can accept or reject it. 

 GROUP SEEKS SIMPLER LOAN PROCESS. Responding to growing concern over abusive mortgage lending practices, the largest U.S. housing finance industry trade group yesterday called for action to simplify the process of getting a home loan. 

 The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said any legislative action to combat so-called predatory lending should also include an overhaul of the mortgage process to make it easier for borrowers to understand. 

 "While it is absolutely essential abusive lending practices be eliminated from the mortgage lending business, none of the efforts to do so will be successful without real and comprehensive mortgage reform," MBA president-elect Andrew Woodward said in a statement.

 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended mostly higher Thursday after being pulled in different directions. Investors had to balance favorable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.06 to 1,478.60, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 48.33 at 3,845.74. 

 Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion. 

 Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.063 to $59.688. Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $3 to $117 after the company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in Japan. 

 Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep dropoff in wireless equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell $9.062 to $61.438. Chase H&Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for Qualcomm for the fourth quarter and next year. Bear Stearns had cut its outlook for the company a day earlier. 

 Financial sector stocks took a hit after Wachovia, a respected banking company based in North Carolina, warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest rates. Wachovia shares tumbled $13.125 to $57.063. 

 "This is a bank that people have a lot of respect for, and that's got the banking stocks down on the day," said Charles White, president and portfolio manager at Avatar Associates, a New York- based money management firm. 

 But outside of the specific factors driving tech stocks higher and financial shares lower, White said the rest of the market was struggling in the wake of mixed economic data. "It's still a market looking for a sense of direction. My sense is that it's going to take more convincing news on the economy before we can see any kind of volume in the market. With earnings pre-announcement season here, there's even more uncertainty ladled on top of it." 

 Coca-Cola gained $3.063 to $56.063 after the company said it reached a tentative deal to settle a race-discrimination lawsuit from current and former employees.

CNNfn: In The Money

 BILL TUCKER, CNN ANCHOR:  It`s been a strong week for the tech sector, but will investors continue to devour these new economy stocks? or will the purging begin? 

 BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR:  Then, brutal weather conditions across the country, record-breaking heat in the West, helping to fan those fast-moving fires in Colorado.  And a dry, thirsty landscape in the Southeast.  Is there relief in sight? 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNN ANCHOR:  And later, they`ve got billions and billions.  You know their names, but who`s the richest of them all? 

 TUCKER:  You`re 300 yards out, standing deep in the rough, sometimes you just gotta reach out to Big Bertha.  Coming up, Callaway Golf is our "Stock of the Day." 

 ANNOUNCER:  From CNN and CNNfn, this is IN THE MONEY with Terry Keenan, Bill Tucker and Daryn Kagan. 

 KEENAN:  And good morning, everyone, and welcome to IN THE MONEY for this Friday. 

 We begin with a couple of stories that hit very close to home: cars, houses and computers. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, gas prices continue to rise.  But what`s the government going to do about it?  What should they do about it?  We`ll have a live report. 

 Also, according to an early morning report, housing starts fell last month and Internet messaging could be even faster. 

 KEENAN:  And we`ll have all of those stories in just a moment.  But first, let`s bring you up to speed on what`s going on on Wall Street this morning.  We have the Dow currently down 73 points, monthly and quarterly expirations of futures and option, making for a busy day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Financial stocks are the culprit again today. We have J.P. Morgan, American Express and Citigroup all solidly to the downside. 

 But the Nasdaq holding on to a slim gain and Qualcomm, which was hammered yesterday, rebounding a bit today, up 4 1/2. 

 TUCKER:  Well, President Clinton said today that he is frustrated with the wallet-emptying gas prices in Chicago and Milwaukee.  In an interview with NBC`s "Today" show, the president said he is concerned about gasoline prices, which have hit 10-year highs at the moment.  But says, at this time, it is unclear if there is any price gouging. 

 So what is causing the rise in prices?  Fred Katayama is down in Washington with some of the answers. 

 Fred, good morning. 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Bill. 

 Well, gas prices keep rocketing higher, a gallon of regular unleaded gas sets motorists back $1.59 in Los Angeles, $1.61 here in Washington, and $2.33 in Chicago, the highest nationwide.  The Midwest is being hit the hardest and cab drivers and motorists are fuming.  And so Illinois Governor George Ryan is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend its new cleaner gas rules that he says have fueled the higher prices. The EPA`s new regulations for reformulated gas, analysts estimate, add three to seven cents a gallon.  The agency says it is reviewing Ryan`s request. 

 And just less than an hour ago, Senator Charles Schumer addressed this topic on the floor. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK:  I appreciate attempts by Secretary Richardson to cajole OPEC into increasing production, but it hasn`t worked and it is time for the U.S. to play a little hardball. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KATAYAMA:  Oil analysts say pipeline problems in the Midwest have further tightened the gas supply, and President Clinton this week asked the Transportation Department to look into those supply problem.  One solution pitched in the past is loosening restrictions on truckers` hours so more gas can be hauled into the region. 

 Oil experts say other factors driving up prices nationwide, include the spike in crude oil prices, which makes up almost half of the total cost of gas, the summer driving season, and the reluctance of some refiners to produce cleaner gas because they fear they would infringe on a patent held by Unocal. 

 This week, the Federal Trade Commission began looked into whether anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing and collusion, are contributing to higher prices -- Bill. 

 TUCKER:  And Fred, while prices are high, we probably ought to put them in some sort of context, they have been higher in the past; right? 

 KATAYAMA:  Well, right, Bill.  In fact, despite the recent spike, when you adjust it for inflation, a gallon of gas today still costs 95 cents less than it did when prices peaked in 1981.  And compared to other consumer products, the rise in gas hasn`t been too bad. 

 Let`s take a look at some of these other prices.  You will notice that gasoline has risen 35.2 percent since 1982, that is more than the increase in electricity at 27 percent, but you know a lot less than the price of a bowl of Frosted Flake.  I mean, cereal has gone up a whopping 226 percent, and tobacco more than 287 percent. 

 Should keep in mind, the source of these numbers are the -- is the American Petroleum Institute, and they also supplies these numbers as for what you would pay for a gallon of say, Coca-Cola, more so than a gallon of gasoline, $1.87 for a gallon of Coke compared to $1.48, that is the average nationwide for a gallon of gas.  Hey, it is going to cost you even more to clean up your breath, Scope costs $19.68, which you will probably need after you take that vat of Jack Daniels at $98.41 a gallon. 

 Bill, so, when you compare it to all that, gas isn`t that bad. 

 TUCKER:  And that explains why I haven`t bought any Jack Daniels in a while.  Fred, thank you very much. 

 KATAYAMA:  Neither have I, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  All right, with gasoline prices rising the way they are, how long would you wait for a tank of free gas?  Well, some people waited eight hours.  That`s how long motorists in Milwaukee, yesterday, waited, a radio station sponsoring a day-long pass at the pumps.  By day`s end, nearly 1,200 drivers lined up for a tankful of gasoline. 

 KEENAN:  Well, the housing report released this morning indicates the efforts by the Federal Reserve to slow the rate of growth in the economy may be working.  Housing starts fell nearly four percent last month, to 1.59 million units.  While the number of new building permits issued also fell, it dropped 4.3 percent.  The figures may indicate that recent interest rate hikes have cooled the economy and effectively put the brakes on inflation, something that will hamper expansion. 

 Well, Xerox warns that its second-quarter earnings will copy first- quarter results and that warning is raising concerns for some on Wall Street, causing a lot of pain for Xerox investors. 

 Let`s bring in Susan Lisovicz at the New York Stock Exchange for the details. 

 And with this stock, Susan, when it rains it pours. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that`s exactly right, because this is the third profit warning in four quarters and investors do not easily forget that, nor do they forgive.  Xerox, right now, the second most actively traded issue on the Big Board, it`s getting hammered, down more than four. 

 What`s happening at Xerox is that, among other things, it`s realigned its sales force, that has hurt its customer relations and sales of some of its highest margin items.  And it also says there are problems in Mexico, sort of a vague attribution to problems there, but apparently its management shake-up, just last month, where its top -- its CEO was replaced, not helping, not right now. 

 Jabil Circuit, a different story for Jabil.  It makes circuit boards that are used in PCs as well as automotive companies and telecom companies. It came out, after the bell, in line with expectations, yet that stock getting hammered today, down more than two.  A lot of techs on the Big Board are weaker today. although Jabil has gotten some favorable comments from Prudential.  It`s upgraded the stock to strong buy from accumulate and Bear Stearns has reiterated buy rating on that stock. 

 And then another story, also very company-specific.  Lehman Brothers blowing away the Street with its estimates coming in at $2.78 a diluted share.  The Street had expected $2.49.  Financials across the board are getting hurt, and now Lehmans, we`re seeing some weakness in that stock as well. 

 There have been a lot of concerns about what higher interest rates will do to companies, such as financials, investment banks, yesterday a large regional bank issued a warning for the entire year.  And we`re still seeing weakness in that sector, including Lehman, which had its second best quarter ever. 

 Back to you, Terry. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you, Susan, Susan Lisovicz. 

 My next guest says today`s economic numbers are further evidence the Federal Reserve`s fight against inflation is doing the trick.  But he says that we are concentrating too much on the Fed.  Instead, investors should be worried about corporate earnings, this, of course, timely in light of today`s warning by Xerox. 

 Joining me now, Gregg Hymowitz, money manager with Entrust Capital. 

 And Gregg, welcome back. 

 GREGG HYMOWITZ, MONEY MANAGER, ENTRUST CAPITAL:  Thanks. 

 KEENAN:  So we`re too fixated on the Fed, is that because they are done raising rates? 

 HYMOWITZ:  No, not only -- maybe they are done, maybe they are not done.  But the bottom line is:  No one`s ever really made that much money trying to bet which way the Fed is going.  I guess you could do that in the bond markets. 

 But as far as equity investing goes, you really have to focus on the companies.  I don`t -- I think there is very few money managers sitting around their offices in the morning, trying to figure which way the Fed is going.  Most people figure that that`s something that you`re never going to be able to predict to any degree of certainty, and therefore it makes more sense to focus on your companies; focus how well various companies are doing and what the earnings forecasts are going to be for those companies. 

 KEENAN:  So we`re coming up to the close of the second quarter, how do things look? 

 HYMOWITZ:  Well, earnings have been relatively strong, although you clearly see in the economic numbers have come out recently, economically sensitive stocks and economically sensitive sectors, housing and the related sectors, are clearly experiencing difficulty.  Even in the industrial production number yesterday, the real strength in industrial production, the other day, was really in the semiconductors. 

 So technology sector continues to grow, particularly some areas of technology, where companies need to employ technology for either defensive or offensive reasons.  But other areas, economically sensitive areas, clearly seem to be coming under pressure. 

 KEENAN:  You know, so that raises the question, perhaps the Fed has done too much to try to slow down the economy and we could tip the balance into a recession, is that a concern of yours at all? 

 HYMOWITZ:  Absolutely, and also further to that point, you have to also think that the last 50 basis points, probably the last 75 basis-point increase, isn`t even factored in yet.  There`s definitely a lag effect for these increases to seep their way into the economy and the last 50, I think, most people would argue are definitely not in. 

 Once those get factored in, it may get a little scary, what those economic numbers may turn out to be. 

 KEENAN:  The half percentage point that we just got in May. 

 HYMOWITZ:  Absolutely. 

 KEENAN:  What are some stocks then that you would be buying here, or would you be staying on the sidelines? 

 HYMOWITZ:  No, I think that, given, you know -- again, I use the industrial production number sort of as a microcosm of what kind of names you want to own.  And I think there are certain areas that are still doing very well.  The infrastructure area in the technology is doing very well. There we own this company called Aspect Communications. It`s sort of an infrastructure play into the new technology, into the new economy paradigm. 

 Select financial:  If you think that interest rates, possibly, are towards the end of the increases, the savings and loans tend to do very well coming out of an interest rate-raising cycle.  So there we own Golden State Bank Corp, the second largest thrift in the country. 

 So you have to pick your spots and you have to really focus on the companies.  My only bottom line is, don`t spend a lot of time for the average investor out there trying to figure out which way Alan Greenspan`s going to move next. 

 KEENAN:  OK, good advice.  Thanks Gregg. 

 HYMOWITZ:  Sure. 

 KEENAN:  Gregg Hymowitz. 

 TUCKER:  Well, in response to an antitrust investigation, America Online has submitted a proposal to the Federal Trade Commission to allow access to its instant messaging software to its competition. 

 With more on that story, CNN`s Bruce Francis joins us now. 

 Hello, Bruce.  And first of all, is the company characterizing this as a response to an investigation by the government? 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  No, really, the way they`re looking at this is there was a deadline for proposals to be submitted to an Internet standards body, and that is exactly what they`ve done here. 

 Competitors this morning, Bill, are telling me, well, you know, this is just an outline.  It`s all in the code.  Let`s see what AOL comes up with. 

 Let`s take a step backwards and really take a look at what AOL Instant Messenger is.  I`m going to message someone, Adam Levine, from IN THE MONEY.  Now, I`ve set up my "Buddy List" here, as you can see.  Adam is online.  I`m going to say, hey Adam.  And you can see that my name comes up there.  Actually, it says "he Adam" because I am a notoriously bad typist. And Adam sends me a message right back. 

 This is a message system that is very widely used on the Net: 91 million people use it.  It`s Free to use, but it is not now interoperable with other forms of Internet messaging. 

 And there are competitors out there.  This is we`re going to go back to the Web, and this is the interface for a company called Odigo.  And you can see over here on the right part of your screen, this area, that`s what their interface looks like.  It is a lot more sophisticated, much more visual than AOL`s Instant Messenger service. 

 And you can`t -- but right now, you cannot actually come in and message AOL Instant Messenger users from Odigo.  They`ve been going back and forth battling, trying to get in and trying to make them interoperable. AOL keeps blocking them at every turn, and AOL says they will continue to do that until this new standard is actually accepted. 

 AOL considers this hacking.  AOL`s line on this is that, well, you know, you expose AOL members to maybe getting spam, which is unwanted, unsolicited kind of junk e-mail, and there are security issues.  Those are issues that competitors play down.  They just say that AOL wants to keep all the marbles for themselves -- Terry, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Bruce, thanks. 

 Let`s bring in Andy Serwer, actually.  Andy`s sitting over on the set here.  Let`s get him involved in the discussion. 

 Where do you weigh in on this, Andy? 

 ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, "FORTUNE" MAGAZINE:  Well, a couple quick points, you guys.  First of all, we want to thank Steve Case for watching IN THE MONEY because obviously he got the idea to open up instant messaging, or it looks like he`s moving it that way, because we were just talking about that a couple days ago. 

 Second point, you know, I think we see AOL moving much quicker here in response to government pressure than the Time Warner half of the new company when they got in trouble with Disney.  So kudos to AOL for being responsive there. 

 And third of all, I just used instant messaging for the first time.  I know I`m a little behind the eight ball.  We got 90 million people using it.  But it really is like stepping off a Greyhound bus and getting on an F-16 jet fighter when you go from regular old e-mail.  And I know, Bill, you`re a user.  So it`s a heck of a technology and a lot of people are using it. 

 TUCKER:  I`m a user, but more importantly, there are millions of teenagers... 

 KEENAN:  Your kids are users. 

 TUCKER:  Exactly right. 

 SERWER:  Right, but it`s going to be a business applications soon, and that`s the real future of this technology. 

 KEENAN:  Quick response from AOL another sign of how worried AOL and Time Warner are about getting this deal done? 

 SERWER:  Absolutely.  I mean, you know, the FTC is -- they did confirm they were studying this, and I think that AOL did the right thing and they`re moving to opening it up.  They -- the critics say they haven`t done it fast enough, but I think they`re definitely heading in that direction. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thanks Andy.  See you a bit later in the program. 

 SERWER:  OK. 

 KEENAN:  Well, all it takes now is a click of a mouse to seal a deal. And an 87-0 vote, the Senate has given the same legal power to cyberspace signatures as a pen-and-paper document.  This will allow businesses to complete multimillion-dollar deals more easily and will allow consumers to obtain mortgages and car loans without ever setting foot in an office. The House overwhelmingly approved the bill on Wednesday and President Clinton has already voiced strong support for the measure. 

 Yesterday, we talked to Credit Suisse First Boston`s Todd Raker about companies that work in this field.  And here are some of the stocks that he suggested looking at: VeriSign was one them; Baltimore Technologies; Entrust Technologies; and Tumbleweed, which specializes in secure document transfer.  And you can see a mixed showing for those stocks today. 

 TUCKER:  Coming up on IN THE MONEY:  How rich is too rich?  Well, we will show you the latest list of billionaires. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  All right, this morning`s "Wake-Up Call" salutes George Washington.  It seems he`s eager to make an appearance on the new $1 coin. A golden dollar has been discovered that is sending coin collectors on a treasure hunt.  The coin has a double stamp: one side has George`s winning smile, while the other has the back of Sacagawea.  The one coin is expected to fetch $100,000.  The discovery is particularly ironic because the mint in Philly had pushed a $40 million ad-campaign touting how happy George is not to be gracing the front of the new dollar coin. 

 KEENAN:  Go figure. 

 OK, time now to check in on some other stories making headlines this morning.  And for that we go to Bill Hemmer in Atlanta.  He is sitting in for Daryn Kagan. 

 Hi there, Bill. 

 HEMMER:  Hey Terry, hey, Bill, pretty nice return on that dollar, huh? Not bad. 

 We`re watching a story this morning out of Indiana.  Two fugitives from Mississippi state prison now back in custody.  John Woolard and Roy Harper escaped from Mississippi`s Parchment Penitentiary back in May. Harper was caught in a car wash in St. John, Indiana earlier today. Woolard was captured minutes ago after officers staked out a rural area near the town about 30 miles south of Chicago. 

 Now, Woolard and Harper broke out of the Parchment Penitentiary in May. 

 Patrick Elmwood (ph) now, from our affiliate WFLD out of Chicago, with more now on their flight from justice. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 MICHAEL DEMIK:  I climbed on top that mailbox, and popped the door open, hoisted myself up there, within me and you, maybe a one foot distance of the man with the gun. 

 PATRICK ELMWOOD, WFLD REPORTER (voice-over):  Michael Demik says he is lucky to be alive after coming face to face with John Woolard and Roy Harper.  He says, he and a friend went out to his barn last night when they noticed it was locked.  They thought something was wrong, so they decided to take a closer look.  That`s when they saw the two fugitives. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I took off running, my kid behind a tree.  I ran down the road.  I got to Route 55 in a mile right here and all of a sudden I heard some tires screech.  I turned around.  They were in my van going down the road. 

 ELMWOOD:  The FBI released these photos of the pair.  They`re pictures the men took of each other in the days following their escape from a Mississippi prison. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 HEMMER:  Again, that story, Patrick Elmwood, our affiliate out of Chicago, WFLD.  Again, both men now back in custody. 

 Now to news from the weather.  All across the country, the intensity of that drought in the Southeastern part of the country has been upgraded to "exceptional."  That`s the government`s highest drought category. 

 Some farmers in the state of Georgia watching their crops go to waste in the fields, and rainfall has been at least 30 percent below average for the past six months.  Atlanta and surrounding counties are on an outdoor watering ban.  And parts of the Midwest also are parched at this time. We could use the rain. 

 From Colorado, lower winds, higher humidity and cooler temperatures expected to help firefighters there battling two major blazes.  The wildfires are a long way from contained then, but more than 17,000 acres so far have burned and hundreds have been forced from their homes. Together, Colorado`s High Meadow and Bobcat fires have damaged or destroyed more than 50 homes and other buildings.  This would be the first relief in the weather for fire crews in days. 

 A cooling trend expected to continue today in Northern California, following this week`s record heat wave, specifically in the San Francisco Bay area.  At least eight people now confirmed dead as a result of those triple-digit temperatures.  The "Oakland Tribune" is reporting there may be more on the way.  Hundreds have fallen ill in the sweltering conditions. 

 The hot weather eased a bit yesterday, although electrical problems did persist.  Thousands still remain without power this morning. 

 That`s a quick update on the news from Atlanta. 

 Now back to New York, more with Bill and Terry on this Friday in the markets. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Bill, thanks. 

 KEENAN:  Thanks, Bill. 

 Well, what do members of royal families, princes, dictators, high-tech CEOs and Wall Street value investors all have in common?  If you guessed money, you`re right.  Money and those who have a lot of it are the subject of "Forbes" magazine`s next issue.  It`s the list of the 200 richest working people in the world. 

 The volatility in the Nasdaq this year was responsible for some last- minute changes, but 50 Americans and another 150 billionaires from around the world made the cut.  Topping the list in this year`s rundown: Bill Gates, who is worth about $60 billion.  Now, that`s down from almost $100 billion last year.  Not very far behind, breathing right down his neck, Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, now with $55 billion dollars.  And behind them, the co-founder of Microsoft, Paul Allen and investment guru Warren Buffett, who had a rough year.  Sharing the fifth place are the German Albrecht family in the retail business, along with Prince Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia and S. Robson Walton, each worth about $20 billion a piece. 

 Joining me now, Kerry Dolan, who is an editor with "Forbes" magazine, and helped compile this list. 

 And Kerry, welcome. 

 KERRY DOLAN, EDITOR, "FORBES":  Thank you. 

 KEENAN:  What was the biggest surprise this year? 

 DOLAN:  Well, it was really tricky to try and keep track of these guys, because as you mentioned, the Nasdaq and the volatility of stock prices were pushing people`s networths way up and then way down.  And so we didn`t really know until the last minute who -- where the rankings were going to fall. 

 KEENAN:  I mean, there are several executives who really were instant billionaires and then fell precipitously earlier in the year, such as Jay Walker of priceline.com, for one. 

 DOLAN:  Right, Jay Walker was on our list last year.  We had -- in this 200 that we do -- just so people in the audience aren`t confused -- 

 we list 50 of -- the 50 of these people are the richest Americans. And so there may be some Americans who are actually up there in the ranks of the rest of the 200, but they`re going to be in our "Forbes" 400 richest American`s issue in the fall. 

 But Jay Walker was $10 billion dollars last year, and so he made this top 50 richest Americans, and now he`s back down to 2.8, and so he didn`t make our cutoff. 

 KEENAN:  What else did you learn from this list?  I mean, one thing that`s interesting is many of these fortunes were built in technology, and were built in the last 20 years or so. 

 DOLAN:  Yes, five of the top 10 richest guys on our list have fortunes from technology.  And about a quarter of the 200 altogether are pure technology fortunes.  And the other things is, a lot of the fortunes are kind of old-economy fortunes, but people are moving in to adding an Internet component to the fortunes that they have, you know, banking or cement, even. 

 KEENAN:  What other countries have made the list with 50 Americans? 

 DOLAN:  Well, we`ve got, beside the 50 Americans, people from all over the world.  This year, first time we`ve had a billionaire from Egypt. And the first time we`ve had a billionaire from Norway.  Other interesting changes: more new billionaires in India and a lot more new billionaires in Japan, which is kind of odd given that their economy is in the dumps. 

 KEENAN:  Yes, perhaps a sign of a turnaround. 

 Any women make the cut? 

 DOLAN:  We only had four women make the top 200, and they have all either inherited their fortunes from their fathers or their husbands, but they`re still working, they`re active.  They`re, you know, we`ve got people like Abby Johnson from Fidelity and Jacqueline Mars from the Mars family, the candy makers, are the American women on the list. 

 KEENAN:  OK, thank you very much, Kerry. 

 DOLAN:  Thank you. 

 KEENAN:  We appreciate it. 

 DOLAN:  All right. 

 KEENAN:  Kerry Dolan, of "Forbes." 

 TUCKER:  All right, irons, drivers and putters, oh my.  This company is in the business of filling your golf bag. 

 Coming up, Callaway Golf is our "Stock of the Day." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 KEENAN:  OK, there you see the Nasdaq market site.  We have turned lower, down about 12 points.  Apple Computer to the down side, off 2 1/2. 

 TUCKER:  All right, in sports, the first round of the U.S. Open is expected to resume at this hour.  Play had been postponed about halfway through yesterday because of fog.  Golfer Tiger Woods was the shining star, despite the weather.  He set a record on the Pebble Beach course after firing a 6-under 65 without any bogeys.  It was the lowest U.S. Open score for a round ever shot at Pebble Beach.  Woods will try to extend that one stroke lead today.  Sounds like lots of folks were shooting it well. 

 Well, the world`s top golfers are teeing up at the U.S. open this weekend, and in many cases, the driver of choice will be the Callaway Golf club.  Since 1982, Callaway and its golf clubs and now balls have been fixtures along the PGA Tour, and this year will be no exception. As a public company, Callaway`s stock has fared well, peaking near $21 a share just last month.  And that makes Callaway Golf our "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER (voice-over):  The dashing duffer who created Callaway Golf built his company on these steel magnolias.  The popular Big Bertha drivers and woods account for 60 percent of Callaway`s sales.  The company also manufactures irons, Odyssey brand putters, and now golf balls. 

 Last year, the company brought in $715 million on sales of 5 1/2 million golf clubs, that is more than its next three competitors combined. After spending $170 million to build its ball factory, Callaway expects sales of its golf balls to reach $50 to $70 million this year. 

 Keeping management`s eye on the ball will be crucial for Callaway.  A slowing U.S. market and the Asian economic crisis derailed its growth back in 1998.  Sales fell dramatically, and Callaway was forced to slice 700 jobs and prices on its clubs. 

 But the company has since staged an impressive comeback, recently beating the Street`s earnings estimate by 69 percent in the latest quarter. All of this has landed Callaway`s stock back on the fairway. Shares are up 59 percent since hitting a near-term low of $11 back in February, thanks in part to a $100 million stock buyback. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  All right, and there you see Callaway Gold trading a sixteenth at 17 1/2. 

 For more, we are joined now by Joseph Yurman.  He is the leisure products analyst, what a great job to have, at Bear Stearns here in New York. 

 And Joe, welcome for being on IN THE MONEY. 

 JOSEPH YURMAN, BEAR STEARNS:  Thanks, Bill. 

 TUCKER:  Let`s start with the fact that you are kind of lukewarm on them because, if I read your research right, you think they have peaked out in terms of price. 

 YURMAN:  Short-term I`d put it.  Longer term we definitely believe that they are the category killer, their brand alone kind of sets them apart.  Shorter term, however, we felt that the stock got a little bit over its heels.  They announced a share buyback on May 4, and we kind of viewed that as the catalyst for the up move. 

 So when it hit 20 we didn`t see any visible growth drivers in place. So we decided to adopt kind of a wait-and-see attitude. 

 TUCKER:  This is kind of an off-the-wall question, but I started wondering if Tiger Woods might represent the biggest threat to them because he endorses other products that compete against Callaway Golf, and if he begins doing well, does that hurt Callaway? 

 YURMAN:  Well, shot 6-under yesterday, but I think any golfer knows that he could probably hit 6-under with a rock.  We really kind of break that into two different tranches.  You have the consumer who will just pretty much go out and buy anything with a brand name, and we think that Nike has the potential to share -- steal some share in that case. However, your really avid golf is pretty loyal to their products, Callaway clubs, Footjoy shoes.  So we really see a bifurcated market there, and don`t necessarily think that it is going to spell doom for Callaway in any stretch. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Joe, thank you very much.  Joseph Yurman, he is the leisure products analyst at Bear Stearn, thanks for being on IN THE MONEY. 

 YURMAN:  Thanks, Bill. 

 KEENAN:  OK, you have now heard everything about Callaway Golf.  Go to the bottom of our Web page and cast your vote. 

 Now, you told us what you thought about Heinz, the maker of tuna and ketchup was yesterday`s "Stock of the Day." Fifty-five percent of you voted to buy the stock, not enough to include it our portfolio.  That means that Heinz gets a thumbs down, and we are not going to add any to our portfolio. 

 TUCKER:  All right, let`s follow up on a story we talked about earlier this month.  A Boston-based financier has bought a piece of Boston Celtics history.  Bob Sager bid more than $330,000 for 16 panels of the famed Boston Garden`s parquet floor, including the part with the famous leprechaun logo on it.  The floor was built during World War II for $11,000.  That parquet floor carried the Celtics through 16 NBA championship.  Sections of it are being auctioned off on-line, but not that one anymore. 

 KEENAN:  No.  And still to come on IN THE MONEY:  Want a cheaper way to a create your own customized portfolio?  We`ll tell you how to get more bang for your buck. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 HEMMER:  I`m Bill Hemmer, live at the CNN Center in Atlanta.  We interrupt IN THE MONEY to bring you George W. Bush live in Canton, Ohio for a quick question-and-answer session here. 

 (JOINED IN PROGRESS) 

 GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  ... since the passage of the 1995 Safe Schools Act.  You heard me during the discussion talk about how the Passages School here reminds me some of the alternative school systems we`ve got in place in Texas.  And I`m pleased to say it`s working. 

 It`s very important for our classrooms to be safe and secure for -- so children can learn, but it`s also important that there be alternative settings for children to learn.  And that`s what we did in the state of the Texas and the results bear out a good, constructive program. 

 I want to thank the teachers for recognizing the progress being made, and I want to thank them for their hard work in the state of Texas and around the country. 

 I`ll be glad to answer questions. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, what could you do as president to help schools like this physically... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Free up money.  I`ve got -- I can`t remember the exact number - - $12 billion of additional increase in money over the next five years. Fund character education programs.  Free up the Century 21 program, so mentoring programs and faith-based programs can access the money to provide character education for children after school. 

 But the really best thing to do is to provide maximum flexibility so districts and states can design programs to conform to their specific needs. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, yesterday the vice president was challenged on high gas prices.  It`s now well over $2 a gallon around here. 

 BUSH:  Yes. 

 QUESTION:  Anything... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Well, you know, I think the thing -- I think the administration is doing the right thing to look at the cause of higher gas prices.  As I understand, this is an aberration, that most states don`t have the, you know, the high price that for some reason Ohio does.  I`d like to know the causes before I make a reaction to it. 

 I do know that there`s very little energy policy coming out of the current administration.  I find it amazing that the vice president, on the one hand, you know, goes to the state of Washington and Oregon, for example, and won`t tell us whether or not the administration will breach dams, which is a part of the source for energy in America, and on the other hand, you know, talks about the need to be independent for energy. There`s some contradictions within the administration about energy policy. 

 I think we ought to be exploring in ANWR.  I think we ought to not be destroying dams in eastern Oregon and eastern Washington. These are sources of good clean energy, and we`re energy deficient obviously today.  I think the -- we need to be working with our friends in OPEC to make sure that the price of crude oil, which doesn`t rise to continue to force the price of gasoline up, particularly as the summer season comes -- is upon us. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, polls -- there`s been some slight dip in the polls lately on the support for the death penalty, and there`s growing concerns about the number of convicts that may be being sentenced to death wrongfully.  As governor of a state that leads the country in capital punishment, do you think that this could hurt you in the election? 

 BUSH:  You mean taking a principled stand and not letting polls and focus groups determine what I believe?  No, I think people appreciate a leader who makes a stand based upon principle.  And the principle that I support is that if the death penalty is fairly administered, and there`s no question about innocence or guilty and it`s -- then I think people ought to be held accountable for their decisions they make.  And I think society would be a safer place for it. 

 QUESTION:  There`s been questions raised about the man who`s going to be executed next Thursday.  Do you have any doubt in your mind that he`s guilty? 

 BUSH:  I`m going to make -- I`m going to wait for the Board of Pardons and Paroles to decide, to make their recommendation.  I`m going to treat this case like every other case. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, has there been anything done in the last few months that`s given you any reason to reassess, even if you still feel the same way, your position on the death penalty?  Does the situation in Illinois, some of the reporting that`s been done about the representation of the people who are on death row in Texas, have you had any pause or any -- a moment to go back and re-examine your position in light of this even if you still feel the same way about it?  Or do you just remain confident that you know enough about the issue and... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Well, I know enough about each case that I analyze.  I take each case very seriously.  I look at the facts of each case.  I`m fully briefed by a staff of lawyers that have analyzed the case.  And I`m confident we have not put to death somebody who didn`t -- was innocent. And secondly, the reports about, you know, certain cases being thrown out on appeal, it shows the system is working. 

 And obviously the DNA issue`s an interesting issue.  There was some doubt in my mind as to the guilt of a particular person that just came up on death row, and we gave him a 30-day reprieve so that we could make sure as to whether or not the man committed the rape of the 12-year-old stepdaughter.  He was guilty of the murder of the 12-year- old stepdaughter. 

 And in my state of Texas, in order to be put to death -- it`s a capital-murder state, you have to be convicted of two offenses.  And the fundamental question is, did he rape the young girl?  The DNA proved he murdered the young girl.  And I felt like it was important for us to answer that question. 

 QUESTION:  The teachers union just did a survey, and the number one thing they`re all afraid of is the violence in the classroom, not having control over students and not being backed by the system to have that control.  What types of things do you think that you would offer to teachers in public schools where this has been... 

 BUSH:  Well, one, the understanding that the threats of a lawsuit oftentimes prevent teachers from maintaining discipline in the classroom, and I think there needs to be a federal liability law that says to teachers and principles who enforce reasonable standards of behavior and discipline in the classrooms you can`t be sued under civil rights statutes; and secondly is to provide flexibility with federal money coming down so that the states, if they feel like the need to develop an alternative school system, have got flexibility to do so. 

 But it`s up to the states to make these determinations.  This is a state issue as far as I`m concerned.  The federal government can fund schools.  As you notice, I talked about -- I mean, fund programs. But we`ve got to trust the people of Ohio to chart the path to excellence. 

 QUESTION:  Have you had a chance to look at Al Gore`s tax cut proposals?  What do you think about them? 

 BUSH:  Really risky.  No, just kidding.  I have not yet. 

 Somebody told me -- I think I read where, you know, they were running a series of focus groups, and so he made a decision to expand his vision on tax cutting because of focus groups. 

 Surely, America doesn`t want a focus group-driven presidency. America wants somebody that makes decisions based upon what`s right. 

 And what`s right is sharing some of the surplus with the people who pay the bills.  If you`re a family of four in the state of Ohio, under my plan you get a 50 percent cut; and you make $50,000 a year, you get a 50 percent cut in your federal income taxes.  There`s some principles in my plan that I think are every important. 

 The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody`s check -- that we ought to drop the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent, because the marginal tax rates on people who are on the outskirts of poverty is hire than someone who`s successful in society, and that`s not fair.  And I believe we ought to eliminate the death tax. 

 These are principled positions I`ve taken.  I`ve taken them ever since the campaign began.  And I don`t need a poll or focus group to tell me what to believe. 

 QUESTION:  Do you use focus groups, though, in... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  I don`t need a poll or focus group to tell me what to believe. 

 QUESTION:  But you use them in your campaign. 

 BUSH:  Maybe we are.  If they do, they haven`t bought the diagnosis to me. 

 It`s like this -- somebody said, "Did you poll the Social Security issue?"  And the answer is, absolutely not.  I`m doing the right thing on Social Security.  And if the American people don`t like my position, then they`ve got an alternative for -- to be the president.        But I believe it`s right to give younger workers the opportunity to invest some of their payroll taxes in the private sector, otherwise we won`t have a Social Security system.  We won`t have it conformed to the way it is today. It`s going to require either a massive tax increase or a major benefit reduction. 

 And so, you know, they make test ads in front of focus groups. But I don`t run a focus group, Robert, to tell me what to say and what to believe, and whether or not to expand my tax relief package or not. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, with respect to Governor Taft... 

 BUSH:  He`s a fine American. 

 QUESTION:  ... as you get closer to the Keystone State (inaudible) as a potential vice president.  Where do you stand on that? 

 BUSH:  This is a vice-presidency question?  It`s kind of an inside joke.  It`s all Candy (ph) seems to be able to talk about these day, in all due respect. 

 And by the way, I love you in yellow. 

 See, this is the way I try to avoid to answer your question. 

 The list?  I`m still going through the process.  I`m making progress. I talk to Dick Cheney on a regular basis.  I`m not going to tell you what I talk to him about except it`s the vice-presidency. And Tom Ridge is a good friend of mine.  I like him a lot, and he`s under consideration. 

 QUESTION:  Is there a short list that you might have or that Candy (ph) may have as far as potential nominees? 

 BUSH:  There is a list. 

 QUESTION:  Is Governor Ridge on it? 

 BUSH:  He`s being considered, yes. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, is Governor Taft on the list? 

 BUSH:  He took himself off. 

 STAFF:  Last question. 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Two. 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 BUSH:  As you know, I used the tax cut to do such that.  I mean, for example, education savings accounts is an integral part of my tax relief package.  And refundable tax credits for working uninsured are an integral part of my package.  Or allowing non-itemizers to deduct charitable gifts is a part of my package. 

 But I also believe that in order to have a tax relief package that encourages and stimulates economic growth, there ought to be a cut across the board as well.  Everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief. 

 So there`s obviously a difference of opinion.  He wants to target all his tax cuts; I want to give universal relief as well as, you know, encourage families to save for education purposes or to help the working uninsured. 

 QUESTION:  Could I just ask you, would the surplus -- apparently there are numbers coming out that show the surplus is a lot bigger than people thought.  Do you envision any changes in your plans to make anything larger or smaller?  What would you do... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  In a tax-relief package? 

 QUESTION:  In any of the packages that you advance... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Yes, I can`t imagine the tax relief package changing much. I told you this is going to be -- the plan I laid out in the primaries is the plan I was going to campaign on in the fall election.  I`m not one of these people that are kind of trying to chase public opinion. 

 But we`ll see, in terms of other things.  I mean, if not, the money can go to debt repayment. 

 Last question. 

 QUESTION:  On the adequacy of counsel question, if an innocent person has an inadequate lawyer and spends years either on death row or in prison before an appellate court lets him go, does the system not work against him?  I mean, is that really the system working when an inadequate lawyer... 

 BUSH:  It`s a very hypothetical.  Do you have a case in mind? 

 QUESTION:  The fellow who had his lawyer sleep through the trial. 

 BUSH:  Is there a question of his innocence and guilt?  You said if an innocent person... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Well... 

 QUESTION:  ... one, say, someone who -- I mean... 

 BUSH:  If you`re suggesting should a guilty person languish on death row, if that`s fair, I don`t think that is.  And that`s why, as you know, we passed a law to speed up the process, to make sure that the innocence and guilt and the full access to the courts were granted as quickly as possible. 

 But the man you`re talking about, I`m not so sure I... 

 QUESTION:  I didn`t have him specifically in mind. 

 BUSH:  OK. 

 QUESTION:  I`m talking about the general issue of -- there is a question about at least a third of the lawyers who handle death row cases... 

 BUSH:  In Texas? 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 BUSH:  Well, Archie (ph), I think we better find out the facts before we speculate out loud.  The only thing I can tell you is, every case that I`ve reviewed, I`ve been comfortable with the innocence or guilt of the person that I`ve looked at.  And I do not believe we`ve put a guilty --I mean, an innocent person to death in the state of Texas. 

 Last question. 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 BUSH:  Next to last question. 

 I`ll let you know after the pardons and parole board. 

 QUESTION:  Governor, there`s been some talk you`re going to have a committee to go over the vice presidential prospects.  Do you think it`s going to be much more of personal decision... 

 (CROSSTALK) 

 BUSH:  Yes, there`s no committees. 

 QUESTION:  Is it you and Mr. Cheney? 

 BUSH:  Yes, somebody said we`re running focus groups to determine who the vice president ought to be.  Forget it, it`s not happening. This decision process is about how I make decisions. 

 BUSH:  And I`m a good decider, I know how to make decisions. 

 QUESTION:  (OFF-MIKE) 

 BUSH:  Because it`s going to be my vice president, and, again, I don`t need a committee to figure out who is best to be the vice president. And I`m going to take my time, and I`m going to decide, and I`ll make a good decision.  And I haven`t decided yet. 

 My body language would probably be different if I decided. You`ll be able to detect it right off the bat.  And then you`ll be saying, you`ve decided but you won`t tell.  And nor have I decided when I`m going to announce.  I`m going to take my time and make a very thorough decision. Well, it`s always a pleasure.  See you later. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER: We`ll talk about a new way to invest and that involves Foliofn.com. A little bit difficult sometimes in investing and investors often times to turn to mutual funds. But our next guest Steve Wallman is a man who is on a mission to make you change your mind. And joins us now form Washington. Steve, thank you for being here. 

 STEVE WALLMAN, CEO FOLIOFN.COM: Thank you very much. Appreciate it. 

 TUCKER:  It`s interesting that you raise this issue of mutual funds, Jack Vogle over at Vanguard Fund on the program a couple of weeks ago raising a number of issues about the mutual fund industry saying in fact they`ve become a marketing business in stead of an investment business. I suspect you would agree with him on that. 

 WALLMAN: Jack is somebody I respect a tremendous amount. He really is one of my heroes. I think mutual funds have actually been one of the greatest contributors to  allowing the average investor in this country to obtain a diversified portfolio by buying into a mutual fund. But then what foliofn.com does is go to the  new level and all someone to in essence buy diversified portfolio stocks and directly own them. And that gives an investor terrific tax advantage, performance capable advantages, lowest cost, and may even provide a higher return because of lower fees overall. 

 TUCEKR: You`ve called the mutual funds the biggest rip off in American finance because they don`t disclose the cost to investors, right? 

 WALLMAN: Actually it`s that the lack of disclosure was unfortunately one of the rip offs where people are not understanding how much a mutual fund really costs. The average mutual fund has a fee an annual expense of about 1.25 percent or so. And when you multiple that by $30000 sort of an average amount that mutual fund investor might hold in funds, you are talking about paying close to $400 a year. 

 TUCKER: But how do you change that? What is foliofn bring in that changes that? 

 WALLMAN: We have a different way of investing. For one thing, what we allow people to do is to customize and buy their own portfolio, And we do it at a flat fee. We charge just $29.95 a month. And for that you can in essence buy and sell twice a day ever day up to 150 stocks if you wanted to do in 3 different folios. We  not expect that`s what people will do . What we think people will do is what we were finding they are doing. Which is they`re going  on our site and they`re buying the Internet folio or the biotech folio and they`re doing it with one click. And they`re doing it simply and easily. It`s a much easier way for people to invest than what`s currently available to them. 

 TUCKER: And what do they cost related to your funds, the foliofn? 

 WALLMAN: Just the flat $29.95. We charge no commissions. We charge no asset base fee. That`s all there is. It`s very simple costs. But in terms of that, what people also get that they can`t through other vehicles whether exchange traded funds, mutual funds or other kinds of vehicles like that is because they directly own the underlying stocks they can do very useful tax planning things at the end of the year. Your whole portfolio may go up in terms of value. But a few stocks may actually go down in value. And what you might want to be there for is sell the ones that have gone down, be able to get cash out and actually take a capital lost that you can use to offset capital gains somewhere else, something you can`t do with any other kind of vehicle. 

 TUCKER: And the web address is foliofn.com, correct? 

 WALLMAN: Correct. 

 TUCKER: All right. Steve, thank you very much. Steve Wallman, foliofn.com. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER: S sounds like a segue into Andy Serwer once again. Andy, welcome back wearing the Father`s Day tie. . SERWER: This tie,  I got to tell you did not cost me $185. This tie was made by my daughter last year, in her nursery school. And I got it for free, and  I think it`s pretty styling. What do you all think? 

 TUCKER:  I like it. 

 KEENAN: I think it`s pretty nice. Why didn`t you wear it in the beginning of the show? You just changed. 

 SERWER: You are right, I mean maybe didn`t go so well with the stripes, Terry. You know about that stuff better than I do. But anyway so I decided to trot it out today. 

 TUCKER: Excellent. 

 KEENAN: And you also wanted to talk about a very famous CEO and his father. 

 SERWER: Kind of an interesting story. I recently went down to West Virginia, with John Chambers the CEO of Cisco, of course to visit his ancestral home to visit his parents. There he is with mom and dad. That`s John in the middle, and his dad and his mom are right there with him. And, an interesting story, John is very close to his father. And he told a story about when he was young boy fishing with his dad in the streams of West Virginia. Fly fishing can be kind of treacherous. And he slipped and fell, and he was going down the stream and possibly drowning. His  father said, hang on to that fishing pole, hang on to that pole. So he hung on to the pole really tight. And his father was able to run downstream and actually pull him out. And he couldn`t figure out why his dad told him to hang on to the rod until later on in life and he realized that his dad was telling him that so he wouldn`t panic, to have him concentrate on the rod. And Chambers said he really learned how to trust his dad, based on that experience. And trust has become such a big part of his life and uses it in business a lot.

 Wachovia Corp. (WB/NYSE), down US$13 1/8 to US$57 1/8, on volume of 4.9 million shares. 

 The third-largest regional bank in the U.S. Southeast saw its shares plunge yesterday after it issued a profit warning. 

 The bank, long seen as a conservative bet during uncertain times, said it was unlikely to meet analysts' expectations for the second quarter and for the year, as rising interest rates slashed the spreads it earns on loans as well as income from its capital markets, mortgage and investment businesses. 

 Wachovia was expected to earn US$1.34 a share in the second quarter and US$5.46 a share for the year, according to First Call-Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' estimates. 

 --- 

 Imagis Technologies Inc. (NAB/ CNDX), up 20 cents to $3.80, on volume of 75,400 shares. 

 The Vancouver-based maker of software for the criminal justice system said it had received three new orders for its biometric face-recognition software from police departments in California. 

 Iain Drummond, chief executive, said the West Covina police, just east of Los Angeles, had installed Imagis' ID-2000 face recognition software to complement Imagis' CABS arrest & booking system, which had been in use for more than a year. 

 The El Segundo police, in Los Angeles county, and the La Habra Police, in Orange county, had purchased both the CABS system and the ID-2000, he said. 

 --- 

 International Properties Group Ltd. (IPX/TSE), up 15 cents to $2.30, on volume of 191,023 shares. 

 The Calgary-based real estate firm, which owns or manages 62 properties with 8,394 condominiums, said its U.S. InvestorPlus.com subsidiary is in talks with a third party to secure a financing. 

 InvestorPlus.com's virtual apartment building concept enables clients to create geographically diverse portfolios of investment properties in high-growth and emerging markets. 

 --- 

 Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM/NASDAQ), down US$9 1/16 to US$61 7/16, on volume of 60.9 million shares. 

 Shares in the maker of chips and other technology for wireless phones slumped as much as 14% following a 13% dip on Wednesday, after reduced sales expectations in South Korea and China prompted a second analyst to cut the company's earnings forecast. 

 Edward Snyder, an analyst at Chase H&Q, trimmed his earnings per share target for the quarter ending Sept. 24 to US28 cents, from US31 cents. A day earlier, Wojtek Uzdelewicz, of Bear Stearns & Co., cut his fiscal 2000 profit estimate to US$1.05 a share from US$1.08.

 Dow tumbles as blue-chip shares hurt by Xerox  profit warning ; Nasdaq rises

 NEW YORK (AP) - Blue-chip stocks fell steeply Friday after Xerox and a regional banking company issued profit warnings that resonated throughout the market. The Dow Jones industrial average sustained its biggest selloff in two months amid fears that rising interest rates will take a toll on corporate profits. 

 Technology stocks were a lone source of strength, helping the Nasdaq finish with modest gains. 

 Driven down by financial components including American Express and J.P. Morgan, the Dow plunged 265.52 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 10,449.30. It was the Dow's worst performance since its stunning 617-point drop on April 14. 

 Friday's decline left the Dow with a loss of 164.76 points for the week. 

 Broader stock indicators held up much better than the blue-chip Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14.27 to close at 1,464.46, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 14.82 to 3,860.56. 

 Financial stocks pulled the market lower Friday after UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in San Francisco, lowered its second-quarter earnings projection, sending its stock down $8.75 to $19.938. 

 The warning from UnionBanCal came a day after Wachovia, a North Carolina banking company, delivered similar bad news. Both banks have begun setting aside additional money to cover bad loans. 

 A recent research note from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston raised the possibility that many other banks will follow, depressing the entire sector. Mellon fell $3.063 to $33.938 and Bank of America dropped $5.563 to $46.50. 

 Larger banks and brokerages also tumbled. J.P. Morgan fell $8.375 to $118.125, contributing most to the Dow's decline. 

 "There's not a great fundamental reason for the whole sector to be down so much," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co. "But it's a momentum-driven sector, and some people obviously feel that profits are going to come under pressure." 

 An additional sign that profits are being threatened came from Xerox Corp., which fell $4.75 to $20.563 after the office machine maker said its second-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street analysts' estimates. 

 As has been the case all week, stocks were being pulled in different directions Friday. Technology stocks showed some scattered strength. Qualcomm was up $4.313 to $65.75, bouncing higher after two days of steep losses. 

 And semiconductor company Rambus soared $25.50 to $82.188 after signing a licensing deal with Japanese consumer electronics company Toshiba Corp. The deal will boost Rambus's revenue. 

 "Something to take heart in is that the Nasdaq is hanging in there even after it's risen substantially in the past two weeks," Hogan said. "That's a testament to improving sentiment." 

 Analysts said many investors are still waiting to see whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its June 28 meeting. 

 "We are not in a dramatic upturn that we saw earlier this year or the slump that happened last month. We are just kind of paralyzed," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 

 Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts' estimates. 

 The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into demand. That's a direct result of the Fed's six inflation-fighting rate increases over the last year. 

 A growing number of analysts believe the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged when its meets June 27 and 28. But the view is not unanimous and some analysts say the Fed may still feel that more needs to be done to make sure inflation is not revived. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.43 billion shares, compared with 1.12 billion shares on Thursday. 

 The so-called "triple-witching" day - marking the quarterly expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts - contributed to the higher volume. 

 The Russell 2000 index was up 1.49 at 513.74. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.9 percent.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks were mixed Friday, with blue-chip stocks falling steeply after Xerox and a regional banking company issued profit warnings. Technology shares were modestly higher. 

 With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 148.85 at 10,565.97. 

 Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 8.47 at 1,470.13, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 17.08 at 3,862.82. 

 As has been the case all week, stocks were being pulled in different directions Friday, with many investors waiting to see if slowing economic growth is hurting corporate profits and whether the Federal Reserve once more raises interest rates. 

 "This market is moving laterally right now. We are not in a dramatic upturn that we saw earlier this year or the slump that happened last month. We are just kind of paralyzed," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities. 

 Some signs that profits are under pressure came on Friday. Shares of Xerox Corp. fell $4.50 to $20.813 after the office machine maker said its second-quarter earnings would fall short of Wall Street analysts' estimates. 

 Also Friday, UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in San Francisco, lowered its second-quarter earnings projection, sending its stock down $8.75 to $19.875. That came a day after Wachovia, a respected banking company based in North Carolina, warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest rates. 

 Financial services stocks, especially those in the banking sector, were rocked again Friday by the weak profit outlook. Mellon fell $3 to $34 and Bank of America dropped $3.813 to $48.25. 

 Larger banks and brokerages also tumbled. J.P. Morgan was down $6.938 at $119.563, contributing most to the Dow's decline. 

 Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts' estimates. 

 The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into demand. That's a direct result of the Fed's six inflation-fighting rate increases over the last year. 

 A number of recent economic reports - including home sales, factory orders, retail sales and unemployment - indicate the economy is cooling down. Given that, a growing number of analysts believe the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged when its meets June 27 and 28. But the view is not unanimous and some analysts say the Fed may still feel that more needs to be done to make sure inflation is not revived. 

 Technology stocks showed some scattered strength. Qualcomm was up $4 to $65.438, bouncing higher after two days of steep losses. 

 And semiconductor company Rambus soared $26.563 to $83.25 after signing a licensing deal with Japanese consumer electronics company Toshiba Corp. The deal will boost Rambus's revenue. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 886.93 million shares by late afternoon, well ahead of 771.77 million shares on Thursday. 

 The so-called "triple-witching" day - marking the quarterly expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts - contributed to the higher volume. 

 The Russell 2000 index was up 0.30 at 512.55.

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE: tech stocks back in favor on Wall Street, Lucent lights up on reports of a possible spin-off, but bank stocks are battered. 

 One big tech exception: Qualcomm (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) crushed again, the high-flyer of `99 takes another step back in 2000 as a second analyst slashes the company`s profit outlook. 

 And just as Coke (URL: http://www.cocacola.com/) settles one discrimination suit, it gets slapped with another. Why Johnnie Cochran is taking on an American icon. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Willow Bay. 

 BAY: Good evening, everyone. Stuart is off tonight. 

 Technology stocks and the new economy triumphed today on Wall Street. Investors picked up computer and Internet-related names and dumped financial and interest-rate sensitive stocks after a report on factory production showed surprising strength. But aside from economic news, the day was marked by a handful of corporate bombshells. 

 Greg Clarkin reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Overall, it was quiet day on Wall Street, but behind the calm, some dramatic hits and misses. The Dow posted a modest gain of 26 points for the session; the Nasdaq fared better, gaining 48. 

 In a sea of winners, there was at least one high-tech nightmare: Qualcomm shares were crushed after an analyst said he sees no good news for the company in the immediate future. But Lucent jumped on reports it`s moving ahead with the spin-off of its microelectronics business. Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Intel also gained. 

 Another nightmare, this time in the banking business: Wachovia (URL: http://www.wachovia.com/) warning that higher interest rates will mean lower earnings. Wachovia plunged and other financials fell as well, including Dow stock J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) . Also losing ground, Bank of New York (URL: http://www.bankofny.com/) , Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) and Bank of America (URL: http://www.bankamerica.com/) . 

 Despite the quiet trading of recent days, stock watchers are encouraged by some trends. 

 BERNADETTE MURPHY, KIMELMAN & BAIRD: Right now, surprisingly enough, the New York Composite, which is all stocks listed on the stock exchange, is in the plus column for the year to date and is ahead of the S&P 500 and, of course, the Dow, which is down, and so that might mean that investors are starting to spread their money around into other industries. 

 CLARKIN: Overall, traders say investors are content to sit and wait to see the outcome of the Federal Reserve`s meeting in late June. 

 GREGG HYMOWITZ, ENTRUST CAPITAL: It`s really a matter of what you perceive to be the outcome of the economy in the sense that, does the Fed slam on the brakes too hard, in which case you get a hard landing. If you get a hard landing, there is very few stocks you really want to own. You really have to become defensive, you have to own foods --food stocks, drug stocks, really defensive names. To the extent the Fed is able to navigate a soft landing, then you could be a little broader in what you wanted to own. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: But many here don`t expect to see trading with any real conviction until the Fed meets, and possibly even beyond that. They`re saying they want to get a look at quarterly earnings reports before making any big moves -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg, how severe was that profit warning for Wachovia? 

 CLARKIN: It was pretty severe, Willow. That is such a touchy sector, obviously tied in so heavily to interest rates. Any time you get a major bank, a regional bank saying that their numbers are going to be weaker because of rising rates, well, that set off a real shiver through the financial industry, and we saw banks pretty much of every size as well as the money center banks and even brokerage houses all  effected. 

 BAY: Greg Clarkin, thank you. 

 CLARKIN: Sure. 

 BAY: Taking a closer look now at today`s markets: the S&P 500 index rose 8 points, it is now in the plus column for the year. Still, more stocks fell than rose on the big board today, 73 stocks hit new 52-week highs; 51 hit new lows. In the Treasury market, the 10-year note ended the day unchanged, the yield at 6.04 percent; the 30-year bond lost a quarter of a point, the yield tonight at 5.92 percent. 

 Bond prices dropped immediately after a report showed unexpected strength at the nation`s factories last month. Industrial output jumped for the 17th straight month in May, blindsiding economists who expected to see a slowdown. 

 Kitty Pilgrim has the story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Factories are running at a good clip, with output in May up .4 percent. That was a big surprise. Economists were actually looking for a drop-off of .3 percent. 

 BILL HORNBERGER, A.G. EDWARDS: It`s really the first piece of data we`ve seen above consensus in three or four weeks. You know, most of the data that we`ve seen in the last month or so has come in on, you know, the softer side, below consensus, arguing that, you know, maybe there is the beginnings of a slowdown in terms of economic activity. 

 PILGRIM: Some sectors in the report showed weakness: autos, consumer durables such as appliances, and construction materials. But energy components were higher -- as might be expected -- and so was technology. 

 Adding today, to the picture of health in the economy were the employment data: fewer people lined up for unemployment last week; 296,000 filed new claims for benefits. Anything below 300,000 suggests a labor market that remains very tight. 

 But today`s evidence of economic strength follows an array of weak reports. And industrial production as an economic indicator is not as important as other factors. For example, housing, retail sales, factory orders all say more about the day-to-day economy. 

 LYNN REASER, BANK OF AMERICA ASSET MGMT.: The industrial sector is only one part of the economy and it really has never been the area that has caused all of the overheating. The major threat in the economy had been more on the service side. 

 PILGRIM (on camera): Tomorrow`s economic report, housing starts, will hold more weight with economists. The housing sector is more subject to interest rate changes and has more trickle-down influence on other sectors of the economy. 

 Kitty Pilgrim, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE: Word of a possible spin-off for Lucent`s (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) laser and chip unit fires up the stock. We`ll tell  you what the company is saying and what is at stake if a deal goes through. 

 Plus, Heinz posts a tasty profit, but does it have the ingredients for a 

 long-term rise? We`ll ask the CEO, William Johnson. 

 And as it settles one discrimination suit, Coke finds itself grappling with another. We`ll tell you why a lawyer who`s become a household name is challenging one of corporate America`s icons. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: More on the big move now in Lucent stock, shares took off even as Lucent officially declined to comment on reports it may spin off its microelectronics unit. Embattled Lucent gained more than $3.25, or 6 percent. 

 Bruce Francis reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street is cheering the idea that Lucent may spin-off its microelectronics unit, which makes specialized chips for telecommunications. That fast- growing business could be worth $40 billion or more, analysts say, and has a wide customer base beyond Lucent. 

 JIM KEDERSHA, SG COWEN SECURITIES: I think it would be a very good thing for Lucent. The microelectronics group at Lucent is a major part of the company, but I think it`s being undervalued right now by the stock market. Lucent has -- even though they`re a major player in telecom equipment -- the largest -- they`ve been plagued by some execution issues. 

 FRANCIS: That`s putting in mildly. Back in January, Lucent warned that it would miss Wall Street expectations. The stock lost almost $50 billion in market value in a single session, and has struggled to regain its status as a tech stock star. The stock began something of a recovery, as the company announced a series of moves starting in March. 

 First, a spin-off of its Enterprise Systems unit, which sells telecom equipment to big businesses. Then, the company decided to put its power supply division up for sale. That business, which makes devices to keep the juice flowing in everything from cell phones to big network switches, hasn`t found a buyer yet. And Lucent said it would outsource it non-core manufacturing, all in the past three months. A spin-off of its microelectronics business, some say, would be a logical  next step. 

 ARIANE MAHLER, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON: Lucent lately has been moving towards a horizontal business model, where they outsource more and more, and strike contracts with the likes of JDS Uniphase (URL: http://www.jdsunph.com/) , they don`t need to rely on their own component makers so much, and frankly, they are unlocking a ton of a value for shareholders by spinning off microelectronics. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: This potential move would make the paired-down Lucent more of a pure play on its business selling equipment to telecom companies, like its new $1.5 billion deal with Verizon, the former Bell Atlantic Mobile -- Willow. 

 BAY: Bruce, clearly in the short term, it would boost the stock. But are there any concerns that it would weaken Lucent in the long term? 

 FRANCIS: There are some synergies that could be lost between owning one of your big suppliers, the microelectronics unit, and putting those chips into equipment that Lucent makes. You might not get an early first look at the best new equipment. And of course there`s the Bell Labs that Lucent is built around. If that gets split up, that might not make Bell Labs quite the engine of innovation that it has been over the past few years. 

 BAY: Is a spin-off here likely? 

 FRANCIS: I think it looks good. Of course, this unit is at the intersection of telecom and semiconductors, something that Wall Street really likes right now, despite the virtual shutdown of the capitol market. And long term, it could be very good for this spun-off unit, if that does happen. After all, it was great for Lucent to get spun off from AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) . It opened up to a wider customer base. Analysts say that could happen for this company should it be spun off. 

 BAY: Bruce Francis, thanks. 

 The legal battle continues in the Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) case. In its latest legal brief, Microsoft told a federal appeals court today, the 19 states who were party to the government`s antitrust victory are not allowed to take their case straight to the Supreme Court. Microsoft says only the U.S. government is entitled to that kind of direct appeal, and the stakes must remain at the appeals court level for now. 

 If Microsoft wins this point, the Supreme Court could turn down the case, knowing that the same issues were already being heard by the lower court. Stand by for the next paper salvo, since the government is sure to respond. Shares of Microsoft up nearly 2 today. 

 Checking tonight`s MONEYLINE "Movers," Conexant Systems (URL: http://www.conexant.com/) jumped 6 1/2, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (URL: http://www.msdw.com/) upgrading it to a strong buy  with a $100 price target. Osicom Technologies (URL: http://www.osicom.com/) plunged more than 16, the biggest percentage loser on the Nasdaq. The maker of optical networks posted a greater than expected first quarter loss because of declining sales. And Nortel Networks gained nearly 3. Bear Stearns (URL: http://www.nortelnetworks.com/) shares are up 34 percent year-to-date. 

 Heinz shares edged higher today after the company posted earnings in line with expectations. It`s one of the most exciting times in the otherwise quiet food business, as a wave of consolidation and  deal- making sweep the industry. And today, Heinz president and CEO Bill Johnson said he`d like to enter the fray. Well, he joins us now. 

 Bill, welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 WILLIAM JOHNSON, CEO, H.J. HEINZ: Thank you very much. BAY: I believe you said that you`re going to be an active player in transforming the food industry. So what is Heinz`s strategy? 

 JOHNSON: Well, I think you have to look at it in a couple of ways. Clearly, there`s going to be consolidation in the industry as the Unilever  (URL: http://www.unilever.com/) -Bestfoods (URL: http://www.bestfoods.com/) deal shows, as the sale on Nabisco shows, and there are a number of other smaller transactions in place. What we will do is participate, in one way or the other, through some kind of consolidation, or pick up the pieces of a consolidation. 

 BAY: All right, one way or another: buyer, seller. 

 JOHNSON: You never know, could be whatever`s beneficial to our shareholders. 

 BAY: Now, Bestfoods reportedly considered some alternatives to Unilever. Heinz was among the names mentioned. Would that have been a deal that fit your strategy? 

 JOHNSON: Well, I certainly wouldn`t have wanted to get in the way between Unilever and Bestfoods. I think it probably would have been not in the best interest of our shareholders. So, I think at this time, it would not have been in our interests. But there are plenty of others out there. 

 BAY: What about a Nabisco (URL: http://www.nabisco.com/) ? 

 JOHNSON: Well, Nabisco is a great company, with great brands, and businesses that growing rapidly, and would be of great appeal to us, but again, we don`t comment specifically what we`re going to do. Just stand by. 

 BAY: Stand by, OK. But does this wave of consolidation then put pressure on other companies in the food industry to get a deal of their own done? 

 JOHNSON: No, I think we`re growing pretty well on our own. If you look at our business over the last three years and you take out the effects of currency and divestitures, we`ve grown our top line at seven percent a year. So, we don`t need consolidation. We don`t need to do anything. We can go very much a standalone basis and still create  a lot of shareholder value. 

 BAY: You met earnings estimates. You had a 5 percent jump, as I understand it now, helped by ketchup sales. I notice you have a ketchup bottle on there. 

 JOHNSON: That`s right. 

 BAY: Does that mean more people were buying ketchup or more people were buying your ketchup? 

 JOHNSON: Both. Clearly, more people are buying our ketchup. Our shares were up all over the globe. The category is growing all over the globe. We`re appealing to teens and to kids, which is really the great trend now, how they were seen emerging in food shopping. So our ketchup business is just really on fire. 

 BAY: All right, speaking of trends, this is one that you believe is the wave of future. It is tuna in a pouch. I have to say it got a ton of reaction in our office today, not all of it positive. Why are folks going to like this? It looks kind of weird. 

 JOHNSON: Well, I think they`re going to like it because there`s no drain, there`s no odor, there`s no mess, there`s no hassle. Once you use this product, you`ll never go back to the can. 

 BAY: We`ll see. Thank you very much for joining us. 

 JOHNSON: You`re welcome. Thank you. 

 BAY: Still ahead on MONEYLINE, a surprise announcement from the man guiding Al Gore`s White House run. We`ll tell you about the changes in store for the vice president`s campaign in our "News Digest." 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: These stocks hit 52-week lows today, including American Eagle, Outfitters -- sorry, American Eagle Outfitters (URL: http://www.ae-outfitters.com/) -- Del Monte Foods (URL: http://www.delmonte.com/) , iVillage (URL: http://www.ivillage.com/) , Loral Space & Communications (URL: http://www.loral.com/) , and Sabre Group (URL: http://www.sabre.com) . 

 It`s peak season for driving, and gas prices are typically sky-high during the summer. But this year, prices are particularly steep, with drivers in Chicago forking over more than $50 to fill up their gas-guzzling SUVs. 

 Government officials are now scrambling to figure out exactly why prices are surging, as Fred Katayama reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Gas prices keep rocketing higher. A gallon of regular unleaded gas today set motorists back $1.59 in Los Angeles and $2.33 in Chicago, the highest nationwide. The Midwest is 

 being hit the hardest, and cab drivers and motorists are fuming. 

 GEORGE INKETSIAH, TAXI DRIVER: We are having a very bad time, because once upon a time, it took about $14 to $15 to fill this cab, but now, it takes about $30 and over. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If I have to drive to St. Louis, I might consider flying now. It`s cheaper to fly than it is to drive. 

 KATAYAMA: And so Illinois Governor George Ryan is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend its new cleaner gas rules that he says have fueled the higher prices. 

 GOV. GEORGE RYAN, ILLINOIS GOVERNOR: The prices went sky high on June 1, and that`s when the new regulations were changed by the EPA. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We need an explanation why that`s occurring. Our investigation, our meetings with the petroleum companies have provided no reasonable answer. 

 KATAYAMA: The EPA`s new regulations for reformulated gas, analysts estimate, add 3 to 7 cents a gallon. 

 Oil analysts say pipeline problems in the Midwest have further tightened the gas supply. And today, President Clinton asked the transportation department to look into those supply problems. One solution pitched in the past is loosening restrictions on truckers` hours so more gas can be hauled into the region. Oil experts say other factors driving up prices nationwide include the spike in crude oil prices, the summer driving season, and the reluctance of some refiners to produce cleaner gas because they fear they would infringe on a patent held by Unocal (URL: http://www.unocal.com/) . 

 This week, the Federal Trade Commission began looking into whether anti-competitive practices such as price fixing and collusion are contributing to higher prices. 

 (on camera): Despite the spike, when adjusted for inflation, a gallon of gas today still costs 95 cents less than it did when prices peaked in 1981. 

 Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BAY: Crude oil prices rose slightly today, as traders questioned whether OPEC will increase production to lower prices. Light Sweet Crude gained ten cents to settle at $32.95 a barrel. 

 A dramatic change revamping today for the Al Gore`s campaign staff. More on that now from Joie Chen in Atlanta in tonight`s "MONEYLINE News News Digest." -- Joie. 

 JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Willow, thanks. The chairman of Al Gore`s presidential campaign announced today that he is stepping down for health reasons, he said. Tony Coelho, who himself took over the campaign nearly a year ago, will be replaced by commerce secretary William Daley. Despite the change in staff, Gore says it is business as usual. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bill is a great leader, and Tony was a great leader. Bill will bring his own style to the campaign. And but as far as the direction and the focus of campaign, it will be the same. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 CHEN: Meanwhile, George W. Bush is campaigning again after a five-day break in Maine. He launched a 72-hour fundraising drive and proposed a plan worth $880 million to help the disabled. 

 Also today, the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez asked a federal court to reverse a decision which might allow the Cuban boy to return home. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled two weeks ago that Immigration officials could deny Elian an asylum hearing, which was requested by relatives. In Colorado, two massive wildfires are spreading. They have already devastated over 13,000 acres. High winds and scorching temperatures are raising the pressure on firefighters. And in Northern California, at least two deaths are being blamed on record high temperatures. Power supplies are expected to be pushed to their limit again today, following blackouts last night. 

 Finally this hour, in the U.S. Open, Tiger Woods holds the lead at this hour. He`s currently six under par, a stroke up on the field. I`ll have those stories and much more ahead on THE WORLD TODAY, coming up at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific. 

 In our "Tech Watch" tonight, new evidence of sampling music on the Web could actually help conventional CD sales, despite earlier surveys to the contrary. That word from a survey by Yankovich (ph) Partners, commissioned by the Digital Media Association, a Web music industry group. After hearing music streamed radio style, 33 percent of the respondents said they`d be more likely to buy CDs in stores, and after downloading songs from the Web, 31 percent would be inclined to spend money on CDs. Nearly 70 percent of the consumers questioned said hearing a song online has led them to buy that song on CD or cassette at least once. 

 Up next, hedge fund legend George Soros says he wants to play it safe. His plan when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Financier George Soros says he`s almost done overhauling his world famous hedge fund group, a transition he started in April after his funds took huge losses in technology stocks. His new flagship fund will be called the Quantum Endowment Fund. It`s set to debut on July 1, with assets of around $6.5 billion. Once known for its stunning returns, this fund will aim for steady returns of about 15 percent. Soros says this fund will invest more in real estate and private equity. When asked about the overhaul in London, the Hungarian-born Soros said -- quote -- "In my old age, I`ve become somewhat conservative. The perception was that I could move markets and that was to my benefit. The fact is that I can move markets, but it is to my detriment." 

 MONEYLINE will be back right after this. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: In tonight`s headlines: Wall Street sends techs back into the black. Sellers kept at bay, despite another disappointment for one of last year`s brightest stars. 

 It may be harder to make money, but Roger McNamee says there are bargains to be had. We`ll ask the technology bull what he`s buying now. 

 And more conflict at Coke. The soft-drink maker settles one discrimination suit, only to be hit with another. This one has Johnnie Cochran leading the charge. But first, more on our top story: a quantum leap out of Qualcomm. Investors bailed out of the telecom-equipment maker for the second straight day, as yet one more analyst decided to cut the company`s profit forecast. The stock slumped another $9 after falling nearly $11 yesterday. This week alone, Qualcomm shares have fallen 22 percent. 

 But Qualcomm wasn`t the only loser today. Allan Chernoff has more on a day of duds. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A humbling day for technology investors. The stock that was a metaphor for last year`s Nasdaq explosion, Qualcomm, imploded today, plunging 13 percent on three times its average volume. Qualcomm told investors that wireless-handset sales in Korea, a key market, are slowing. And there are further problems according to Chase H&Q 

 ED SNYDER, CHASE H&Q: China is not going to deploy Qualcomm`s technology. That seems to be clear at this point. So I think we`re -- they`re in for a bit of rough water certainly over the next quarter or so. 

 CHERNOFF: Even before today, Qualcomm stock had been in a dive, losing two-thirds of its value since the first trading day of the year. It`s the flip side of last year`s moon shot, when Qualcomm was a "wireless wonder," soaring from 28 1/2 exactly one year ago. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You can never sell at the top, can you? 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m very happy I didn`t buy it. 

 CHERNOFF: The lessons, say market technicians: Don`t try to catch a falling stone. 

 JEFFREY DEGRAAF, LEHMAN BROTHERS: The trend has been -- for the intermediate term -- has been down. And that, to us, has been the warning to stay clear of Qualcomm. As long as the trend`s down, as long as it`s making a series of lower lows and lower highs, in our opinion, that`s a situation from which we`re going to stay away from. 

 CHERNOFF: And there was more pain to be shared in the banking sector. Wachovia Corporation warned that earnings for the quarter and the year will fall below forecast, partly due to rising interest rates. 

 Investors worry Wachovia`s sneeze could turn into an industry cold, so they cashed out of big bank stocks. Wachovia lost 19 percent of its value today. Regionals like Union Planters (URL: http://www.unionplanters.com/) and Mellon Financial (URL: http://www.mellon.com/) were off 8 percent. 

 And another former tech high-flyer, CDnow (URL: http://www.cdnow.com/) , tumbled on news that one of its board members was resigning. True, the Dow and Nasdaq posted modest gains, but decliners beat advancers on both markets. It was a day for recognizing just how fickle Wall Street can be. (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: No one is actually questioning the quality of Qualcomm`s CDMA technology, same wireless protocol that investors were crazy about last year. But when a stock is priced for perfection, as Qualcomm surely was, there is no room for imperfection. Even after plunging today, the stock`s price earnings ratio is 81, about three times the market multiple -- Willow. 

 BAY: Allan Chernoff, thanks. 

 Today`s drop in Qualcomm only underscores how much the market has changed lately. Investors have become an unforgiving bunch, who are now taking even the slightest bad news as reason to sell. 

 Terry Keenan has more in tonight`s look "Behind the Numbers." 

 TERRY KEENAN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Willow, what a difference six months and a bare market in many Nasdaq stocks makes. Think back to late December. In the quiet holiday week before the millennium celebration, Walter Piecyk, a 28-year-old analyst at PaineWebber (URL: http://www.painewebber.com/) , set off some fireworks with an outrageous millennium prediction of his own, forecasting that Qualcomm stock would soar to $1,000 a share: $250 based on its subsequent four-for-one stock split. The audacious estimate set off a buying spree of mammoth proportions. Qualcomm stock soared more than $190 that day alone, a move that added $30 billion to Qualcomm`s market value. 

 Back then, Piecyk relied on the new math of the new economy in reaching his headline-grabbing target, and investors lapped it up. Rather than focusing on Qualcomm`s current business prospects, Piecyk took out his crystal ball and looked forward to the year 2010. He told me then an investor would be investing in future cash flow. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 WALTER PIECYK, PAINEWEBBER: The value in Qualcomm is the fact that their technology is going to be the technology of choice for the next decade. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 KEENAN: Fast forward to today. Qualcomm shares are trading 55 percent below where they were the day of Piecyk`s call, and today suffered another session of aggressive selling. The reason: for the second day in a row, an analyst cut earnings estimates for the next quarter and for the year. 

 It`s a stark reminder, says Chuck Hill of First Call, that we`re now in a market that is totally unforgiving. Forget the fluff, he says. Today`s investors want earnings that are up to snuff right now, not smoke-and-mirrors calculations based on business prospects a decade away. 

 Piecyk, by the way, was unavailable for an interview today, but he is clinging to his $250 share price target, although extending his time horizon out until June of 2001 -- Willow? 

 BAY: Terry, thanks. 

 Qualcomm`s quake didn`t spread to the rest of the markets today, as strong tech stocks helped boost both the Dow and the Nasdaq. The Dow industrials tacked on another 26 points today, after gaining 66 yesterday. The blue-chip average closed at 10,714. 

 Over on the Nasdaq, strength in computer and chip stocks helped push the composite index up 48 points to 3,845. 

 Checking some of the big movers: Lucent up more than 3 1/4, even after the company declined to comment on reports it may spin off its micro-electronics unit. 

 Other movers: Viacom (URL: http://www.viacom.com/) and Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) , up 3 1/2, while J.P. Morgan fell more  than 4 3/4. And General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) lost 2 1/2. 

 Unexpected strength at the nation`s factories weighed on bonds today. Industrial production jumped 0.4 percent in May, slowing from the revised 0.7 percent gain seen in April, but still higher than economists expected. Treasuries initially sold off on the news, but the 10-year recovered by the close to end unchanged. The 30-year: down eight tics. 

 Overall, it was a quiet day on Wall Street. But behind the calm, investors  have a lot on their minds. 

 Greg Clarkin is here with the details from the New York Stock Exchange --Greg. 

 CLARKIN: Hi there, Willow. 

 It was a day, really, of modest gains. And in speaking with many of the traders on the floor of the NYSE here this afternoon, they say that we`re looking at a market that really is just drifting, at this point, with no real defined moves. Now sure you had big moves in some individual issues today: Lucent, as you mentioned. Coca-Cola was also up nicely. 

 On the down side: Wachovia on its profit warning. But still, traders are here saying what they`re getting the sense is that a lot of folks, in their words, are just "sitting on their hands," waiting for a number of events to pass. 

 Now here are some of those key events that they`re focusing on: Tomorrow`s a "triple-witching" day here at the NYSE on the Big Board. And basically that just means the expiration -- simultaneous expiration --of options, futures, contracts, and the like. And yes, over the years this has become less of an event here and less volatility. But still it is an event, and these guys like to see events just past. So they`ll be watching that tomorrow carefully for any volatility that it may bring at the beginning of trading and at the close of trading. 

 And then the Fed meeting later in the month, and watching to see what Allan Greenspan does with interest rates. And then beyond that, they want to get a better sense of where corporate profits are going. So they`ll be looking for those second quarter earnings report in about three weeks or so. 

 Now a lot has been made of the volume recently. Just is it -- how much lighter is it than it had been in past? And they`re interesting numbers, once you look at them. The volume for first two weeks of June on the NYSE: about 900 million shares. Now compare that to March, when it was over one billion average daily volume. But if you go back to June of last year, it was just 733 million. So volume actually has increased year over year, but still it is down from the frenzy that we  saw back earlier in the year. And, Willow, it`s a similar pattern over on the Nasdaq as well. 

 BAY: Greg, thanks. 

 CLARKIN: Sure. 

 BAY: Coming up, how to make money in a market that feels like it`s going nowhere. Tech bull Roger McNamee is next here on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: If it seems that the Nasdaq is struggling to find direction, well, that`s because it is. In the last nine trading sessions, the Nasdaq has failed to follow through on a trend -- up one day, down the next. In the end, it`s gone nowhere. But our next guest says you can still make money in this market. He is Roger McNamee. 

 Roger, welcome. 

 ROGER MCNAMEE, INTEGRAL CAPITAL PARTNERS: Pleasure to be back. 

 BAY: So is it safe yet for investors to get back in to techs? 

 MCNAMEE: Well, I don`t think it`s ever safe to go back into tech stocks, but I do think that things have shaken out enough and prices have come down enough that there, in fact, some places to put money if you`re prepared to invest in a time horizon that I think is now measured in years rather than days or weeks. 

 I think it`s very important to get out of mindset of instant gratification and instant riches. But if you`re willing to do that, if you`re willing to think in terms of traditional rates of return, where 20 percent in a year seems like a really good rate of return, I think there`s  actually a lot of tech stocks that can provide you with above average rates of return going forward. 

 BAY: All right, so if we rid ourselves of those dreams of instant riches, can we suggest that we think that worse is over, that nightmare of plunges weaken, vanish to. 

 MCNAMEE: I wish I could say that that`s the case, but I`ll tell you, I learned years ago not to try to predict the future, and so it`s not at all obvious to me that the worst is over, but I could tell you that a bad thing has happened. 

 Any time you take a group like technology, which is, you know, 30 percent of the S&P 500, and bring it down roughly 50 percent on average, for the average stock, I mean, that seems to me to take a huge amount of risk out of the market. And it was a 30 percent relative correction in techs. So I think that for tech relative to the market, yes, the  worst is over. Whether you could say that for market as whole, I`m just not prepared to say, but I also don`t think it`s relevant. I think we just have to do our best from here. 

 BAY: Roger, let`s get your take on some names in the news, a stock you like, Microsoft. 

 MCNAMEE: Sure. 

 BAY: What should investors be worried about? A breakup, behavioral constraints or the cloud of the appeals process hanging over it? 

 MCNAMEE: I`m -- the latter is the one I`m worried about. If I were Microsoft, I would embrace this, not because it`s necessarily the best solution, but because I think it`s now politically impossible for government to do anything other than to pursue this to the end, and I think it`s really hurting Microsoft to continue to fight. I think breaking the company into two pieces, as proposed, would result in two very well-positioned companies, and as a consequence, investors would do very well, I think, to see company broken up. 

 BAY: And what about right now? Could they proceed, really proceed with business as usual as they say? 

 MCNAMEE: Well, it`s pretty clear to me that they can not, because I think they`re moral issues. 

 BAY: What about Lucent? The stock rose today on the news that it may spin off its microelectronics unit. Do you think that`s a good move for them? 

 MCNAMEE: I think it`s a fabulous move, at least from investor perspective. For Lucent, their principal competitor is Cisco (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) . Cisco is not making components, and it`s very important for Lucent to get totally focused in a way that`s more or less comparable to they way Cisco is focused to be able to compete head to head. The microelectronics business, they`re very well positioned, and I think they have a very attractive stock. 

 I think it would be a very attractive stock. It`s one I would love to own, and I do think that it`s a stand-alone business, and therefore, it`s better to go from a less vertically integrated model to something that`s a little leaner and meaner, and I think both businesses will be better off. That said, I think the outlook for Lucent itself as currently constructed is not that great. So absent this transaction, I wouldn`t like the stock much. 

 BAY: OK, Roger McNamee, as always, thank you. 

 MCNAMEE: Take care. 

 BAY: Coming up, the mutual fund company that rode the bull market all the way to the bank gets ready to take on Wall Street. We`ll tell you about Janus` plans to go public next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: One of the fastest growing mutual fund companies will soon be hitting the street. Today, Kansas City Southern, a railroad operator, announced the spin-off of its financial subsidiaries, which includes mutual fund giant Janus. The new company, Stilwell Financial, will trade on  the New York stock exchange under the ticker SV. The move comes despite objections from Janus management, who would prefer to be their own independent public company. Either way, investors appear to want to own a part of the red-hot mutual fund company. Kansas City Southern gained nearly 7 1/2. 

 Other companies making moves today: Corning  (URL: http://www.corning.com/) gained 8 3/4. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette (URL: http://www.dlj.com) upped its price target to $270, and reiterated its buy rating. Corning is up nearly 17 percent this week. Fellow fiberoptic equipment maker JDS Uniphase also rose today, up nearly 3 3/4. Credit Suisse First Boston reiterated its buy rating, saying the stock is a core holding in the industry. And Immunex  (URL: http://www.immunex.com/) gained more than 3. Banc of America initiated coverage with a strong buy rating and a $51 price target. Despite today`s gain, the stock is off 55 percent from its high of $83. 

 Coca-Cola`s stock jumped on an upgrade by Salomon Smith Barney. The brokerage said its efforts to localize its operations are paying off. Coke`s stock rose nearly 3, was the Dow`s biggest gainer. Also helping the stock, the company`s settlement of long-running racial discrimination case. But just as Coke tried to put this case to rest, it was slapped with another lawsuit. 

 Peter Viles has story. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This was a day when Coca-Cola hoped to get a break from controversy. Under new CEO Doug Daft, the company had reached a settlement in principal of a racial discrimination lawsuit. Coke released this statement from Carl Ware, the company`s highest ranking black executive. 

 CARL WARE, COCA-COLA: Consistent with our historic and guiding principals, we will move forward with our important diversity initiatives. We want to thank the many community leaders who have been and continue to be so tremendously helpful. 

 VILES: But then Coke was hit with this, another discrimination suit filed by four black women, seeking $1.5 billion and represented by Johnnie Cochran. Coke blasted the second suit as -- quote -- "and eleventh hour act of disruptive legal maneuvering by the other lawyers to seek to prolong the process and forestall real progress." 

 Cochran blasted back. 

 JOHNNIE COCHRAN, ATTORNEY: We`re not going to back off. We`re going to represent them to best of our ability, and we`re going to outmaneuver anybody. We`re trying to best represent these clients who claim substantial injuries, and Coke have has to deal with a that. They can run, but they can`t hide. 

 VILES: Both suits claim black workers at Coke were passed over for promotions in favor of white workers. In the first suit, workers are represented by lawyers Willie Gary and Cyrus Mehri. Mehri`s best known for winning $176 million in a similar suit against Texaco. In the second case, other workers are represented by Gary again, who was shut out of settlement talks, and Cochran, who`s best know for defending O.J. Simpson. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: When the settlement in the first suit is final, up to 2,000 Coke workers will have a choice: They can accept that settlement, or they can take their chances on another lawsuits. But this second suit is so ambitious, seeking $375 million per employee, that it could persuade some workers to opt out of the first settlement -- Willow. 

 BAY: So, Pete, how long will the settlement process for the first case take? 

 VILES: For the first case, the judge has put a timetable table on this. He wants it done by October 30. 

 BAY: Deadline October 30. 

 Beaten down for weeks, computer hardware stocks made a comeback today, and they are the focus of tonight`s sector report. Leading the group, Compaq Computer, the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette repeated its buy rating on the stock, citing strong demand for the company`s servers. Compaq jumped more than 2 today to close at 27 3/4. Also gaining ground, Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) up 3. It`s joining with SOFTBANK to form what`s expected to be the largest e-commerce Web site in Japan. Other computer hardware stocks which also moved higher today include Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) , IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , and Apple Computer (URL: http://www.apple.com/) . 

 Still ahead on MONEYLINE, one day after a record securities-fraud bust, the lawyers prepare for the court battle ahead. We`ll have new details after the break. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Details are emerging today on what prosecutors are calling a record bust for securities fraud. New York defense lawyers began sizing up the government`s case and plotting strategy. 

 Allan Dodds Frank has more. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the spring of 1995, the forces of organized crime began an assault on Wall Street that federal law enforcement authorities now call the most widespread securities fraud in history. 

 And according to indictments unveiled Wednesday by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, one way some defendants gained leverage over an unnamed stock broker by taking over a $40,000 debt he owed. And several defendants used threats of violence to induce the stock promoter to consent, the government charges. 

 Outside federal court today, a defense lawyer speculated that the alleged extortion was apparently one reason that James Labate, an alleged organized crime family associate, was still being held in custody pending a bail hearing Friday. 

 MARK WASSERMAN, ATTORNEY FOR JAMES LABATE: I believe there is one allegation of an -- in the indictment regarding an alleged or attempt to 

 extortion. Obviously, my client denies that allegation. That is an event that occurred, I believe, it`s alleged in the indictment, 1995, and that is the only allegation. There is no allegation of any physical violence to anyone or any act of violence against anyone. 

 FRANK: Another defendant still in custody is Robert Lino, who the government has alleged is the top organized crime figure involved. He was not named in the extortion count involving the stock promoter. Lino`s lawyer dismisses the notion the government has a case. 

 JOSEPH BENFANTE, ATTORNEY FOR ROBERT LINO: Whether my client is a member of an organization or not, he is really not -- I mean, that`s not the crux of the charge here, the crux is -- of the charge is what he did in the stock fraud situation and whether he used violence, and I don`t think that there`s any allegation set forth in the indictment about that, and I don`t think that the government has any proof of that. 

 FRANK: Another series of charges against the organized crime defendants, that they tried to defraud union pension funds and allegedly bribed a recently retired New York police detective, Stephen Gardell, treasurer of the Detectives Endowment Association. 

 JOSEPH TACOPINA, ATTORNEY FOR STEPHEN GARDELL: Nothing that he`s accused 

 of done, was ever done, and so, you know, they charge him on some conspiracy law, which means he conspired to do something. But you would think that one of the things they alleged to have happen, happened, and quite frankly, every single thing they alleged to have happen, never happened. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANK: At the bail hearing tomorrow, prosecutors may have to reveal exactly why they believe the defendants still in jail should not be released before their cases go to trial -- Willow. 

 BAY: So, Allan, if they are forced to do that, what are they likely to say? 

 FRANK: Well, the government has a thousand hours of tapes of secret conversations. There have been seven guilty pleas, so that presumably means now cooperating witnesses. They may have a lot of information they do not want to reveal to the defendants until the last possible moment. 

 BAY: Don`t want to tip their hands. Allan Dodds Frank, thank you. 

 Now, a correction: In our report last night about the securities fraud indictments, we mistakenly identified Thomas Scotto, president of the Detectives Endowment Association, as one of those indicted. He was not. We regret the error and any misunderstanding it may have caused. 

 Up next, "Ahead of the Curve," some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open tomorrow. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking some of what could move the markets tomorrow: it is a triple-witching Friday, so watch for increased volatility. And there is another 

 key economic report coming out. May housing starts will be released and they are expected to come in slightly lower than last month, at an annual rate of 1.62 million units. But the picture could be a mixed one. Request for new building permits are expected to have edged higher. 

 On the earnings front, Circuit City (URL: http://www.circuitcity.com/) expected to report first-quarter profits of 28 cents a share, up  8 cents from last year. Also keep on eye on Adobe Systems (URL: http://www.adobe.com/) . It reported better-than-expected earnings after the bell today. And also, Jabil Circuits, whose earnings were in line with expectations. Also watch Dow Chemical (URL: http://www.dow.com/) . It splits its shares three-for-one at the end of tomorrow`s trading day. 

 That is MONEYLINE for this Thursday. I`m Willow Bay. "CROSSFIRE" is next.

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Stocks held gains in late afternoon trading on Thursday with most technology blue chips moving up while the banking sector went on a slide. 

 "There is an interesting phenomenon under way, and that is over the past couple of days the market has seemed extremely dull and listless, said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "Market internals have been not horrible but not good." 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) gained 53. points, or 0.50 percent, at 10,742 with Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines, and AT&T among the most heavily-traded issues. 

 Strength in technology leaders pushed the Nasdaq composite .IXIC) up 32 points, or 0.87 percent, to 3,830 with Cisco Systems, Microsoft Corp., Dell Computer and WorldCom all higher. 

 Broader measures of the market displayed a mixed picture. The Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX) managed a gain of 0.34 percent at 1,475 while the small-cap Russell 2000 .RUT) was off 0.16 percent at 508 points. 

 "There continues to be money on the sidelines, that money wanting to go to perceived leadership and the perception through this confusion that the Fed is going to be gentle," Bleier added. "If that is the case, money has to be put to work." 

 Lucent Technologies jumped 4 to 60-3/4 amid news that the firm may move ahead with the spin-off of its microelectronics business and will become the primary equipment supplier to Verizon Wireless. 

 AT&T rose to 33-5/8. The phone company said it would explore together with its AT&T Latin America affiliate and Latin American telecom carrier FirstCom Corp. a possible combination of AT&T Global Network Services' operations in South America into AT&T Latin America. 

 Wireless communications technology developer Qualcomm Inc. was among the session's losers on mounting concerns over the company's profit outlook. 

 Falling to a near 7-month low, Qualcomm tumbled 9-1/2 to 61. 

 E-commerce services provider Digital River Inc. fell after saying it could not meet Wall Street's second quarter expectations as a slow period for its software services unit was likely to undermine results. Digital fell 2-11/16 to 7-9/16. 

 A profit-warning by southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp., which sent its stock tumbling 12-7/16 to 57-3/4 triggered selling in other sector peers. 

 Bank of America fell 4-1/16 to 51-5/16, Citigroup eased 1-13/16 to 65-5/16 while Chase Manhattan traded at 47, off 3-1.16. 

 AG Edwards cut its investment opinion on U.S. Bancorp, causing the stock to slide 1-9/16 to 21-7/16. 

 The approach of Friday's "triple-witching," the expiration of options and futures on stocks and stock indexes, also could help drive the market, traders said. Such quarterly expirations often bring arbitrage activity that can push the market quickly in either direction.

 UPDATE 3-Wachovia sees quarter, 2000 profit shortfall.

 (adds analysts' comments paragraphs 7, 9, 17; updates stock price, previous WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.) 

 NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Southeast regional bank Wachovia Corp. said on Thursday its second-quarter and full-year profits would fall short of Wall Street's expectations because of rising interest rates, and the company's shares fell more than 17 percent. 

 The warning spurred fears that higher interest rates would damage profit margins and trigger loan defaults at other regional banks, knocking down those stocks too. 

 The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based bank also said it plans to take a $200 million loan loss provision in the second quarter. A slowdown in economic growth has squeezed borrowers and boosted the bank's level of problem loans, it said. 

 Rate increases make it expensive for banks themselves to borrow to fund new loans. They also cause people who are hard-pressed to make loan payments to default, known as credit quality deterioration in banking lingo. 

 "Asset quality is moving to the front burner for the banking industry," Michael Mayo, an analyst at CS First Boston said. "The flip side of...a slower economy is more asset quality problems. The special provision was a surprise." 

 Wachovia's stock tumbled 12-1/8 to 58-1/16 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday afternoon. 

 Merrill Lynch bank industry analyst Sandra Flannigan cut her second-quarter estimate on Wachovia to 69 cents a share from $1.33, her 2000 estimate to $4.70 a share from $5.45 and her 2001 estimate to $5.75 a share from $6.00. 

 Wachovia said the pace of profit growth might slow this year from last year, because higher rates have curbed growth in its capital markets, mortgage and investment businesses, and put pressure on lending income. 

 "This is somewhat predictable given how fast and by how much rates have risen over the past year," Stephen Biggar, an analyst at S&P Equity Group, said. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised rates six times, or a total of 1.75 percent, since last June, to keep inflation at bay during an unprecedented economic boom. But most banks normally protect themselves against only a 125-basis point rate increase over a year, Biggar said. 

 "Notwithstanding the difficult interest rate environment, Wachovia should still achieve good growth in revenue and earnings although at a somewhat slower pace than the growth rate reported in 1999 or previously expected by management in 2000," Robert McCoy Jr., Wachovia's chief financial officer, said in a statement. 

 Wachovia was expected to earn $1.34 per share in the second quarter and $5.46 per share for the year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' estimates. 

 The bank earned $1.22 a share in last year's second quarter and $4.97 in 1999. 

 Debt rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered its rating outlook on Wachovia to negative from stable on Thursday after the announcement. 

 Other regional bank shares also fell, though not as much as Wachovia's stock. Shares of BB&T Corp., another bank in Winston-Salem, fell 2 to 26-7/8, SunTrust Banks Inc. stock fell 4-5/16 to 53-7/8 and KeyCorp stock lost 1-1/4 to 19-5/16. 

 KeyCorp, in Cleveland, was among the large regional banks to warn last quarter that profits would come in at the low end of a forecast range because of rising rates. 

 David Hilder, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he had spoken with SunTrust and the Atlanta-based bank remained on track to meet analysts' second-quarter estimates.

 Perot Systems Blames Order Shortfalls For 2nd-Quarter  Profit Warning

 DALLAS -(Dow Jones)- Perot Systems Corp. said late Thursday it expects second-quarter revenue and earnings to be lower than the year-earlier quarter because two of its clients terminated or reduced their orders. 

 The computer services concern said the order shortfall also could cause 2000 earnings to be flat compared with 1999, falling short of analysts' expectations. 

 The mean estimate of eight analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for second-quarter earnings of 17 cents a share and fiscal 2000 earnings of 70 cents a share. 

 East Midland Electricity PLC terminated its contract with Perot when Midland was acquired by Swiss-based ABB Ltd., and UBS AG cut orders to reduce costs, Perot (PER) said. 

 "While we see positive results in the form of long-term contract signings; declines from EME and UBS this year are offsetting these gains," said Ross Perot, company chairman. 

 The Dallas company said long-term contract signings totaled $575 million through the end of May, and it expects to close additional contracts early in the third quarter.

 International Flavors Issues 2nd-Quarter  Profit Warning

 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citing the "persistent strength" of the dollar against the euro and weaker-than-expected flavor sales, International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. Thursday said it expects second-quarter earnings to remain flat with the year-ago quarter excluding charges, and below expectations. 

 The maker of artificial aromas and flavors estimated a sales decline of about 1% in the second quarter from year-earlier sales of $371.1 million. 

 For the quarter ended June 30, New York-based International Flavors (IFF) said it will earn about 48 cents a share. The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for 53 cents a diluted share. The company earned $27.4 million, or 26 cents a share after charges, on sales of $371.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the charge, International Flabors had operating earnings of $50.6 million, or 48 cents a share in the 1999 quarter. 

 International Flavors also expects earnings and sales for the year ending Dec. 31 to fall below previous forecasts. The company estimates earnings of $1.80 a share, up slightly from 1999 operating earnings of $1.79 a share. Sales will likely stay flat at around $1.44 billion, the company said. 

 In 1999, the company's bottom-line earnings came to $162 million, or $1.53 a share, including a restructuring charge of 26 cents a share. 

 The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of $1.94 a diluted share for all of 2000. 

 International Flavors has been hurt by lower-than-expected flabor sales in the company's North America and Europe, Africa and Middle East segments, reflecting continued weak business conditions for many of the company's food customers in those areas. 

 Fragrance sales also reflect customers' continuing efforts to reduce their inventory levels, modify corresponding reorder patterns, and streamline operations, International Flavors said.

 NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks ended mostly higher Thursday after being pulled in different directions. Investors had to balance favourable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.06 to 1,478.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 48.33 at 3,845.74. 

 Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 US billion. 

 Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.063 to $59.688. Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $3 to $117 after the company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in Japan. 

 Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep dropoff in wireless equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell $9.062 to $61.438.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks ended mostly higher Thursday after being pulled in different directions. Investors had to balance favorable news for technology companies with a profit warning from a respected regional banking company. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.87 to close at 10,714.82, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 8.06 to 1,478.60, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 48.33 at 3,845.74. 

 Lucent Technologies led the tech sector higher as reports surfaced that the telecommunications equipment maker was considering spinning off a microelectronics unit for more than $50 billion. 

 Lucent was among the most actively traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, rising $3.063 to $59.688. Hewlett-Packard shares also rose, gaining $3 to $117 after the company announced plans to start an online commerce venture in Japan. 

 Enthusiasm in the tech sector was muted, however, by a steep dropoff in wireless equipment maker Qualcomm, which fell $9.062 to $61.438. Chase H&Q cut its earnings and revenue estimates for Qualcomm for the fourth quarter and next year. Bear Stearns & Co. had cut its outlook for the company a day earlier.

Wary Traders Buckle Down

The Australian sharemarket was marked lower from the outset yesterday, due to a weaker market in the US overnight, and then drifted sideways for the rest of the day as investors waited for more concrete signs of the direction of US interest rates.

The All Ordinaries index closed 30.60 points lower at 3071.30 on solid volume of $1.69 billion. The ASX 200 index also faltered, falling 32.70 to 3113.80.

``I think the market has run out of steam at the moment,'' Ord Minnett institutional dealer Mr Eric Gale said.

``I think there is a little bit of hands off, which is reflected in the slowness of the market.''

Following the flat US producer price index data on Friday, brokers said investors were now looking to the release tonight of consumer price index figures to provide a better indication of whether the US Federal Reserve will tighten interest rates.

A drop in News Corp shares after their surge last week accounted for more than 17 points of the decline in the All Ords.

Following two days of strong rallies last week which pushed its share price up 14 per cent, News Corp shed 79c to $21.21, while its preferred shares ended 90c weaker at $18.

Brokers said News Corp was tracking the downturn on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 49.85 points to 10,564.21 on Monday night.

The Nasdaq Composite was also off, sliding 106.93 points to 3767.91 following a profit warning from Citrix Systems.

``News Corp is a bit of a Dow stock, and with the Dow off overnight it has been savaged in line with the US markets,'' Hartley Poynton's institutional adviser, Mr Paul Lucas, said.

BNP Paribas senior equities dealer Mr Tim Powditch attributed the fall to uncertainty surrounding the soccer rights in Britain held by News Corp's British Sky Broadcasting associate. They are now the subject of a bidding war.

``People are reading that negatively for News Corp, because they can't use their manipulative skills. They basically have to bid the most,'' Mr Powditch said.

The banking sector produced a mixed bag yesterday. CBA lost 16c to $26.54 after managing director Mr David Murray denied a British newspaper report it intended to bid for British building society Bradford & Bingley.

Westpac was also down, easing 10c to $12.15 while St George Bank managed to carry its 26c dividend pay-out, falling just 21c to $11.52 as it traded ex-dividend.

Both ANZ and NAB gained 9c yesterday, to $12.31 and $25.49 respectively.

Perth telecom Newtel surged 51c to $2.16 on suggestions that its American depositary receipts (ADRs) would hit $US17.50, equal to $2.90.

Strong retail interest in the stock saw more than 3 million Newtel shares traded, with CS First Boston, BNP and Findlays doing much of the buying.

Telecom stocks continued to weaken, as Telstra edged back another 10c to $6.82 and Cable & Wireless Optus ended the day 4c softer at $4.44.

Mixed movements in base metal prices are beginning to affect Rio Tinto, which fell 40c to $25.50, while BHP was 11c weaker at $17.65.

Brokers expect the market to remain quiet in the lead-up to the end of the financial year, as tax-induced selling continues.

``At the moment investors are looking at their individual tax situations,'' said BT Funds Management's head of dealing, Mr Wayne Nicholls.

``People that made a fair amount of money this year are looking at what stocks they can sell to offset capital gains liabilities,'' he said.

 UPDATE 5-Stagecoach drops as buyout prospects fade.

 LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Shares in British transport group Stagecoach Holdings closed 11 percent lower on Wednesday despite annual pre-tax profits at the higher end of expectations as hopes faded of a buy-out to take it private. 

 The company said it was confident of a recovery from a series of profit setbacks but basic earnings per share for the year to April 30 fell 22 percent, and investors were unimpressed. 

 The stock, on the decline since troubles came to light last year, closed down 7-1/2 pence at 62-1/2, giving up Tuesday's gains. It had already halved in value in the year to date and underperformed the FTSE All Share transport index by 50 percent. 

 The low valuation and a planned 250 million pound ($375 million) share buyback had prompted speculation the company might be taken private. But Chief Executive Keith Cochrane told Reuters the board had no such plans at present. 

 "The position of the board is that Stagecoach is a public company, and I'm here to demonstrate to the market the plans that we have to deliver on performance going forward," he said. 

 The group issued a profit warning in April highlighting the loss of a key client at Prestwick airport in Glasgow and particularly higher fuel costs and tight labour markets in its British and U.S. bus operations. 

 LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY IN U.S. 

 Analysts said Stagecoach's cost-saving overhaul in the United States would lead to improved earnings eventually, but it could take two to three years before its effects were felt. 

 "I don't think the shares are going to particularly go off to the races, because there's no short-term earnings story or trading story that's going to support that, and they've clearly scotched a management buyout in the short term," said Alistair Gunn, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe in London. 

 "There's not a lot of downside either. We are buyers of the stock, but there's no hurry," he said, adding that the shares would be ultimately underpinned by the buybacks. 

 Another analyst, who declined to be identified, said one of the group's main concerns would be to regain confidence in the recently reshuffled management. 

 Earlier this week, Stagecoach announced a write-down of its investment in Hong Kong's Road King Infrastructure Ltd resulting in an exceptional charge of some 85 million pounds. 

 "Clearly, the next year is a year of transition," said Cochrane, who took over as CEO from Mike Kinski in February. 

 "We're undertaking a strategic review of each of our businesses to identify areas of initiative that we can undertake to improve revenues. Our challenge is to grow revenues to offset cost pressures." 

 TOTAL DIVIDEND UP 20 PERCENT 

 Pre-tax profit before exceptionals for the year to April 30 rose 11 percent to 244 million pounds on a 41 percent rise in turnover to 2.179 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a pre-tax range of 200 million pounds to 259 million, giving a consensus of 230.3 million pounds. 

 But basic earnings per share fell 22 percent to 9.4 pence after exceptional items, including write-downs of 115 million pounds from non-core operations. 

 The group will pay a final dividend of 2.4 pence per share, giving a 20 percent rise in total dividend to 3.6 percent. 

 Cochrane said Coach USA - bought last June for $1.24 billion - had still not met expectations, with operating margins down to 14 percent from 16 percent. 

 Stagecoach planned to restructure Coach USA to exploit potential cost savings and spur underlying revenue growth. The initial focus of the overhaul would be in New York and New Jersey, which accounted for 25 percent of the business. 

 "We continue to believe it is a strong platform for organic and acquisition growth in North America," he said. 

 Cochane said, however, there was limited scope for further cost reduction in its UK bus operations, where the focus would have to be on revenue growth. 

 Stagecoach is currently bidding for an extension of its British South West Trains franchise, which was fined 3.8 million pounds in the year to January 2000 for failing to meet agreed goals on punctuality and reliability. 

 Cochrane said a key part of its bid would be steps it could take to improve the infrastructure and reduce over-crowding. ($1=.6625 Pound).

 NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - ING Barings said Wednesday that analyst Patrick Parr was downgrading Kennametal Inc. to hold from buy. 

 - cited 1) uncertainty in outlook for 82 percent-owned JLK Direct ; 2) lack of any clear near-term catalysts; and 3) the likely "penalty" to be accrued to the multiple until the JLK issues are identified and resolved. 

 - Lowered his earnings estimates for Kennametal's fiscal fourth quarter, ending June 30, to $0.67 a share from $0.73, which takes his fiscal 2000 estimate to $2.12 from $2.17. 

 - cut his fiscal 2001 estimate to $2.50 a share from $2.75. 

 - "We believe 'core' (Kennametal without JLK) operations continue to trend mostly favourably, but would await greater evidence of progress on resolution of JLK issues before recommending purchase of the shares." 

 - On Tuesday Kennametal cut its fourth-quarter profit growth forecast, citing an earnings warning by JLK. 

 - Kennametal shares were off 3/8 at 24-5/8 in morning trade.

 U.S. stocks dragged lower on corporate profit worries.

 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Stocks sagged in early trading on Tuesday after soft U.S. economic data underscored worries about the impact of slower U.S. growth on corporate profits. 

 The latest retail sales report indicated the Federal Reserve's six credit tightenings in the past year may be taking a bite on the economy, limiting the need for further increases. 

 "The concern is quickly becoming, 'Can the Fed negotiate a soft landing?'," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King, Nussbaum Inc. 

 Hyman said that the market seemed to be unable to muster the enthusiasm usually expected when the Fed appears to be reaching the end of a tightening cycle. 

 "The conviction in the market is so tenuous that sellers seem to want to sell on the slightest whim," he added. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average sagged 61 points, or 0.58 percent to 10,503, while the Nasdaq composite index tumbled 46 points, or 1.22 percent, to 3,722. 

 Jitters over corporate earnings continued to slam technology stocks. 

 NBC Internet slumped 9-13/16 to 15-7/16 after the Web-based companion to the NBC television network warned its results would be below Wall Street expectations. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock. 

 Citrix Systems was the Nasdaq's most heavily traded stock, edging up 1-3/8 to 23-5/8 after slamming more than 45 percent lower Monday when it also issued a profit warning. 

 Weakness in financial shares weighed on the Dow, with J.P. Morgan off 1-7/8 at 127-3/4. 

 The U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.3 percent overall in May and remained flat excluding automobiles. 

 The May figures fell well short of Wall Street consensus estimates for a flat reading overall and a 0.3-percent gain excluding autos. 

 "On the one hand, it makes it more likely the Fed does not need to do anything at the next meeting, but it is also calling into question whether there may be too much of a slowdown, a slowing of the rate of earnings growth that the market has been counting on," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. 

 "It is the cup half empty versus a cup half full," he added. 

 Investors were looking ahead to remarks from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan this afternoon, which they hope will yield more clues to the direction of interest rates. 

 Greenspan is scheduled to speak via satellite on business data analysis before the New York Association for Business Economics conference in New York at 1:10 p.m. EDT (1710 GMT), 

 Investors are hungrily awaiting any pieces of economic data that could yield clues to how much robust growth is slowing in reaction to the Fed rate hikes and how much more tightening can be expected. 

 Consumer price data scheduled for Wednesday will likely be this week's main event. A week ago, producer prices, which showed inflation remained in check in May sent investors on a brief buying spree. 

 "I don't see anything to turn this market sharply higher until we get a more definitive notion of where interest rates are going and where the economy's headed," said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson & Co.

 U.S. stocks stuck lower, techs down as oil, drugs up.

 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Stocks held losses in early afternoon trading on Tuesday as new data offered more evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing, fuelling concern that the Federal Reserve's soft landing will cramp corporate profits. 

 Cash shifted out of high-flying technology sectors and into groups seen as more resilient to economic gyrations, including utility, drugs and food and beverage shares. 

 "(The markets) are worried that the soft landing might be a hard landing," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. 

 With economic growth slowing, "the worry is that earnings will not grow fast enough to support high-priced earnings multiples, or high valuations," he added. 

 By early afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 8 points to 10,556 - weighed down by technology heavyweight Hewlett-Packard Co. H-P fell after an analyst at Sanford Bernstein downgraded the stock. 

 Technology stocks suffered more broadly amid valuation jitters and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 28 points to 3,739. 

 Broader measures of the market hovered near the breakeven point with the Standard & Poor's 500 index up 2 points at 1,448, while the Wilshire 5000 slipped 6 points to 13,484. 

 Softer-than-expected U.S. retail sales hinted that the Federal Reserve's year-long campaign of interest rate increases may be nearing an end. But the data also underscored concerns that the economy may be cooling too fast to keep Wall Street happy. 

 "The retail sales figure is an indication that the recent Fed tightening action is working, but it is really a two-pronged concern," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. in New York. "One is the slowing economic growth and the other is inflation." 

 The U.S. Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.3 percent overall in May and remained flat excluding automobiles, well short of Wall Street consensus estimates for a flat reading overall and a gain of 0.3 percent, excluding autos. 

 "On the one hand, it makes it more likely the Fed does not need to do anything at the next meeting, but it is also calling into question whether there may be too much of a slowdown, a slowing of the rate of earnings growth that the market has been counting on," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. 

 But the Consumer Price Index scheduled for Wednesday will likely be this week's main event. Investors are hungrily awaiting any pieces of economic data that could yield clues to how much robust growth is slowing in reaction to the Fed rate hikes and how much more tightening can be expected. 

 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan addressed the New York Association for Business Economics conference via satellite on Tuesday afternoon, but did not refer to the U.S. economic and monetary policy outlook. 

 Bond prices sagged, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note down 2/32, pushing the yield up to 6.08 percent. The 30-year bond lost 25/32, with the yield at 5.93 percent. 

 As technology stocks slumped, strong gains from huge pharmaceutical names Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co. helped stem the Dow's losses, benefiting from market players' conviction that demand for their goods will stay steady in the face of a slower economy. 

 J & J climbed 2-7/16 to 87-3/16, while Merck jumped 2-11/16 to 72-5/8. 

 Energy services companies also fared well, getting an added boost as crude oil prices rocketed higher for a second day in a row. The Dow Jones Utility Average index climbed 3.0 points at 332. 

 Still, jitters over corporate earnings continued to hurt selected technology stocks, however. 

 NBC Internet slumped 8-15/16 to 15-11/16 after the Web-based companion to the NBC television network warned its results would be below Wall Street expectations. Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock. 

 Citrix Systems, the Nasdaq's most heavily traded stock, rose 2-3/8 to 25-5/8 after falling more than 45 percent lower Monday when it also issued a profit warning.

 NEW YORK, June 13 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks hovered at the unchanged level in midday trading on Tuesday as worries that slower economic growth will dent corporate profits sparked a shift to sectors seen more resilient to economic gyrations. 

 Utility, drug and food and beverage companies all gained as traders fled less stable, high-priced issues.

 Households goods giant Clorox rallied 3-1/8 to 43-5/8 after PaineWebber said it started coverage of the company, setting a $50 per share 12-month price target. 

 The Dow was weighed down, however, by weakness in shares of computer giant Hewlett-Packard. It slumped 8-3/16 to 117-13/16 after Sanford Bernstein lowered its rating on the stock and cut its third-quarter revenue growth outlook for the company.

Earnings nervousness hurts markets /Home Depot news lowers Dow; Citrix news jolts Nasdaq

NEW YORK - Stocks fell sharply Monday, sending the Nasdaq composite index down more than 100 points, as reports from two companies suggested that second-quarter earnings won't meet Wall Street's high expectations.

An earnings warning from Citrix Systems, a maker of computer network products, helped give the Nasdaq its worst loss since May 23. Meanwhile, Home Depot hurt the Dow Jones industrials after a Wall Street analyst said rising interest rates are taking a toll on sales.

The Nasdaq ended the day down 106.93 at 3,767.91. Since it lost 199 points on May 23, the index had been staging a gradual recovery.

The Dow fell 49.85 to 10,564.21, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 10.95 to 1,446.00. Both indexes gave up early gains.

Trading was light, convincing analysts that investors are trading cautiously in advance of several government reports on the economy due out later this week.

"It's an orderly market, but not a market with a great deal of conviction," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. in New York.

Citrix set the tone for the Nasdaq, warning that its profits will miss estimates in the coming quarter. The company said its core business in large-enterprise accounts has been growing slower than expected. Its shares plunged 47 percent, or by $19.188, to $22, and Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the shares from his firm's "Highlighted Stocks" list.

The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning, which rose $18 to $230 after the fiber-optics company said it anticipates earnings for the second quarter of 78 to 80 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents.

Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last year's second-quarter totals.

Other technology stocks that sustained sharp losses were Harmonic Inc., which lost $18.688 to $38.75, and MicroStrategy, which fell $23.313 to $38.938.

Home Depot slipped $1.938 to $46.063 after a Robinson-Humphrey Co. analyst lowered his estimate for second-quarter same-store sales. Analyst Mark Mandel lowered his expectations after meeting with Home Depot management on Friday. Mandel said rising interest rates appear to be hurting business.

Other retail stocks also paid a price for an anticipated economic slowdown. Wal-Mart fell $1.25 to $52.75, adding to the Dow's decline.

With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are just beginning the "pre-announcement" period, when they give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive surprises.

The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts predict that investors will punish any company that appears to be losing momentum.

"Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating," Ackerman said. "The market is still quite fragile."

Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products.

Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past year.

The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June 28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.

"If the retail sales and consumer price reports show the economy slowing and inflation remaining tame, then we believe the odds are that the Fed will not be raising rates at that time," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by just a few dozen issues on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 943.94 million shares, compared with 967.03 million in the previous session.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.55 to 508.51.

The price of the 30-year treasury bond rose point, or $3.12 per $1,000 in face value. It's yield slipped to 5.87 late Monday from 5.89 Friday.

In Mexico, the bolsa index closed up 6.27 points to 6,405.00. Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 0.3 percent and Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.2 percent. The French stock market was closed for a holiday.

In late New York trading, the dollar was at 106.75 yen, down from 106.83 Friday, and at 9.7879 pesos, down from 9.8920 Friday. The peso's value was up to 10.2167 cents from 10.1092 cents. The euro was at 95.30 cents, down from 95.31 cents.

 Stagecoach Fiscal Year Seen Ahead,But Investors Still Wary

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- An expected increase in full-year earnings Wednesday from Stagecoach Holdings PLC (U.SGS) is unlikely to restore investor confidence in the U.K. bus and rail group, analysts say. 

 Investors are likely to focus on developments at its struggling U.S. operations, the prospect of a future dividend cut and the outlook for its U.K. rail division. 

 The company, hit earlier this year by management changes, has already issued a profit warning. 

 "It's going to be a long, slow haul for Stagecoach to restore market confidence," said Damian Brewer, analyst with HSBC. 

 Analysts expect a pretax profit of GBP235 million for the year ended April 30 2000, compared with GBP219 million last year. However, the range is wide as some analysts have not adjusted their forecasts following Stagecoach's GBP85 million writedown on the value of its stake in Hong-Kong listed toll road operator Road King Infrastructure Ltd. (H.RKG). 

 Shares in Stagecoach have dropped sharply since the start of the year, in part due to a profit warning issued April. 

 This is despite a GBP250 million share buyback program announced at the same time, which is funded from the proceeds of the GBP1.4 billion disposal of Stagecoach's rolling stock leasing business Porterbrook. 

 At 1525 GMT, the shares were up 11%, or 6.75 pence, at 70.25 pence. 

 In April, the company warned of flat profit at its U.K. bus division because of rising fuel prices and labor costs. It has said Coach USA, which it bought last year, faces similar problems, which would hurt margins until next year. 

 The sudden departure of Mike Kinski as chief executive in February also hit the share price. He was replaced by Keith Cochrane, the finance director. 

 Analysts will be keen to hear how Stagecoach intends to turn its U.S. operations around, but most believe there is still a long way to recovery. 

 "We're not past the worst at Coach USA," said HSBC's Brewer, citing the expected slowdown of the U.S. economy next year, and the huge integration task still facing the company. 

 Some observers said the U.S. difficulties and reduction in revenue due to the Porterbrook sale could put the dividend under pressure. 

 "The dividend policy is definitely going to be under review," another analyst from a European bank said. However, the 3 pence a share total dividend is likely to be held this year, but could be reduced next year, he added. 

 Analysts also expect to hear from Stagecoach on the refranchising process that its U.K. rail business, South West Trains, has just entered. 

 Some observers expect the company to face stiff competition to win the franchise, which will be awarded by the government.

Stocks fell sharply yesterday, sending the NASDAQ composite index down more than 100 points, as reports from two companies suggested that second-quarter earnings won't meet Wall Street's high expectations. 

An earnings warning from Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of computer network products, helped give the NASDAQ its worst loss since May 23. Meanwhile, Home Depot hurt the Dow Jones industrials after a Wall Street analyst said rising interest rates are taking a toll on sales. 

The NASDAQ ended the day down 106.93 at 3,767.91. The index had been staging a gradual recovery since it lost 199 points on May 23. 

The Dow fell 49.85 to close at 10,564.21, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 10.95 at 1,446.00. Both indexes gave up early gains. 

"It's an orderly market but not a market with a great deal of conviction," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &Co. in New York, reflecting on the light trading yesterday ahead of key economic reports later this week. 

Citrix set the tone for the NASDAQ, warning that its earnings will miss estimates in the coming quarter. The company said expansion of its core business in large enterprise accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged 47 percent, or by $19.19, to $22, and Edward M. Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his firm's "Highlighted Stocks" list. 

The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning, which rose $18 to $230 after the fiber-optics company said it anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share. 

Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last year's second-quarter totals. 

Other technology stocks that sustained sharp losses: Harmonic Inc., which lost $18.69 to $38.75, and MicroStrategy, which fell $23.31 to $38.94. 

Home Depot fell $1.94 to $46.06 after a Robinson-Humphrey Co. analyst lowered his estimate for second-quarter same-store sales. Analyst Mark Mandel lowered his expectations after meeting with Home Depot management on Friday and said rising interest rates appear to be hurting business. 

Other retail stocks also paid a price for an anticipated economic slowdown. Wal-Mart fell $1.25 to $52.75, adding to the Dow's decline. 

In Ohio, Liqui-Box fell $2.31 to $47.50, and Cincinnati Financial fell $1.56 to $36.31. 

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.3 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.2 percent. The French stock market was closed for a holiday.

 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Monday, sending the Nasdaq Composite index down more than 100 points, as reports from two companies suggested that second quarter earnings won't meet Wall Street's high expectations. 

 An earnings warning from Citrix Systems, a maker of computer network products, helped give the Nasdaq its worst loss since May 23. Meanwhile, Home Depot hurt the Dow Jones industrials after a Wall Street analyst said rising interest rates are taking a toll on sales. 

 The Nasdaq ended the day down 106.93 at 3,767.91. Since it lost 199 points on May 23, the index had been staging a gradual recovery. 

 The Dow fell 49.85 to close at 10,564.21, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 10.95 at 1,446.00. Both indexes gave up early gains. 

 Trading was light, convincing analysts that investors are trading cautiously in advance of several government reports on the economy due out later this week. 

 "It's an orderly market, but not a market with a great deal of conviction," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. in New York. 

 Citrix set the tone for the Nasdaq, warning that its earnings will miss estimates in the coming quarter. The company said expansion of its core business in large enterprise accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged 47 percent, or by $19.188, to $22, and Edward M. Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his firm's "Highlighted Stocks" list. 

 The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning, which rose $21.625 to $233.625 after the fiber-optics company said it anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share. 

 Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last year's second-quarter totals. 

 Other technology stocks that sustained sharp losses: Harmonic, which lost $18.688 to $38.75 and MicroStrategy, which fell $23.313 to $38.938. 

 Home Depot fell $1.938 to $46.063 after a Robinson-Humphrey analyst lowered his estimate for second quarter same-store sales. Analyst Mark Mandel lowered his expectations after meeting with Home Depot management on Friday, and said rising interest rates appear to be hurting business. 

 Other retail stocks also paid a price for an anticipated economic slowdown. Wal-Mart fell $1.625 to $52.375, adding to the Dow's decline. 

 With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are just beginning the "preannouncement" period, when companies give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts predict investors will punish any company that appears to be losing momentum. 

 "Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating," Ackerman said. "The market is still quite fragile." 

 Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products. Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past year. 

 The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June 28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep inflation at bay. 

 "If the retail sales and consumer price reports show the economy slowing and inflation remaining tame, then we believe the odds are that the Fed will not be raising rates at that time," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. 

 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by just a few dozen issues on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume lagged behind Friday's quiet pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.55 to 508.51. 

 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent. Germany's DAX index fell 0.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.4 percent.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell Monday after companies that represent both the new economy and the old suggested that corporate profits might falter. 

 An earnings warnings from Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of computer network products, gave the Nasdaq its worst loss since May 23. Meanwhile, Home Depot fell after a Wall Street analyst said rising interest rates are taking a toll on sales. 

 The Nasdaq composite index was down 106.92, or 2.8 percent, at 3,767.92. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 49.85, or 0.5 percent, at 10,564.21, and the Standard and Poor's 500 index was down 10.95 at 1,446.00. Both indexes had given up early gains. 

 Declining issues led advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume lagged behind Friday's quiet pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.19 to 510.87. 

 Trading was light, convincing analysts that investors are treading cautiously in advance of several government reports on the economy, due out later this week. 

 "It's an orderly market, but not a market with a great deal of conviction," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock and Co. in New York. 

 The Nasdaq led the broad market lower after Citrix said its earnings will miss estimates in the coming quarter. 

 Citrix said expansion of its core business in large enterprise accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged 47 percent, or by dlrs 19.188, to dlrs 22. Edward M. Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his firm's "Highlighted Stocks" list. 

 The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning, which rose dlrs 21.625 to dlrs 233.625 after the fiber-optics company said it anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share. 

 Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last year's second-quarter totals. 

 Home Depot fell dlrs 1.938 to dlrs 46.063 after a Robinson-Humphrey Co. analyst lowered his estimate for second-quarter same-store sales. Analyst Mark Mandel lowered his expectations after meeting with Home Depot management on Friday, and said rising interest rates appear to be hurting business. 

 Other retail stocks also paid a price for an anticipated economic slowdown. Wal-Mart fell dlrs 1.625 to dlrs 52.375, adding to the Dow's decline. 

 With three weeks remaining in the second quarter, companies are just beginning the "preannouncement" period, in which companies give Wall Street advance notice of any disappointments or positive surprises. The second quarter is generally expected to be a strong one, but with interest rates on the rise, analysts expect investors to harshly punish any company that appears to be losing momentum. 

 "Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating," Ackerman said. "The market is still quite fragile." 

 The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June 28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep inflation at bay.

 NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks fell Monday after companies that represent both the new economy and the old suggested that corporate profits might falter. 

 An earnings warnings from Citrix Systems Inc., a maker of computer network products, gave the Nasdaq its worst loss since May 23. Meanwhile, Home Depot fell after a Wall Street analyst said rising interest rates are taking a toll on sales. 

 According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq composite index was down 106.92 at 3,767.92. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 49.85 at 10,564.21, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 10.95 at 1,446.00. Both indexes had given up early gains. 

 Trading was light, convincing analysts that investors are treading cautiously in advance of several government reports on the economy, due out later this week. 

 "It's an orderly market, but not a market with a great deal of conviction," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. in New York. 

 The Nasdaq led the broad market lower after Citrix said its earnings will miss estimates in the coming quarter. 

 Citrix said expansion of its core business in large enterprise accounts is taking place slower than expected. Its shares plunged 47 percent, or by $19.188, to $22. Edward M. Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber, removed the stock from his firm's "Highlighted Stocks" list. 

 The profit warning from Citrix tempered good news from Corning, which rose $21.625 to $233.625 after the fiber-optics company said it anticipates earnings for the second quarter to be 78 cents to 80 cents a share, well above analysts' estimates of 69 cents a share. 

 Corning expects profits to come in about 50 percent above last year's second-quarter totals.

 "Good earnings are likely to help the market move forward or at least hold its ground. Bad earnings are likely to be devastating," Ackerman said. "The market is still quite fragile." 

 Rising interest rates can hurt corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money to finance growth and by making it more expensive for customers to borrow to buy a company's products. Ackerman said investors are especially nervous this quarter because it isn't yet clear whether the Federal Reserve is finished raising rates. Fed policy-makers have raised rates six times in the past year. 

 The Fed's next decision on interest rates is expected on June 28. This week, government data on consumer prices, retail sales and housing starts could offer some indication of whether the Fed's earlier rate increases are slowing the economy enough to keep inflation at bay. 

 "If the retail sales and consumer price reports show the economy slowing and inflation remaining tame, then we believe the odds are that the Fed will not be raising rates at that time," said John H. Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest Inc. 

 Declining issues led advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume lagged behind Friday's quiet pace. 

 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 12.19 to 510.87.

AT&T stands by rate-hikes plan despite outcry

NEW YORK - AT&T Corp. is standing by plans to restructure its basic long-distance calling rates, which include some increases similar to ones the company withdrew earlier this week amid protests from regulators and consumers.

The new rates, designed to help offset the loss of a $3 monthly fee from millions of low-usage customers, are still being devised, but the company hopes to implement them "just as quickly as we can," AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel said Friday.

Last month, the Federal Communications Commission announced it would cut by $3.2 billion the access fees local phone companies charge long-distance carriers to connect calls - costs that phone users typically pay.

Major phone companies, including AT&T, pledged to pass the savings along to consumers. As such, AT&T eliminated the $3 fee for callers who opt for basic long-distance rates because they don't want to pay the $5 or more per month often charged to high-volume callers wanting the lowest rates.

But when the nation's largest long-distance company tried to compensate - trimming some basic rates while raising others by as much as 21/2 times - consumers and FCC officials complained that AT&T had violated the spirit of the industry's pledge.

AT&T quickly backed off on the new pricing, which had lowered the Sunday rate from 11.5 cents a minute to 7 cents a minute while increasing the rate for the rest of the week to a flat 29 cents per minute.

For now, the old basic rates are in place: 11.5 cents a minute on weekends, 16 cents off-peak on weekdays, and 26 cents for peak weekday calls.

The rate changes are crucial to help make up for the $3 monthly fee, a reliable revenue stream that AT&T can ill afford to lose at a time when price wars are already eating into the company's long-distance business.

In early May, AT&T issued its first profit warning since C. Michael Armstrong took over as chief executive in late 1997. The company said it was being hurt by a variety of factors, including a faster-than-expected decline in revenue growth from the company's core long-distance consumer business.

At the same time, AT&T is struggling to make a success of its $110 billion investment in buying cable TV systems to provide telephone and Internet services to the nation's homes.

Siegel said AT&T had expected basic-rate customers to embrace the lower Sunday rate as a good trade-off "because a lot of people do weekend calling and we thought it was a very aggressive rate for basic plans."

He rejected the idea that AT&T was going back on any pledge, saying that AT&T had previously said it would be adjusting its rates. "We've been very straightforward about saying that some rates would go up and some rates would go down," he said.

 E.D.S. Shares Skid 26 Percent On Company's Sales Warning

 PLANO, Tex., June 9 -- Shares of Electronic Data Systems tumbled 26 percent today after it said second-quarter sales would be less than expected. 

 Shares fell $14.8125, to $43 today. The stock fell 8.5 percent on Thursday and has slipped 34 percent this year. 

 Changes in the organization of its sales force are hurting revenue growth at E.D.S., which competes with I.B.M. for contracts to run corporate computer systems. 

 The warning is a setback for Richard H. Brown, who took over as chief executive last year and has eliminated more than 8,000 jobs and pared management in an effort to jump-start sales and profit growth. 

 ''The reduced revenue outlook will cause investors to question the turnaround,'' wrote Gregory Gould, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, in a report this morning. 

 Mr. Gould, who downgraded E.D.S., said its management told him on Thursday night that base sales, which do not include sales to its former parent General Motors, will rise 3 percent in the quarter, lower than the 7 percent he expected. General Motors accounts for about 20 percent of E.D.S. sales. 

 Sales growth in the third quarter will be ''in the mid-single digits,'' about half his previous estimate, Mr. Gould said. 

 Under Mr. Brown, Electronic Data Systems reorganized so that each customer had a single sales contact at the company. That has meant sales representatives have had to forge new relationships with clients, taking more time to complete sales. 

 The company said, nonetheless, that it was confident that it would meet earnings forecasts. E.D.S. is expected to earn 53 cents a share for the second quarter and $2.28 for the full year, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 ''The revenue is out there and we think this is a temporary situation that's isolated to this quarter,'' said Reed Byrum, an E.D.S. spokesman. 

 David Togut, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst, said E.D.S. was on track to save $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, more than the $1 billion the company had earlier told analysts it expected. That is helping make up for the problems the changes are causing with sales, he said. 

 Even so, Mr. Togut also downgraded the stock and cut his price target to $75 a share from $90.

Raytheon agrees to pay

$1 million to settle suit

BOSTON -- Defense contractor Raytheon Co. has agreed to pay more than $1 million to settle federal claims that it failed to do quality control tests on electronic products it sold the government. Raytheon also agreed to fire or otherwise punish 26 employees and the senior management in its Quincy, Mass., plant.

Raytheon reported testing anomalies going back to 1988 in its Electronic Systems division, primarily in the Quincy plant.

Oil prices remain high

despite drop in demand

LONDON -- Despite a springtime drop in demand for oil, crude prices are hovering around $30 per barrel and are likely to stay there in part due to tightness in U.S. gasoline markets, an industry report said Friday.

Refineries are buying as much oil as possible to make gasoline for sale this summer, when many motorists will hit the roads for vacation travel.

But OPEC is giving mixed signals about whether it will boost oil production to help meet that expected demand, so the outlook for cheaper oil in coming months is poor.

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, TALKING STOCKS: Welcome back.  We`re talking today with Donald Selkin of Joseph Gunnar.  You saw McDonald`s (URL: http://www.mcdonalds.com/) on the screen  coming back, taking a big hit, down more than 3.  That`s because the company today announced its sales in the first 5 months  of the year were growing at rate of 5 percent and that does represent a slowdown.  And you know it goes to the point actually that you were making, Donald, a little earlier when you look at these companies and you look at growth.  You got to look at the technology part of the world.  The US economy not making it on hamburgers anymore, is it. 

 DONALD SELKIN, CHIEF MKT. STRATEGIST, JOSEPH GUNNAR:  Absolutely.  The growth rate - and that`s kind of, I guess the eternal debate: value versus growth.  I mean you look at some of these "value stocks," quote, unquote, and the growth rate is just not there.  So even though the multiple is low and they are "cheap," quote, unquote, you know, why do you want to pay, you know, even though it`s a lower multiple for a stock  that really doesn`t have much earnings growth, and that is the problem why stocks like you know McDonald`s, Caterpillar (URL: http://www.caterpillar.com/) , Eastman Kodak (URL: http://www.kodak.com/) ,Boeing (URL: http://www.boeing.com/) are just kind of weight the Dow down and they`re kind of the real heavy components of the Dow that prevent it from you know doing as well as it might. 

 TUCKER:  Let`s get with Richard he`s on the line.  Go ahead please. 

 CALLER:  How are you doing.  My question is, I`m 23-years-oid, I`m pretty new to investing.  I would like your opinion as far as long term between AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) and MCI WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) .  I know AT&T is reaching a 52-week low and it sounds like a good buy; and WorldCom has been kind of on the upbeat in the last week.  I was just wondering what your opinion as far as long-term since I am pretty new to this. 

 SELKIN:  Well you say you`re 23-years-old, and you know, to be blunt about it, I don`t think a 23-year-old should own either one of these stocks. AT&T, like you mentioned, is on, near a 52-week low and when stocks are on a 52-week low, they`re on a low because of a reason.  That the fundamentals are not very, vry good.  Just look at the chart here, it doesn`t look very healthy. 

 WorldCom is a stock that everyone has great things to say: you can mention 20 positive bullet points on it, and the stock hasn`t done anything for a  year and a half; it is just drifting.  And the main reason why neither one of these stocks has done anything is because there is too much competition in the long-distance field, and rates are low, and AT&T tried to get a rate increase and it was turned down by the government. Look at the chart of WorldCom, it`s just drifting lower. 

 If you want a stock that is in this field, related to this field, why don`t you try something in the wireless, like Nokia (URL: http://www.nokia.com/) or Ericsson (URL: http://www.ericsson.com/) , this is where the growth is.  I just don`t see AT&T and WorldCom, especially for a young fellow like yourself who doesn`t need it for retirement, you probably don`t need the dividends, I mean you probably have a good job.  So I would say stay away from both of them and get into something that`s a little more exciting, that you will grow with as you know you go through your 30`s and 40`s; a stock like Nokia and Ericsson, a Qualcomm (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) , something involved in wireless communications, rather than the old-line stocks.  I just don`t see either one. 

 TUCKER:  All righty, terrific.  Amanda is calling from New York; go ahead please. 

 CALLER:  Hi, how are you today.  I have a question.  I was wondering what you thought about Kmart (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) . 

 SELKIN:  Kmart is, I say is kind of a basket case, to be blunt.  It is, the stock has been drifting downwards  for years.  You know, just look at that chart, I mean it`s sad 17 down to 7 - is it cheap at 7? The answer is there is no earnings growth there.  You know, read the - and you have to remember also that the Fed is after the strong consumer spending, so by the Fed raising rates, you know they always talk about you know we have to slow down the growth of consumer spending because consumer spending is two-thirds of GDP.  So there`s a whole bunch of stocks like this.  These retailers, these kind of old-line retailers, that have been around.  Saks (URL: http://www.proffitts.com/) Fifth Avenue is another one.  Kmart. Abercrombie & Fitch (URL: http://www.abercrombie.com/) .  They are really low and I don`t see much hope here, even though it`s at $7; what`s the downside risk?  Sure, you can only go down 7 point, but what`s the upside.  You know, you`d rather get 

 into one of the retailers that has a little more pizzazz to it: perhaps something like a Tiffany (URL: http://www.tiffany.com/) or a Gucci (URL: http://www.gucci.com/) which are more expensive but at least they have better growth rates.  So Kmart I would avoid, even at this level. 

 TUCKER:  Even though they have had a management change up there and they`re trying to turn things around? 

 SELKIN:  Yes. 

 TUCKER:  Or does that make you even more - 

 SELKIN:  Well, I don`t know, that`s obviously the management change is because of what we saw on the screen here.  I just don`t see it.  I mean, you know, once these stocks get beaten down like this, you know, it takes a long time for them to build a base and to regain credibility with the investment community, and I just don`t see anything 

 that`s going to make Kmart do this.  So you know if you want retailers, there are better ones.  But - and even at $7.  I just don`t see much potential. 

 TUCKER:   Russ is on the line from Wisconsin.  Go ahead please. 

 CALLER:  Good afternoon.  Thanks for taking my call.  I`d like your opinion on Owens Corning (URL: http://www.owenscorning.com/) , short and long.  And overall views of management, what they`re doing with asbestos litigations and where you expect to see them go in the next 12-month time frame. 

 SELKIN:  It`s the kind of a stock that one would think should have done better.  It`s in a group that you know the fiber-optic group, you take a stock like GLW (URL: http://www.corning.com/) you know, which has been a great performer, look at Owens Corning, it`s just dropping. 

 TUCKER:  In fact, you know what.  While you`re talking, Donald, if, in the control room you can get GLW to lay up against that, it would be really interesting to take a look at it.  I`m sorry to interrupt you. 

 SELKIN:  Yes, sure.  That is the Corning, I mean the traditional Corning. I mean you can see that one of them has really adapted itself to the way the new economy is, it`s  fiber-optics.  Owens Corning has obviously not, and that is what is causing the stock to really be  down in the, at the lower levels.  If you want to play something in that group, buy GLW, which is Corning. 

 TUCKER:  It`s interesting because we`ve got a theme here, and it has nothing to do with what the stocks are about, and it has to do with what the stocks have done.  People seem to be looking at the markets now and taking a look at stocks that are down near their lows. Which is I guess you know admirable that they are starting to do some homework here.  But you seem to be pointing out you know fairly that I think there`s a reason why they might be low. 

 SELKIN:  Right; look at McDonald`s today, which is dragging the Dow down. McDonald`s is low because they announced that the same-store sales were low.  So is McDonald`s a good stock to buy because you know six months ago it was in the 50`s and 40`s, and now it`s in the 30`s?  I mean, stocks make 52-week lows because of a reason, and you know, sometimes is does pay to bottom fish.  But you know you have to have some fundamental justification for the fact that the earnings growth will start to increase, and in McDonald`s and in Kmart as was mentioned earlier, AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) , I don`t see it in these kind of stocks, and these are kind of you know household names.  AT&T, you know, blue chip Dow stock, has been around forever.  But I don`t see it. I just don`t see it. 

 TUCKER:  We were talking about Owens Corning, put that up for one quick second, and there is - now, there`s Corning. 

 SELKIN:  Right.  I mean I`d rather pay $200 or $190 for a stock that the market by just looking at that chart, the market is showing you that there`s earnings growth, there`s good management, and there`s a good domination of their field I mean because even though - sometimes it pays to buy $190 stock or $180 stock rather than a $15 stock because the $15 stock just might sit there, you know, and it does not matter what the price is; it`s the percentage return on the money you invest. So if you have $10,000 obviously you can`t buy as many shares of a $108 stock as you can of a $15 stock.  But at the end of the year, maybe the $10,000 invested in a $180 stock will get you from 10 to 13; and the $10,000 invested in the $15 stock might be worth you know 9700.  So you know don`t, people, investors should not get scared of high-priced stocks if they`re high-priced for a reason. 

 TUCKER:  All right, we got to get a break in here; 1-800-304-fnet is the number to call.  Donald Selkin is the man answering the phone today; we`ll talk to you in a minute. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Welcome back.  We`re talking today with Donald Selkin.  So let`s get back on the phones and we`ve got Dan on the line, calling in from Ohio. Go ahead please. 

 CALLER:  Yes.  Back around the first of the year, I read an article in the paper that Fruit of the Loom (URL: http://www.fruit.com/) was in receivership. Also read they`d moved their headquarters to the Cayman Islands.  Also read that they were transferring manufacturing operations in the Caribbean and that the Bank of America (URL: http://www.bankamerica.com/) had loaned them $850 million.  So I thought that the stock was just around a buck or something I thought well what the heck, if Bank of America went for it, maybe I should buy it, so I bought a thousand shares.  So I just wanted to know what`s happened since I guess. 

 SELKIN:  This is a stock I think they were in, filed for Chapter 11; it`s  a stock, another one of these kind of depressed stocks.  My advice to you would be if you can get your money out at the price you bought it at,  you would be doing well.  It`s another stock, it`s an old-line name-brand that has not done well; it`s very,  very depressed in price. And again, you know, if you can get your money out, I would say that is the best you can do.  Don`t hold onto this stock forever.  It`s a stock that has been sinking steadily, as I said, once you declare bankruptcy, it`s really not the best thing from a business point-of-view.  So as I said, if you can cut your loss or just get out at even I would say that would be considered a victory. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, and that one is tough because it was basically managed right into bankruptcy. 

 SELKIN:  Right, right. 

 TUCKER:  We`re going to stick with the Dans here; this one is out in Iowa. Go ahead please. 

 CALLER:  Hi, Donald and thanks for taking my call.  I have a question about an individual stock, Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) that I have held for quite sometime.  And I`m kind of concerned about it, and I just wanted to know what your feelings are on it, and if it will gain some more share - momentum? 

 SELKIN:  Well, OK, as we all know, Procter & Gamble made its second profit warning shortfall you know it`s two quarters in a row which is not  very commendable, especially for a stock in the Dow. You also mentioned you had bought it a long time ago, I would imagine from the price you paid for it, several years ago, you are well ahead.  And as you can see on the chart, it made that initial plunge earlier this year, the first profit warning, then it rallied a little bit and now it`s coming down.  Kind of testing the lows again.  I don`t see much hope here.  One of - the Street thought that there would be some earnings in the second quarter, that the stock was on its way to a recovery. And you can see that there the price action showed that there was little bounce from the original decline.  It subsequently had come down again into the mid to low 50`s.  I don`t see much hope; if you`ve owned it from lower levels and you can bear to part with it, I would say 

 this: you know, to me, it looks like dead money for the next several months. So if you don`t have any significant tax implications from it, let`s say a large long-term capital gain that you don`t want to pay by realizing the profit that you`ve owned it for, for several years, if that is not a consideration, I would get into something  else; there are so many better stocks because no matter what have you tied up in it, it`s not going to do anything, it`ll be kind of "dead money," quote, unquote, for the next several months.  So you know take the proceeds of that and get into something else.  I mean I would imagine it`s kind of scraping bottom down here in the low 50`s, but its upside is probably very, very limited over the near-term. 

 TUCKER:  Interesting.  Just taking a rough price range of $60 a share, it has not seen 60 since back in early 1997.  So it`s been a while; the stock has taken a big hit. 

 SELKIN:  Yeah, oh yeah. 

 TUCKER:  Roudy in California, go ahead please. 

 CALLER:  Thanks for taking my call.  I just want to inquire about Rambus (URL: http://www.rambus.com/) . What do you think about long-term holding, a long-term investment for Rambus.  I know it`s been benefiting from Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) ,  at least for the short-term because of the breakthroughs, but what do you think about long-term investment.  And also, a wireless stock, Powerwave Technologies (URL:http://www.powerwave.com/) ? 

 SELKIN:  OK, well Rambus it`s in a great area, it`s in the semiconductor group.  And that has been the hot performer this year aside from the oil drillers.  Look, in a Rambus is the kind of stock that I would advise you to maybe be more active with in buying and selling. In other words, this is a stock that can swing 30, 40, 50, 60 points in a matter of a couple of weeks.  So the point what I`m making is that instead of just sitting on it and holding, you probably increase your rate of return - well, you can see with those swings there on the chart - by perhaps you know buying into areas of weakness, selling it into strength, and kind of trading it back and forth. Longer-term, I think it`s very good, but you are talking about a 3- $400 stock here, at the higher levels, and very few stocks can maintain that level. 

 So I would advise you to treat that stock - it`s -fundamentally I think it`s very good.  It made a tremendous run-up, I mean an historic run-up from late last year into early this year, and then took a tremendous dive.  So you know if you have some astuteness in trading, you might want to try to sell it on days that it rallies and then try to buy it back because I don`t think it`s going to run away to the upside. But I think long-term it is good, but I think you should treat it more like a trading vehicle as a short-term stock. 

 Powerwave Technologies has been a tremendous performer this year in what`s been a kind of so-so market, and I think, again looking at the chart here, that has been a very good one, it`s pulled back from its recent all-time highs; it looks like it`s starting another leg up.  The fundamentals here are very good, and this I  would hold for the long-term. 

 TUCKER:  What do they do, right before we go to break? 

 SELKIN:  Powerwave, they make the equipment for telecommunications. 

 TUCKER:  OK, terrific.  We`ll be back.

 U.S. stocks seen opening higher after PPI.

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were expected to open higher on Friday as financial markets took an optimistic view of key producer price data. 

 The U.S. Labour Department reported the monthly producer price index (PPI) unchanged in May, falling well below Wall Street expectations for a 0.3 percent gain in the headline number. 

 Core PPI, however, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.2 percent, compared to the 0.1 percent gain that U.S. economists had forecast on average. 

 Despite the mixed reading, traders seemed to be seeing the glass as half full, and their optimism helped push major U.S. stock index futures higher. 

 "I think these numbers are bond market-and stock market-friendly," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer, First Albany Corp. 

 "This says that there is not meaningful or significant enough upward pressure on prices at the wholesale level to cause the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes again or to raise interest rates at their June meeting," Johnson added. 

 With less than an hour to go before the opening bell, the Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for September were up 8.80 points at 1,498.00, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures climbed 82 points to 3,872.00. 

 Financial markets have been keenly focused on economic data in recent weeks, searching for hints that the U.S. economy's blazing pace of growth may be cooling and that the Federal Reserve's recent spate of interest rate hikes may be nearing an end. 

 U.S. equities rallied sharply last Friday after U.S. employment data for May showed a gain in unemployment and softer-than-expected increase in average hourly earnings. 

 The tame data prompted speculation the six Fed rate hikes of the past year were taking effect, and markets applauded the notion that further aggressive tightening in monetary policy might not be necessary. 

 But traders said the market could continue the choppy, sideways trading seen throughout much of the past week, and market players would remain on the lookout for further data on inflation or economic growth. 

 "When you look at the calendar next week, there is a lot more data out (for investors to focus on), said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates. 

 Brown added that recent comments from Fed officials do not indicate the Fed is convinced yet that the U.S. economy's pace is easing sufficiently. 

 Financial markets will be keeping an eye out for consumer price data, which is set for release next week. 

 On Thursday, U.S. markets sagged as an earnings warning by consumer products giant Procter & Gamble and cautious comments from Wall Street analysts prompted profit-taking ahead Friday's economic data. 

 Trading was subdued but in line with recent trends as consumer products, bank and defence shares shot lower, along with some weakness in technology stocks that pulled all major indexes down. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 144.14 points, or 1.33 percent, at 10,668.72 - dragged down by shares of Procter & Gamble following the company's profit warning. J.P. Morgan & Co. , Honeywell International and United Technologies also dropped. 

 Weakness in tech leaders Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. pulled the Nasdaq composite into negative territory, with the index ending down 13.70 points, or 0.36 percent, at 3,825.56. 

 AT&T Corp. was in the news again on Friday, after the Wall Street Journal reported Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said he expects to resubmit some long-distance rate changes for tens of millions of customers because the changes are vital to meeting revenue projections. 

 Earlier this week, the company backed off on price hikes for its basic calling plan after federal regulators expressed dissatisfaction with the move. AT&T closed at 35-1/4 on Thursday.

 ATLANTA, June 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Profit Recovery Group International Inc. , battered by a recent profit warning, continued to slide on Friday after a U.S. brokerage cut its earnings estimates for the Atlanta-based business services firm. 

 Shares of Profit Recovery, which provides accounts payable and other audit systems to customers around the world, were down 5/8 to 14-7/16 near midday on the Nasdaq stock market. 

 The shares fell 15 percent on Thursday. The stock has fallen from about $26 a share since the company announced in late March that its first-and second-quarter revenue and earnings results would fall short of Wall Street forecasts. 

 New-York based brokerage Goldman Sachs said on Friday it had cut its earnings estimates for Profit Recovery to $1.04 per share from $1.07 for 2000, and to $1.35 from $1.45 for 2001. 

 The brokerage maintained its "market outperformer" rating on the stock. 

Profit Recovery has said its profit warning was prompted by a series of tax workers' strikes in France, which effectively halted the company's ability to invoice its French customers for tax services. 

 That explanation, however, failed to sway a group of lawyers who recently filed a class-action suit on behalf of Profit Recovery shareholders who purchased the company's common stock between Feb. 16 and March 29. 

 "The lawsuit charges Profit Recovery and certain of its officers with violations of the federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading financial statements for the company's 1999 fiscal fourth quarter on Feb. 16, 2000," Berman DeValerio & Pease, a law firm with offices in Boston and San Francisco, said in a press release this week.

 U.S. stocks seen up at open, but all eyes on PPI.

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were expected to open slightly higher on Friday, but the market will likely take its cues from key inflation data, which many hope will give clues to the extent of further interest rates hikes. 

 Traders were anxiously awaiting the release of the Producer Prices Index (PPI), set for release at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT). 

 U.S. economists in a Reuters survey predicted that PPI rose 0.3 percent overall in May, following a 0.3 percent drop in the prior month. Excluding volatile food and energy items, they saw PPI up 0.1 percent, unchanged from the April figure. 

 With more than an hour to go before the opening bell, the Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for September were up 4.90 points at 1,493.80, while the Nasdaq 100 index futures climbed 49 points to 3,839.00. 

 "Obviously, PPI will be painting today's trade...but we are looking firmer right now," said Bryan Piskorowski at Prudential Securities. 

 A benign reading from the report could underscore recent data showing the U.S. economy's blazing pace of growth may be cooling and that the Federal Reserve's recent spate of interest rate hikes may be nearing an end. 

 U.S. equities rallied sharply last Friday after U.S. employment data for May showed a gain in unemployment and softer-than-expected increase in wages, prompting speculation the six Fed rate hikes of the past year were taking effect. 

 Piskorowski noted, however, that the market is likely to continue the choppy, sideways trading seen throughout much of the past week, and that market players would remain cautious until further data are available. 

 Financial markets are particularly focused on consumer price data due next week. 

 On Thursday, U.S. markets sagged as an earnings warning by consumer products giant Procter & Gamble and cautious comments from Wall Street analysts prompted profit-taking ahead Friday's economic data.

 In other news, MP3.com Inc. and Warner Brothers music group, an arm of Time Warner Inc. , announced on Friday they had settled their copyright dispute, and MP3.com said Warner had granted it a license for the My.MP3.com service. MP3.com closed on Thursday at 17-1/4, while Time Warner finished at 79-15/16.

 NEW YORK, June 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks stayed in positive territory in late morning trading on Friday as investors applauded tame inflation data and technology stocks got a boost from strong demand. 

 Gains in computer giant Hewlett-Packard helped underpin the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI), which rose 52 points, or 0.49 percent, to 10,720. 

 The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC), meanwhile, clung near its highs for the day, up 60 points, or 1.56 percent at 3,885. 

 Although the producer price (PPI) index gave a mixed reading of the U.S. inflation picture, traders opted to take an optimistic view, hoping signs that prices are in check will stay the Federal Reserve's hand on interest rates. 

 "There's some relief that the numbers were not worse," said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at Boston-based PanAgora Asses Management Inc. "There seems to be some misplaced optimism in the market that the Fed is going to stop." 

 Computer heavyweight and Dow 30 component Hewlett-Packard was in the lead with a hefty gain of 4-3/16 to 130-1/16. Hewlett-Packard and SmartServ Online Inc. said they plan to partner on wireless services, targeting a global financial market. 

 Also lifting the blue chip index were shares of Johnson & Johnson, which gained 2-1/2 to 87-3/8. The European Commission said on Friday it had cleared a joint venture between Johnson & Johnson and Mercury Asset Management, part of Merrill Lynch. 

 Not everyone was benefiting from the broader market buying spree, however. Earlier in the day, Electronic Data Systems slumped 13-2-1/16 at 44-11/16 after the company said it expects disappointing second-quarter earnings. 

 The stock recently peaked at almost $77 per share in early February. 

 AT&T Corp. slipped 5/8 to 34-5/8 after its chairman said he expects to resubmit some long-distance phone rate changes for tens of millions of customers because they are vital to meeting the company's revenue projections, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 Earlier this week, AT&T backed off on price hikes for its basic calling plan after federal regulators expressed dissatisfaction with the move. 

 Among high-tech shares, MP3.com Inc. climbed 3-1/8 to 20-3/8 after it announced settlement of a copyright dispute with Warner Brothers music group, an arm of Time Warner Inc. and that Warner had granted it a license for the My.MP3.com service. 

 The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .IXB) blazed higher, up 46 points, or 4.35 percent, at 1,116. 

 On Thursday, stocks sagged as an earnings warning by consumer products giant Procter & Gamble and cautious comments from Wall Street analysts prompted profit-taking ahead Friday's economic reports. 

 Markets have been keenly focused on economic data in recent weeks, searching for hints that the economy's blazing pace of growth may be cooling and that the Federal Reserve's recent spate of interest rate hikes may be nearing an end. 

 Stocks soared last Friday after employment data for May showed a gain in the jobless rate and softer-than-expected increase in average hourly wages. 

 The tame data prompted speculation that the six interest-rate hikes by the Fed over the past year were taking effect, and Wall Street applauded the notion that further aggressive monetary tightening might not be necessary. 

 Merrill Lynch chief economist Bruce Steinberg said there is no significant inflationary pressure, and today's PPI data did not change the firm's view that the Fed will remain on hold at its policy meeting on June 27-28. 

 "The Fed is concerned about the strength of the economy and the tightness of the labour market," Steinberg wrote in a research report. 

 "Over the past two months, economic data suggests that economic growth has downshifted into a more sustainable pace and the labour market is not as tight as previously thought," he added.

 UPDATE1-Profit Recovery comfortable with Q2 EPS forecast.

 ATLANTA, June 9 (Reuters) - Profit Recovery Group International Inc., a U.S. business services firm battered by a recent profit warning, said on Friday it was comfortable with consensus earnings estimates for the second quarter even though it would likely fall short of previous revenue targets. 

 Atlanta-based Profit Recovery, which provides accounts payable and other audit systems to customers around the world, "reaffirmed its comfort level" with a consensus forecast that it would earn 26 cents per share in the three months ended June 30, 2000. 

 The company predicted revenue would be about $110 million for the period, lower than analysts' previous consensus estimates. It attributed the shortfall to the impact of currency fluctuations in Europe and longer billing cycles in its government-based business. 

 "Approximately one-third of Profit Recovery Group's business is outside of the U.S.," Profit Recovery Chairman and Chief Executive John Cook said in a statement. "Of that, we believe the majority is affected by the weakness in the Euro-denominated currency and the (British) pound." 

 Cook added that currency fluctuations should lower the company's expenses by the same ratio as the drop in revenue. He also noted that Profit Recovery was finding "efficiencies" in other areas of its business. 

 Profit Recovery, which announced in late March that first-and second-quarter revenue and earnings results would fall short of Wall Street forecasts, earned $2 million, or 4 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2000. 

 On Friday, New-York based brokerage Goldman Sachs said it had cut its earnings estimates for the Atlanta firm to $1.04 per share from $1.07 for 2000, and to $1.35 from $1.45 for 2001. 

 The brokerage maintained its "market outperformer" rating on the stock, which has tumbled from about $26 a share since the profit warning was issued. 

 Profit Recovery gained 9/16 to 15-5/8 in late-afternoon trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange. On Thursday, the stock shed about 15-percent of its market value. 

Profit Recovery has said its March profit warning was prompted by a series of tax workers' strikes in France, which effectively halted the company's ability to invoice its French customers for tax services. 

 That explanation, however, has failed to sway a group of lawyers who recently filed a class-action suit on behalf of Profit Recovery shareholders who purchased the company's common stock between Feb. 16 and March 29. 

 "The lawsuit charges Profit Recovery and certain of its officers with violations of the federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading financial statements for the company's 1999 fiscal fourth quarter on Feb. 16, 2000," Berman DeValerio & Pease, a law firm with offices in Boston and San Francisco, said in a press release this week.

Procter & Gamble fires CEO after only a year and a half

NEW YORK - Procter & Gamble Co. said Thursday that its chief executive is stepping down after only 17 months.

In announcing the departure of Durk Jager, the largest U.S. household products maker warned of disappointing earnings for the second quarter in a row. The axing of Jager, 57, who was also chairman and president, follows months of turmoil at P&G, once a haven for investors seeking steady profit growth.

"Durk Jager tried to take the company down a different track from what you would call P&G's historical norm," said Rob Izmirlian, a consumer products analyst at S&P. "But it didn't work out the way he envisioned."

In a move seen as refocusing the company on its core soap and personal-care businesses, P&G brought back John Pepper, 61, as chairman. Pepper was chairman and CEO from 1995 to 1999. The company named another of its veterans, Alan Lafley, 52, as president and CEO.

Shares of the Cincinnati-based maker of brand-name goods such as Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste tumbled 9.7 percent on the news that it expected to miss its quarterly profit estimate, after a similar warning for the previous three months.

Jager's jump into new products and businesses sputtered, giving P&G its first decline in operating profit in eight years.

The expansion initiative included ill-fated talks in January on a three-way merger with Warner-Lambert Co. and American Home Products Corp.

The company said it expects core diluted earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter, ending June 30, to be little changed from the year-earlier period, when they came in at 55 cents.

Analysts had estimated earnings of 64 cents. The company previously had said that it expected a 15 to 17 percent increase.

P&G attributed the expected earnings shortfall to lower-volume growth, competitive pressures and reduced marketing support in key businesses.

Sales are expected to grow by 2 to 3 percent, down from an April estimate of 5 to 7 percent.

In the third quarter, P&G's operating profit dropped 11 percent to $923 million. It blamed higher-than-expected raw material costs and a delay in U.S. approval of an osteoporosis drug.

Lafley said the magnitude and pace of change P&G undertook was a major factor in its results. Under Jager, P&G introduced such products as Swiffer detergent and the Dryel home dry-cleaning kit, and acquired the Iams line of pet products.

Lafley said his priority is to return P&G's big, core businesses to consistent year-to-year sales and profit growth.

NEW YORK - Procter & Gamble Co. said Thursday that its chief executive is stepping down after only 17 months.

In announcing the departure of Durk Jager, the largest U.S. household products maker warned of disappointing earnings for the second quarter in a row.

The axing of Jager, 57, who was also chairman and president, follows months of turmoil at P&G, once a haven for investors looking for steady profit growth.

"Durk Jager tried to take the company down a different track from what you would call P&G's historical norm," said Rob Izmirlian, a consumer products analyst at S&P. "But it didn't work out the way he envisioned."

In a move seen as refocusing the company on its core soap and personal-care businesses, P&G brought back John Pepper, 61, as chairman. Pepper was chairman and CEO from 1995 to 1999, when Jager replaced him.

The company named another of its veterans, Alan Lafley, 52, as president and CEO. He was previously president of the global beauty care and North American divisions.

Shares of the Cincinnati-based maker of brand-name goods such as Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste tumbled 9.7 percent on the news that it expected to miss its quarterly profit estimate, after a similar warning for the previous three months.

Jager's jump into new products and businesses sputtered, giving P&G its first decline in operating profit in eight years.

The expansion initiative included ill-fated talks in January on a three-way merger with Warner-Lambert Co. and American Home Products Corp. A sharp drop in the company's stock price signaled the market's displeasure with P&G's attempt to make a bold foray into pharmaceuticals.

The company said it expects core diluted earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter, ending June 30, to be little changed from the year-earlier period, when they came in at 55 cents.

Analysts had estimated earnings of 64 cents. The company previously had said that it expected a 15 to 17 percent increase.

P&G shares dropped $6.125 to $56.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, less than half their 52-week high of $118.375 and not far from their yearly low of 53.

P&G attributed the expected earnings shortfall to lower-volume growth, competitive pressures and reduced marketing support in key businesses.

Sales are expected to grow by 2 to 3 percent, down from an April estimate of 5 to 7 percent.

In the third quarter, P&G's operating profit dropped 11 percent to $923 million. It blamed higher-than-expected raw material costs and a delay in U.S. approval of an osteoporosis drug.

Lafley said the magnitude and pace of change P&G undertook in the current fiscal year was a major factor in its disappointing results. Under Jager, P&G introduced such products as Swiffer detergent and the Dryel home dry-cleaning kit, and acquired the Iams line of pet products.

"Scads of new products is not what creates enthusiasm with this equity," said an analyst who requested anonymity.

"What investors want from P&G is a boringly predictable earnings stream, which means investment behind the core brands Tide, Pampers and Crest," said William Steele, consumer products analyst at Banc of America Securities.

Sally Dessloch of J.P. Morgan Securities said investors want to see P&G address the issues it faces in its core businesses and not undertake any sizable acquisitions for now. "For a company the size of P&G, focus is a good thing," she said.

Lafley said his priority is to return P&G's big, core businesses to consistent year-to-year sales and profit growth.

Over the next six weeks, he said, he will sort through established and new businesses to achieve a balanced portfolio that will drive profit and revenue growth. He added that he will focus on the "tough choices" needed for better cost control.

 Column One: Hard Sell: Teaching DaimlerChrysler Wall Street's Rules --- Detroit Executive Makes Progress, but Stock Drops --- `I'm a Hired Gun for Shareholders'

 STUTTGART, Germany -- To Wall Street investors, DaimlerChrysler Controller James Donlon is "our man in Stuttgart" -- a veteran Detroit executive brought here to infuse the company with American-style financial management.   

 So far, it has proved a thankless job.   

 After several lackluster quarters, DaimlerChrysler shares have tumbled to nearly half the level reached in the heady days following the global auto maker's birth. The stock drop has rendered many executives' stock options worthless.   

 The plummeting stock has sparked frustration and finger pointing in the company's boardroom. DaimlerChrysler's chairman, Juergen Schrempp, an early European disciple of shareholder value, says angry investors send him e-mail asking, "What the hell is the stock price doing?" Even one of his sons phoned to complain about the share price. "Our stock is not performing well," Mr. Schrempp concedes, "and I have to face the music."   

 Mr. Donlon, the highest-ranking American at DaimlerChrysler headquarters, came to Stuttgart 16 months ago to teach the company how to play by Wall Street's rules. The man who helped rescue Chrysler in the early 1990s by finding novel ways to cut costs flew in American consultants. He introduced a new financial lexicon. He pushed for tougher internal measures of profitability, and repeated to everyone his mantra: speed and transparency.   

 Then German resistance set in, forcing Mr. Donlon to let up a bit. DaimlerChrysler executives refused to issue a profit warning, and some unit managers chafed at the new system for measuring their performance. Mr. Donlon did get the company to release annual results a month earlier this year than last, and had hoped to shave off another month next year. But his German colleagues contended that a full month was too radical, so he's settling for an improvement of eight to 10 days.   

 Mr. Donlon's experience helps explain why DaimlerChrysler has disappointed investors. It also shows that the gap between European and American treatment of shareholders remains wide. "Over 30 years, I have resigned myself to the fact that employees are responsible to the people who put money in," he says during an interview in his utilitarian office on the ground floor of DaimlerChrysler's sprawling headquarters here. "I'm a hired gun for the shareholders."   

 That attitude remains far from universal in German business, so Mr. Donlon picks his fights with care. "There are hundreds of employees here who feel threatened by the change to the new world order," says the 53-year-old, whose penchant for straight talk, though beloved on Wall Street, gives some German colleagues the jitters. "They're coming along," Mr. Donlon adds, "but they are understandably reluctant and resistant, given the awesome magnitude of the global changes."   

 As other American executives try to get their foreign operations to pay more heed to Wall Street, they are watching Mr. Donlon's struggle with interest. "Being in international a bit myself, I can appreciate what he's trying to go through," says Phil Cieslik, a Motorola Inc. vice president who once invited Mr. Donlon to address his staff on how Chrysler's finance department reduced its costs. "It's kind of hard to walk in there and say to somebody, `There's probably a more efficient way of doing things.'"   

 DaimlerChrysler insiders say Mr. Donlon's feistiness has made him a favorite of Mr. Schrempp, who is known for directness and quick action. Mr. Donlon is among only a handful of people not on DaimlerChrysler's management board who regularly attend its meetings. Observers say he comes prepared and willing to speak his mind. "At the old Daimler-Benz, it wasn't always a good idea to speak frankly," says one former executive. "But Donlon has a lot of respect, and can get away with it."   

 A native of Seattle with an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, Mr. Donlon stands out if only because there are so few American executives in Stuttgart. At the time of the merger, DaimlerChrysler executives planned to bring over up to a dozen senior Americans. Then, one by one, they made their excuses: Their children were in school; their spouses couldn't leave. Mr. Donlon was different: His three children were in university, his wife didn't work, and he liked the idea of living abroad. An avid hiker and skier, he is quick to hop in his company-issue Mercedes S-class and head to Zermatt in Switzerland and the area around the Matterhorn.   

 At first, he was something of a curiosity in Stuttgart. He didn't speak German, though he met his wife in a university German class and is now studying the language again. He started work each day at 5:30 a.m.; around Stuttgart, 8:00 is the norm. He drank coffee out of a mug instead of the small white cups provided in the executive offices. He had almost-cliche American interests, including a ranch in Colorado with 320 head of cattle.   

 A reputation for financial efficiency preceded him. In the early 1990s, when Chrysler was immersed in one of its brushes with ruin, Mr. Donlon translated Toyota Motor Corp.'s famously efficient approach to production to financial processes. He computerized tasks such as travel-expense accounting so his staff would waste less time on clerical work.   

 He introduced new ways of thinking, showing that it was a mistake to evaluate the cost of introducing a new car color by calculating only the price of the paint. When Chrysler, at the urging of Mr. Donlon's group, looked also at the paint's propensity to chip and the cost of cleaning paint machines, it discovered that new colors might sell a few more cars, but reduced profits. Others had called such colors "incremental winners," says Dave Meador, who worked for Mr. Donlon at the time. "What we were able to show was that it was an incremental loss. It led to premium pricing on certain options."   

 While Mr. Donlon was at Chrysler, Mr. Schrempp was ruffling feathers by pushing the concept of shareholder value. In 1993, Daimler-Benz AG became the first German firm to list on the New York Stock Exchange, which meant more disclosure than is common in Europe. Mr. Schrempp likes to tell how, in 1995, he asked 10 of the company's managers to state the company's stock price. "Seven didn't know it," he says. "Three were wrong."   

 By July 1998, two months after the merger was announced, there were signs of change in Germany. A team of top Chrysler executives visited Stuttgart to tour Daimler-Benz's facilities. One hot afternoon, the group was sitting in a garage listening to the head of a unit that restores old Mercedes. Mr. Donlon's hand shot up. "That's fine, but is it worth the investment?" he asked. The German manager had a quick answer: "A 40% return," he said. Mr. Donlon began clapping, and the whole group joined in.   

 Eight months later, Mr. Donlon moved to Stuttgart as a senior vice president. In one of his first meetings, he described his goals as "much more" and "faster," recalls Lukas Vogt, senior manager of corporate controlling and process development. Though a Donlon fan, Mr. Vogt concedes that some in Stuttgart wish the American would slow down. "There are some people who say, `I'm not ready with my last task, and then he starts on a new one,'" Mr. Vogt explains.   

 Among the biggest problems Mr. Donlon saw was that Daimler-Benz didn't report annual financial results until March. At Chrysler, his goal was to give the chief financial officer the company's results so fast that he could carry them in his tuxedo breast pocket at the Detroit Auto Show, in early January. Quick reporting, Mr. Donlon believes, gives a company a head start on planning and reassures investors that a company has its business under control.   

 But DaimlerChrysler had a bottleneck: The staffers who compiled past results also handled plans for future spending. There was little impetus to plan early because the numbers didn't go to the company's supervisory board until January, slowing the completion of the annual results.   

 Determined to pick up the pace, Mr. Donlon ordered his staff to get the planning work done by the end of December so they could then crunch end-of-year results. He then asked Mr. Schrempp's staff if they could schedule a supervisory board meeting in late December to receive financial-planning projections.   

 "He'll never be able to do that," his staff whispered, according to Mr. Donlon. They were wrong; the board scheduled the meeting and his staff's doubt turned to shock. "Everybody felt like, `Oh my God. Now we do have to deliver,'" Mr. Donlon recalls. "And they did."   

 DaimlerChrysler reported its annual results on Feb. 28 this year -- a full month earlier than it did in 1999, though still more than a month behind General Motors Corp. and General Electric Co.   

 Mr. Donlon has had plenty of help in this crusade. Hilmar Kopper, the former chairman of Deutsche Bank who now chairs DaimlerChrysler's supervisory board, has been campaigning to persuade German companies to get as nimble as American firms. Before Mr. Donlon's arrival, DaimlerChrysler had formed a 10-member "fast-close" team -- as in a fast financial closing. It included two outside consultants. Mr. Donlon asked the team what company DaimlerChrysler most resembled. General Electric, they said. So he declared GE the benchmark for DaimlerChrysler's finance staff. Now, every time GE issues a quarterly earnings report, Mr. Donlon prints copies off the Web and hands them to a colleague. "Just browsing the Internet," he says, brandishing the report. "Here it is." DaimlerChrysler's first quarter results were issued April 19 this year; GE's came six days earlier.   

 Not everything goes Mr. Donlon's way. For months, in fact, the company has been rocked by an internal debate: Why have its shares tanked?   

 At first, the shares suffered because Standard & Poor's doesn't include foreign-based companies in its index of 500 corporations. So mutual funds that track the S&P 500 sold DaimlerChrysler. Most Wall Street analysts turned coverage of the company over to colleagues in London and Frankfurt.   

 Later, there was an internal argument about how much to preview the company's quarterly earnings for analysts. In early spring 1999, it became clear to DaimlerChrysler executives that their second-quarter results wouldn't be as rosy as investors were expecting. Mr. Donlon wanted to issue a warning -- a move that would surely cause the share price to fall but might pre-empt a deeper decline if the company surprised the market.   

 The company didn't take his advice. Indeed, company officials were still making bullish statements about the second quarter only days before the results were issued in early July. When DaimlerChrysler did post the numbers, the stock price fell 9%. It dropped an additional 7% the next day.   

 That sparked a debate among top executives about whether the disaster was a result of bad financial results, poor communication with Wall Street or a combination of the two. The company said publicly that it was all a big misunderstanding. Mr. Donlon says it was more than that -- and more than even a timely warning could have cured. "The financial markets are brutal. If you've got good numbers, you can deliver them in a brown paper bag," he says. "If you've got bad numbers, no amount of communication is going to help you."   

 To goad managers into improving their results, DaimlerChrysler is now measuring performance more rigorously. In the mid- 1990s, Mr. Schrempp replaced the traditional barometer of operating profit with a complex indicator known as "return on capital employed," and demanded that each business unit turn in a 12% return - or face being sold off.   

 But Mr. Donlon felt the measure left managers too much wiggle room. So he convinced DaimlerChrysler to adopt a stricter measure called "return on net assets," or RONA, which, for operating units, is pretax operating income divided by net assets. "The calculation can come right from the financial statement," he says. "There are fewer adjustments." Managers are to earn at least as much as the company's cost of capital, or at least 15.5% pretax.   

 At first, some managers resisted. Others gave in. In the past, says Helmut Petri, head of manufacturing for Mercedes-Benz cars, the company would increase investment to increase output to meet strong demand. Now, he feels pressure to increase output while limiting new investment. That means making the work force more flexible by, for instance, laying on extra shifts when sales heat up. "Everything is much more goal-oriented than it used to be," he says.   

 Albert Kirchmann, chief financial officer of the company's power-train business, agrees. Like Mercedes-Benz, the unit has added a shift to increase RONA. Walking around the factory floor, he points to specific pieces of equipment and reminds supervisors that for every euro the company spends, it wants at least 1.20 euros returned. "What we are trying to do with Mr. Donlon," he says, "is to bring the two worlds together -- the pragmatic Americans with the analytical Germans."   

 Despite these efforts -- nearly all major business units now meet the RONA goal -- shares in DaimlerChrysler continue to fall. On Thursday, they closed at 60.56 euros each in Frankfurt trading, about 30% below where they stood last June. In New York trading, they've fallen 33%. "Some here could easily say that despite all your preaching, it doesn't work," Mr. Donlon concedes.   

 He is chastened but not defeated. "I go to work each day saying, `I will not get discouraged. I will just try to make forward progress and hopefully, in time, they'll come around to see this,'" he says. "But I would be the first to acknowledge there's only so much you can do."

 P&G ISSUES  PROFIT WARNING  AS IT BOOTS CEO DURK JAGER EXITS AFTER 17 TROUBLED MONTHS AT THE HELM OF PROCTER & GAMBLE.

 NEW YORK -- Procter & Gamble Co. on Thursday said its chief executive was stepping down after only 17 months at the helm of the largest U.S. household-products maker as it warned investors of disappointing earnings for the second quarter in a row. 

 The departure of Durk Jager, 57, who also was chairman and president, marks the culmination of months of turmoil at P&G, once a bastion of conservative management and a longtime haven for investors looking for steady profit growth. 

 Under Jager's tenure, the Cincinnati-based maker of brand-name goods such as Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste posted its first decline in operating profit in eight years and began a sputtering push into new products and businesses. 

 The initiative included ill-fated talks in January over a three- way merger with Warner-Lambert Co. and American Home Products Corp., as P&G flirted with a bold foray into pharmaceuticals. But a sharp drop in the company's stock price signaled the market's displeasure with such a shift. 

 "Durk Jager tried to take the company down a different track from what you would call P&G's historical norm," said Rob Izmirlian, a consumer-products analyst at Standard & Poor's. "But it didn't work out the way he envisioned." 

 John Pepper, 61, a former chief executive of the company, was named to succeed Jager as chairman of the board, effective immediately. Alan Lafley, 52, president-global beauty care and North America, will take over as president, chief executive and a director. 

 The company, in announcing the change at the top, said it expected earnings per share for the its fourth quarter, ending June 30, to be little changed from the year-earlier period, when earnings came in at 55 cents. Analysts had estimated earnings of 64 cents for the current quarter. 

 Investors sent shares of P&G tumbling after the news. The stock closed at $56.75, down $6.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.  P&G attributed the expected earnings shortfall to lower volume growth, competitive pressures and reduced marketing support on several key businesses. Sales are expected to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent, down from an April estimate of 5 percent to 7 percent growth for the current quarter. 

 "What investors want from P&G is a boringly predictable earnings stream," said William Steele, consumer-products analyst at Banc of America Securities. He said P&G has been investing too much in new products and acquisitions and not enough in its core brands.

 Procter & Gamble Co. on Thursday said its chief executive was stepping down after only 17 months at the helm of the largest U.S. household products maker, as it warned of disappointing earnings for the second quarter in a row. 

 The departure of 57-year-old Durk Jager, who was also chairman and president, marks the culmination of months of turmoil at P&G, once a bastion of conservative management and a longtime haven for investors looking for steady profit growth. 

 "Durk Jager tried to take the company down a different track from what you would call P&G's historical norm," said Rob Izmirlian, a consumer products analyst at S&P. "But it didn't work out the way he envisioned." 

 In a move seen as refocusing the company on its core soap and personal-care businesses, P&G brought back John Pepper, 61, as chairman. Pepper had served as chairman and CEO from 1995 to 1999, when Jager replaced him. It named another company veteran, Alan Lafley, 52, to take over as president and CEO. He was previously president-global beauty care and North America. 

 The Cincinnati-based maker of brand-name goods such as Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste also said it expects earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ending June 30 to be little changed from the year-earlier earnings of 55 cents a share. 

 Analysts were expecting 64 cents for the latest quarter. The company previously said it expected a 15% to 17% increase. 

 The news sent shares in P&G down $4.38 to close at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, pulling other blue chips down with it. Since P&G reached its 52-week high of $118.38 in January, the company's stock has dropped 52%. 

 P&G attributed the expected earnings shortfall to lower volume growth, competitive pressures and reduced marketing support on several key businesses. Sales are expected to grow by 2% to 3%, down from an April estimate of 5% to 7% for the current quarter. 

 Under Jager's tenure, P&G posted its first decline in operating profit in eight years and began a sputtering push into new products and businesses.

 Lafley said the magnitude and pace of change P&G undertook in the current fiscal year was a major factor in its disappointing results. 

 "What investors want from P&G is a boringly predictable earnings stream, which means investment behind core brands: Tide, Pampers and Crest," said William Steele, consumer products analyst at Banc of America Securities. 

 Lafley said his priority is to return P&G's big, core businesses to consistent year-to-year sales and profit growth. Over the next six weeks, he said, he will sort through established and new businesses to make choices on investments and ensure a balanced portfolio that will drive profit and revenue growth. He said he would focus on the "tough choices" needed for better cost control. 

 "We will hold sales, research and administration [costs] flat on established businesses next year," Lafley told analysts after the announcement, adding that he would cap cost growth for new businesses in the low single-digit percentage range next year. 

 Jager, who is officially retiring July 1, said in a statement that it was a personal decision to step aside. "It's unfortunate our progress in stepping up top-line sales growth resulted in earnings disappointments," he said. 

 For the fiscal year, P&G said it expected core net earnings per share to grow about 4% from the previous year. 

 It lowered its outlook for fiscal 2001, saying earnings growth was expected to be 11% to 13% above the new fiscal 2000 estimate. Analysts, who welcomed the revision as more realistic, said P&G's previous estimate had been for 13% to 15% growth. 

 Merrill Lynch, in a research note issued Thursday, said P&G may see its results in the June quarter hurt by slow growth categories. It also mentioned the impact of the weak euro against the dollar. The currency effect reduces the U.S. dollar value of revenues generated in Europe for U.S. corporations.

 Bob McNulty has been in the investment game for decades, so when the market is in sloppy shape and a touch of fear is in the air, he resorts to the calm recitation of Yogi Berra lines. 

 "We may be lost, but we're making good time," McNulty quoted the former New York Yankee catcher in trying to capsulize current Wall Street conditions. A profit warning by household giant Procter & Gamble and the hoopla surrounding the division of Microsoft had the market on edge yesterday. 

 "We're making a bottom," McNulty said, "but it will take time. It may be three or four more months." 

 McNulty, who has mentioned the "R" word (retirement) more than once in recent years, is a co-founder of Coldstream Capital Management in Bellevue. His greatest claim to fame may be from his teenage years, when he beat out the older Curt Flood for the batting championship in an Oakland, Calif., American Legion league. Flood became a famous major-league baseball player. 

 McNulty said any Federal Reserve Board action on interest rates in June or August will affect the market's recovery. But he said the market may have to form a triple bottom -- a deep decline followed by a recovery and drop followed by another recovery and drop -- before conditions are right for a serious resumption of the bull market. 

 Stocks, expected to fluctuate yesterday based on Wednesday's Microsoft decision, declined on fears of economic trouble. 

 Procter & Gamble, the nation's leading purveyor of household goods, jettisoned its chief executive and said financial results won't meet expectations. That spooked the market in general more than the fallout from the federal court ruling that Microsoft should be sliced in two. In addition, traders were worried about economic news regarding today's wholesale-prices report. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average, of which P&G is a component, fell 144.14 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,668.72. About 30 of those points were Procter & Gamble's. The Nasdaq composite index held up better, easing 13.70 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,825.56. 

 Microsoft shares were up in early trading and gradually turned red as they followed the market down. The Redmond software giant closed at $68.813, off $1.688. Boeing stock slipped 37.5 cents to $38.188. Microsoft and Boeing are Dow components; Microsoft also is in the Nasdaq. 

 Among other Northwest stocks, Merix, an Oregon maker of printed circuit boards, said profit would be double expectations. The shares skipped $13.125, or 41 percent, to $45. 

 Data Critical, a Bothell maker of portable communications gear for the health-care industry, jumped $3.188, or 28 percent, to $14.75. A Wall Street analyst began coverage of the stock with a "strong buy" rating. 

 Cellular Technical Services, a support company for the wireless industry, added $1.188 to $10. The Seattle stock has been moving the past few days on word that a legal settlement will add 53 cents a share to profit. 

 Click2learn, a Bellevue company involved in computer training, advanced $1.313 to $13.813 on word the number of available jobs in information technology continues to grow. 

 Some Internet-related stocks did well. F5 Networks, a Seattle company that helps sort traffic on the Internet, gained $4.938 to $47.438. Digimarc, which provides coding for a variety of visual content, rose $4.125 to $37.375. Extended Systems, on a run since it agreed to supply Intel, leaped $7.375 to $72.25. Extended makes products for hand-held computers. 

 Biotechs were divided. Seattle's Corixa, which agreed to a collaboration on drug development, bounded $3.375 to $43.375. But Immunex lost $3.688 to $32.625 and Targeted Genetics fell 68.8 to $11.25. Both of those stocks were recent big winners. 

 A bigger percentage loser was Concur Technologies. The Redmond company whose software automates employee-benefit forms, said it was cutting its work force and making other significant changes. The stock, worth nearly $45 last July, fell 56.3 cents, or 10 percent, to $5. 

 Trendwest Resorts fell $1.875 to $23.938. It appeared to be returning some of its recent climb from $23 to $26. 

 Western Wireless of Bellevue sank $3.875 to $55.125. A brokerage cut its rating to "attractive" from "buy." 

 Nordstrom eased $1.375 to $24.313. A slowing economy could affect retailers first.

 STOCKS EDGED LOWER THURSDAY after a profit warning and management shakeup at Procter & Gamble spooked blue-chip stocks. 

 Trading volume remained light in the stock and bond markets ahead of Friday's Labor Department report on wholesale prices in May. 

 Economists on average expect the May producer price index to be up 0.3 percent, reversing a 0.3 percent decline in April. They predict that the core PPI--absent volatile food and energy components--will be up just 0.1 percent, equal to the April increase. 

 Meanwhile, U.S. stocks came under some pressure after the European Central Bank boosted short-term interest rates in Europe by a half percentage point, to 4.25 percent. 

 Although the euro slipped on the news, analysts said the greater-than-expected rate hike could bolster the euro and divert capital toward European stocks and bonds, especially if U.S. ecomomic growth slows. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 144.14, or 1.3 percent, to 10,668.72, on New York Stock Exchange volume of 846 million shares. Losing stocks outnumbered winners by a slim 15-13 margin among NYSE-listed issues. 

 The Nasdaq composite index slipped 13.70, to 3825.56, on Nasdaq volume of 1.39 billion shares. Losing stocks topped winners by 7-6. 

 Procter & Gamble, one of the 30 Dow industrial stocks, dropped $4.37, to $57.50. The company's chief executive officer, Durk Jager, announced his resignation after just 17 months in the post. 

 The company disclosed that fiscal fourth-quarter profits for the period ending June 30 would be unchanged from the previous fourth quarter, at 55 cents per share. Wall Street analysts on average were expecting 64 cents per share in profits for the current quarter. 

 Robust corporate profit growth and prospects for more of the same have been a key to the market's ability to stabilize and recover partially from sell-offs in April and May. 

 New doubts about the profit outlook, combined with uncertainties about interest rate trends, would blunt rally attempts in the weeks ahead. 

 But so far, there's no reason to panic about profits, say researchers at First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks earnings reports and estimates. 

 As the second quarter draws to a close, an earlier trend among analysts to boost estimates for the current quarter and the rest of the year has leveled off. Analysts grew optimistic after the boffo 23 percent year-over-year profit gain in the first quarter for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies. 

 Even if S&P 500 profit growth slips to a 15 percent gain by the fourth quarter, the advance for the year could be as much as 19 percent--a spectacular increase over strong 1999 results and well above historical norms, First Call said. 

 The more problematic period is 2001, especially if Fed interest rate increases persist, the firm said. 

 In the market for Treasury securities, prices advanced after Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers hinted at expanded debt buybacks by the government. 

 Global entanglements: Developments in Japan overnight, coming a day after an unexpected boost in European interest rates, could complicate the effect of the release of the U.S. producer price index for May. 

 The Japanese government will release details on the nation's economic growth for the first quarter of the year. With elections two weeks off, the report is expected to present an optimistic assessment of the nation's economic performance and outlook. 

 Global analysts will cast a skeptical eye on the data, however. 

 "At its core, the economy is stagnant, with minimal investment spending and contracting consumer spending," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. 

 Last month, non-Japanese investors sold, on a net basis, nearly $10 billion worth of Japanese equities, the largest sell-off for a single month in 10 years. 

 LOCAL NEWS: Credit Suisse First Boston began research coverage of several drugstore retailers, with a "buy" rating on Deerfield-based Walgreen. The firm assigned a $35 price target for the stock, which rose 44 cents, to $28, in Thursday's session 

 Chicago-based Internet technology consultant Lante jumped $4.62, to $26.75, after Credit Suisse First Boston boosted its revenue growth projections for the company for the rest of this year and 2001.

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, the Dow`s biggest loser this year digs deeper into a hole -- Procter & Gamble (URL: http://www.pg.com/) delivers another profit warning and says its chief executive is out. We`ll talk to the new man in charge. 

 WILLOW BAY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: P&G, a big drag on the Dow. Blue chip stocks take a triple-digit dive and pull the Nasdaq down with it. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 STEVE BALLMER, PRESIDENT & CEO, MICROSOFT: It is unreasonable and excessive. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 VARNEY: Steve Ballmer speaks out in Europe about a judge`s order to split his company. We`ll span the globe for world reaction. 

 BAY: And from Wall Street to a Senate seat, Jon Corzine drops a record sum to score the New Jersey Democratic nomination, but can he win it all? And how much more is he prepared to spend? A new twist on money and politics. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR, live from New York and Los Angeles. 

 BAY: Good evening. I`m Willow Bay. 

 A day after Microsoft`s landmark penalty, top trustbuster Joel Klein says he`s willing to talk settlement. 

 VARNEY: I`m Stuart Varney. Is the Internet gold rush turning into a dot.com letdown? Why more start-ups are delivering pink slips. 

 But first, a very nervous day on Wall Street. A potential Microsoft breakup, persistent interest rate anxieties, and a profit warning from this  year`s biggest Dow loser, all plaguing Wall Street today. The Dow industrials posting their biggest drop in two weeks, as one of its own, Procter & Gamble, takes another big tumble. Investors also nervous ahead of a key economic report out tomorrow. It`s the Producer Price Index for the month of May. 

 As Susan Lisovicz reports, the trouble for the market started early. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Opening bell brought the first day of trading after a judge`s rolling that Microsoft be split  into two. But it was old economy company that determined the Dow`s downward path. Procter & Gamble, the 163-year- old giant that makes Tide laundry detergent, Jiff Peanut Butter and Pampers disposable diapers tumbled more than $6 on an earnings warnings and a management shakeup. 

 TONY VENTO, EDWARD JONES: They tried to accelerate the sales growth too quickly and lost sight of the earnings side of the equation. Their expenses rose too quickly, and consequently, they disappointed investors. 

 LISOVICZ: For a second consecutive quarter, P&G`s earlier warning in March sent the stock plunging to a new 52-week low. It`s latest setback, along with weakness from Microsoft, weighed on the Dow, which gave up 144 points  on the session. 

 LARRY WACHTEL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: It`s kind of the morning after. First of all, the excitement of Microsoft has faded, and so has Microsoft`s stock. Procter & Gamble was a bad scene, the second quarter that they preannounced a poor quarter. That brought down all the multinational consumer companies, brought down food stocks, brought down the defensive stocks. Dow losers also included J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) , United Technologies(URL: http://www.utx.com/) , Honeywell (URL: http://www.honeywell.com/) and AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) among the 22 blue chip stocks to close lower on the day. The Nasdaq, which started out modestly higher, also succumbed to selling pressure, giving up nearly 14 on the day. 

 But while Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) and Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) ended up on the losing side, there were many tech winners, including Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) , Qualcomm (URL: http://www.qualcomm.com/) and  PMC-Sierra (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com/) . 

 Many analysts say the market is waiting on inflation data over the next few trading days. 

 JOHN HUGHES, SHIELDS & CO.: I think traders were closing out their positions just because it is a concern, it is a worry, and we`re not really expecting anything too bad from these numbers, but at the same time, there`s no reason to take chances. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 LISOVICZ: And while investors are hoping to see tangible signs that the economy is cooling off enough to satisfy Alan Greenspan, they may not like the impact it has on corporate earnings. Lands End today said its  sales from the first half of fiscal 2001 will be flat, and after the closing bell, H&R Block issued an earnings warning -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Watch out. Susan Lisovicz, thank you. 

 VARNEY: Well, for more on today`s Dow dive, we go live to the New York Stock Exchange where Rhonda Schaffler has been following the action -- Rhonda. 

 RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Stuart. 

 The market may have weathered the Procter & Gamble news better if it was just Procter & Gamble. But as Susan mentioned, there were other warnings of earnings or sales slowdowns, and that weighed on the overall investors` psyche, because the concern is really about what`s going to go on with second quarter profit growth. Prediction right now are that it`s still going to be strong, but not as strong as the first quarter was. 

 And we also had, as far as the Dow goes, some weakness in the financial stocks. That coupled with Procter & Gamble, as well as some selling in old economy stocks really helped turned the Dow lower and keep it there throughout the trading day. 

 Selling also was not limited to the Dow. It spread out to broader markets. S&P 500 fell more than nine points to close at 1461. Market breadth negative, decliners beating advancers by an eight-to-seven margin. Forty-eight stocks hit new highs, 44 fell to new lows. Volume fairly light, and that is because tomorrow`s PPI number is considered the most important number of week. Traders looking for clues of what the Fed may do, especially since they`re worried that the Fed may have already done a bit too much -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Well, if that the producer price index is so important, what are traders down there looking for tomorrow? 

 SCHAFFLER: Well, if there are no surprises in that index, they`re hoping that the market can turn around and actually close out the week on a plus note. Now if that doesn`t happen, if the market continues to sell off, other traders are going to say, this was a consolidation week here. Last week was very strong for both the Dow and the Nasdaq. But what`s going to happen is people are still looking number to number. And after PPI is over, they`ll just look at the week after that. VARNEY: We`ve been there before, have we not? 

 SCHAFFLER: That`s right. 

 VARNEY: Rhonda Schaffler at the Big Board, thanks very much. 

 BAY: A day after Judge Jackson delivered his landmark punishment to Microsoft, all sides were speaking out. But while the software giant continued to blast the decision, the government`s top trust-buster said he`s still willing to consider a settlement. 

 Steve Young has more from Washington. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Justice Department`s antitrust chief today opened the window slightly to the possibility that Microsoft could still escape the breakup. Joel Klein said a negotiated settle is possible. 

 JOEL KLEIN, ASST. ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think you know any negotiation should be between the parties, and not conducted in public in this. 

 QUESTION: It sounds like you wouldn`t accept a settlement that didn`t include some form of divestiture. 

 KLEIN: I don`t think you should read anything one way the other. 

 YOUNG: The comment came after Thomas Penfield Jackson, who allowed these unprecedented pictures of a federal judge in his chambers, told the "Washington Post" he`d rather see the lawsuit settled out of court, even now. He told the "Wall Street Journal," he ruled against Microsoft because "if somebody lies to you once, how much else can you credit as truth." Jackson is now considering whether to stay his final breakup order, a request that came from Microsoft overnight. A source close to the case told CNNfn, the Department of Justice has asked Judge Jackson to give it until Monday the respond to that request. 

 His judgment includes many mandates about how Microsoft should run its business, including a requirement that sell a version of Windows without a Web browser at a lower price. 

 RICK RULE, MICROSOFT LEGAL COUNSEL: That`s their sort of pricing by the pound. But since they haven`t been able to identify exactly what code it is  that they want Microsoft to take out to make it an Internet Explorer-free version of Windows, it`s a little hard to even to apply that formula. 

 YOUNG: With the outcome of the case still uncertain, technology CEOs gathered in Washington today were still ducking the controversy. 

 LOUIS GERSTNER, CHMN. & CEO, IBM: Our view is antitrust policy exists in the country. It ought to probably apply to the physical world and  the digital world. We leave that up to the judges. 

 MICHAEL DELL, CHMN. & CEO, DELL COMPUTER: I would rather not comment on the merits of the case or the ability of the judge to understand our industry. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: Judge Jackson has dealt the company a serious blow, but until some appellate court makes the order stick, Microsoft is still a company CEOs don`t want to cross -- Willow. 

 BAY: Understood, Steve. 

 Steve, has anything changed that would indicate that a settlement is a real possibly? 

 YOUNG: No, except those comments both by the judge and Joel Klein. I can tell you the Justice Department continues not to confirm this. Late today, Microsoft told us that they can confirm the DOJ has asked for a stretch-out until Monday, but they did tell me that no talks are going on now. 

 BAY: So, but is that unusual that the DOJ would request extra time? 

 YOUNG: Yes, a consultant for Microsoft said after all they knew that it`s routine for a stay to be asked for, why are they delaying? 

 BAY: Steve Young, thank you. 

 The final outcome for Microsoft is still uncertain, but if Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson`s ruling stands, a Microsoft breakup would apparently look like this: The first company, applications, would include Microsoft`s Internet and consumer services, such as MSN, Hotmail, Expedia (URL: http://www.expedia.com/) -- that`s the travel site -- and Carpoint; and the software business, which includes Office, the Exchange e-mail system and of course Web browser Internet Explorer. Right now, Internet Explorer commands 70 percent of the Web browser market against Netscape`s 30 percent. The second company would be focused on Microsoft`s operating system, including Windows 2000, NT, and CE, as well as the upcoming Millennium Edition. Microsoft, as you know, handily dominates this market. 

 VARNEY: Here`s what`s coming up, what would a Microsoft breakup mean to the company`s thousands of employees? We`re going to head live to Seattle to find that one. Plus, the big three automakers take a big step. The companies say they`ll extend health benefits to same- sex partners. And forget IPO riches, dot.coms are now delivering something much different -- the latest layoffs in this troubled sector, when MONEYLINE returns. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 ANNOUNCER: From CNN`s New York and Los Angeles headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Thirty-five thousand Microsoft employees today read what Judge Jackson had to say, heard reaction from Bill Gates, and are still left with the burning question: What would a divided Microsoft mean for us? 

 Katharine Barrett has that story from Redmond, Washington. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATHARINE BARRETT, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a legal filing earlier this week Microsoft suggested it`s employees might resign en masse rather than sign a form agreeing to the government`s terms. While most observers say that threat seems overblown, some high-tech head hunters in Microsoft`s hometown uncertainty about the company`s  future will hurt its ability to attract new talent. 

 JASON HANCOCK, HENDRICK & STRUGGLES: People will be worried about joining an organization and not knowing where they`re going to work. So it may stop people accepting a position there, and they may entertain other opportunities because there are multiple other opportunities out in the market at the moment. 

 BARRETT: New high-tech start-ups have sprouted like mushrooms here in the past five years, all of them eager to poach top-flight engineers and marketers from Microsoft. 

 But others say the prospect of a mass Microsoft exodus is remote. In fact, Microsoft`s depressed stock price may actually keep people from leaving rather than being forced to exercise options at unfavorable prices. 

 Software recruiter Rod Asher says a low-price stock may even attract some new blood. 

 ROD ASHER, ROD ASHER & ASSOC.: The fact that the stock is at a low creates opportunity for the stock to go up. And new employees are excited about getting the options at a low valuation. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 BARRETT: And most acknowledge whether there is ultimately one Microsoft or two, this company will still employ some of the best and the brightest in the industry, and it will remain a leader in technology marketing and new technology -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right, Katharine Barrett right there in Redmond, Washington. Thank you, Katharine. 

 BAY: One person Microsoft employees will turn to for guidance undoubtedly is Bill Gates. But according to our next guest, Gates is a leader suffering from battle wounds himself. Ken Auletta is currently working on a book about the Microsoft trial and covers the company for "The New Yorker." 

 Ken, as always, welcome to MONEYLINE. 

 KEN AULETTA, "THE NEW YORKER": Thank you. 

 BAY: We have watched with some amazement, really, the transformation of Gates throughout this trial process. At last night`s press conference, the hair, the makeup, the clothes, the relentlessly upbeat and polished performance. But do you think he`s changed? 

 AULETTA: Well, he hasn`t -- I mean, he has a better barber. He`s changed in that way. But he basically is angry. And he`s angry all throughout this trial because he feels the government is persecuting him and doing the bidding of his competitors and accusing him of crimes that he doesn`t feel are crimes, in fact, feels are quite normal. So he`s quite angry. And he feels -- he identifies with that company. He created that company with a few other people. 

 BAY: Angry, but choosing clearly not to show it publicly. 

 AULETTA: Yes, I mean, and so, you know, his people, you know, when you watch Bill Gates come into a room, he`s surrounded much like a heavyweight champion is by his handlers, who are trying to keep a certain distance. And -- but he`s angry, and sometimes he explodes. 

 BAY: It`s interesting. They`ve just released a commercial to the press which will air this weekend. Let`s take a look at it. And, Ken, I guess my question for you as we`re looking at this commercial is, has Bill Gates bought into the notion that image is everything? 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, MICROSOFT COMMERCIAL) 

 BILL GATES, CHAIRMAN & CO-FOUNDER, MICROSOFT: The next generation of software is being developed right here. It will understand your voice, anticipate your needs, protect your privacy and connect you to the Internet whenever you are. It will help your children learn and give businesses new tools to succeed in the digital... 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BAY: So, Ken, has he bought into this notion that image is everything? 

 AULETTA: I don`t know whether he`s bought in that it`s everything. I don`t think he would ever admit to that or believe that. I think he`s too much of a nerd and a scientist, if you will, for that. But that`s a warm and fuzzy ad, and it is meant to counter the kind of harsh portrayal of Microsoft that a federal judge has -- and the Justice Department and 19 states have presented. 

 So he`s got a problem, and it`s a PR problem. But it`s also a real problem, and that add is obviously an attempt to make people feel a little better about Bill Gates and his company. 

 BAY: We`ve heard some softer comments from him last night and this morning. He appears to be expressing some regret that he didn`t go down to Washington to personally explain to the judge what the PC business is all about. Do you think he does regret not testifying? 

 AULETTA: I don`t know. You know, he told me when I asked him that question some months ago that he had no regrets about that. And in reality, the problem he would have if he had testified is that David Boies, who is the government prosecutor, would have pitted the Gates who is then -- who is now testifying against the Gates -- the 20 hours of taped deposition from Gates. 

 The government didn`t call Gates as a witness because they liked the Gates they had in the deposition, this kind of surly, forgetful guy. And would Microsoft have dared call him when, in fact, they might have tried to portray him as a liar? 

 BAY: Ken Auletta, as always, thanks for joining us. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, from dreams of green to the reality of pink: counting pink slips as layoffs at Internet start-ups pile up. 

 That story when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: And here are some of tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers." Lands` End (URL: http://www.landsend.com) down more than four points. In its second warning this year, the catalog retailer said that sales and earnings for the first half of the year will be lower than expected. It also lowered its full-year sales estimate. 

 Great Plains Software (URL: http://www.greatplains.com/) plunged 18 3/4. Late yesterday, the e-business software firm warned that it could miss fourth-quarter estimates by as much as 27 cents. 

 And Central Newspapers surged more than 20 1/2, the biggest percentage gainer on the Big Board. The newspaper publisher has hired Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette (URL: http://www.dlj.com) to discuss a possible sale of the company. 

 BAY: In tonight`s "Tech Watch," downsizing at the dot.coms. After flocking to the Internet start-ups in the hopes of making it rich, many are now being laid-off, as their employers run out of cash. 

 And, as Fred Katayama reports, this may just be the beginning. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Many people who job-hopped to join the Internet gold rush are finding their dreams are not panning out. Just this week alone, the online magazine Salon.com (URL: http://www.salon.com/) said it`s laying off 9 percent of its staff. The crime news Web site APBnews.com fired its 140 employees. 

 JOE KRAKOVIAK, APBNEWS.COM: The simple answer is we ran out of money. We have no money to pay our employees or to pay any severance. The long answer is that the market`s valuation of Internet companies in general and content companies such as ours has changed drastically since earlier this year. 

 AULETTA: The employment consulting firm Challenger Gray & Christmas reports in its inaugural survey that dot.com firms announced 654 job cuts in May. That`s just a fraction of the 27,000 layoffs across all sectors. 

 But look for more pink slips amidst the shakeout that has seen high-profile  Internet retailers Toysmart and Boo.com go bust. 

 JOHN CHALLENGER, CHALLENGER, GRAY & CHRISTMAS: That`s the first time we`ve really seen the dot.com sector begin to announce layoffs. It suggests we`re at the beginning of what could be a littering of job cuts. 

 KATAYAMA (on camera): The tech stock meltdown has dried up funding sources for many start-ups. And nervous investors now insist that those spendthrift companies turn out profits, so companies are tightening their wallets. 

 TUCK REYNOLDS, RUSSELL REYNOLDS ASSOC.: For people who are already in Internet companies, you know, perhaps the prospects for their own company aren`t quite as clear as they were, and if anything, you know, a  lot more interest on the part of those individuals to entertain different opportunities. 

 KATAYAMA: But experts say Internet workers who were fired can easily find employment. And the Internet economy is still creating jobs. With everyone from steelmakers to automakers building their online operations, Internet wannabes can also find new jobs at old- economy companies. 

 Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VARNEY: And still ahead on MONEYLINE, a radical shift by Detroit`s big three on a controversial benefits issue. We`ll tell you about that after this break. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: A dramatic change today by America`s big three automakers on benefits for same-sex partners. With more on that and more, here`s Wolf Blitzer and the "MONEYLINE News Digest" -- Wolf. 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNNfn ANCHOR: Thanks, Stuart. 

 The big three today announced they`ll offer healthcare benefits to the same-sex partners of U.S. employees. That decision takes affect August 1st. A GM spokesman predicts the cost to the company will be minimal. 

 In Tennessee, Al Gore`s home state, George W. Bush today spelled out changes he says would make Washington more civil than it`s been under the Clinton administration. Among his ideas, adopting government budgets every other year with the off years used for oversight and other business. 

 Meanwhile, at a training center for California sheriffs, the vice president called for tighter laws on personal privacy in the Internet age. Gore says he`s backing legislation put before Congress today making it a federal crime to by or sell someone`s Social Security number. 

 Also today, a crackdown by Washington on a popular pesticide sold under the names Dursban and Lorsban. The EPA banned it for home and garden use. The biggest manufacturer is Dow Chemical. 

 And controversial Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker today reported to his new team, the minor-league Richmond Braves. Yesterday, Rocker said he might quit baseball to become a stockbroker. 

 I`ll have those stories and much more coming up on "THE WORLD TODAY." That`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 on the West Coast -- Stuart and Willow. 

 BAY: See you then, Wolf, thank you. 

 Coming up in our next half hour, we`ll check out Procter & Gamble, which issued a chilling message on profits and unveiled big changes in its corner office. We`ll speak with the new CEO. 

 And we`ve got an exclusive interview with Sun Microsystems` boss Scott McNealy about his long-time nemesis Bill Gates, and the judge`s order to break up Microsoft. 

 Plus, we look at money and politics in the Garden State: a profile of Jon Corzine who hopes to translate his Wall Street success to a seat in the Senate. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s headlines: Wall Street weakens, led by trouble at a company that fills the shelves of nearly every American household. 

 And shockwaves from Microsoft`s breakup order reverberate around the globe. We`ll check out what the world makes of the judge`s decision. 

 Plus, we`ll have an in-depth look at a financial power broker who`s shaking up New Jersey politics. Will Jon Corzine`s deep pockets pave the way to the U.S. Senate? 

 BAY: But first, more on tonight`s top story. Procter & Gamble chills Wall Street with a warning on profits and unveils a shake-up in the boardroom, the consumer goods giant ousts chief executive Durk Jager in the  wake of the stock`s dismal showing. P&G slumped more than 6 today, the worst performer on the Dow this year. 

 Greg Clarkin has more on the trouble at P&G. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They make Pampers, Ivory soap and Tide. And now, Procter & Gamble is rapidly becoming known for its profit warnings. This was the second earnings bombshell from P&G in three months and this one also included a major management shake-up: CEO Durk Jager getting the boot, he`ll be replaced by P&G executive A.G. Lafley, and John Pepper comes back to be chairman. He ran P&G before Jager in the late `90s. 

 P&G earnings for the quarter will be about 55 cents a share. Analysts were looking for 64 cents. The profit warning follows a hectic stretch in which P&G began a massive restructuring with the goal of cutting 15,000 jobs. 

 CAROL WARNER WILKE, CS FIRST BOSTON: They undertook a pretty aggressive restructuring and reorganization of the firm and it was a -- it was too much, too fast, and I think the decision to, you know, just get someone in there to maybe take a step back, continue what was going on but with a more realistic outlook. 

 CLARKIN: Additionally, unfavorable currency exchange rates and increases in raw material costs continue to eat away at profits, and there is also the  ongoing battle of how to boost sales. 

 HEATHER HAY, MERRILL LYNCH: Most of these companies, Procter included, compete in extremely mature categories, ones where pricing is difficult to achieve, ones where unit growth is slow. I mean, how much more toothpaste will one person consume in the developed world? And the emerging markets continue to be somewhat dynamic, but the growth is getting harder to come by. 

 CLARKIN: P&G shares are down almost 50 percent on the year and analysts are pessimistic as to when the stock will rebound. One option is to acquire companies to offset slow growth, but with the stock trading so low, it`s tough to do a stock deal. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: Some analysts believe the new management team will have to reduce sales and volume estimates even more in the coming weeks, and there`s the issue of rebuilding P&G`s credibility with Wall Street after a series of profit warnings and sales revisions -- Willow. 

 BAY: Greg, so we should get prepared for a little more bad news as they sort through this all? 

 CLARKIN: Exactly, Willow. A number of analysts I spoke to today say that they expect to see more news coming out of P&G maybe tweaking some of those figures, volume figures and estimates in the coming weeks. BAY: Greg Clarkin, thank you. CLARKIN: Sure. 

 VARNEY: Well, late this afternoon, I spoke with the man charged with righting the ship at P&G. Alan Lafley takes over the CEO`s job after running the firm`s global beauty business. I ran through the familiar list of problems: higher commodity prices, weak overseas currencies, especially the euro, and the ongoing, costly restructuring. But I asked him  if the real problem wasn`t P&G`s lack of pricing power. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALAN LAFLEY, CEO, PROCTER & GAMBLE: I don`t think it is pricing power. We clearly have some issues in some businesses that are more commodity like. But there is ample evidence in other businesses where we can command premium prices and where there is flexibility in pricing. 

 VARNEY (on camera): You have warned that earnings in the fourth quarter are going to be flat. Can you reassure shareholders that that`s the last of the bad news, that there is nothing else lurking there down the road with more warnings still to come? 

 LAFLEY: Well, with 24 hours or so in the business, I don`t know that I`m in a position to guarantee shareholders that we know -- you know, that I know as much as I need to know about the Procter & Gamble business. Having said that, I can reassure shareholders that we are taking all the steps we need to take to get our sales growth to 4-6 percent next fiscal year and to get our earnings growth back in the 11-13 percent range. 

 VARNEY: I realize that you`re less than a day on the job and not ready to lay out concrete strategy for the future, but your food business -- you have a food business -- and the value of it is rising, especially recently. Any plans at all to even consider selling it? 

 LAFLEY: No, I have no plans at the moment to consider selling the food business. It`s one of our core global business units. And we have quite a strong global brand in Pringles. 

 I need to focus my attention in the next few days and weeks on the operating businesses and getting their plans ready for next year, and then I think when we have those in shape and on track to deliver that 4-6 percent sales growth and 11-13 percent earnings growth, I will be able to step back and look at the strategy across all of our businesses and out a couple of years, or three years into the future. 

 VARNEY: Alan Lafley, incoming chief at Procter & Gamble, thanks very much for being with us on MONEYLINE. 

 LAFLEY: Thank you.

 VARNEY: P&G`s warning set the tone for blue-chip stocks today, but it was not the only stock in the red, as financial stocks suffered through a dismal showing. The Dow had its troubles right from the outset and the losses mounted through the day, the Dow finished down 144 at 10,668. On the Nasdaq, tech stocks bucked the old-economy downtrend until a late-day slide hit the index, and it closed down just 13 at 3,825. 

 All this coming one day ahead of a major inflationary indicator tomorrow: we`re going to get the producer price index for the month of May. 

 Alan Chernoff has more on today`s action on Wall Street. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Blue-chip blunders hit the Dow. Procter & Gamble`s latest earnings bombshell triggered a tide of selling in the stock known as "Procter & God" at its Cincinnati home. But the shares have been anything but heavenly. 

 AT&T was down 1 3/16 following a bungled attempt to raise long distance rates. The Federal Communications Commission is blocking that move, responding to consumer outcry. Now Wall Street is worrying about growth and the company`s revenues. 

 But it was more than management miscues that dragged down the market. Investors focused on multinational corporations with exposure in Europe, like Procter & Gamble. Caterpillar (URL: http://www.caterpillar.com/) , Gillette (URL: http://www.gillette.com/) , Honeywell and United Technologies could get hurt by the European central bank`s hike in interest rates, which should slow European economies. That on top of sluggish revenues from Europe, due to the weak euro. 

 Insurance companies, star performers of late, suffered casualties, including Aetna (URL: http://www.aetna.com/) , Allstate (URL: http://www.allstate.com) , and Chubb (URL: http://www.chubb.com/) , while banks continued giving back some of their recent gains. 

 GRACE FEY, FRONTIER CAPITAL MGMT.: The banks have been very sloppy here, and actually, Chase has also been very weak, and I think that`s more related to the stock market IPO environment, where investment banking revenues have come under pressure recently, because of, you know, sort of sloppy market environment. 

 CHERNOFF: But many money managers are not overly concerned, particularly since the sell-off came on moderate volume. 

 ROBERT STOVALL, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: I think in this sort of hiatus period between the earnings reports of the next quarter and the Fed action, which is in a fortnight plus, that you look at industries where there is shifting going along, or going on, mergers, takeovers, discussions of same. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: After dramatic gains last week, fund managers say it`s fine for the market to consolidate this week, even healthy. Many remain bullish, arguing that last week`s action has renewed interest in the stock market, getting investors poised to jump back in --Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Alan, I have followed your work elsewhere, shall we say, and it`s a pleasure to have you work with us here. Welcome to CNN, Alan. 

 CHERNOFF: Thank you so much, great to be here. 

 VARNEY: OK -- Willow. 

 BAY: Alan, for me too, good to have you with us. 

 Coming up, a conversation with one man who could not be more pleased with the judge`s order to break up Microsoft. We`ll talk to Sun Microsystems` Scott McNealy, and also check out how the decision is playing around the world. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: In tonight`s "MONEYLINE Focus," the day after a federal judge`s landmark decision to bust up Microsoft, the company`s executives blasted the decision from both sides of the Atlantic -- Bill Gates here and CEO Steve Ballmer in Europe. Additionally, Microsoft filed papers to request a stay of the judge`s order pending appeal. Meanwhile, the government`s top trust buster, Joel Klein, said that he still favors settling the case, but noted that any resolution would need to address Microsoft`s anti-competitive practices. 

 Checking Wall Street`s reaction, the stock lost nearly 1 3/4, giving back gains posted ahead of the judge`s decision. And surprisingly, stocks that deal in the Linux operating system, an upstart competitor to Microsoft`s Windows, fared poorly. VA Linux (URL: http://www.valinux.com/) slipped 1; Corel (URL: http://www.corel.com/) , which today announced job cuts and a cost-cutting plan, was down one-quarter. Red Hat (URL: http://www.redhat.com/) lost 1 1/2. 

 The Microsoft decision was welcome news for one of its harshest and most persistent critics, Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun Microsystems. Our technology correspondent Bruce Francis caught up with McNealy. And in this exclusive interview, McNealy said that a split-up of Microsoft could spur significant change in the technology industry. 

 Bruce has the story from Pebble Beach, California. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Just about the only thing rabid golfer Scott McNealy could ask for now is to rate a spot at the U.S. Open. His company, Sun Microsystems, is selling more servers than ever, and his archrival, Microsoft, has been ordered by a federal court to split itself in two. 

 We caught up with McNealy at the site of the open, the Pevbble Beach Golf Links in California, and asked him how the breakup could change the business. 

 SCOTT MCNEALY, CHAIRMAN & CEO, SUN MICROSYSTEMS: What has happened is all of a sudden we have scrutiny. And with scrutiny, you have a very, very different opportunity. Because the DOJ has stepped in and said, hey, we`re going to referee this thing, people are now comfortable that they can operate freely and competitively and openly. 

 If the government were to have just had thrown the case away and let Microsoft do the same old thing, we`d close down and go back into the same old innovation-stifling, competition-stifling, choice-stifling operating mode of Microsoft. It`s different now. 

 FRANCIS (on camera): Will this change the everyday business environment at Sun (URL: http://www.sun.com/) ? Will it be different for your salespeople going into meetings? Will it be different for your company? 

 MCNEALY: Nothing`s going to change in the short run because I think this thing`s going to go to an appeals process. And I think Microsoft is not going to change its ways. It`s going to try to dig a deeper hole here to make it even harder to pull off structural and conduct remedies. That`s just been their M.O. from day one. So we don`t expect  any short-term change. I mean, we`re certainly not going to built a business model or a business strategy that expects Microsoft to act any differently. 

 FRANCIS: Is there any sense of apprehension at the prospect of greater government involvement in your industries? 

 MCNEALY: That`s like saying someone who got pulled over for going 90 miles an hour on the freeway, and they get pulled over and get a ticket, and somebody asks them, well, do you think the government`s going to get more involved in our drivings habits now? This law has been on the books for 100 years. It`s been enforced very judiciously, very conservatively and very effectively for a hundred years. Somebody just got pulled over and given a ticket, in fact, you know, maybe they`re going to  take their license away for a while. That doesn`t change government intervention. You want government enforcement of laws. 

 FRANCIS: Microsoft is one of the most widely held technology stocks... 

 MCNEALY: I don`t own any. 

 FRANCIS: All right, you`re the exception that proves the rule then. Should there be any sense of regret about that? About the decline in the value of Microsoft stock? 

 MCNEALY: A monopolist who`s allowed to exercise monopoly power is going to get a huge market cap. A monopolist who`s not allowed to execute that monopoly power is probably going to take a hit. But that has not -- this has not, like, been a secret to any investor. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRANCIS: McNealy says he`s looking forward to an explosion of innovation now that that secret is out -- Willow. 

 BAY: Bruce, briefly, where should we be looking for that explosion to come from? 

 FRANCIS: I think you`re going to see it more in existing competitors, maybe in some of these middle wear companies. Also, let`s see if the venture capitalists get behind a lot of small companies who want to compete here. 

 Bruce Francis, thank you for that exclusive. 

 VARNEY: Well, the court-ordered breakup has far-reaching implications that stretch well beyond the U.S. 

 Peter Viles takes a look at how the Microsoft decision is being received elsewhere in the world.. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was front-page news from Seattle to Hong Kong. "The New York Post" boiled it down to two words. This French newspaper told the story with one image. An editorial cartoon warned the French they may have to change their video games, their e-mail addresses and more. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was in the Netherlands and on the offensive. 

 STEVE BALLMER, CEO, MICROSOFT: The district court adopted the government`s plan to break up and regulate Microsoft without even a single day of testimony. 

 VILES: "The New York Times" endorsed the break up, calling it the best way, quote, "Microsoft can no longer smother software that would be good for consumers but bad for Microsoft." 

 On the Street and online, opinion was divided. 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I mean, if you control 80 percent of a market, if that`s not a monopoly, what is? 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He started Microsoft on his own and he got it to this level. So why should he split it up with somebody else? 

 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think it sends a message to entrepreneurs to don`t be  too successful, the government will knock you down. 

 VILES: One post to a Yahoo! chatroom concluded, quote, "Long live MSFT." 

 On Thestreet.com, a Microsoft supporter wrote, quote, "Call Judge Jackson. I just did," then gave out the judge`s phone number, then said he`d asked the judge`s office, quote, "What platform they recommend I use once they`ve destroyed the one I use now to run my finances and my life." 

 Another e-mail read, quote, "I think the plan Microsoft has to move to Canada is brilliant." 

 VILES (on camera): Now Microsoft, of course, has said it has no plan to move to Canada. But as today`s coverage made clear, this story and this debate over Microsoft`s future are now matters of global concern. 

 Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VARNEY: And still to come, tonight`s "MONEYLINE Movers": Chip stocks provide something of a silver lining in today`s cloud over Wall Street. All of that coming up on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking on some other stocks making moves today, Talk.com (URL: http://www.talk.com/) , which sells long-distance phone service over the Internet, fell more than 1 1/2. That, after an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney downgraded the stock. 

 Electronic Data Systems (URL: http://www.eds.com/) was down, off nearly 5 1/2, after Merrill Lynch (URL: http://www.ml.com/) lowered the 12-month price target to $81 a share and cut earnings estimates. 

 But Tech Data (URL: http://www.techdata.com/) , the No. 2 computer distributor in the world, gained four, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings. 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s "Sector Focus," a look at chip stocks. That group rallied today on positive analysts comments from several brokerage houses. Chase Hambrecht & Quist says the sector`s strength is due to unprecedented demand driven by wireless communications, the Web, and hand-held electronic systems. The brokerage upgraded one of its top picks, Atmel (URL: http://www.atmel.com/) , to a strong buy. That stock rose 2 1/4. 

 Micron Technology also higher today, up almost 4, after UBS Warburg raised the stock`s price target to $110. 

 Other chip stocks making gains today: Analog Devices (URL: http://www.analog.com) , Vitesse (URL: http://www.vitesse.com/) Semiconductor, and Lam Research (URL; http://www.lamrc.com/) . 

 BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, the Wall Street veteran using business savvy, and the power of the dollar to drive a Senate campaign. We`ll tell you about John Corzine after the break. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: John Corzine, once a top executive at Goldman Sachs trounced his opponent this week, capturing the Democratic nomination for a Senate seat in New Jersey. But it didn`t come cheap. Corzine powered through the records for campaign spending in a Senate race and the money race will likely intensify as election day approaches. 

 Allan Dodds Frank reports. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNNfn CORRESONDENT (voice-over): For John Corzine, the sweet sound of victory. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I voted for you. 

 JON CORZINE (D) NEW JERSEY SENATE CANDIDATE: Thank you. 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your welcome. 

 FRANK: To win the Democratic nomination to the Senate from New Jersey, the former Goldman Sachs (URL: http://www.gs.com/) co-chairman used a lot of the money he earned and some of the lessons he learned on Wall Street. 

 CORZINE: Business leadership, like politics, is all about people. One has to be able to articulate a mission and the objectives that you`re trying to pursue in a way that people feel that you will be an advocate for the purposes that they`re about. 

 FRANK: He spent $31.5 million -- smashing the record for a Senate primary vote. That works out to more than $127 a vote for more than nine times what his opponent, former New Jersey Governor Jim Florio spent. 

 Voters apparently did not buy Florio`s attacks on Corzine`s wealth. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) 

 ANNOUNCER: Election day showed Jon Corzine that New Jersey is not for sale. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) FRANK: Corzine, unlike some other rich candidates, softened possible resentment by embracing grassroots organizations. The mayor of Newark recalls how Corzine accepted his advice early on. 

 MAYOR SHARPE JAMES, NEW JERSEY: Here for the first time was a man of substance, a man with money, who said: I want to be part of the Democratic family. How can I help the Democratic family? And you know the answer`s always, could you buy 10 tickets? Could you send me some dollars? Could you make a contribution? And I think that he got the answer loud and clear. 

 FRANK: The 53-year-old Corzine came a long way from a Modesto upbringing on an Illinois farm, to one of Wall Street`s top spots. His career at Goldman Sachs left him with a fortune worth more than $400 million. 

 Corzine spend most of his campaign cash on TV time. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT) 

 ANNOUNCER: John Corzine says it`s wrong for senior citizens to have to choose between putting food on the table... 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 FRANK; He believes his issue-oriented ads helped. 

 CORZINE: Many people say, this guy, regardless of background, is actually trying to talk the issues that make a difference in my life. 

 FRANK: Corzine clearly has more money than his Republican challenger, Congressman Bob Franks. 

 HENRY SHEINKOPF, POLITICAL CONSULTANT: There are only six states that are in play: New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri. They need New Jersey. They need that ethnic vote to swing over to the  Republican Party. And they`re going to spend whatever it takes to get it. 

 FRANK: Corzine may well have to spend tens of millions of dollars more to keep pace, says the man he wants to succeed in the Senate. 

 SEN. FRANK LAUTENBERG (D), NEW JERSEY: I think, you`ll see more money spent in this next phase -- that`s both Republican and Democrat -- than one would have imagined either necessary or possible in the past. 

 FRANK: Some Republican consultants believe Corzine may tout his Wall Street background. 

 ROGER STONE, CAMPAIGN CONSULTANT: The themes he must stress here is that he is an outsider. He is a businessman, not a politician; that he`s an entrepreneur, not a career Washington pol. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) FRANK (on camera): Corzine has not yet released his tax returns, but his financial disclosure statement does provide a few surprises. Aside from his Goldman Sachs bonanza, he has more than a quarter- million dollars invested in Amazon and in Dell Computer, and he has a Brazilian treasury note worth a million dollars or more, which he says has done quite nicely -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Great country, isn`t it? Allan Dodds Frank, thanks very much. 

 FRANK; Your welcome. 

 VARNEY: What`s next, Willow? 

 BAY: "Ahead of the Curve": Some of what you need to know tonight, before those markets open tomorrow. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 BAY: Checking some of what could move the markets tomorrow, the Producer Price Index due out. Economists are looking for a rise of .3 percent caused by the rebound in energy prices. The core rate, expected to be up .1 percent. 

 And after the bell tomorrow, shares of Chase Manhattan (URL: http://www.chase.com/) Bank are due to split three for one. ALCOA (URL: http://www.alcoa.com/) and Liberty Media (URL: http://www.libertymedia.com/) both will split two for one. 

 That is MONEYLINE for this Thursday. 

 I`m Willow Bay in Los Angeles.

 U.S. stocks fall in late trading, market eyes Friday's data.

 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Stocks fell in late afternoon trading on Thursday with the technology sector joining the broader pullback as buyers pulled back ahead of key economic data due on Friday. 

 Trading was slow in the last hour, with Wall Street weighed down by profit warnings and pending economic numbers that could offer clues on the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision later this month. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) lost 111 points, or 1.03 percent, at 10,701, led lower by Procter & Gamble after the detergent and toothpaste maker warned that it would hit profit targets. 

 Honeywell International and United Technologies also dropped as investors moved cash out of defence-related stocks, offsetting gains in shares of Hewlett-Packard. 

 The Nasdaq composite .IXIC) dipped in and out of the red, lastly losing 2 points, or 0.05 percent, to 3,837 as Microsoft Corp. slumped following a judge's ruling that the software giant be split in two. 

 Broader measures of the market also edged lower with the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX) down 9 points, or 0.63 percent, at 1,462 while the Wilshire 5000 .TMW) lost 70 points, or 0.52 percent, to 13,654. 

 Procter & Gamble was the clear loser on the Dow, pressuring its entire sector, after the company announced the retirement of Durk Jager as its chairman, chief executive and president, and warned that fourth-quarter profits would be equal to year-ago results, instead of matching its previous guidance of a 15 percent to 17 percent rise. 

 P&G fell 6-7/16 to 56-7/16, near a 52-week low of 53. 

 "The Dow is obviously being whacked around by the Procter & Gamble warning," said analyst Bryan Piskorowski at Prudential Securities. 

 Nervousness that P&G's profit warning might foreshadow more bad news on the earnings front prompted the selling, traders said. 

 "People are wondering, 'Will there be other profit warnings?' because you can't have a slowing economy without also a slowing in corporate earnings," said Sam Stovall, senior investment strategist for Standard & Poor's, referring to recent signs of cooling in the blazing pace of U.S. economic growth. 

 Electronic Data Systems Corp. was also one of the most heavily traded stocks, falling nearly 8 percent after Merrill Lynch cut its revenue growth forecast for the computer services company to 4 percent from 7 percent. The stock fell 4-7/16 to 58-3/4. 

 "There is always a possibility that in an economy that's slowing down to a dull roar from red hot, there are going to be some disappointments from companies that are real, including Procter & Gamble, which has problems of its own," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross. 

 Recent signs that the economy is indeed slowing also have managed to hurt sectors that investors had used as safe havens for their cash, analysts said. 

 Defence stocks are often viewed as defensive investment plays by being less volatile in tough market environments than so-called growth stocks. 

 Honeywell International Inc. fell 3-11/16 to 50-1/8 while United Technologies was off 3-9/16 at 56-7/16. Diversified, those Dow names are often lumped with aerospace and defence stocks due to their heavy exposure in those markets. 

 Wall Street was looking ahead to producer price data on Friday morning for hints on the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision, traders said. Economists expect the overall Producer Price Index to rise 0.3 percent in May, according to a poll. 

 Excluding the volatile food and energy groups, core PPI is expected to increase 0.1 percent in May, according to the economists' forecast. 

 Bond prices gained as money came out of stocks. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note gained 7/32, pushing the yield down to 6.12 percent from Wednesday's close at 6.15 percent. The 30-year bond rose 9/32 with the yield at 5.89 percent from Wednesday's 5.91 percent.

 NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - Technology stocks dropped off their highs in early afternoon trading on Thursday as profit warnings and comments from Wall Street analysts sparked concerns about waning growth among top-tier companies. 

 Investors were also stepping cautiously ahead of new economic data due Friday that may offer clues on the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision, traders said. 

 By early afternoon, the Nasdaq composite held a gain of 16 points, or 0.43 percent, at 3,855 after climbing as high as 3,890 during the session. Microsoft Corp. was the most actively traded stock, just inching lower despite an order from a U.S. judge to split the software giant in two. 

 Modest weakness in some leading technology stocks coupled with a pullback in financial shares to hold the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average down 126 points, or 1.17 percent, to 10,686. 

 Broader measures of the market also edged lower with the Standard & Poor's 500 index down 7 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,464 while the small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.55 point, or 0.11 percent, to 515. 

 Consumer products' names, along with retailers, manufacturers, defence contractors and energy stocks, all slid some more while computer-chip and Internet issues held gains. 

 Procter & Gamble was the clear loser on the Dow, pressuring its entire sector, after the company announced the retirement of Durk Jager as its chairman, chief executive and president, and warned that fourth-quarter profits would be equal to the year-ago results, instead of matching its previous guidance of a 15 percent to 17 percent rise. 

 P&G shares fell 5-3/4 to 57-1/8. 

 "The Dow is obviously being wacked around by the Procter & Gamble warning," said analyst Bryan Piskorowski at Prudential Securities. 

 Nervousness that P&G's profit warning might foreshadow more bad news on the earnings front prompted the selling, traders said. 

 "People are wondering, 'Will there be other profit warnings?' because you can't have a slowing economy without also a slowing in corporate earnings," said Sam Stovall, senior investment strategist for Standard & Poor's, referring to recent signs of cooling in the blazing pace of U.S. economic growth. 

 Electronic Data Systems Corp. was also one of the most heavily traded stocks, falling nearly 8 percent on Thursday after Merrill Lynch cut its revenue growth forecast for the computer services company to 4 percent from 7 percent. 

 The stock fell 4-13/16 to 58-3/8. 

 "There is always a possibility that in an economy that's slowing down to a dull roar from red hot, there are going to be some disappointments from companies that are real, including Procter & Gamble, which has problems of its own," said Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross. 

 Recent signs that the economy is indeed slowing also have managed to hurt sectors that investors had used as safe havens for their cash, analysts said. 

 Defence stocks are often viewed as defensive investment plays by being less volatile in tough market environments than so-called growth stocks. 

 Honeywell International Inc. fell 3-11/16 to 50-1/8, accounting for 22 points of the Dow average's slide, while United Technologies fell 3-9/16 to 56-7/16. While diversified, those Dow names are often lumped with aerospace and defence stocks due to their heavy exposure in those markets. 

 "I suppose people are more encouraged, on balance, that the economy is slowing and that it will be a soft landing, which would probably tend to favour some of the other growth names in the market which people have been concerned about in the past few months," said aerospace and defence analyst Chris Mecray, with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 

 Wall Street was looking ahead to producer price data due Friday morning for hints on the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision, traders said. Economists expect the overall Producer Price Index to rise 0.3 percent in May, according to a poll.

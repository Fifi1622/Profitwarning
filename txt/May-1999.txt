 In New York: Blind Trust In First Union Burns Analysts

 Nearly everyone on Wall Street wanted to believe Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. could do it. And that is the problem. 

 Last week, the First Union chief executive conceded that the North Carolina bank's $19.8 billion acquisition last year of CoreStates Financial, then the largest bank takeover in U.S. history, is crumbling under its own weight. The essential problem: First Union's promise to increase sales while chopping expenses almost in half at CoreStates, of Philadelphia, just isn't coming true. 

 The jarring news caught many Wall Street analysts napping. Burned by First Union's third profit warning in four months, analysts now are scrambling to slash their ratings on the stock, which closed Friday at $46.1875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, up 56.25 cents. As of Thursday, just eight out of 25 analysts rated First Union a buy or strong buy, compared with 15 four days earlier, according to First Call. 

 "My worry is that the problems have gone beyond CoreStates," says David C. Stumpf of A.G. Edwards & Sons, who now urges investors to dump the stock. 

 First Union stock is down about 25% so far this year, compared with a 6% decline among its regional-banking peers and a 4% rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Thursday, First Union said it would amend last month's $1.1 billion agreement to acquire Everen Capital to protect the Chicago brokerage firm's shareholders against declines in the bank's stock. Though the value of the deal is unchanged, Everen holders now would get a fixed $31 of First Union stock for each Everen share instead of the previous 0.555 share of First Union. 

 The sudden flip-flop and finger-pointing on CoreStates raise a prickly question: Why did so many experienced analysts ignore warning signs months ago that First Union's latest rapid-fire acquisition was missing the target so badly? Looking back, it was evident that CoreStates customers were leaving the bank in droves and seemingly robust earnings were being propped up by unusual items. 

 The answer goes a long way toward explaining why investors can't blindly depend on Wall Street research these days. Research analysts traditionally act as a filter between the stock market and investors. But in the record bull market, many analysts don't simply assess stocks; they increasingly promote them. This is because if analysts aggressively tout a company's stock, their firm stands a greater chance at snaring an advisory role from the corporate client -- meaning a bonus for the analyst. Analysts currently have a "buy" or "strong buy" on fully two-thirds of the roughly 7,000 U.S. stocks tracked by First Call, a Boston earnings and estimate-tracking service. The percentange of "sell" recommendations: just 1%. The remainder are "holds." 

 Thomas K. Brown, a money manager at Tiger Management and a critic of Mr. Crutchfield's high-priced acquisition strategy for the past decade, says the slip-up is a reminder of the willingness of many analysts to dole out second chances to companies even after they begin to stumble. "Because management throws out some numbers, everyone buys it," he complains. "If (analysts) got out and kicked the tires and drilled down more . . . they might notice it's not as good as they think." 

 In First Union's case, the company line on CoreStates was unabashedly optimistic until this week. "I'm feeling good about where CoreStates is," John R. Georgius, the bank's president, told analysts in March, though he acknowledged sales gains were slower than expected. 

 Still, it was evident as far back as last winter to some of First Union's competitors in the Northeast that the situation at CoreStates looked much worse. "It's like a joke, the numbers they come up with," Vernon W. Hill II, chairman and president of Commerce Bancorp Inc. in New Jersey, said in an interview Monday, the day before First Union delivered its bad news to Wall Street. 

 Mr. Crutchfield declined to be interviewed. But people close to First Union say top executives say they are sorry about how the stumbles were handled. In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Georgius said: "Nobody said it would be easy." 

 The scarcity of outside data on Core-States available to analysts on the Internet during the past few months also was a sign of problems, but what was available could have indicated snags. In New Jersey alone, the deposits held in First Union and CoreStates branches fell 4% to $18.4 billion in the 12 months ended in June 1998, just two months after the acquisition was completed. In contrast, New Jersey banks except for First Union saw their deposits grow nearly 6% in the same period. 

 A chastened Mr. Stumpf, who follows both First Union and Commerce, now says he should have paid more attention to horror stories from bankers like Mr. Hill. "I'm asking myself to listen more to the anecdotal evidence," he says. 

 Another black eye for most analysts is that they didn't pay much attention to evidence in the fall and winter that First Union's core revenue and profit were a far cry from the numbers appearing in the bank's quarterly earnings reports. 

 Thomas D. McCandless, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, was one of the first to express some concern, as early as October, about First Union's use of nonrecurring items to boost the bottom line. Other analysts scoffed at his conclusions. Then, in January, his calculations showed that after excluding branch-sale gains and other benefits, operating income fell nearly 4% last year on a per-share basis. That wasn't even close to the 25% jump First Union, which wasn't making those exclusions, was claiming in January. 

 Some embarrassed analysts now concede they had their eye instead on areas where First Union appears to be making all the right moves. One of those is investment banking, a fast-growing business that underscores the company's aggressive push to shift its dependence away from traditional activities such as collecting deposits and into fee-generating operations. Its results have remained strong. 

 Other analysts concede they allowed themselves to be reassured too many times by Mr. Crutchfield, who is known for his aw-shucks charm and plain talk. 

 Now, First Union could find it much harder to win analysts back. "How many times have we had to eat our words?" says Mr. Stumpf, the A.G. Edwards analyst. "You can only do it so many times."

 NEW YORK, May 28 (Reuters) - Shares of Valero Energy Corp., America's fourth largest independent oil refiner, were hard hit Friday morning after the company warned that its second-quarter profits would be hit by the weakest Gulf Coast refining margins in 15 years. 

 Valero, a Fortune 500 company which is seen as a weather vane for the refining business, said in a statement on Thursday that it "expects to report a net loss for the second quarter ending June 30, based on the extremely weak refining margin environment in April and May and the company's expectations for below average refining margins for June." 

 The statement added that refining margins "are well below their lowest levels for any comparable period over the last fifteen years." 

 Valero plunged to a low of $18.875, down $1.625, early on Friday before bouncing back to stand at $20.0625, down $0.4375, or a little over 2.0 percent, just before 1400 EDT. 

 Analysts noted that Valero, which has seen its market value halved in the past two years to about $1 billion, also issued a profit warning about this time last year. 

 Though its strategy of being a "pure refiner," with no retail chain to cushion the bad times when factory-gate margins are squeezed, has not been successful in recent years, some analysts see it paying off longer term. 

 Jennifer Weinstein Gordon, an analyst with BT Alex Brown in Baltimore, says, "Valero is much more leveraged to refining margins than most...and Gulf Coast refining margins are not good." 

 She expects refining margins, which so far in the second quarter are running at half last year's level, to fall another 10 percent this year. 

 "For margins to improve capacity has to be taken out of the system," Weinstein Gordon said. BT Alex Brown forecasts that tighter environmental rules in both Europe and the U.S. will start to improve industry margins from next year. 

 Valero's strategy has been to position itself to take advantage of longer-term trends, including the worldwide trend toward producing more of the cheaper "sour" crudes, and the U.S. trend toward importing more and more of its oil needs. 

 But OPEC's agreements over the past year to cut back production has worked against Valero particularly. 

 "Things look pretty dark at Valero right now, but strategically their assets are well placed," said Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., a Houston-based investment bank specialising in the oil industry. 

 He says Valero's share price values the company at only slighthly over the book value of its assets, which means it does not have much more room to decline. But it has significant upside potential to gain from an improvement in margins, Dietert said.

 Nearly everyone on Wall Street wanted to believe Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. could do it. And that's the problem. 

 Earlier this week, the First Union chief executive conceded that the North Carolina bank's $19.8 billion acquisition last year of CoreStates Financial, then the largest bank takeover in U.S. history, is crumbling under its own weight. The essential problem: First Union's promise to increase sales while chopping expenses in half at CoreStates, of Philadelphia, just isn't coming true.

As of Thursday, just eight out of 25 analysts rated First Union a buy or strong buy, compared with 15 four days earlier, according to First Call Corp.

"It's like a joke, the numbers they come up with," Vernon W. Hill II, chairman and president of Commerce Bancorp, said in an interview Monday, the day before First Union delivered its bad news to Wall Street. 

 Mr. Hill says his New Jersey bank has had no trouble luring away customers, unhappy with branch closings and snafus with their accounts, from CoreStates. He shares this fact gladly with anyone who asks. "We've seen many, many mergers, and I've never seen one this bad," he said. "The volume we've gotten from First Union is much higher than we would normally see." 

 Mr. Crutchfield declined to be interviewed. But people close to First Union say top executives say they are sorry about how the stumbles were handled. In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Georgius said: "Nobody said it would be easy." He added that First Union "expects to be back on track" next year. 

 The scant outside data on CoreStates, available to analysts on the Internet during the past few months, also was a sign of problems. In New Jersey alone, the deposits held in First Union and CoreStates branches fell 4.2% to $18.4 billion between June of 1998, just two months after the acquisition was completed, and a year earlier. In contrast, New Jersey banks except for First Union saw their deposits grow nearly 6% in the same period, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

 A chastened Mr. Stumpf, who follows both First Union and Commerce, now says he should have paid more attention to horror stories from bankers like Mr. Hill. "I'm asking myself to listen more to the anecdotal evidence," he said. "This hurts our credibility, and maybe we deserve it for not seeing things." 

 Another black eye for most analysts is that they didn't pay much attention to evidence in the autumn and winter that First Union's core revenue and profit were a far cry from the numbers appearing in the bank's quarterly earnings reports. 

 Now, analysts are predicting a steep decline for 1999. Mr. McCandless still worries, though, about the bank's latest promise to accelerate revenue growth to 10% in 2000 from only about 6% this year. "It's a little early for investors to make that leap of faith," he said.

 For the second straight day on Tuesday, a Memphis hospitality company flashed warnings about its profits, and the price of its stock dropped sharply. 

 Executives of Promus Hotel Corp. said earnings per share growth this year will be "in the mid-single digits" rather than the previously expected "mid-teens range." They cited declining market conditions, expenses of revamping some of its Doubletree hotels and deteriorating performance of its Red Lion brand. 

 Promus stock fell $5.371/2 to close at $25.121/2 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange where more than 4.9 million shares, or 12.7 times the average daily volume, changed hands. 

 Shares of ResortQuest International Inc. of Memphis plunged nearly 42 percent Monday after company executives said the firm will not live up to analyst profit forecasts for the second quarter. 

 On Monday morning, ResortQuest executives said the company will earn 10 to 14 cents a share during the quarter that will end June 30. A consensus of analyst estimates put projected earnings at 18 cents a share. In the same quarter last year, profits totaled 7 cents a share. 

 ResortQuest stock closed at 713/16 , down 13/16 Tuesday. 

 A slowdown in the market for hotel rooms accounts for some of the revisions in Promus's growth projections, said Norman P. Blake Jr., chairman, chief executive officer and president. Increases in revenue per available room will be about 1 percent to 3 percent this year, lower than projected earlier, he said. 

 Efforts to improve the quality of Doubletree hotels will result in changes to 29 of them this year and next, Blake said. 

 "Those hotels are either not in appropriate markets or do not have the acceptable product quality to measure up to Doubletree standards," he said. 

 Ten to 15 of the hotels will be dropped from the Promus system. The others are expected to be converted to Red Lion Inns. 

 Those changes have also slowed growth of Doubletree and income from management contracts. 

 Also, the company's purchasing subsidiary's fees have not grown because of lower-than-expected Doubletree management fees. 

 The Red Lion brand was not marketed aggressively after Promus acquired Doubletree. But Promus plans to reverse that to make the brand a dominant one in the Northwest, Blake said. That includes improving hotels, adding others and setting up new franchising programs. 

 Analysts who follow the company dropped their ratings on the stock. Harry Venezia of Raymond James Financial Inc. in St. Petersburg lowered his rating to "accumulate" from "buy" while Denise Wilder Warren of Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York downgraded Promus shares to near term "neutral" from near-term "accumulate." 

 Thomas Graves of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York put a "hold" rating on the stock, down from "accumulate" and dropped his 1999 profit estimates by 17 cents to $2.20 a share and his 2000 projections by 32 cents to $2.33. 

 Those figures exclude asset sale gains and employee retention costs, he said. 

 "Promus is no longer the growth company for the next year or two that people expected it to be," Graves said, "I'm increasingly concerned about the competitive environment in the industry." 

 The hotel construction boom will keep room rates from rising and dampen occupancy growth rates for the next year or more, he said. 

 The repositioning of the Doubletree brand will cost Promus management fees and hurt profits in the short run, he said. 

 But, Graves said Promus shares are worth holding on to because their price-to-earnings value is lower than the average stock and "a lot of bad news" is built into the price. 

 In addition, the drop to about $25 a share makes Promus a more attractive takeover candidate than before the decline, he said. 

 Hilton Hotels, for example, could benefit by attaching its brand names to the Promus name, Graves said. 

 Marriott Corp. is another possibility, although the company and Promus compete head-to-head in many hotel segments such as budget inns and suite hotels, Graves said. 

 Meanwhile, analysts' earnings expectations for Promus have begun to decline. 

 An 18 analysts earnings estimate average for Promus' second-quarter (June 1999) was 66 cents a share, which four have reduced to 59 cents. And the annual earnings estimate, which once averaged $2.38 has been reduced to $2.17, said Chuck Hill with First Call Corp. 

 Looking ahead to the next fiscal year ending December 2000, First Call analysts have reduced their earnings expectations for Promus from $2.71 per share to $2.37, said Hill. 

 Whether the earnings declines are the beginning of a trend for the lodging industry remains unclear.

 First Union Issues 3rd  Profit Warning  Since Acquiring CoreStates

 CHARLOTTE, N.C. -(Dow Jones)- First Union Corp., the nation's sixth-largest bank, said Tuesday it expects second-quarter and 1999 earnings to come in below analysts' expectations and the bank's own goals, citing weaker-than-expected revenue growth and costs associated with acquisitions. 

 The news rattled investors, who sent the banking company's shares (FTU) down $4.25, or 8.5%, to close at $45.688 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 The profit warning is the third issued by the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank this year. In March, the company said first-quarter earnings would miss expectations because of potential fallout from continuing job cuts in the wake of last year's acquisition of CoreStates Financial Corp. First Union was in the process of eliminating 5,850 jobs, or 7% of its work force. 

 In January, First Union warned it expected this year's operating income to fall far short of its target because of an accounting change, additional advertising expenses and branch renovations. 

 First Union said Tuesday it expects second-quarter earnings of between $770 million and $800 million, or 80 cents to 83 cents a share, excluding a one-time gain of eight cents. 

 Earnings for the year, excluding a 20-cent gain, are seen coming in between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, or $3.40 to $3.50 a share, below the bank's $4-a-share target. Last year, First Union reported earnings of $3.7 billion, or $3.77 a diluted share, before merger and restructuring charges. 

 Both the quarter and full-year projections exclude merger-related and restructuring charges. 

 The mean estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by First Call called for earnings of 97 cents a share in the second quarter and $3.98 a share for the year. 

 First Union said revenue-related factors, including a decline in growth in the CoreStates territory and the implementation of its Future Bank project, will have a 27 cents to 32 cents a share impact on 1999 earnings. 

 "The CoreStates market was not a growth market and First Union paid a huge price for them," said Edward Jones & Co. analyst Michael Ancell. 

 John Moore, bank analyst with Interstate/Johnson Lane, suspects that a significant number of CoreStates customers have been lost to other banks since the First Union acquisition. 

 "I'm not sure how much of the business base has run off in Pennsylvania and New Jersey," he said. "But I expect it's more than what they (First Union) anticipated." 

 Expense-related factors from the $1.1 billion acquisition of Midwest brokerage Everen Capital Corp. and a $90 million to $110 million increase in loan-loss provisions, will lower earnings by up to 28 cents a share. The company said other miscellaneous items, principally expenses, will reduce earnings by seven cents to 10 cents a share. 

 The banking company had assets of $231 billion and shareholder equity of $16 billion as of March 31. 

 "In 1999, the company's fundamental operations are strong, as evidenced by an estimated 20% return on shareholders' equity. However, in 1999 we are faced with overcoming the impact of substantial 1998 unusual, noncore earnings items, major acquisition integration and acceleration of spending for major new strategic initiatives as we deploy a new business model," said Edward E. Crutchfield, First Union's chairman and chief executive officer. 

 First Union said its new business model will expand distribution capabilities, including building an Internet presence, and includes nationwide brokerage activities provided by its Wheat First Union and Everen brokerage units. The switch to the new model will require a $500 million investment in 1999 in First Union Capital Markets, Capital Management, Future Bank and Internet units. 

 The bank said the outlook for the full year includes core revenue growth of 6% to 7% and expense growth of about 3%. The company said its investments should provide a platform for core revenue growth of about 10% for 2000. It expects double-digit earnings growth from its Capital Markets and Capital Management unit over the next five years. 

 But analysts said the latest profit warning translates into a loss of credibility for First Union management. "Everything that we're seeing here points to an issue of credibility, as well as a lack of strategic management," said George A. Bicher, banking analyst with BT Alex. Brown & Sons in New York. "How much credibility does this company have in saying now that it's OK?" 

 Others agreed. "I think it's the first time since the last recession that a bank has missed earnings targets two quarters in a row," said Edward Jones' Ancell. "Management has egg all over its face." 

 Bicher said First Union shares will continue to trade at a significant discount to its peer group as long as credibility remains an issue. "The catalyst to credibility would be a shake-up in management. But I don't see that happening right away," he said. 

 First Union also said Tuesday it will buy back up to 50 million of its shares. At Monday's closing price of $49.938, the buyback would be worth about $2.5 billion. The company has 967.9 million shares outstanding.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)-- Marks & Spencer PLC's (U.MAR) Chief Executive Peter Salsbury, Tuesday, set about redeeming the flagging status of Britain's biggest clothing retailer. 

 Salsbury, in the past, has always played second fiddle to Chairman Richard Greenbury at results meetings. But he had the stage to himself, Tuesday, as he presented his plans to turn M&S around after last year's disappointing profit performance. 

 Greenbury, who handed over the chief executive's reins in January after a bitter boardroom struggle, was absent. He was holding discussions in Westminster with an all-party committee of Members of Parliament on the U.K. textile industry. 

 "The results were a major setback and simply not acceptable," Salsbury told a press conference. M&S reported a 41% drop in pretax profit to GBP655.7 million before exceptional items for the year to March 31, from GBP1,114.8 million a year ago. 

 Group sales for the year were flat at GBP8.2 billion, though like-for-like sales were down 4.1%, becoming progressively worse during the year. Clothing and home furnishings led the decline in like-for-like sales with a 5.6% drop, while the food business suffered a 1.4% fall. 

 Salsbury outlined how M&S had lost market share to rivals such as Gap Inc. (GPS) and Next PLC (U.NXT). Salsbury said this was due to M&S's "dull" clothing ranges, bad publicity and the inconvenience caused to customers by refurbishment work in some of the stores. He said that M&S plans to fight back through a combination of better buying, leaner management and, most importantly according to him, a return to value principles. This was a reference to the need to offer value for money, in the face of increased competition on product ranges, but also on prices. 

 Analysts felt Salsbury emerged with credit from his first major test under the media spotlight. "I thought he got his message across well," said one analyst who attended Tuesday's briefing. "He handled most of the questions OK." 

 M&S has been struggling to redeem its stock market standing since last year's boardroom infighting, which was followed by January's shock profit warning. In order to bring the group closer to the investment community, the results meeting was for the first time held away from M&S's Baker Street headquarters, at a venue near the City of London. 

 M&S shares recovered some of their recent heavy losses Tuesday, as investors were relieved that the figures held no new shocks, observers said. There had been fears of a first- half profit warning, observers added. 

 At 1516 GMT, the shares were up 17 pence, or 4.5%, at 396 pence, with 24.3 million shares traded. 

 "The numbers were in line and the share price rise is mostly down to the presentation," said Nathan Cockrell, analyst at broker BT Alex Brown. 

 "They've certainly addressed the main issues. There's much less material for the bears to work with. There seems to be a change in culture and in style," Cockrell added. 

 Cockrell said he intends to maintain his forecast of a current year pretax profit of GBP750 million, though this is only because of the inclusion of a 53rd week's trading this year, which M&S said will add around GBP42 million to profits. (The financial year can be extended by one week, since it doesn't follow the calendar year.) 

 Excluding the extra week and other one-off factors, Cockrell said he has reduced his forecast by around GBP25 million. Cockrell said that this was due mainly to the "hideous" performance of M&S's Continental European operations, which posted losses of GBP12.5 million before exceptional items in the year. 

 Broker SG Securities upgraded its recommendation on M&S shares to hold from underperform, while Credit Suisse First Boston repeated its buy rating. 

 Salsbury said that the high street was becoming increasingly competitive. "The (retail) market was characterized by new entrants from a number of different directions," Salsbury said. 

 "There were a number of entrants from overseas. In addition, some of the more traditional competition revived using brands and marketing promotion, while there was also the growth of the supermarkets at another level", he added. 

 M&S said its share of the U.K. clothing and footwear market fell to 14.3% in the second half of last year from 15.1% a year earlier, while its share of the food market held at 4.3%. 

 Salsbury said that one of the group's key priorities was to stop the drop in market share. M&S must also offer "better value and a better range of products", restore profitability in its overseas business and continue to develop its financial services arm, he said. 

 Referring to pressure on prices, Salsbury said: "Values are much keener now than they were a year ago and we will make sure we take advantage of our better efficiencies and better buying to offer tremendous value." 

 Salsbury said that M&S will save around GBP40 million a year from the recent job cuts at head office and store levels. 

 He added that the group's buying will benefit from a trend toward overseas sourcing of goods. Around 40% of M&S's merchandise is now sourced overseas against 35% a year ago, with the biggest growth areas being North Africa and the Far East, Salsbury said. 

 M&S's overseas retail operations, which made an operating loss of GBP14.6 million last year, continue to hold a key role in the group's future, Salsbury said. In Europe, power has been shifted to local managers and smaller buying teams have been set up, Salsbury said. Two stores in France and Spain have been closed, and overseas director Guy McCracken added that: "Where appropriate we'll take further actions." 

 Salsbury said that group sales have stayed under pressure in the current year to date, but he pointed to a trend toward improvement. Total sales were down 7.2% in the four weeks to April 24, but fell only 2.6% in the following two weeks. If the improving trend seen in the last fortnight is maintained, "we would make progress this year", Salsbury added. 

 M&S raised its dividend for the year to 14.4 pence from 14.3 pence. Salsbury said that the board had never considered cutting it.

PROFIT WARNING FEAR SLAMS M&S SHARES: Confident that more trouble is in store for Marks & Spencer, sellers dumped shopping bag loads of the troubled High Street giant's shares. They fell 23 pence before closing 1514 pence down at 391 1/4 pence on increasing fears that a warning about first-half profits will accompany Tuesday's preliminary results. 

 Dealers already expect bad news. M&S warned in January that annual profits would be slashed by almost a half to UKpound 625 million-UKpound 675 million after a drastic slump in sales. But, should chief executive Peter Salsbury warn again about current trading, it would be catastrophic for the share price. 

 Long-term bears West LB Panmure is a seller down to 325 pence. Analyst Emily Shamma is convinced M&S will have to warn on first-half profits. She says the timescale involved in turning the business round is incredibly long, it is some way from addressing its major strategic problems in UK food and like-for-like sales in clothing have averaged double-digit decline throughout the spring/summer season. 

 Shamma forecasts bottom-of-the-range pre-tax profits of UKpound 625 million, down from UKpound 1.1 billion. 

 M&S suppliers AB Foods dipped 12 pence to 4833/4 pence and Northern Foods 6 pence to 138 pence in sympathy. Arcadia declined 25 pence to 257 1/2 pence and Debenhams 21 pence to 461 1/2 pence on concern that M&S will drag the rest of the retail sector sharply lower. 

 Elsewhere, stronger-than-expected US inflation data slammed the brake on record-breaking Wall Street and depressed London. Yields on US treasury bonds soared amid renewed fears that the Federal Reserve will soon have to raise interest rates. 

 As the Dow Jones lost 199 points in early trading, the Footsie plummeted 195.2 points. But selling was light and it recovered to finish 156.2 lower at 6300.4, only 55.6 off on the week. 

 Gilts lost 50 pence in sympathy with US treasury losses of 2 points. The pound dipped to $1.6145 before closing 1/8 dearer at $1.6202, while the euro edged up to 66.03 pence from 65.64 pence. In dollar terms, it rallied to $1.0650 from $1.0631. 

 Financials were the heaviest casualties. Fund manager Amvescap lost 47 pence to 598 pence, insurer CGU 61 pence to 899 1/2 pence, Barclays 78 pence to 1792 pence and NatWest 53 pence to 1368 pence. 

 Speciality chemicals reflected a combination of recovery and bid hopes. Yule Catto jumped 17 pence to 345 pence. Croda International, still drawing strength from this week's upbeat agm, rose 9 pence further to 281 1/2 pence. 

 Amberley, recently tipped by Sutherlands at 57 pence, closed 7 pence better at 70 pence. Meanwhile, British Vita eased 3 1/2 pence to 266 1/2 pence ahead of an analysts' trip next week to its foam operations in Belgium. 

 Leisure group Rank cheapened 8 1/2 pence to 223 pence on Lehman Bros red pencil treatment. Citing weak trading in the first quarter, the broker slashed its current-year pre-tax profit forecast to UKpound 229 million from UKpound 262 million. 

 Pub and restaurant group SFI, which held abortive merger talks with Regent Inns earlier this year, frothed 6 pence higher to 226 pence. The management has been well received at various institutional presentations of late. Regent held at 196 pence. 

 Rival theme bar and restaurant concern Luminar lost 1212 pence to 975 pence. Chief executive Stephen Thomas sold 100,000 shares at 970 pence and chairman Michael Arnold 15,951 at 970 pence. 

 Confirmation of a bid approach at 43 pence lifted printed circuit board maker Symonds 6 pence to 39 pence. 

 An agreement with the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union over terms of employment helped Jarvis touch 515 pence and finish 13 pence dearer at 472 1/2 pence. The construction and infrastructure services group had been in a 10-month dispute with its employees over working conditions and pay. 

 Mobile phone company Vodafone buzzed 11 pence higher to 1187 pence. Broker Warburg Dillon Read advised clients to buy up to UKpound 15. 

 Confectionery group Cadbury Schweppes improved 15 pence to 827 pence on revived speculation that American investment guru Warren Buffett will soon emerge with a 3 percent stake.

 NEW YORK -- Oracle Corp. fell on concerns that the database software giant might lower its earnings outlook for its fourth quarter. 

 Over the past two weeks, Oracle has been "more cautious in their comments" about its fourth fiscal quarter ending May 31, said Goldman Sachs & Co. Rick Sherlund. 

 Sherlund noted that Oracle missed analysts' revenue targets during its third fiscal quarter and that there has been "a fair amount of uncertainty" about how successful the company will be converting deals into actual revenue. 

 Several business software companies have faced prospects of slowing near-term revenue growth. In particular, the year 2000 computer glitch is leading customers to defer buying new software until they fix their existing systems. 

 Oracle is hosting a financial analyst meeting Thursday after the close. Sherlund said he is anticipating that the company will be "negative on the quarter" but positive in terms of its long-term strategic direction. 

 In recent trading, Oracle was down 1 13/16, or 7.2%, at 23 1/2.

 FOCUS-C&W profits slide, warns worse to come.

 LONDON, May 12 (Reuters) - Cable and Wireless Plc, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, warned on Wednesday that tough trading conditions in its key Hong Kong business and hefty investment plans would cut earnings significantly this year. 

 Posting a 17 percent drop in 1998/99 pre-tax profits to 1.82 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) on a 13 percent rise in revenues to 7.94 billion, C&W heralded a year of transition in which it would focus increasingly on booming data and Internet services. 

 Hoping to feed revenues from corporate customers that already account for 73 percent of the total, C&W also announced a two billion pound, three-year network investment plan to support rising corporate demand for data and Internet services and total capital expenditure of over three billion this year. 

 "I firmly believe that our increased focus on major growth markets based on data and Internet will deliver improved value for our shareholders," said C&W's new Chief Executive Graham Wallace in the results statement. 

 But analyst hopes were dashed that the group, which has already put its 50-percent owned British cellular operator One2One up for sale, would unveil a radical restructuring spelling an end to its exposure to the global consumer market. 

 C&W's shares ended down 4.7 percent, or 39-1/2p, at 806p as dealers predicted a 10 percent cut in profit forecasts and analysts said a long-awaited strategic review had turned out to be a disappointment. 

 C&W executives told analysts they had no plans to use the possible sale of One2One as a launchpad for disposing of other consumer businesses, such as those in Hong Kong and Australia, because these were integrated in their subsidiaries. 

 "If selling off One2One is not part of a bigger strategy of getting out of the consumer business...then you have to ask whether they are just doing it because they need the cash and are not in control of their destiny," said Justinian Clifford-Bowles, telecoms analyst at Commerzbank. 

 "Either the integrated approach is right, or it isn't." 

 Analysts argue that C&W could have integrated One2One by buying out its co-owner, MediaOne International, rolling the business into C&W's British cable operation Cable & Wireless Communications Plc and re-branding it. 

 MediaOne is selling its One2One stake after recommending a $58 billion takeover by U.S. telecoms giant AT&T Corp. News in March that C&W was also considering selling or listing its stake in the fast growing industry took some by surprise. 

 It was closely followed by news that C&W's majority-owned cable TV and telephony business CWC was in talks with rival Telewest Communications Plc in a move analysts speculate could see C&W exit Britain's cable TV market. 

 C&W's earnings had been expected to suffer this year after a sharp drop in profits amid fierce price competition at its prized Hong Kong Telecommunication Ltd's subsidiary, followed closely by a profit warning from CWC. 

 But analysts were wary of a company statement that difficult economic and market conditions in Hong Kong, which accounts for the lion's share of C&W's profits, and planned investments would "reduce underlying earnings significantly" this year. 

 C&W's share price was in marked contrast to that of CWC, Britain's biggest cable group, which saw its stock jump almost four percent to 652p after a newspaper reported U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp might to buy a 30 percent stake worth more than $4.0 billion. 

 Wallace declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal Europe article, which cited sources close to the talks as saying he had talked with Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Greg Maffei on Tuesday - but that completion of a deal was not imminent. ($1=.6169 Pound).

 Synopsys seeks No. 1 spot in chip-design software. 

 By Simon Hirschfeld

 NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Synopsys Inc. , now the No. 2 player in software used to design the computer chips that power almost every electronic device, could surpass its main rival in two to three years, its chief executive said. 

 Aart de Geus, also founder and chairman, said in an interview that while Cadence Design Systems Inc.  is the No. 1 player, with $1.2 billion in revenues, Synopsys, with $750 million, is gaining ground fast in the $3 billion market. 

 Cadence shocked Wall Street in April by predicting near-zero earnings and revenue growth for the rest of the year. By contrast, Synopsys expects 20 percent revenue growth, and well over 50 percent earnings gains for the current year, with a target of $2.50 a share in earnings from 1998's $1.34. 

 Cadence's profit warning, which sent the stock plunging 40 percent in one day and prefigured the resignation of its chief executive a week later, has put the shares in the $13 range, down from about $21 before the warning. 

 In lowering estimates, Cadence cited industry conditions in Asia, slower-than-expected technology upgrades and a slower industry recovery following the beginning of a turnaround in semiconductors. But some analysts believe the problems were specific to Cadence. 

 Synopsys shares also fell, from $53, to near $45, after an analyst mistakenly predicted in early April that it would miss second-quarter earnings estimates. But shares have since regained ground to trade near $49. Mountain View, Calif.-based Synopsys came in at the high end of analysts' estimates for the second quarter, with pro forma earnings of 60 cents a share. 

 "The worry I think is still lingering a bit, Cadence having hit the wall so hard, is if there is anything suspicious about the market," de Geus said in a recent interview in New York. 

 "Fundamentally, all the financial metrics are very sound," he said of his own company's finances. 

 And the market for such chip-design software is fairly reliable, "chugging along" at 15 to 20 percent annual growth, according to Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Erach Desai. 

 "On the heels of a tough semiconductor environment it can be as low as 10 percent," Desai said. "With the wind at its back from a robust semi environment it can be a 20 to 25 percent grower." 

 Industry-watchers are predicting semiconductors will recover from a three-year downswing that troughed in 1998. "The (chip-design software) sector typically benefits with about a one-quarter lag," said Desai, who rates Synopsys a "strong buy." 

 The Cadence profit warning may have soured investors on the industry, since Cadence has a 40 percent market share, but these problems are not shared by Synopsys, Desai said. 

 With about 25 percent of the market, Synopsys faces a challenge to capture the leading spot without acquisitions, Desai said. 

 Synopsys is sitting on nearly $700 million in cash with which it could buy companies that fit its strategy of acquiring complementary technologies, de Geus said. 

 In recent years, Synopsys has made two of the largest acquisitions in the history of its industry, spending about $450 million to buy Epic Design Technology and $500 million for ViewLogic Systems. 

 "We try to avoid dilutive deals unless they are so small we can push a little harder on the rest of the company," de Geus said, referring to the company's effort to make acquisitions pay for themselves. 

 Synopsys is the market leader in "high level design" software used to work out the architecture of chips as complex as the infrastructure of a major city. By contrast, Cadence has dominated "physical design" software used to ensure the microscopic details work in practice. 

 But Synopsys is expanding onto Cadence's home turf. 

 The company, which spends an unusually high 20 percent of revenues on research and development, has joined high-level and physical design in a "chip architect" product that allows customers to follow the implications of their design ideas all the way down to the physical level of a chip. 

 The product could save customers from having to go back to the drawing board when they find out a design won't work, saving months of development time for customers like Intel Corp.  and Motorola Inc.  in a fast-moving industry, de Geus said.

 News Analysis - Can Internet sales save Compaq UK?

 Compaq UK is determined to avoid a repeat of its US counterpart's profits warning by taking on sales over the Internet. But in a sector dominated by seasoned rivals, is it a case of too little, too late? asks Paul Edwards. 

 Compaq's profit warning in the US two weeks ago shocked the computer industry and led to the dismissal of the company's two top directors. After years of uninterrupted growth, the PC manufacturer was hit by price-cutting from rivals and a failure to concentrate on the budget-price consumer market while it pushed into business computing. 

 Equally problematic has been Compaq's slow uptake in marketing its products on the Internet, as its rivals, such as Dell, have done. 

 The Houston-based PC maker, whose chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer and chief financial officer Earl Mason were fired last week, reported net income of $281m (#175m), or 16 cents a share in the first quarter of 1999. Before the company's profits warning two weeks ago, analysts had expected 31 cents. 

 The turmoil at the top of Compaq has left the company's UK bosses wondering how they can ensure the UK business does not suffer a similar fate. 

 Compaq UK is to start selling PCs over the Internet, in a move which observers believe is an attempt to ensure there is no repeat of the US profit warning. 

 Direct sellers such as Dell have not only undercut Compaq with $1,000 (#600) multimedia PC packages, but have exploited Internet sales to the full. 

 According to Dell, computer sales on the Internet accounted for 50 per cent of its business last year - worth $4m a day in Europe and $14m worldwide. 

 That a highly-regarded computer manufacturer such as Compaq has only just started an Internet sales site in the US seems hard to believe. That site could take some time before it is operational in the UK. 

 In addition, Compaq has been busy during the past few years with acquisitions. In 1997 it acquired Tandem Computers, known for its high performance, reliable computers used in stock markets. And last year it bought Digital Equipment, entering the computer services market, as well as broadening its hardware and software product lines. 

 Compaq's UK bosses have admitted their American counterparts should have acted more quickly to avert the recent profit slump. 

 Compaq UK marketing director Vesey Crichton says: "The bottom line is that the integration [with Tandem and Digital] is taking longer than the then leaders of the company thought it would. 

 "It's going well, but not all the processes are finished. It was forecast to the market that the whole thing would be done in six months, but we missed. Not hugely in revenue, but it did amount to a profits warning and the leaders got fired. 

 "The only mistake made was thinking the integration would take only six months. But the company is completely sound, with about $1bn in the bank." 

 Crichton, who is a former adviser to Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and has worked at Compaq for the past ten years, adds: "Pfeiffer [Compaq's sacked chief executive] did an incredible job of taking the company from $3bn to $40bn in eight years. That's incredible growth. 

 "But when companies have heroes like that, boards are usually reluctant to confront them when things start to drift." 

 Richard Caines, retail consultant with market research company Mintel, says there is little doubt the profit warning came about because of price competition in the PC market. 

 Caines, who edited a recent report called Computer Retailing, says: "It's a company problem and certainly not the computer market because sales are still growing. In the UK there is still huge potential for further market growth. 

 "I don't agree with Compaq's statement that the downturn in profits was due to a `lower demand than expected'. It's a profits problem, rather than sales, which seem to be holding up pretty well. 

 "Direct sellers like Dell have used the Internet to sell products at much cheaper prices for some time. If Compaq is only now using the Internet, it has some catching up to do." 

 However, Crichton appears unworried by the competition from direct sellers like Tiny, Time and Gateway 2000, which sell PCs from about #700 in this country. 

 He says: "PC prices have been dropping about 20 per cent a year anyway. 

 "But the real cost of a PC is not in the purchase price, it is in cost of ownership. If people think they are being bright by saving money (C) buying in the box, it's actually the wrong decision, because it costs much more to maintain and up-grade a PC." 

 Crichton is also keen to emphasise Compaq's existing Internet links. He says more devices attached to the Internet are Compaq hardware and more Websites run on Compaq than any other platform. 

 "We have a pretty strong position in the running process. Microsoft does great software, and it has a fantastic Website which takes 150 million hits a day. But that not only runs on Compaq, it is outsourced to Compaq as well. Compaq owns the platform and runs it." 

 He says Compaq is aiming to increase its Internet involvement. One of the main activities is Compaq.com, where products can be bought online in the US. Plans to set up a UK service are underway. 

 As well as increased Web advertising, Compaq is also marketing online solutions to support Internet users. 

 Crichton adds: "We are trying to build the best IT company for the 21st century and have bought various companies and developed a range of product lines to do that. We have market share leadership with PCs and are world leaders for Internet access. We feel we have the fundamentals." 

 Compaq says its latest advertising campaign, created by DDB, which focuses on facts about Compaq, is creating wider awareness. 

 "The core brand proposition we are trying to get across is that Compaq reduces the complexity of computing. We go the extra mile," says Crichton. 

 But such assurances may not be enough to counter increased competition from cut-price PC manufacturers. Compaq will have to wait and see if its reputation for after-sales service is more attractive to consumers than plummeting prices. Its entry into Internet sales may save the day, though the company is lagging far behind its rivals.

 Autodesk tumbles after warning of weak first quarter.

 PALO ALTO, Calif., May 5 (Reuters) - Autodesk Inc. stock tumbled 17 percent in active trading on Wednesday, a day after the maker of computer-aided design software said its first quarter profits would fall far short of expectations as customers wait for new products. 

 The shares fell $4.94 to $23.56, making it the 15th-biggest percentage loser on the Nasdaq. The stock has tumbled from a 52-week-high of $49.44 

 The San Rafael, Calif.-based company said after the market closed on Tuesday that profits before charges and amortization for the quarter ended April 30 would be 10 cents to 15 cents a share. That is far less than the 40 cents a share analysts were forecasting, according to First Call Corp. 

 In last year's first quarter, Autodesk reported net income of $27.6 million, or 55 cents a share. 

 "Autodesk customers are in a transition throughout our product line," Chief Executive Carol Bartz said in a statement. 

 The company said it now expects revenues of $190 million to $195 million. Excluding the charges but including amortization of goodwill, earnings per share will be 2 cents to 5 cents. 

 The company, which makes software used by engineers, architects and designers, will announce results on May 27. 

 After the profit warning, brokerage firms Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Dain Rauscher Wessels downgraded the stock. Goldman cut its rating to "market performer" from "market outperformer." Dain cut its rating to "neutral" from "buy." 

 Dain Rauscher Wessels noted in a research note to clients that while it expected sales eventually to rebound, there is a risk of "peak-and-valley" revenue. It downgraded the stock because of the uncertainty surrounding the product transition.

 FOCUS-Newbridge faces credibility gap after warning.

 TORONTO, May 5 (Reuters) - Investors drove the share price of computer networking and telecommunications company Newbridge Networks Corp. sharply lower on Wednesday as doubts about its credibility climbed after yet another profit warning. 

 Shares in Newbridge, based in suburban Ottawa, plunged 27 percent on Toronto's stock market at Wednesday's opening. Late on Tuesday the company surprised analysts by announcing that fourth-quarter earnings would fall short of estimates. It had issued a similar warning for its third-quarter results. 

 The stock dropped C$14.55 to C$39.05 in early action before recovering a bit to trade down C$12.15, or nearly 23 percent, at C$41.45 late in the day. 

 Up to C$2.17 billion was lopped off the company's market value on Wednesday. 

 In New York, Newbridge stock dropped $8.31 to $28.50 after opening trade was delayed due to an imbalance of buy and sell orders. 

 Market players took a jaundiced view of Newbridge's warning that operating profit for its fourth quarter, ended May 2, would come in at 12 cents to 14 cents a share, as much as 43 percent below the 21 cents a share average forecast of analysts polled by New York research house First Call. 

 Newbridge has shaken the street's trust with its recent performance, several analysts said. The company told Reuters it has failed to meet consensus expectations or issued warnings in five of its last eight quarters. 

 "Right now there is a credibility gap," said Duncan Stewart, fund manager at Tera Capital. 

 Newbridge acknowledged that its orders in the quarter, at around $550 million, were not processed quickly enough, leaving some sales uncompleted by quarter-end. "This is the sort of thing big companies are supposed to be good at," Stewart said. 

 Analysts said that orders normally surge in the last part of the quarter. 

 The company has admitted it will take two quarters to correct problems in its its manufacturing and shipping procedures. 

 "It's not one simple problem. It's a number of modest problems that are all adding up to one big bloody problem," said Robert MacLellan, analyst at CT Securities in Toronto. 

 Chief Operating Office Alan Lutz was braced for a barrage of downgrades. "We're deeply disappointed," he told analysts in a conference call on Tuesday. "I'm not trying to hide behind a rock....We expect people to criticise our ineptness." 

 On Wednesday, analyst Jim Kedersha from SG Cowen & Co. cut Newbridge to a buy from a strong buy and dropped his fiscal 2000 earnings expectations to $1 a share from $1.20 a share. 

 Analysts forecast that U.S. competitors such as Cisco Systems Inc.  or Lucent Technologies Inc.  could move to scoop up unfilled orders. 

 But, Stewart said he expects that investors will turn around and embrace Newbridge after the furore dies down. "The memory of institutional investors is not unlike that of a May fly," he said. 

 "If they give us a good quarter next, everybody will be talking about what a great company it is and how they want to bear Alan Lutz's children." 

 MacLellan, who has put a hold on the stock since December, chopped his share price target to $20 from $25 and his estimate for fiscal 2000 to 80 cents a share from $1 a share. "My view is that it's (drop in the stock) is only the beginning. I think it's got a lot further to go," he said. 

 Stewart predicted that Newbridge's first-quarter numbers will also be problematic.

ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Nestle SA (Z.NES) shares are higher in pre-market trading Wednesday following the release of the company's first-quarter sales figures.

Nestle said first-quarter revenues declined 2.7% from a year earlier, but said sales in April suggest "an accelerating growth momentum."

At 0624 GMT, Nestle shares were up CHF17.50, or 0.5%, at CHF2,777.50, while the overall market was down 0.2%.

First-quarter sales totaled CHF16.7 billion, slightly below many analysts' forecasts of around CHF17 billion.

"There had been a lot of rumors (Tuesday), that Nestle would announce a decline in first quarter sales. Thus those who wanted to sell sold Tuesday," a trader at a Swiss private bank said.

Nestle also doused market rumors of a coming profit warning by saying it expects to "generate growth in both sales and profits" for the full year, despite a slow start.

The company's cautiously optimistic outlook for the full-year is also helping its stock, the trader added.

 Europe Stock Focus: Semperit Seen Needing Higher Profile

 VIENNA (Dow Jones)--Austrian analysts have a message for shooting-star-turned-market-laggard Semperit AG Holding (R.SEM): you've got it, so flaunt it. 

 Management complacency, they argue, rather than any deterioration in its fundamentals, is responsible for the rubber products group's fall from grace in recent months. 

 Since August, the share has underperformed the local benchmark index by 30%. By comparison, it had outperformed the Austrian Traded Index by 117% in 1997 and by 220% in 1996. Even in the first half of 1998, it was 27% ahead of Austria's other blue-chips. Friday, it closed at EUR84.88, up 88 cents, or 1.1%, but still down 7.9% on the year, in which time the ATX has risen 16%. 

 Semperit's underperformance is all the more remarkable given the fact that the ATX rally has been led by fellow industrials, rather than by financials or by the defensive plays of breweries, or tobacco or power groups. 

 Analysts are unanimous about the reason for the decline: the investors who were on board during the stock's 14-fold increase between 1996 and mid-1998 all took profits during the Russia-inspired rout in the second half of last year. Since then, no new generation of investors has come along to replace them. 

 "The share price hasn't got any momentum of its own any more. It needs a push," said Claudia Vince-Bsteh, an analyst with Raiffeisen Zentralbank. 


   Profits To Keep Growing Despite Cyclical Pressure



For the present, however, analysts say Semperit's share looks
extremely cheap. Friday's closing price was only 10.5 times expected
1999 earnings and 9.7 times expected earnings in 2000. This scarcely
does justice to Semperit's record of raising pretax profit to 404
million schillings (EUR1=ATS13.7603, $1=ATS13.008) from ATS58 million
and sales to ATS3.91 billion from ATS2.67 billion in the last four
years.



Growth continued in the first quarter of 1999, with pretax profit
rising some 10% to ATS102 million. Chairman Rainer Zellner has said he
expects pretax profits of ATS450 million for the full year.



Roland Neuwirth, an analyst with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Vienna,
says he still trusts the company to continue delivering profit
increases, despite stiff competition in its key medical gloves division
and despite cyclical weakness in many of the industries to which it
delivers, such as the automobile and construction sectors.



"The group is still raising profits, but the environment has become a
little more difficult," he said.



Deutsche has a buy recommendation on the stock, as do Bank Austria's
CAIB Investmentbank unit and Erste Bank. This is despite a sharp battle
for market share in the U.S. in medical gloves, which generated 39% of
group sales in 1998.



Overcapacity and an appreciation of the Thai baht, in which most of
Semperit's glove production costs are factored, may depress margins this
year. Zellner says the Sempermed gloves division currently has sales of
between $3.5 million and $4 million a month in the U.S., but doesn't say
how margins are faring.



At all events, Semperit has so far avoided the problems of Safeskin
Corp. (SFSK), its largest U.S. competitor, which has issued a profitwarning for the full year, only just broke even in the first quarter and
whose management has resigned under a cloud of false accounting charges.



   Roadshows Seen Later This Year



However, 69% of Semperit's sales remain in Europe, and the weakness of
the European economy makes analysts wary of getting carried away by the
stock's low valuations.



Peter Breyer, an analyst with Erste Bank in Vienna, warns that profits
at the group's divisions for conveyor belts and tailored industrial
products are likely to remain "pedestrian." He still feels, however,
that the share "could easily be 10%-20% higher" than it is currently, in
view of its fundamentals.



RZB's Vince-Bsteh said profits at the group's fourth division, which
makes hydraulic hoses for industrial users, will depend on how quickly
and cheaply it can restructure Optimit, a Czech-based company it
acquired last year. She said it will be important that social
considerations don't excessively impede the rationalization at Optimit.



She and others argue that, while Semperit's story is a good one, it
isn't the only one in town. For that reason, they urge the company to
take a more active line in marketing the stock.



Austrian stocks, perhaps more than any others in the European Union,
need active selling. All but the country's largest companies struggle to
muster enough liquidity to interest Anglo-Saxon fund managers, and many
still labor, rightly or wrongly, under the image of being too close to
their former state or family owners.



The signs are that the message has already hit home at Semperit. The
company plans roadshow visits to Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Zurich in May,
London in late August and the U.S. later in the fall.

 Worldwide economic difficulties did not put too much of a brake on the PC market during 1999's first quarter, according to the latest figures from Dataquest. 

 Total shipments rose by 17.2% to 25 million helped by a solid US market, up 20.8% at 9.7 million, and by western Europe, where Dataquest is predicting "mid-teen growth for the first quarter". 

 David Stremba, principal analyst for Dataquest's personal computers worldwide programme, said: "Within the Asian region, the Japanese market continues to exhibit strength in the consumer segment despite its prolonged economic weakness. 

 "In Latin America, early signs show that first-tier [leading brand] vendors have done extremely well during the quarter at the expense of tier two and tier three vendors." 

 The figures also underline the background to Compaq's recent profit warning and the enforced resignation of Eckhardt Pfeiffer, its CEO. The company is still the number one shipper of PCs, but its worldwide market share fell back year-on-year to 13.4% from 14.3%. This decline was even more marked in the US where market share fell to 15.7% from 17.8%. 

 Compaq's shipments grew but the 9.9% volume improvement worldwide and its 6.9% rise in the US compared unfavourably with the close to 50% rises achieved by competitor Dell during the same period. Compaq's growth was also slower than that of other major manufacturers. 

 Stremba said: "Competitive pricing, efficiency, execution and new markets permit Dell to sustain its phenomenal unbroken sequence of approximately 50% unit growth. 

 "Compaq faced a slight inventory build-up in the fourth quarter which contributed to a slow start in 1999. Compaq's difficulties appear to be more company-specific rather than industry-wide."

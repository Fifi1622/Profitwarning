 EATONTOWN, N.J. -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Osteotech Inc. plunged Monday after the company said it expects to post fourth-quarter earnings below analysts' estimates, citing lower processing fees. 

 Osteotech's Nasdaq-listed shares (OSTE) fell $3.875, or 23%, to close at $13.125. Volume was 2.6 million shares, compared with a daily average of 330,000 shares. 

 Eatontown, N.J.-based Osteotech, a provider of ceramic medical devices and bone and connective tissue for transplant patients, said it reduced earnings expectations for the quarter after a client decided to send fewer donors to the company for processing. The client will reduce inventory because of softness in base-tissue sales, which will hurt its revenue by about $1 million in processing fees, the company said. 

 Osteotech now estimates that it will earn between 16 cents and 18 cents a share on revenue in the range of $18 million to $19 million. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial currently puts Osteotech's fourth-quarter earnings at around 22 cents a share. The company earned 33 cents a diluted share, or $3.2 million, on revenue of $16.2 million in the year-ago period. 

 Osteotech also said the reductions in its fourth quarter will cut 1999 earnings to the range of 83 cents to 85 cents a share, and revenue to $73.9 million to $74.9 million. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial predicted the company would earn about 82 cents a share for the year. Before a stock split, the company earned $10.3 million, or $1.10 a diluted share, on revenue of $59.2 million in the year-earlier period. In March, Osteotech paid a 3-for-2 stock split. 

 Osteotech officials declined to reveal the name of the client trying to reduce its inventory. But Osteotech Chief Operating Officer Michael Jeffries confirmed it was one of the company's two largest clients - the American Red Cross and the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation in New Jersey. 

 "What it amounts to is they are going into the new year with a higher level of tissue products on the shelf than they care to have, and they adjusted the processing level accordingly," Jeffries said. 

 Officials for the American Red Cross and the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation weren't immediately available for comment. 

 The inventory problem isn't expected to affect business next quarter, Jeffries added. 

 "We are expecting this to be a one-quarter situation. We have no indication that the client will not be back to normal levels of business going into next year," he said. 

 Still, Monday's earnings warning does little to help Osteotech's efforts to regain the investor confidence that has dwindled over the last year amid disappointing earnings and a falling stock price. 

 Osteotech shares fell sharply last June after a posting on an online message board claimed the $600,000 acquisition of the Versalok Low Back Fixation System would sharply dilute third-quarter earnings. Analysts doubted the truth of the statement, which the company also denied. 

 But three months later, Osteotech issued a warning to Wall Street that third-quarter earnings would fail to meet analysts' expectations as a result of lower gross-profit margins. 

 Jeffries attributed last quarter's earnings disappointment to a number of factors, including overly enthusiastic Street expectations, a third-quarter sales downturn that exceeded the traditional seasonal decline, and underestimating the impact of a competitor's new product line. 

 Whatever the reason, past disappointments have left the company vulnerable to downside surprises, Fahnestock & Co. analyst Juan Noble said. The timing of Monday's fourth-quarter earnings warning has done little to help, he added. 

 "To announce a fourth-quarter shortfall when you are well into the period does not instill a lot of confidence in investors," Noble said. 

 But Jeffries said company officials learned of the coming shortfall before the Thanksgiving holiday and released the information to investors as soon as possible. 

 "We do put out news, good or bad, as we understand it and when we understand it. This is something outside of our control. It is not anything we had any way of anticipating," Jeffries said.

        The drug and device market experienced another day of losses
Friday, finishing the week with a five-day session decline of 0.4%.  The
sector finished Friday's session in the red, dipping a minor 17.70 points
to close at 12568.78.
        An aggregate indicator of the group tracked by Federal Filings
Business News fell 14 basis points, with five of the eight sub-indexes
ending the day giving up value.
        Drug and device stocks have shed 1.4% over the last ten sessions.
The sector is up 26 basis points for the year.
        Small pharmaceutical stocks slipped 3.36 points, or 1.7%, to close
at 190.10.  Shares of Algos Pharmaceutical Corp.. (ALGO), QLT
Phototherapeutics Inc. (QLTI - see story below), Sepracor Inc. (SEPR) and
Cygnus Inc. (CYGN) contributed to the group's demise.  Small pharma stocks
are still up 33.8% year-to-date.
        Large pharmaceutical issues also ended Friday lower with a 22.62-
point loss to close at 10062.70.  Allergan Inc. (AGN), Eli Lilly & Co.
(LLY), Schering-Plough Corp. (SGP) and Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. (PNU) led
all decliners in the group.  Large pharma issues are now down 3.5% for the
year.
        In sub-index news, shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) lost ground
Friday -- $0.25 to $37.75 -- despite its announcement that it has acquired
Perclose Inc. (PERC) and signed a multi-year distribution agreement with
Biocompatibles International plc for all its current and future vascular
products, and a license for its coating technology for use on Abbott
vascular devices.
        "Through the acquisition of Perclose and the distribution agreement
with Biocompatibles, we are building upon our current position in vascular
medicine with leading technology and new, innovative products," said
company senior vice president Richard A. Gonzalez.  "Both Perclose and
Biocompatibles offer Abbott opportunities in the rapidly growing
interventional market.  Perclose's strong product line along with its
existing relationships with interventional cardiologists and radiologists
will be an excellent platform for expanding Abbott's vascular business."
        In a separate story, Abbott and Sepracor Inc. (SEPR) announced a
co-promotion agreement for Xopenex (levalbuterol HCl), a beta agonist, for
treatment of reversible bronchospasm.  Under terms of the agreement,
Abbott's Ross Products Division will promote Xopenex to the pediatric
market in the U.S.  Sepracor's sales force will market Xopenex to
pulmonologists, allergists and primary care physicians in U.S. hospitals
and clinics.  Sepracor will be credited with all sales and Abbott will
receive a commission on pediatric sales.  Each company is responsible for
its own selling expenses.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
        On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Pulmonary-
Allergr Drugs Advisory Committee will review Glaxo Wellcome plc's (GLX)
marketing application for three products: the Advair Diskus 100 micrograms
(ug), the Advair Diskus 250ug and the Advair Diskus 500ug for the
maintenance treatment of asthma of patients age 12 and older.
        Dow Jones News reported that the Advair Diskus consists of powder
forms of the company's drugs Flovent, a corticosteroid for preventing
inflammation in the airways and Serevent, a long-acting bronchodilator to
prevent tightening of the lung muscles.
          The combined drugs come in a flat, round container shaped like a
cosmetic case or a flattened hockey puck, said Dow Jones.  The powdered
medicine is stored in blister packs and patients pop them open.  The drug
can be inhaled in several breaths, if necessary.
        The combination is already sold in 30 other countries under
different names.  It was first launched in Sweden as Seratide at the
beginning of 1999.  For the first six months of the year, the combination
recorded $18 million in sales.

OTC SWITCH: The FDA approved Novartis Consumer Health Inc.'s Habitrol for
over-the-counter (OTC) use as an aid to smoking cessation for the relief of
nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  The nicotine transdermal system is available
as 21, 14 and seven milligrams per day patches.  Habitrol was initially
approved by the agency in 1993 as prescription medication in the same
doses.  According to company spokeswoman Kate King, most treatments that
belong to this category have switched over from prescription to OTC.  The
company made Habitrol available over-the-counter, because "there seems to
be a market place," stated King.  Novartis Consumer Health is a division of
the Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG (Z.NOV).

 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 It's a Tech, Tech, Tech Market as Nasdaq Surges Again 

 By Andrew Bary

 Rarely has one sector of the stock market been so dominant as technology is today. Tech's ascendance continued last week as the Nasdaq Composite surged 148 points, or 4.6%, closing Friday at 3369, another record. So far in 1999, the Nasdaq is up a stunning 53.7%. That beats last year's 39.6% advance and approaches the 57% gain recorded in 1991 -- the index's best performance since it was created in 1971. 

 This year's Nasdaq showing is even more impressive than 1991's because it comes after four strong years, not a snapback from the sharp decline in 1990. In just the five weeks since its October 15 low, the Nasdaq is up 23%. 

 "You have to go back to the 1970s and the surge in the energy group to find an industry sector that has so overpowered the rest of the market," says Tom Galvin, strategist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. 

 A pure technology barometer, the S&P 500's tech sector, which includes major Nasdaq stocks such as Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Intel, as well as companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and EMC that are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, now has gained 49.6% in 1999 after a 72% rise last year. Technology now accounts for about two-thirds of the gain this year in the entire S&P 500, which is up 15.7%. Tech has swollen to 26% of the index from 19% at the start of 1999 and now is the biggest group in S&P by a wide margin. Financials are a distant second at 15% of the S&P. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average did advance last week, rising 234 points, or 2.2% to 11,003, but continues to lag behind the surging Nasdaq. The Dow is now up 19.9% this year. 

 Friday's trading was typical. The Nasdaq advanced 22 points on the strength in such issues as Sun Microsystem, Intel and Oracle, but the Dow declined 31 points. The entire drop in the Dow was caused by Caterpillar's fall of 6 9/16 to 49 3/8 after the heavy-equipment maker issued its second profit warning in five months. Market breadth was weak again Friday with decliners outnumbering advancers on the Big Board by three-to-two. 

 The fading fortunes of some of the Dow's industrial stalwarts was dramatized by Caterpillar, which said Friday morning that it expects fourth-quarter profits to fall below forecasts because of weak North American sales. Caterpillar now is expected to earn about $2.60 a share in 1999, down from early-year estimates of $3.50. 

 Microsoft, which normally leads the tech sector, has failed to participate with the group recently because of investor concerns about the potential impact of the adverse findings earlier this month in the federal antitrust case. But the software giant's shares got a boost in after-hours trading Friday after the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, appointed a mediator to oversee "voluntary" settlement talks between the government and Microsoft. The surprise action raises the probability of an out-of-court settlement. Microsoft, which traded at 86, down 3 3/16 on the week at 4 p.m., rallied after the antitrust news at 4:15, rising to 88 in after-hours dealings. 

 Some laggard tech issues came to life last week, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and 3Com. H-P rose 16 13/16 to 93 1/2 after the company beat already-reduced profit and revenue estimates, earning 75 cents in the October quarter, two cents above expectations. Carly Fiorina, the company's new chief executive, seems to be adroit in at least one area: earnings guidance. H-P steadily brought down October quarter estimates, which had been as high as $1 a share in September. This allowed the company to generate a positive "surprise" when the profit numbers finally came out. 

 Fiorina has a growing fan club on Wall Street, but her critics claim she is more style than substance. Reflecting a new spirit that Fiorina wants to inject in Hewlett-Packard, which used to be viewed as a hard-core hardware company, she talked about various initiatives in a speech at the Comdex trade show last week, including a partnership between H-P and Swatch to deliver the first wristwatch that provides Internet access. 

 Elsewhere in the tech sector, Intel rose 3 11/16 to 79 7/8; Oracle jumped 11 to 76 1/8; Cisco gained 4 9/16 to 88 1/8 and Compaq was up 4 3/16 to 26 3/16. 

 -- The stock market shrugged off the Federal Reserve's quarter-point rate increases last week, although thrift stocks did come under pressure amid concerns about shrinking margins because of the narrowing gap between short- and long-term rates. Other losing groups included airlines, which were hurt by a surge in oil prices; automakers, and railroads. Reflecting the weakness in both the airlines and rails, the Dow Jones tranportation index dropped 3.7% to 2976. The Dow utility average also was weak, falling nearly 3%, hurt by a weak bond market. 

 -- The surge in tech stocks this year has lifted many of their valuations to extraordinary levels. The accompanying table lists the top dozen tech companies in the stock market, along with their year-to-date gains and price/earnings ratios based on estimated calendar 1999 profits. 

 Several companies, including Microsoft, don't operate on a calendar year, but a calendar-year profit estimate has been used to facilitate comparisons. All 12 stocks have risen this year, with gains ranging from Nortel Networks' 225% jump to Dell's 12.9% rise. 

 "Technology companies have delivered at a time when profit growth has become more suspect in the rest of the market," Galvin asserts. A tech bull, he acknowledges that some of the huge P/E multiples on the tech leaders means that "investors are looking out a few years" on earnings to value the stocks. Cisco, now No. 3 in market capitalization behind General Electric and Microsoft, trades for just over 100 times projected calendar 1999 profits. Sun, EMC, Oracle and Nortel have price-earnings ratios of around 80 while America Online tops the P/E list, sporting a multiple of more than 300. 

 -- Bell Canada's parent, BCE, has risen 84% this year to 69 13/16, but some think the stock still has substantial appreciation potential because the company trades for little more than the value of its big stake in Nortel Networks, the hot telecommunications equipment company whose shares have more than tripled in 1999. 

 "BCE is the cheapest telecom play in the world," argues Alec Cutler, a managing director at Brandywine Asset Management. He says BCE is worth over $100 per share. (BCE's stock is traded both on the New York Stock Exchange and in Toronto. Except as noted, all figures here are in U.S. dollars.) 

 BCE, a telecom conglomerate, owns a 40% stake in Nortel that's now worth about $44 billion, or $68 per BCE share (each BCE share effectively controls 0.84 Nortel shares). BCE has substantial non-Nortel assets, including an 80% interest in Bell Canada, Canada's leading phone company; BCE Mobile, a major Canadian wireless company; stakes in various public companies, including Teleglobe and CGI Group, as well as $5 per share in net cash. BCE also is the biggest Internet service provider in Canada. 

 Cutler says BCE's asset value could be unlocked because the company's well-regarded chief executive, Jean Monty, is upset that BCE hasn't kept pace with the soaring value of its Nortel stake. BCE rose 3 5/16 last week to a record 69 13/16, while Nortel gained 8 11/16 to 81 1/4, also a record. 

 On a conference call with institutional investors last month, Monty said he would consider a possible spinoff of Nortel if BCE continues to trade at a steep discount to its asset value. Cutler and some analysts believe BCE could accomplish such a spinoff on a tax-free basis under complex Canadian law. "It generally pays to invest in companies trading at large discounts to their asset values [and] that have skilled and frustrated management," Cutler says. 

 Nortel has soared this year because it has a strong position in one of technology's hottest sectors, optical networking products, which enhance the capacity of fiber networks. Nortel, as noted above, is no cheap stock, trading at over 80 times earnings. Nortel is now the largest company in the Canadian stock market, with a market value of over $100 billion. BCE ranks second. 

 At the start of the year, BCE traded for 35 and its Nortel stake was worth around 21 per share, valuing its non-Nortel business at about 14. But the gap has steadily shrunk to less than $2, given the soaring value of Nortel. 

 The more rapid appreciation in Nortel has stung some arbitrageurs who had bought BCE and shorted Nortel to synthetically create BCE's non-Nortel assets. 

 Indeed, one publicly traded vehicle that permitted ordinary investors to participate in this arb trade, TeleClone, a Canadian company, faces liquidation this week because of a margin call on its short position. TeleClone says it lacks collateral to meet the call. It finished Friday at $1.75 Canadian, down over C$20 since the start of the year. When TeleClone was formed last year, its backers figured the risk was minimal that BCE's non-Nortel assets could drop toward zero in the market. Yet that unlikely scenario has unfolded. 

 Should TeleClone be liquidated, BCE could briefly come under pressure and Nortel appreciate because the trust holds about seven million BCE shares and is short over five million Nortel shares. 

 BCE carries risk at current prices because of Nortel's lofty valuation. Should Nortel drop, BCE might still rise if the BCE moves to unlock its valuable holdings or if investors accord a higher valuation to BCE's non-Nortel assets. At minimum, BCE appears to be a better bet than Nortel at current prices. 

 -- Another intriguing asset play is disc-drive maker Seagate Technology. 

 Why? Because Seagate owns a stake in highflying Veritas Software that's now worth more than Seagate's current stock price. 

 Here's the math: Seagate finished the week at 38 3/4, up 1 3/4, giving it a market value of $8.7 billion. It owns 61 million shares of Veritas, whose shares have risen almost fivefold this year to 145 1/2, including a 29-point rise last week. Seagate's Veritas stake is worth $8.9 billion, or about $40 per Seagate share. 

 Cutler notes that Seagate also owns about $800 million of stock in SanDisk and Gadzooks and has $1 billion in net cash after debt, which add up to nearly $9 per share. So the total value of Seagate's equity holdings and cash is almost $50 a share. 

 Moreover, Seagate is the only major disc-drive maker earning money. The company had operating profits of seven cents a share in the September quarter and is expected to earn about 40 cents a share in its fiscal year ending June 30, 2000. 

 Seagate management clearly believes the stock is undervalued. The company has been a huge buyer of its own stock, repurchasing 48 million shares for $1.5 billion, nearly 20% of the stock outstanding, in the past year. And Seagate recently authorized the repurchase of another 50 million shares. It now has 224 million shares outstanding. 

 Seagate is up 27% this year, but it's still below its peak of 54 in early 1997 despite the ballooning value of its Veritas stake. Should the disc-drive market ever revive, Seagate's profits could rise sharply. It earned $3 a share in 1997 when market conditions were good. 

 Brandywine's Cutler says Seagate is worth at least $70 a share. This analysis, he notes, puts a conservative valuation on its disc-drive business and accords no value to the company's business-intelligence software division and its 35% stake in the private Dragon Systems, a leader in the hot field of voice-recognition technology. 

 Little wonder Seagate has been mentioned as a potential takeover candidate. 

 The satellite TV bill that cleared key hurdles in Congress last week could be bullish for Hughes Electronics and Echostar Communications, the two leading satellite TV providers, and also lift General Motors, whose 70% stake in Hughes now accounts for more than half its stock price. 

 By allowing satellite TV companies to offer local channels, the bill will remove a big competitive disadvantage that satellite companies have faced, relative to cable operators. The satellite industry's already strong growth rate could accelerate their own expansion. 

 Hughes, whose tracking stock is traded as GM class H (symbol GMH), has nearly doubled this year to 81 13/16, although it was off a quarter-point last week. 

 Echostar has performed even better, rising sixfold in 1999 to 75 3/8 after a 3 1/2-point gain last. Echostar is favored by investors because it's a pure-play satellite TV company and has been growing more rapidly relative to its subscriber base. Hughes owns DirecTV, the leading satellite TV business, and it has other satelliterelated operations. 

 Echostar now trades for about $6,500 per subcriber, while Hughes commands just $3,000 per subscriber, assuming a value of about $25 per share on Hughes non-TV businesses. Marc Crossman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, believes Hughes could top 100 in the next year. "The ability to offer local stations will at worst have a sizable positive impact on the satellite industry and will at best create a huge change that could lead to a revaluation of the stocks." Hughes now has about 7.8 million subscribers and could end 2000 with more than 9.5 million.

 Slow Sales Bring  Profit Warning  from Caterpillar 

 Sallie L. Gaines

 Caterpillar Inc. shocked Wall Street on Friday by warning that sluggish sales will pummel fourth-quarter profits, which, in turn, led to a pummeling of the company's shares. 

 Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of heavy machinery, said it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be slightly above the 61 cents a share reported for the third quarter. 

 Before the announcement, 20 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Associates had a consensus prediction that earnings would be 97 cents a share, up from 83 cents a share in the fourth quarter of last year. 

 Five analysts quickly lowered their forecasts to a consensus of 66 cents, said Chuck Hill of First Call. 

 Investors responded by dumping Caterpillar. Shares dropped 12 percent, or $6.75, to $49.19 on the New York Stock Exchange on five times usual volume. 

 Friday's announcement came as a surprise, Hill said, because on Oct. 15 Caterpillar had said earnings for all of 1999 would be around $3. "That was implying $1.04 for the fourth quarter," based on earnings already reported for the first three quarters, he said. 

 Even so, the First Call consensus was apparently cautious at 97 cents, he noted. 

 "The problem here is four weeks ago, Caterpillar went in front of analysts and said everything's OK," analyst Tobias Kevkovich of Salomon Smith Barney told Dow Jones. "My sense here is the company had been kind of thinking that retail sales would be about flat, and it's coming in lower for October -- down 8 percent to 15 percent. And they must have realized November was coming in weak." 

 Sales are particularly soft in North America, Caterpillar said. At the same time, stiff competition is holding down prices, the company said. 

 Agriculture and construction equipment manufacturing has been slow for more than a year. Like most of its competitors, Caterpillar shut down production at its Peoria tractor plant several times this year to match weak demand. 

 Still, Caterpillar's stock has narrowly underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index for most of the past two years. Deere & Co., the world's No. 1 maker of agricultural equipment, has widely underperformed the index. 

 Caterpillar said it will issue an outlook statement for 2000 in mid-January, but said its preliminary analysis indicates sales and revenue and profit above 1999 levels. 

 Hill said that the First Call earnings consensus for all of 2000 went from $2.93 to $2.62 after Friday's announcement.

 Severe Price Competition Buffets U.K. Retail Sector

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Arcadia Group PLC's (U.ACA) profit warning and news of further troubles at Storehouse put the U.K. retail sector's difficulties firmly back in the spotlight Thursday. 

 The clothing sector, in particular, is taking a buffeting, as shops are forced to resort to heavy price discounting in a climate of cutthroat competition. 

 Other parts of the industry are also suffering from deflationary trends, not helped by the arrival on these shores of U.S. discount stores giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which has made clear its intent to make a price-led assault on the industry after its takeover of supermarket chain Asda Group PLC. 

 Analysts believe the price cutting is likely to get worse before it improves. 

 "The pain is not going away", said Emily Shamma, retail analyst at brokerage WestLB Panmure. "The consumer is using price as a primary motivation to purchase in a way they never have before". 

 The recent problems of Marks & Spencer PLC (U.MAR) haven't helped the sector, as the U.K.'s biggest clothing retailer has resorted to various price campaigns in order to win back disaffected customers. Three heavily-advertised promotions by M&S in the last six weeks have sent shudders through the retail industry and forced its rivals into retaliatory action. 

 Outside of clothes, Boots PLC (U.BOO) said Wednesday it will sell all chart music CDs for GBP9.99 - between GBP3 and GBP4 cheaper than at traditional music outlets - in a move analysts say is designed mainly to get shoppers back into the stores. Boots' core health & beauty market has recently been the focus of price campaigns by supermarkets Asda and Tesco PLC (U.TSC). 

 Analysts say the difficulties in clothing are being compounded by a lack of exciting new fashion ideas. 

 "People just aren't interested by what they see in the shops, so retailers are having to find other ways of getting customers in", said Richard Perks of research house Retail Intelligence. 

 There has been talk that consumers are simply delaying purchases ahead of the millennium, though WestLB's Shamma doesn't believe this to be the case. 

 "Stores won't be rescued by millennium spend", she said. "We don't believe there will be much incremental spend. Consumers will wait for a discount on partywear or will spend money on that rather than buy a new coat", she said. 

 While price pressures are affecting most store operators, Arcadia has been particularly hard hit due to its high level of operational gearing. With rent still a significant part of its costs, small changes in sales per square foot have an exaggerated effect on profit. 

 Profit Estimates Have Been Slashed 

 Arcadia said Thursday that savage price competition had forced it to offer deeper and more extensive markdowns both during and after its midseason sale. The company's house broker, Credit Suisse First Boston, slashed its forecast of full-year pretax profit to GBP25 million from GBP51 million and also downgraded its estimates for a number of others. 

 Brokers also downgraded estimates for Storehouse after the deeply troubled retail combine unveiled plans to split up its BhS and Mothercare chains into separate companies and said current trading remains weak. 

 Some stores, however, are bucking the general trend, particularly established players at the discount end of the market. Matalan PLC (U.MTN), the out-of-town stores group which is seen by many people as a U.K. version of Wal-Mart, continues to drive sales and margins up on the back of its cut-price, no-nonsense format. 

 With a highly-efficient buying process, Matalan is able to sell garments such as t-shirts, fleece jackets and combat trousers for around 40% below the average price on the high street. 

 "It's a strong business with a strong format operating in the lower cost area of the market", said Investec Henderson Crosthwaite analyst Matthew McEachran. 

 While share prices of most clothing retailers have had a rough ride of late, Matalan remains within touching distance of its all-time high, having risen fivefold over the last year. At 1410 GMT, the stock was down 15 pence at 1532.5 pence. 

 Some analysts believe Next PLC (U.NXT) is another clothing retailer capable of staying out of trouble thanks to a good product offer and strong management. WestLB's Shamma, however, disagrees. "Being a good retailer is just not good enough in this sector any more", she said. 

 "I wouldn't be surprised if a big retailer broke ranks and went on full sale next week", she said, a move which would be unprecedented so far before Christmas. 

 Christmas is always a crucial time for retailers, but is particularly vital this year in view of potential extra spending on millennium celebrations and the current climate on the high street. 

 According to Richard Hyman of research house Verdict Research, Christmas will be helped by a "millennium effect". But high street trading "will not be very much better and Christmas will be late, focused very much on December rather than November, and particularly on the last week or so", he said.

 FOCUS - Lockheed sells $3.0 billion in debt.

 NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp., under pressure in recent weeks after a profit warning and cuts in its debt ratings, nevertheless found substantial investor demand for $3.0 billion of corporate debt it sold Thursday. 

 Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed, the largest U.S. defence and aerospace company, attracted more than $8 billion of bids. More than 300 investors bought the debt. 

 As analysts expected, Lockheed had to pay a higher rate of interest than it would have before the ratings cuts and profit warnings. Still, demand for the debt was heavy enough that the size of the deal was boosted twice from an initial $2.0 billion, and $2.5 billion when launched on Wednesday. 

 Because of the demand, the yields, or interest rates, Lockheed will pay on the debt came in at or below the low end of expectations. 

 Lockheed, whose products include the Atlas and Titan rockets, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, and the external tanks for the Space Shuttle, sold $750 million of six-year notes to yield 7.99 percent, or 190 basis points (1.9 percentage points) more than U.S. Treasuries with comparable maturities. 

 It also sold $1.0 billion of 10-year notes to yield 8.202 percent, or 215 basis points (2.15 percentage points) over Treasuries. And it sold $1.25 billion of 30-year bonds to yield 8.535 percent, or 225 basis points (2.25 percentage points) over Treasuries. 

 "Given the credit concerns, the spreads are appropriate," said David Johnson, vice president of fixed-income research for ABN Amro, Inc. 

 The debt was "certainly priced to move," he said. "Buyers were looking for some additional protection and compensation for the risk they were taking. The company had to pay up." 

 The notes and bonds performed well when freed to trade, traders said, with the yield spreads over Treasuries narrowed five to six basis points. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point. 

 Lead managers for the sale were Goldman Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 

 Lockheed said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission it would use proceeds of a debt sale for general corporate purposes. 

 The company did not comment Thursday about the sale. 

 Bob LoBue, vice president of J.P. Morgan's fixed-income syndicate, said "fantastic would be an easy way to summarize (the deal). The story was told in a very positive fashion, and investors seemed to embrace the new strategy position by Lockheed." 

 Moody's Investors Service rates the company's senior debt Baa3, while Standard & Poor's rates it BBB-minus. The ratings are now just one notch above "junk" status. 

 Both agencies have cut Lockheed's ratings twice in the last two months, most recently on Nov. 3. In making the cuts, Moody's and S&P noted Lockheed's financial leverage and debt burden. S&P said that burden "will likely preclude rating improvement over the next several years." 

 But LoBue said investors "look at management and the company and view it as an upwardly moving credit over the next few years." 

 One investor in the new debt was John Bender, a portfolio manager for Strong Capital Management, Inc. in Menomonee Falls, Wisc. He said Lockheed's existing debt has underperformed, called today's pricing "very attractive," and said the company has the flexibility to address its problems. 

 "We think that Lockheed will hold its ratings," he said. 

 On Oct. 29, Lockheed cut estimated 2000 earnings from $2.15 to $1.00 a share and free cash flow from $900 million to $500 million. It attributed the change in outlook to softness in the commercial space business, increased investment costs, and some satellite and launch delays. 

 Lockheed also said third quarter profits fell 43 percent from a year earlier. The company is said to be considering asset sales and consolidation of some core operations. 

 Its stock has not performed well. It closed at 20-5/8 on Thursday, up 1-3/8 on the day but down 62 percent from its split-adjusted 52-week high of 54-5/8. 

 Johnson said Lockheed "made a lot of large acquisitions, and was expected to assimilate them in a smooth fashion, and it failed to do that. People are taking a wait-and-see attitude to see if the company...has its problems under control." 

 Immediately after Thursday's sale, traders said Lockheed's existing 7.7 percent notes due in 2008 yielded 210 basis points over comparable Treasuries, while its 7.75 percent bonds due in 2026 yielded 220 basis points over Treasuries. Three weeks ago, the spread on the bonds was 44 basis points narrower. 

 In comparison, rival Raytheon Co.'s 6.15 percent notes due in 2008, rated Baa2 by Moody's and BBB-minus by Standard & Poor's, yielded 178 basis points over Treasuries.

 Maytag chief financial officer resigns.

 NEWTON, Iowa, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Maytag Corp. , which last month reported disappointing third-quarter results, said on Thursday its chief financial officer had resigned, but the home appliance maker denied any link between his departure and the company's recent performance. 

 Gerald Pribanic, 56, executive vice president and finance chief, is leaving "to pursue other CFO opportunities," Maytag said in a statement. He will stay on at the company while a successor is sought. 

 In September Maytag, famous for its advertising campaign featuring an appliance repairman with nothing to do, warned that its third-quarter profits would fall short of Wall Street expectations because of decreased sales of low-to moderately-priced home appliances. 

 The warning prompted analysts to cut their profit forecasts for the company. Maytag's shares were down nearly $2 at midday Thursday on the New York Stock exchange to $43.93. Its 52-week high was $74.81. 

 But on Thursday a spokesman for the company, James Powell, denied Pribanic's resignation was linked in any way to the September warning. "There is absolutely no connection," he told Reuters. 

 In fact, following the September warning, Maytag's earnings of 92 cents per share for the quarter exceeded Wall Street estimates. Originally, analysts had expected 99 cents; their revised consensus estimate was 84 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, a research firm that tracks such forecasts. 

 "Jerry managed the CFO's role during one of the more profitable periods in Maytag's history," Maytag Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Ward said in a statement about Pribanic's departure. "His integrity and commitment to financial discipline are indicative of his contribution to Maytag." 

 One New York analyst who follows Maytag said Pribanic's resignation was a little unexpected. "It's a bit of a surprise. Maybe it's because of the third quarter," said the analyst who requested anonymity. "It could be just cleaning house (by Ward)." 

 Pribanic joined Maytag's floor-care division, Hoover Co., in 1990 as vice president of finance and controller. He was named executive vice president and finance chief in 1996. ((-New York Equities Desk 212-859-1700)).

 FOCUS-Newbridge to  cut  costs, open to offers.

 OTTAWA, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Troubled Canadian telecoms equipment maker Newbridge Networks Corp.   said on Thursday it is open to takeover offers and that it will cut staff and products to trim costs by about 10 percent. 

 The strategic plan was announced with the release of second-quarter results in which the company reported a profit of 8 U.S. cents a share. On November 2, it had issued a profit warning warning that halved analysts' estimates of 20 U.S. cents a share. In the year-before quarter, earnings per share were 20 U.S. cents. 

 Newbridge said it will cut more than 10 percent of its staff, about 720 employees, outsource volume manufacturing operations, and focus its research and development on core technology. About two-thirds of the job cuts will come from the firm's Ottawa-area headquarters. 

 Newbridge takeover rumours have gathered steam since investors began to hammer the stock when the company posted its sixth earnings warning in 10 quarters on November 2 and announced the resignation of President Alan Lutz, who was replaced by Vice President Pearse Flynn. 

 Newbridge posted net earnings of C$302 million for the quarter on sales of C$481 million. It also posted net gains of $470 million on investments. In the same period last year, it had net earnings of C$53 million on sales of C$457 million. 

 "The disappointing results of the quarter compelled us to accelerate the deployment of a comprehensive strategic action plan," Chief Executive Terry Matthews said in a statement. 

 Newbridge said on Thursday it has not ruled out putting itself up for sale. A source close to the company said that Matthews told staff during a meeting on Thursday that in six months Newbridge could be part of another company, but that it intended to remain independent. 

 A financial advisor is now working with Newbridge to explore all options, including selling off the company, Flynn told analysts during a conference call late on Thursday. 

 "It's like you've put your house on the market," said Duncan Stewart, fund manager at Tera Capital Corp. in Toronto, of the financial advisor. "The open house sign is on the front lawn and you've changed the potpourri in all the washrooms." 

 An ambitious timetable has been set for the company's overhaul. Job cuts will be complete by month's end, volume manufacturing will be outsourced in four months, with an announcement that services will be outsourced expected in days. 

 "We're going to have to build the reputation of our company back one quarter at a time," said Flynn. 

 That plan does not address Newbridge's key challenge, said Paul Sagawa, analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York. Sales for the firm's flagship asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology have slowed in North America as Newbridge readies to release a new high-speed product. 

 Newbridge may not be able to count any meaningful revenue from that next-generation 50-gigabit switch, which sends multimedia data zipping around networks at high speeds, for as long as nine to 12 months, Sagawa said. 

 Lab trials of the product are expected to begin in March with sales starting in the next quarter, said Ed Ogonek, head of switching products. 

 "It's high time that Newbridge consider the value of a takeout," said Sagawa. "Right now, Newbridge is in a position that no matter how good the product is, the customer's always going to be doubting their ability to execute over the expected lifetime of a system, which is five years or more." 

 Newbridge faces tough competition from several network equipment giants including Lucent Technologies Inc. , Nortel Networks Corp.   and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO.O, he said. 

 "Those companies can offer a much broader product line, those companies can offer a much more stable relationship with a customers, those companies can make promises that stick with regard to future developments and support," Sagawa said. 

 Also on Thursday a federal jury in Delaware awarded Lucent $9.6 million in patent infringement damages against Newbridge in an interim ruling. That award, however, will not be paid out for some time, if ever, pending further legal proceedings. 

 "We are clearly disappointed with the decision. This is by no means the end of this matter. There will be a further trial at a later time," Newbridge general counsel Peter Nadeau told Reuters.

 OTTAWA Nov 18 (Reuters) - Executives of troubled Canadian telecoms equipment maker Newbridge Networks Corp.   told staff on Thursday the company is open to takeover offers, a source close to the Ottawa area firm said. 

 The company made a presentation to employees before releasing second-quarter results in which it reported a profit of 8 U.S. cents a share, in line with a November 2 warning that halved analyst's estimates of 20 U.S. cents a share. In the release, it also said it will cut 10 percent of its staff and some manufacturing operations as part of a plan to boost profitability. In the presentation, Newbridge outlined job cuts affecting about 720 staff and said it has not ruled out putting itself up for sale, but is not now considering an offer, the source said. 

 During what the source described as a "upbeat meeting" Chief Executive Terry Matthews said that in six months Newbridge could be part of another company, but it intended to remain independent. 

 Newbridge has been called a takeover candidate after investors hammered the stock after it posted its sixth earnings warning in 10 quarters on November 2 and announced the resignation of President Alan Lutz, who was replaced Pearse Flynn. 

 Newbridge posted net earnings of C$302 million during the quarter on sales of C$481 million, which included $470 million in net gains on investments. Income from operations stood at C$5 million. "The disappointing results of the quarter compelled us to accelerate the deployment of a comprehensive strategic action plan," Matthews said in a statement.

 EUROPE 

 Saab Launches 

 Offer for Celsius 

 In Defense Merger 

 Sweden's Saab launched a friendly offer of five billion kronor ($599 million) for the country's other large defense company, Celsius, in a move marking further consolidation in Europe's defense sector. Saab's offer of 179 kronor a share represents a 40% premium to Celsius's average share price over the past month. Celsius rose 5.4% to 136.5 kronor before trading in the shares was suspended at  midday yesterday in Stockholm. The Swedish government, Celsius's largest shareholder with a 25% stake that gives it 62% of votes, and the company's management said they endorse Saab's offer. Saab's biggest  shareholders, Investor AB of Sweden and British Aerospace, said they back Saab's move, which would create a Nordic defense company with more than 18,000 employees and sales of 23 billion kronor. 

 Saab's bid also comes as other European defense companies are linking up. British Aerospace, which owns 35% of Saab, is in the process of completing its own acquisition of Marconi Electronic Systems from Britain's Marconi PLC. 

 Thyssen Krupp to Float Steel Division 

 Thyssen Krupp, one of Germany's largest industrial conglomerates, said it plans to float its steel division next year and narrow its focus to a few core businesses. Thyssen said it would reduce its current 23 divisions to six core businesses plus real estate, divesting itself of businesses with annual sales of about 10 billion marks ($5.29 billion). Thyssen shares rose 12% to close at 23.75 euros in Frankfurt trading. The company said it would float 25% to 35% of its steel unit Thyssen Krupp Steel next year. Thyssen Krupp also reported pretax profit of more than one billion marks for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 

 Holzmann Awaits Creditors' Decision 

 German construction company Philipp Holzmann awaited a decision from bank creditors on a bailout that would save it from bankruptcy, as German prosecutors began investigating allegations that fraud brought on the 150-year-old company's problems. The Frankfurt state prosecutors office said it has opened an investigation based on Holzmann's allegations that former employees committed breach of trust, fraud and account forgery. The company shocked the market Monday by announcing it had discovered 2.4 billion marks ($1.27 billion) in potential losses. 

 Telefonica's Terra Networks to Lift Off 

 Spain's Telefonica said profit for the first nine months of 1999 rose 43% from a year earlier to 1.4 billion euros ($1.45 billion), despite competition in Spain and an economic recession in its important Latin American market. The telecommunications company said revenue rose 9.7% to 9.86 billion euros. Telefonica shares should receive a boost from the debut today of its  Internet unit, Terra Networks. 

 Exchange Offers Data on UBS Shares 

 Switzerland's stock exchange has handed over documents from its investigation into possible insider trading last year related to shares of Swiss bank UBS to criminal investigators in Zurich and Geneva and to the Swiss Banking Commission. The Swiss Exchange's inquiry focused on unusual share-price movements ahead of UBS's profit warning last fall, an exchange spokesman said. 

 New-Car Registrations Fall in Europe 

 Western European new-car registrations fell for the first time this year in October, signaling that surprisingly strong auto demand this year may be leveling off. Registrations slipped 0.8% in October from a year earlier to 1.17 million units. The fall was widespread, but was most pronounced in Germany, where new-car registrations slid 10.8%. For the first 10 months, about 12.99 million cars have been registered in Western Europe, up 5.6% from a year before. 

 BRIEFLY: 

 -- Germany's council of independent economic advisers forecast gross domestic product would grow 1.4% this year, down from 2% the panel had forecast a year earlier. It also urged the government to take advantage of the expected recovery to tackle structural reform. 

 -- France and Britain appeared to move closer to a settlement of their dispute over restrictions on British beef, even as the European Commission began a procedure to punish France for ignoring the European Union's Aug. 1 lifting of a ban on exports of British beef.

 IMF Urges Thailand to Trim Its Deficit 

 The International Monetary Fund said that with Thailand's economic recovery under way, the country's government should start bringing down its budget deficit in 2000 if it wants to maintain confidence in Bangkok's economic policy both at home and abroad. The message came as an eight-member IMF mission completes an annual review today of Thai economic conditions and policies. So far, Thailand's relatively large budget deficit -- projected at about 5.5% of gross domestic product this year -- is acceptable because it enables the government to stimulate the economy, which contracted 10% last year. But with Thai economic recovery expected to continue next year, any failure by the government to bring spending back into line with revenue isn't going to be positive for Thailand, the IMF official in Washington said. 

 IBRA Sacks Standard Chartered Team 

 The Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency removed Standard Chartered officials installed to manage Bank Bali and replaced them with IBRA officials. The move marks the latest blow to relations between the British bank and scandal-plagued Bank Bali. An IBRA spokesman said it had decided to remove Douglas Beckett, appointed to head Bank Bali's management, and seven other managers appointed by Standard Chartered. 

 Korean Publisher Admits Tax Charges 

 The owner of one of South Korea's largest newspapers admitted tax-evasion charges filed against him. "I did not instruct the accountant to evade taxes, but I was informed of it later," Hong Seok Hyun, the owner of Joong Ang Ilbo, the country's second-largest daily, said during the opening hearing of his trial. He was arrested last month on charges of evading 2.53 billion won ($2.1 million) in inheritance and other taxes. The charges stemmed from an audit of Bokwang Group, in which Mr. Hong is the largest shareholder. He resigned as president and publisher of the paper, which has a circulation estimated at more than two million, after his arrest. The newspaper wasn't implicated in the case. If found guilty, he could face five years in prison. 

 Bangkok Bank to Cut Jobs by Attrition 

 Bangkok Bank, Thailand's biggest commercial lender, plans to eliminate as many as 6,000 of its 21,000 jobs -- without layoffs -- in the next few years to cut costs and compete better with foreign banks. "We have to accept that we are overstaffed," said the bank's president, according to an article yesterday in the Bangkok Post. But he said there "won't be a single cut" in the downsizing. 

 BRIEFLY: 

 -- Tokyo department store sales in October rose 0.3% from a year earlier to 186.19 billion yen ($1.78 billion), the Japan Department Stores Association said.

 THE AMERICAS 

 Zedillo Won't Tap `Discretionary' Fund 

 For the first time in decades, a Mexican president has requested zero funding in the government's annual budget for the so-called secret account -- a discretionary spending line that used to allow presidents to spend hundreds of millions of dollars without accounting to anyone for the outlays. President Ernesto Zedillo began slashing the account, widely viewed as a political slush fund, in 1997, when opposition parties gained a majority in the country's Congress. The discretionary spending is still allowed by Mexico's constitution and thus could be revived in subsequent years. 

 PC Holdings Offers Share Exchange 

 Argentina's PC Holdings, owned by the Perez Companc family, said it launched a share-exchange program, offering shares in Perez Companc Holdings, or PCH, for existing shares of energy conglomerate Perez Companc. The deal will give Perez Companc better access to capital markets, PCH said. Perez Companc has interests in oil and gas production and transportation, power utilities and forestry activities. 

 Bombardier Gets Order for 12 Planes 

 The aerospace unit of Bombardier of Canada  said it received firm orders for 12 airplanes, valued at about $145 million, from ExecuJet Aviation Group of Switzerland. Bombardier also said it sold two widebody Challenger 604 business jets to the Royal Jordanian Air Force but terms of the sale weren't disclosed. 

 BRIEFLY: 

 -- Yupi.com, a Spanish-language Internet network based in Miami Beach, Fla., said it has taken in $67.4 million from a private placement of convertible preferred shares. Yupi.com said it has received $110 million in private investment so far this year. 

 -- Regional Airline Holdings of Canada said it is prepared to "acquire, finance, restructure, manage and expand" the regional subsidiaries of Air Canada and Canadian Airlines in order to create an independent, Canadian-owned airline serving the country's smaller markets.

 Hey there, all you companies thinking of making loans to your officers to buy back stock. Don't count on this boosting the share price. 

 Just look at what happened when HealthSouth's chief executive and other officers of the Birmingham, Ala., health-care company recently got busy buying back stock in what they described as a show of confidence. Investors didn't listen. The shares barely budged. 

 Analysts point out that many of the millions of shares bought by Chief Executive Officer Richard Scrushy and other executives since August have been financed with company loans. It's a practice that draws fire from some shareholder advocates. 

 When company loans are involved, investors "should not give as much weight" to insider buying, says First Call/Thompson Financial, a Rockville, Md., company that tracks earnings forecasts and insider buying. 

 Worried about stingy health-care reimbursement rates, skittish investors have left the stock languishing in the mid-single digits after it traded above $15 in the past year. First Call analyst Paul Elliot says the company gave executives unusually favorable conditions for stock purchases by lending them money to buy the stock and then allowing the executives to use the stock as collateral for the loans. In essence, HealthSouth has made it so favorable for insiders to buy that the insider purchases might be more a reflection of this great deal than of confidence in the company. 

 If CEOs are willing to spend their own money to buy a stock, investors take it as a vote of confidence. But according to Patrick McGurn, director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services, a corporate-governance group in Bethesda, Md., "That vote of confidence is undermined when the company decides to facilitate" the purchase -- because the executives aren't using their own money. 

 For now, analysts say, HealthSouth's outlook is weak because it appears profit margins will continue to be hurt by shrinking reimbursements from managed-care companies. Analysts issued a slew of downgrades on the stock after the company in September issued a third-quarter earnings warning. Seven of nine analysts now rate the stock a "hold," according to First Call. The company is expected to report per-share earnings for 1999 of 86 cents, putting a multiple of six on HealthSouth, which operates 2,000 outpatient-surgery and rehabilitative centers in 50 states. 

 Plans to make the loans were disclosed in proxy material filed in April. It said Mr. Scrushy and other executives could be lent a total of as much as $50 million to buy company stock. 

 Michael Martin, HealthSouth's chief financial officer, says shareholders approved the loan program. He says there is plenty of risk for the executives, including possibly having to meet a margin call should the value of the stock drop below a prescribed level. Senior executives are buying the stock because they think it is a compelling value, Mr. Martin says. 

 The insider purchases were made as problems plaguing all health-care stocks finally caught up with HealthSouth. Managed-care companies have forced health-care providers to curb their rate increases because corporations are demanding cheaper health insurance. At the same time, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act has cut nearly $200 billion from what Medicare otherwise would have paid to health-care providers to care for the elderly and disabled through 2002. 

 Until the fall of last year, HealthSouth had been viewed as one of the last havens for health-care investors, immune to the lower reimbursements. Just two years ago, HealthSouth's stock traded in the $27 range and Mr. Scrushy, who founded the company in 1984, was rapidly expanding the company's outpatient centers. 

 But in late September 1998, HealthSouth warned that its long-term annual earnings growth would slow to between 15% and 20%, down from 30% a year. The concern cut HealthSouth's stock by more than half, to the $8 level, by mid-October last year. This year, problems worsened. First- and second-quarter earnings that were flat or down from a year earlier kept HealthSouth's stock in single digits. 

 On Sept. 9, HealthSouth's stock fell 28% to $5.688 after the company warned that its profit would be weaker than expected for the rest of the year. The company also said it had tabled a proposed spinoff of its hospitals into a separate publicly traded company. 

 That's when the company started to announce the insider stock buys. In the same news release, Mr. Scrushy said the company would resume purchases of its own stock under a $1 billion share-buyback plan announced earlier in the year. And he pledged to buy a big block himself. 

 "We believe that our stock remains undervalued, and we expect that many of our senior management team will be buying stock as well," the news release said. "I currently intend to buy up to $25 million worth of our stock personally, demonstrating the continued confidence that we have in our business fundamentals." 

 HealthSouth issued another news release eight days later. It said Mr. Scrushy and two other executives had bought 5.5 million shares. Separately, the company said 16 more executives had bought 1.1 million shares and that the company had bought 7.7 million shares. The company's shares outstanding fell 4.5% in the three months through Sept. 30, to 418.4 million fully diluted. 

 Mr. Scrushy said in the statement that that stock buying was sign the stock was undervalued: "HealthSouth has resumed active repurchases under its previously announced buyback program, and our management team has stepped forward to increase its investment in the company." 

 Then on Nov. 3, the company reported more bad news. For the third quarter, revenue fell 5.2% to $993.3 million from $1.05 billion. The company had a net loss of $4.3 million, or one cent a diluted share, after restructuring charges, compared with year-ago net income of $5.7 million, or one cent a share. 

 In short, says First Call's Mr. Elliot, the lesson for investors is simple: "We haven't seen a whole lot of good luck following insiders who are buying using company money."

 Well-Lit: Uniroyal Technology rose 54% last week to $14.125 after the Sarasota company said it would double its capacity to make light-emitting diodes used in traffic signals, auto taillights, stadium scoreboards and indoor and outdoor lighting. 

 Uniroyal said it expects to begin churning out the diodes from a Tampa manufacturing plant by December. 

 George J. Zulanas, chief executive, said in an interview that the company recently spoke about the plans at an electronics-industry conference and that this probably helped spark the stock rise. 

 --- 

 Disappointing Results: Modis Professional Services fell 21% to $10.75 after the Jacksonville staffing company reported third-quarter earnings that fell shy of Wall Street expectations. For the quarter, Modis reported net income of $30.7 million, or 31 cents a diluted share. Separately, the company said it was exploring moves such as spinning off its information technology unit and taking public an electronic-commerce division.

 FDA Jitters: The stock of LaserSight fell 12% to $11.625 last week amid concern about the length of time it was taking the Winter Park maker of lasers for eye surgery to receive federal approval. On Monday, however, the stock rose 24% to $14.438 after it disclosed U.S. Food and Drug Administration pre-market approval for its LaserScan LSX machine. The company said that this means it can market and sell the laser for eye surgeries in the U.S.

 Ratings Boost: AnswerThink Consulting Group in Miami was rated a "buy" in new coverage by New York investment firm Credit Suisse First Boston. The firm said it envisions the $27 stock rising to $40. Last week, the stock of the technology consultant rose 44% to $27.375 after it completed its merger with New York-based Think New Ideas.

 Promising Drug: King Pharmaceuticals, of Bristol, Tenn., shot up 85% last week to $45.125 after a study was presented at the American Heart Association's annual science meeting in Atlanta that suggests great promise for one of its products. Researchers found that the drug Ramipril, which the company markets as Altace, reduced the combined rate of heart attack, stroke and death from cardiovascular disease by 22% over patients given a placebo. But all the patients were also taking a variety of other medications typically prescribed for heart patients.

 Product Launch: Clarus rose 58% for the week to $37.875 after the Suwanee, Ga.-based technology firm, which provides business-to-business Internet-commerce software, launched a training product designed to help companies using its electronic-procurement system teach thousands of employees at multiple sites how to operate it.

 Results Unravel: Crown Crafts fell 24% to $3 after the Atlanta-based manufacturer of home furnishings reported a loss of 66 cents a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended Sept. 26, more than double the 27-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter. Though sales rose 5% in bedroom products, the company said, they fell 27% in home accessories and 10% in children's products. It blamed $10 million in lost sales on troubles with a new computer system that snarled shipping logistics.

 MMC Shares Drop After It Warns Of Slowing Sales To Cisco

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- MMC Networks Inc. shares tumbled 27% Tuesday on heavy volume before recovering somewhat after the company warned of slower sales to Cisco Systems Inc., its biggest customer. 

 The forecast prompted investment-rating downgrades and earnings forecast revisions from a slew of securities firms Tuesday, including A.G. Edwards, Hambrecht & Quist, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Needham & Co. 

 MMC stock (MMCN) closed Tuesday at $19, down $3, or 14% on volume of 8.5 million shares, compared to average daily volume of 1.4 million. 

 Cisco (CSCO) was using in its Catalyst 6000 local-area-network switch, a chipset made by MMC Networks only temporarily while it developed its own. When the networking equipment behemoth told MMC it was ready with its own device much sooner than expected, MMC had little choice but to make its profit warning late Monday, analysts said. 

 Moreover, supply-chain management decisions made by Cisco during the quarter in response to demand for its own products forced the company to cut back on some of its MMC orders, Hambrecht & Quist analyst Eric Suppiger said. According to his estimates, Cisco represented 56% of MMC's top line in the third quarter and will still generate about 50% of MMC's revenue in the next period. 

 Analysts don't expect MMC to recoup lost sales to Cisco until well into next year, when new products the company is developing are set to hit the market. 

 Suppiger said the question is how fast MMC will be able to get new products to market to offset declining revenue from older ones. 

 In its press release, MMC told analysts to expect fourth-quarter revenue to fall to between $11 million and $13 million, with sales to Cisco less than half the levels of a year ago. 

 Suppiger cut his revenue estimate to $12 million from $20 million and his earnings per share target for the fourth quarter to a 1-cent loss from a 9-cent profit. Before the warning, Wall Street as a whole was looking for 10 cents a share in earnings. 

 MMC strived in its press release to assure investors that its business relationship with Cisco "continues to be strong." MMC said it's working with Cisco to develop several new products using technology called Layer 3, which the company expects to begin rolling out in the first half of next year. 

 But analysts slashed their estimates for the year 2000 regardless, resetting their models to account for MMC's less Cisco-heavy business. 

 Suppiger reduced his per-share earnings forecast for all of next year to 26 cents from 64 cents - equal with the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call before the profit warning - and his revenue estimate to $78.9 million from $119.3 million. 

 MMC's warning comes amid a steep stock-price decline since touching an all-time high of $57 in August. Word of decreased technology spending by corporations because of lock-downs before the New Year served to deflate the company's stock price, Morgan Stanley analyst Christopher DuPey said.

 US Corp Bonds - Arcadia debt soars - Players eye Fed.

 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Bonds of Arcadia Financial Ltd.  soared on news of its acquisition by higher-rated Associates First Capital Corp. , in otherwise quiet corporate bond trading ahead of Tuesday's meeting of U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers. 

 Arcadia Financial saw the value of its debt skyrocket after A1 A-plus rated Associates, a leading diversified finance company based in Dallas, said Monday it would buy the Minneapolis-based provider of non-prime automobile loans for $200 million in cash plus security obligations. 

 Arcadia's 11-1/2 percent issue due 2007 closed up 38 points at 101 bid, traders said. The firm's other issues finished the session with similar gains, they said. 

 "Those bonds (Arcadia) traded up sharply on the news. Prior to today they were quoted in the high 60's," one high-yield trader said. 

 Associates is rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by Standard & Poor's. Arcadia is rated B3 and B-minus. Moody's and S&P placed Arcadia rating under review for a possible upgrade following the news. 

 Moody's said the proposed transaction would eliminate the funding constraints which Arcadia has faced and provide a stronger capital base to suppport the company's ongoing business. 

 Arcadia serves nearly 500,000 customers and originated more than $1.8 billion in loans in the first three quarters of 1999. 

 The companies said the transaction would close in the first quarter of 2000. 

 Turning to the broader high-yield sector, prices ended a subdued session unchanged to off 1/4 amid a cautious tone ahead of the Fed and recent supply pressures, traders said. 

 "The tone was quiet ahead of tomorrow's meeting, and recent supply from the telecom sector has weighed on prices a bit," said one high-yield trader. 

 Last week, the junk bond market saw more than $5.6 billion in new supply. High-yield bonds have enjoyed a bit of euphoria as larger media and telecommunications issuers have rushed to market to take advantage of improved sentiment and a surfeit of cash ready to be deployed. 

 Observers attribute the improvement principally to declining Y2K concerns, lessening fear that interest rates will surge, increased investor willingness to assume risk, and about $808 million in net inflows into high-yield mutual funds in the latest measured week. 

 Global Crossing Holdings Ltd., a unit of Bermuda-based telecom products and services provider Global Crossing Ltd. , broadband telecom provider NEXTLINK Comunications  and designer and builder of high-capacity fiber networks Metromedia Fiber Network Inc.  were among last week's largest issuers. 

 In the high-grade market, spreads ended a lacklustre session unchanged as all eyes remained on the upcoming Fed meeting. 

 Tuesday's meeting by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will take the spotlight on Tuesday. Economists remain split over whether the Fed will raise its target federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, from its current 5.25 percent. 

 Looking ahead, the largest deal on the investment-grade calendar is a $2.0 billion three-tranche offering from the defence and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. . Goldman Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. will underwrite the offering. 

 Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed is expected to sell six-year, 10-year, and 30-year debt, market sources said, at spreads of 190 to 195 basis points, 215 to 220 basis points, and 230 to 235 basis points, respectively, over comparable Treasuries. 

 After Lockheed issued a profit warning Oct. 29, Moody's and S&P cut their respective senior debt ratings for the company to Baa3 and BBB-minus, their lowest investment grades. 

 In other markets, the U.S. Treasury 30-year bond closed up 4/32 at 101-10/32 to yield 6.02 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial average ended the session down 8.57 points at 10760.75.

 NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The forward calendar for U.S. high-yield bonds looks sedate, but if last week's activity proves a harbinger, that may not remain the case. 

 High-yield, or junk, debt prices rose a quarter point Monday morning, traders said, with nothing in particular driving the market. 

 The spreads on investment-grade debt, meanwhile, were unchanged Monday morning, traders said, in advance of Tuesday's Federal Reserve policy setting meeting. 

 Spreads are the difference in yield between corporate debt and U.S. Treasuries with comparable maturities. 

 "Everything is opening up quiet and stagnant today," said one investment-grade trader. "We're all just awaiting the Fed's decision tomorrow." 

 Economists are split over whether the Fed will raise its target federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, from its current 5.25 percent. 

 The quiet Monday follows a week that saw more than $5.6 billion in new junk issuance. 

 High-yield bonds have enjoyed a bit of euphoria as larger media and telecommunications issuers have rushed to market to take advantage of improved sentiment and a surfeit of cash ready to be deployed. 

 Observers attribute the improvement principally to declining Y2K concerns, lessening fear that interest rates will surge, increased investor willingness to assume risk, and about $808 million in net inflows into high-yield mutual funds in the latest measured week. 

 It's not coincidental that the big media and telecom issuers have taken advantage of market conditions. They have been among the market darlings for much of the year. 

 "Widely followed, high quality telecommunications and cable companies are accessing the market based on a short window of opportunity, where demand is present for the first time in more than a few months," said one high-yield syndicate official. 

 Late Friday, two big deals priced. 

 Global Crossing Holdings Ltd., a unit of Bermuda-based telecom products and services provider Global Crossing Ltd. , sold $1.1 billion of 10-year notes and $900 million of seven-year notes in the Rule 144a market through lead manager Chase Securities Inc., market sources said. 

 The 10-year notes yielded 383 basis points over Treasuries, and the 7-year notes yielded 363 basis points over Treasuries, market sources said. The notes were Ba2/BB rated. 

 Separately, NEXTLINK Communications Inc.  sold $400 million of 10-year senior notes and $455 million (proceeds) of 10-year senior discount notes in the Rule 144a market through lead managers Goldman Sachs & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney, market sources said. The deal was increased in size from $500 million, market sources said. 

 NEXTLINK is a Bellevue, Wash.-based broadband telecom provider founded by telecom pioneer Craig McCaw. 

 Moody's Investors Service rated the notes B2, and Standard & Poor's rated them single-B, roughly the equivalent. On Friday, both agencies revised their outlooks on NEXTLINK to stable. 

 Earlier in the day, Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. , a White Plains, N.Y.-based designer and builder of high-capacity fiber networks, sold $1.0 billion of debt. 

 Separately, Allstate Corp. , which through subsidiaries is a leading property/casualty and life insurer, late Friday sold $750 million of A1/A-plus rated 10-year notes to yield 130 basis points over Treasuries, through lead manager Goldman Sachs. 

 Are more issuers lurking in the wings? 

 "I think we'll continue to see the larger carriers that need money to continue to come to market during the next week or so," said the syndicate official. 

 The largest deal on any U.S. corporate bond calendar is the $2.0 billion three-tranche offering from the giant defence and aerospace company Lockheed Martin Corp. , through Goldman and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 

 Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed is expected to sell six-year, 10-year, and 30-year debt, market sources said, to yield spreads of 190 to 195 basis points, 215 to 220 basis points, and 230 to 235 basis points, respectively, over comparable Treasuries. 

 After Lockheed issued a profit warning Oct. 29, Moody's and S&P cut their respective senior debt ratings for the company to Baa3 and BBB-minus, their lowest investment grades. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 5/32 in early trading, yielding 6.05 percent.

 Dell Stock Off On Worries About Slackening Corporate PC Sales

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dell Computer Corp.'s shares lost some ground Friday after a Prudential Securities Inc. analyst lowered fourth-quarter revenue and earnings forecasts, citing weakness in the U.S. corporate personal computer market. 

 At the close of trading, Dell's (DELL) shares were off $1.688, or 3.9%, at $41.75. 

 Prudential analyst Kimberly Alexy also removed Dell from the firm's "single best idea" list, replacing it with rival personal-computer maker Gateway Inc. (GTW). She maintains her "strong buy" rating on Dell. 

 Meanwhile, other analysts Friday issued more bullish ratings on the No. 1 direct seller of PCs. Brown Bros. started Dell at "near-term" and "long-term buy," while ABN Ambro raised its rating on Dell to "outperform" from "hold." 

 Late Thursday, the Round Rock, Texas-based computer maker reported a 25% drop in third-quarter earnings in line with analysts' lowered estimates, citing soaring prices for computer memory chips and an acquisition charge. Sales surged 41%. 

 Alexy said that while Dell's core earnings were in line with the firm's and Wall Street's expectations, the company in its conference call Thursday "clearly guided down" fourth-quarter revenue growth to 7% from 10% on a quarter-to-quarter basis. While the company didn't cite reasons for the guidance, Alexy said it likely stems from a tapering of corporate demand for PCs. 

 "Channel checks suggest Y2K, but follow-up conversations with Dell suggest higher corporate PC pricing may be the real culprit," Alexy said. 

 Based on that guidance, Alexy lowered her revenue outlook for the fourth quarter ending January to $7.2 billion from $7.4 billion, while maintaining her earnings outlook of 21 cents a share. She cut her EPS view for fiscal 2001, which ends in January 2001, to $1.01 from $1.03. 

 The mean estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for fourth-quarter earnings of 21 cents a share. 

 The analyst said that while Dell remains attractively valued, "there are limited catalysts near-term until visibility around industry growth improves." She added that corporate PC weakness will cause "continued pressure" on Dell shares. 

 She has a 12-month target price of $60 on Dell shares, which closed at $43.438 on Thursday. 

 Alexy said Gateway shares are a better choice for the single best idea list because of strong consumer demand trends and improving business momentum. 

 Thursday, Dell said net income came to $289 million, or 11 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, compared with $384 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased 41% to $6.78 billion. 

 However, the latest results included a $194 million charge related to the acquisition of storage-software maker ConvergeNet Technologies Inc. Excluding the charge, the company said it would have posted earnings of $483 million, or 18 cents per share. The mean estimate of 27 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for income, excluding items, of 18 cents per share. Before Dell's October profit warning, the mean estimate of analysts surveyed was for earnings of 20 cents per share. 

 In a conference call with analysts following the earnings report, Dell executives said they are bullish about the fourth quarter, dismissing concerns about a slowdown in spending ahead of the year 2000 date change and saying that memory-chip prices have reached a plateau. 

 Dell Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith noted, however that Dell and other computer makers will have to deal with "the increased costs of memory" going forward, although he said Dell is well-positioned to do so because of its efficient business model and solid relationships with component suppliers.

 Dell Outlook Seen As Strong After Solid 3rd Quarter Results

 AUSTIN, Texas -(Dow Jones)- Dell Computer Corp.'s (DELL) third-quarter results Thursday were greeted positively by analysts, despite the company's October profit warning that caused Wall Street to lower expectations in advance. 

 "I would use the word 'satisfied' - not ecstatic, but satisfied," said Louis Mazzucchelli of Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. "They basically preannounced what was going to happen, and that's what happened." 

 Other analysts agreed, saying Dell's profit warning was the result of an unexpected price surge for memory chips that likely won't catch the company flatfooted again. 

 "It was a one-quarter shock, and given their lean inventory structure, it negatively impacted them," said Ashok Kumar of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 

 Dell reported third quarter earnings of 18 cents a share excluding charges, which matched Wall Street expectations. Still, the company warned Wall Street last month that high memory chip prices would cut into profits for the quarter, causing analysts to back off an early earnings consensus of 20 cents a share. Dell earned 14 cents a share in the year-ago quarter. 

 Revenue for the third quarter rose 41% to $6.78 billion from $4.82 billion a year ago.

 Rite Aid Cancels Analyst Call, and Stock Plunges

 Rite Aid Corp. abruptly canceled a scheduled conference call with analysts, dealing yet another blow to the drugstore chain's credibility and driving the shares down by 31%. 

 The company also warned that investors shouldn't rely on earnings projections issued last month by its since-ousted chief executive officer, Martin Grass. 

 Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., had been expected to conduct the call yesterday evening. The cancellation was announced in midafternoon. That news ignited a high-volume sell-off: On the New York Stock Exchange, Rite Aid shares were quoted at $5.50, down $2.4375, before the Big Board halted trading late in the session. Trading didn't resume before the 4 p.m. end of the regular session. 

 The decline marked a new 52-week low and continued a protracted drop-off, in which the stock has fallen nearly 90% from a high of $51.125 in January. 

 Timothy Noonan, Rite Aid's acting chief executive, and other officers had planned to use the call to review the results for the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 28; the company filed those results last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 The cancellation suggests that the nation's No. 3 drugstore chain doesn't have a grasp of its financial results, said A.G. Edwards analyst Jack Russo. "They don't know what's going on," he said. 

 Karen Rugen, a Rite Aid spokeswoman, said the call was canceled because management wasn't yet prepared to discuss details about the fiscal second quarter, such as the reasons for changes in inventory levels or cost of sales. 

 On Oct. 18, the day Mr. Grass was ousted as CEO, Rite Aid disclosed that it would restate its earnings over the last three fiscal years, shaving off about $500 million in pretax earnings from the results it had reported. 

 Rite Aid gave a first installment in its SEC filing last week, restating earnings for its first quarter of the current fiscal year and the first six months of the previous year. Analysts had been expecting to gain further insight into the big chain's accounting troubles from the conference call, as well as guidance on what effect those issues will have on future earnings. 

 Though the results the company reported were unaudited and are still being reviewed by the SEC, she said the company doesn't expect to "change materially" any numbers it reported in the filing. 

 Ms. Rugen confirmed that the Rite Aid board met yesterday, and characterized it as a regularly scheduled meeting. She wouldn't comment on what was decided, if anything. 

 Yesterday's news comes one day after Rite Aid confirmed that it had recently been contacted by the enforcement arm of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Though the company said it is unaware of a formal investigation, Ms. Rugen said Rite Aid anticipates such an investigation will take place, given the expected size of the restatements. 

 Rite Aid also jarred investors yesterday with its warning that profit projections Mr. Grass made in an analysts meeting Oct. 11 were no longer reliable. 

 In that meeting, Mr. Grass said the company expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $1.01 billion for this fiscal year, which ends in February, and $1.27 billion the next. 

 Ms. Rugen declined to elaborate on why those projections were no longer valid. "We are no longer comfortable with any previous financial guidance, and we are currently giving none right now," she said. 

 Last month, Rite Aid avoided a cash crunch by renegotiating $2.7 billion in bank loans and by receiving a $300 million infusion from Leonard Green & Partners LP. Rite Aid said the fact that it is no longer backing earlier earnings projections won't affect those crucial agreements.

 NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bond prices fell and spreads widened in slow trade on Wednesday, on the heels of a report showing a mixed outlook for inflation. 

 For holders of the debt of Rite Aid Corp. , Wednesday was a day to forget. The drug store chain issued a profit warning, sending its debt tumbling. 

 Spreads on investment-grade debt widened one to two basis points, and high-yield prices fell a quarter point, traders said. Spreads are the difference in yield between corporate debt and comparable U.S. Treasuries. 

 Rite Aid's outstanding senior debt plunged after the Camp Hill, Pa.-based drug store chain advised investors "not to rely" on its Oct. 11 profitability and cash flow forecasts, and cancelled a conference call with analysts. 

 The company has already faced earnings shortfalls, allegations of wrongdoing, and the resignation of its chief executive officer. Its stock fell by one-third Wednesday. 

 "There's no new management team in place, and there's no quantitative evidence that things are turning around," said John Ransom, an equity analyst at Raymond James Financial in St. Petersburg, Fla. 

 Major rating agencies in October cut Rite Aid's senior debt to junk status, forcing managers who cannot hold junk to sell. 

 A trader said the 6.125 percent notes due in 2001 fell 20 points Wednesday to 55 bid, 60 asked. The 7.125 notes due 2007 fell about 15 points to 48 bid, 53 asked, and the 6.875 percent bonds fell 10 points to 46 bid, 50 asked, he said. 

 Bond prices in general slid after the U.S. Labour Department reported that U.S. producer prices, excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, rose 0.3 percent in October, above the 0.1 percent economists had forecast. The overall rate fell 0.1 percent, compared to an expected 0.1 percent gain. 

 Inflation hurts the value of most existing debt. 

 But observers still see recent improvement in the corporate bond market's tone, evidenced by increases in the frequency and dollar amounts of corporate debt issuance, together with a calm feeling among buyers that rates will not surge, and the risks of corporate debt ownership are worth assuming. 

 High-yields in particular have seen a surge in "drive-bys," where companies sell debt with little or no warning. Last week's rally may have triggered some of these. 

 "Treasuries have had a rally over the last few weeks, and we've just started," said George Edwards, a portfolio manager who helps manage $10.0 billion of high-yield debt for Prudential Global Asset Management in Newark, N.J. 

 "This boomlet of supply should take a little bit of steam out of the recent rally," he said. But few companies can successfully do drive-bys, and few are doing road shows. "That part of the new issue calendar is dormant," he said. 

 One drive-by is Adelphia Communications Corp.'s  sale Wednesday of $500 million of B1/B-plus rated 10-year notes to yield 350 basis points over Treasuries, through Credit Suisse First Boston and Salomon Smith Barney. Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia is a large U.S. cable television company. 

 Another is a planned $500 million 10-year note sale in the Rule 144a market by Nextlink Communications, Inc. , a Bellevue, Wash.-based broadband telecommunications provider. The deal could price Friday through Goldman Sachs & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney, market sources said. 

 Moody's Investors Service rates the company's existing senior debt B3. Standard & Poor's rates it single-B. 

 Among the issues Edwards is looking at is another media and telecom deal. It's a planned sale of about $1.0 billion, increased Wednesday from $600 million, from White Plains, N.Y.-based Metromedia Fiber Network, Inc. . 

 The B2/B-plus rated 10-year note deal is expected to include a $700 million to $800 million tranche and a 200 million to 300 million euro tranche, lead manager Salomon Smith Barney said. Both tranches, expected to price Friday morning, should yield 10 to 10.25 percent, market sources said. 

 Metromedia Fiber designs and builds high-capacity fiber-optic networks. It has a $2.25 billion debt and equity shelf with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Also Wednesday, New York-based designer Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.  sold 275 million euros ($286 million) of Baa2/BBB rated seven-year notes through Goldman Sachs & Co. 

 Indianapolis-based Duke-Weeks Realty Investments Inc.  sold $150 million of 10-year notes to yield 188 basis points over Treasuries, through Salomon Smith Barney. 

 And Cleveland's Eaton Corp.  sold $250 million of five-year notes and $150 million of 30-year bonds at 110 and 150 basis points over Treasuries, respectively, through Chase Securities Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. Eaton sells hydraulic and other industrial products. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond shed 10/32 to yield 6.09 percent. U.S. bond markets close Thursday for Veterans Day. ((Jonathan Stempel, U.S. Corporate Bond Unit, (212) 859-1662)).

 International 
 Britain's Marks & Spencer Struggles To Revive Its Old Luster in Retailing

 LONDON -- Marks & Spencer, the big British retail concern humbled by slipping profits that have now spread even to its U.S. unit, Brooks Brothers, is fighting to regain its former glory. The question is whether it is too little too late. 

 In business since 1894, Marks & Spencer won the hearts of consumers in the United Kingdom by offering solid and dependable merchandise at affordable prices. But the formula has grown weary, and the mass-market retailer has failed to keep pace with more-savvy niche operators. Twice this year, the company issued profit warnings, and its share price has slumped by a third. 

 Just last week, Marks & Spencer confirmed the trend, reporting a 43% plunge in pretax profit in the first half of the financial year and warning that sales in its core U.K. clothing market remain little changed from the year before. Pretax profit before one-time charges for the 26 weeks ended Sept. 25 fell to GBP 192.8 million ($312.8 million) from GBP 337.4 million a year earlier. Group sales for all operations were down 3% to GBP 3.7 billion from GBP 3.8 billion. 

 Marks & Spencer also said its Brooks Brothers unit in the U.S. swung to a loss, but insisted it still plans to bring the classic American clothier to Europe. Brooks Brothers sales rose 14% to GBP 174.9 million from GBP 152.9 million, but the unit reported a GBP 5.1 million loss from a pretax profit of just under 1 million pence a year earlier, because of increased investment in new stores. 

 To boost sales and profit in its core British market, Marks & Spencer chief executive Peter Salsbury last week announced a radical shift for the staid retailer, saying it would part with tradition by allowing shoppers to use third-party credit cards. It will also expand Internet shopping for Christmas, and work with top fashion designers to develop subbrands of its in-house St. Michael's label. 

 These moves by Mr. Salsbury, who took over last year after a bitter boardroom row, are among many that tinker with the Marks & Spencer formula. Earlier, he shuttered all Canadian stores and some in Europe, and announced the sale of its Kings supermarket chain in the U.S. In late October he jettisoned a longtime U.K. clothing supplier. 

 Still, some analysts believe the company isn't restructuring fast enough in a fiercely competitive retail sector. "The underlying trends aren't really improving," says Emily Shamma, an analyst at WestLB Panmure in London. "Management should realize that tweaking the system isn't enough, and that it's time for some radical steps." She said Marks & Spencer should put its own house in order before taking on the challenge of bringing Brooks Brothers to Europe. 

 The fact that Marks & Spencer has to take such aggressive action is especially grim because, much like the monarchy and the chimes of Big Ben, the Marks & Spencer retail empire was always regarded as a solid and dependable British institution. 

 For decades, tourists trudged there to buy simple, woolen sweaters, the perfect way to say, "I've been to the U.K." British men who hated shopping loaded up on shirts and ties for the office, while women went for the lingerie. But Marks & Spencer failed to see an invasion of competitors selling staples such as underwear and other clothing -- and selling it better, with more style than frumpy Marks & Spencer. The newcomers, such as Gap Inc. of the U.S., stole customers who craved brand names, trendy designs and a cutting-edge shopping ambiance that Marks & Spencer lacked. 

 Meanwhile, supermarket chains such as Asda PLC, now owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. of the U.S., expanded their clothing lines, offering shoppers cut-price designer and own-label apparel along with their groceries. As the retail sector raced ahead, plugged into youth culture and maverick marketing gimmicks to lure increasingly sophisticated shoppers, Marks & Spencer resolutely stayed rooted in the past. 

 "We lost touch with our customers," acknowledges John Bowen, a Marks & Spencer executive. "We didn't listen to them. We were arrogant, in many senses." Until recently, Marks & Spencer's stores didn't have bathrooms, try-on rooms or restaurants. 

 At a time of seismic shifts and consolidation in the European retail sector, Marks & Spencer is racing against the clock to modernize. 

 "There's still value in their brand, but the challenges are enormous, and there's no quick fix," says George Wallace, managing director of Management Horizons Europe, a retail consultancy in London.

 US Corp Bonds-Many issuers testing healthier market.

 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds ended a quiet Monday essentially unchanged, amid an increasing belief among traders and managers that testing this market may not be such a bad idea. 

 Spreads, the difference in yield between corporate debt and benchmark securities with comparable maturities, were unchanged Monday, as were high-yield prices, traders said. 

 U.S. bond markets have recently shown considerable life, with $8.84 billion in investment-grade and $4.228 billion in high-yield new debt issuance last week alone. 

 Spreads have narrowed considerably in recent weeks, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond has fallen from its recent Oct. 25 peak of 6.40 percent to its current 6.06 percent. The bond price edged down 1/32 on Monday. This environment allows corporations to offer lower yields and command better prices than they could before. 

 At the same time, data showing manageable U.S. economic growth have suggested that perhaps the Federal Reserve will not move aggressively to raise interest rates to stanch growth. And in high-yields, some flattening in the rate of new corporate debt defaults, and the first net inflows into high-yield mutual funds in seven weeks have also improved market sentiment. 

 "You have a host of positive indicators that people have groped onto," said a portfolio manager who trolls in both investment-grade and high-yield corporates. 

 But the clamour to own does not extend to all corporate debt. Referring to last Thursday's $1.0 billion 30-year bond sale by Dow Chemical Co. , the manager said that by buying large, liquid issues, investors get both easy-to-trade debt and the peace of mind of knowing they paid a fair price. 

 "If you're a trader, and you buy a bond like Dow, you know that it's pretty hard to be off by more than two or three basis points," said the manager. "But if you buy other securities, you can be off by 10 to 15 basis points because there may be no buyers around. It's not dissimilar to the equity market, where perhaps 20 to 40 stocks have driven the S&P." 

 Among the deals pricing on Monday, General Electric Capital Corp., the Stamford, Conn.-based financing arm of conglomerate General Electric Co. , sold $300 million of Aaa/AAA rated notes maturing Jan. 2005 to yield 74 basis points over Treasuries through lead manager Warburg Dillon Read. 

 And Staples Inc.  sold 150 million euros ($156 million) of five-year Baa2/BBB-minus notes to yield 5.925 percent, or 145 basis points over equivalent maturity BTANs (French government Treasury notes), through lead managers Goldman Sachs & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney. 

 Framingham, Mass.-based Staples, which operates more than 1,000 office supply stores, is expected to use the proceeds in part to finance its purchase of office supply companies from Germany's Divaco, a joint venture between German retailer Metro AG  and Deutsche Bank AG . 

 Several deals are in the works. 

 Lockheed Martin Corp. , the world's largest defence and aerospace company, is expected to sell $2.0 billion of five-, 10-and 30-year Baa3/BBB-minus rated debt, the lowest investment grade, through lead managers Goldman and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. 

 Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's cut the company's debt ratings after Lockheed issued a profit warning Oct. 29 that caused its stock and debt to fall sharply. 

 Dealers said Sprint Capital Corp, a unit of Sprint Corp. , will launch on Tuesday an inaugural $500 million two-year medium-term note deal through Credit Suisse First Boston, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney. The notes are rated Baa1/BBB-plus. 

 Also, Hovensa LLC plans to sell $650 million of BBB-minus rated senior secured bonds in the Rule 144a market, dealers said. Wholly owned subsidiaries of Amerada Hess Corp.  and Petroleos de Venezuela each own half of Hovensa, a crude oil refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, S&P said. 

 Sovereign Bancorp Inc. , a Wyomissing, Pa.-based thrift holding company with about $25 billion in assets, may sell $700 million of Ba1/BBB-minus rated debt through Lehman Brothers Inc. and Salomon Smith Barney, dealers said. 

 The debt will include seven-year notes yielding about 10.50 percent and four-year or 4-1/2-year notes yielding about 10.25 percent. Sovereign is acquiring and assuming 268 branches, $8 billion of loans, and $12 billion of deposits from FleetBoston Financial . 

 In high-yield markets, the straight debt of Arch Communications Group Inc. , the No. 2 U.S. paging company, surged about 10 points after Arch agreed to merge with No. 1 Paging Network Inc. . PageNet's straight debt rose about two points, traders said. ((Jonathan Stempel, U.S. Corporate Bond Unit, (212) 859-1662)).

 Defence and aerospace group Lockheed Martin has cited its failed bid for the UK Astor defence contract as one of its reasons for issuing a fourth profit warning in less than a year. 

 The company has cut its 2000 forecast to just $1 per share with cash flow expected to be $500m, down from $2.15 per share and a cash flow of $900m. It has maintained its 1999 earnings forecast of at least $1.50 per share with a cash flow outlook of $500m. 

 The company says that organisational structures have been put in place "to help reduce capital expenditure, expenses and to rationalise facilities and headcount". 

 A spokesman says it is unlikely that job losses and/or site closures will take place in the UK, where Lockheed regrouped its operations as an independent subsidiary earlier this year. 

 Astor - the UK's airborne stand-off radar project - was won in June by a Raytheon-led consortium. Lockheed had entered a rival bid with Racal. 

 Vance Coffman, Lockheed's chairman and CEO, said: "We are deeply disappointed with this reduced outlook for our company. This level of earnings and cash generation is unacceptable for Lockheed Martin." 

 Other reasons cited for the downturn were failures to win airborne early warning and imaging contracts as well as softness in the commercial space sector and increased investment in advanced launch vehicles. 

 In the near future, Lockheed is looking to capitalise on a number of projects with which it is already involved, including the Joint Strike Fighter (pictured). 

 Net earnings for its third quarter were $217m, down from $318m in the same period last year, while sales were $6.2bn, down from $6.3bn last year.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dole Food Co. Thursday posted a third-quarter loss, citing weaker pricing in the European banana business and last year's citrus freeze in California. The latest results, however, met analysts' diminished expectations. 

 The company also announced it will downsize its operations in order to reduce costs, enhance earnings and pay down debt. 

 The Westlake Village, Calif.-based fresh fruit and flower grower expects to take a fourth-quarter charge in the range of $30 million to $40 million as it downsizes its banana operations and consolidates European businesses. It said it expects to return to profitability in 2000. 

 Dole (DOL) said its third-quarter net loss came to $8 million, or 14 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, for the period ended Oct. 9, compared with net income of $15.6 million, or 26 cents a diluted share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 17% to $1.41 billion. 

 However, the latest results included a charge of $7.8 million, or 11 cents a share, from expenses associated with Hurricane Mitch. Excluding the charge, the company said it lost $1.87 million, or three cents a share, meeting the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 After Dole reduced its third-quarter targets in September, analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial revised their estimates from a previous prediction for a profit of around 13 cents a share. But before a July warning, analysts had been looking for earnings of 39 cents a share. 

 Dole has blamed trade conditions in the European Union and continued softness in eastern Europe and Russia, in part, for its troubles. 

 EU rules governing banana trade favor imports from Africa and Caribbean nations - Europe's former colonies - over less-expensive Latin American bananas. Earlier this year, the World Trade Organization ruled that the EU's banana-import system is illegal. The WTO has authorized the U.S. to apply punitive tariffs on $191.4 million of EU imports. 

 Dole said cash flow from operations - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization - before rehabilitation expenses, totaled $68.2 million, compared with $76.1 million a year ago. 

 Dole is trimming its banana operations by 17%, which will include the closure of certain production sites, reducing purchases from independent growers and ceasing operations in Nicaragua and Venezuela. The company said overproduction of bananas in Latin America and the need to bring its supply in line with market demand are behind its decision to eliminate certain operations. 

 The effort will eliminate more than 25 million boxes from the company's pipeline, and is expected to affect about 9,000 workers. Dole said the cost-cutting measures also will include the elimination of seven of the company's shipping vessels. 

 Dole also plans to cut sales to "developing markets," such as Russia and Eastern Europe. Dole said it will consolidate its Eastern Europe distribution and sales operations, closing 15 locations and reducing its work force by more than 300 people. 

 In addition, Dole said it has consolidated all of its North American fresh-product production and sales under one unit in Salinas, Calif., and has closed its fresh-fruit offices in Bakersfield, Calif. 

 Dole also said it has started a review of all of its noncore assets or underperforming units with an intention to sell or liquidate underperforming businesses. The company said this initiative is expected to generate about $100 million to $200 million over the next 18 months, which will be used to pay debt. 

 The company also plans to reduce capital expenditures. 

 The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial is for net income of about 24 cents a share in the fourth quarter. For the year-ago fourth quarter, the company reported an operating loss of $7.8 million, or 13 cents a share.

 ASIA/PACIFIC 

 Mitsubishi Heavy 

 Joins Long List 

 Of Struggling Firms 

 Japan's heavy-machinery and shipbuilding companies suffered big losses in the fiscal first half ended Sept. 30, and analysts said the strong yen will continue to weigh on businesses in the second half. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries said that it suffered an unconsolidated pretax loss of 29.74 billion yen ($285.7 million), the first parent half-year loss since the company was established in a merger more than three decades ago. Mitsubishi Heavy blamed the loss on increased competition at home and abroad, the poor Japanese economy and reduced exports to Asian economies. Reflecting the poor demand environment, its sales plunged by nearly 18% to 916.36 billion yen. A strong yen can hurt results both because of currency translation of sales made abroad and because of reduced imports by other countries. 

 If misery loves company, Mitsubishi has got plenty. Kawasaki Heavy Industries last week posted its first interim pretax loss in 12 years. With Asian economies back on track toward recovery, Japanese machinery makers and shipbuilders find themselves confronting increasingly competitive rivals in neighboring countries such as South Korea, where the cheap won allows exporters to sell products more inexpensively overseas. In response to the conditions gripping the industry, Mitsubishi Heavy also unveiled the details of a four-year restructuring plan. It said it would reduce group staff by 7,000 to 64,000 by March 2004 through attrition. At the parent company, payrolls will be trimmed to 35,000 from the current 40,000. 

 Taiwan Quake Causes Little Damage 

 Taiwan's latest big earthquake, a 6.9-magnitude tremor centered off the island's southern coast, caused little damage and, despite persistent aftershocks, isn't expected to disrupt the island's closely watched shipments of computer chips and other electronics, industry executives said. That's a very different story from the island's last major earthquake, on Sept. 21, which left more than 2,400 people dead and 100,000 homeless and shut down the island's computer-chip industry. Then, prices for computer chips soared around the world as the disruption cut supplies just as the industry was heading into its peak season. But the epicenter of September's 7.6 quake was the middle of the island, while the latest one was in the ocean, far from high-tech manufacturing areas in northern Taiwan. 

 Mou Enters Plea in Fraud Case 

 A well-known Chinese entrepreneur pleaded not guilty to charges that he defrauded a state-run bank of $75 million. Mou Qizhong, head of Land Economic Group and once one of China's richest men, told the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court he had legitimately borrowed the money to launch satellites in Kazakstan. If the loan was not legal, Mr. Mou said, that was the fault of the Bank of China, among others, as the bank issued the letter of credit. The one-day trial was notable for its lack of witnesses. One co-defendant, Mr. Mou's former chief financial officer, turned state's witness. A verdict is expected in eight days, and Mr. Mou could receive a life sentence, which would likely result in his serving 10 years in prison. 

 Japan Forecasts Tax Shortfall 

 Japan said its tax revenues will fall more than a trillion yen ($9.6 billion) short of the budgeted amount in the current fiscal year, forcing the government to use funds from a supplemental budget to fill the gap. Reflecting the sluggish business environment, the government recently had to return 400 billion yen in prepaid corporate taxes to companies whose earnings fell short of expectations in the past fiscal year. Meanwhile, Japan's economy grew by a real 0.1% in the July-September quarter compared with the previous period, according to a report released by Nomura Research Institute. Japan's Economic Planning Agency isn't expected to release its preliminary findings for July-September GDP until early December. 

 BRIEFLY: 

 -- Morgan Stanley Capital International has delayed the return of Malaysia to its benchmark indexes by three months until May 31, 2000, to avoid market uncertainty over possible leap-year computer glitches. Market watchers said the move could prove troublesome for anyone betting on an MSCI-inspired market rally in Malaysia at the start of next year. 

 -- Citigroup said it acquired 19% of Nikko Beans, a Japanese Internet brokerage firm that began operations last month. Specific financial terms weren't disclosed. Citigroup said the acquisition is part of an alliance with the Tokyo firm.

 Anglo American-Tarmac Talks End 

 Anglo American, a London mining and financial conglomerate, announced that talks about a possible takeover of British building-materials maker Tarmac ended Friday after Tarmac rejected an offer of 550 pence ($9.01) a share, or about GBP 1.13 billion ($1.86 billion). Tarmac had previously rejected an offer of 535 pence a share, or about GBP 1.1 billion. Among other things, Anglo American is the parent of Anglogold of South Africa, the world's biggest gold-mining company. Anglogold recently bid for Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields, Africa's third-largest gold producer, and Australian group Anaconda Nickel. Anglogold said it is interested in Ashanti Goldfields' biggest operating mine, Obuasi, in Ghana and a promising new mine, Geita, in Tanzania. The Ghanaian gold miner remains in takeover talks with its biggest shareholder, Lonmin, a U.K. mining group. Separately, Gold Fields, South Africa's second-largest gold miner, said it will pay a 62% market premium to acquire the shares it doesn't own in junior producer St. Helena Gold Mines. Gold Fields currently holds 46% of St. Helena's equity. 

 Internet Bank Pushes Rate Envelope 

 Losing money has never been so popular. First there was EGG, the internet-banking unit of British insurer Prudential PLC, which offered unusually high interest rates on savings accounts. Others followed. Now First-E, a recently launched Internet bank, has gone one step further. Its new interest rate on savings accounts, an aggressive 6.25%, is higher than the 6.00% being offered by EGG and well over the current base rate of 5.25%. First-E -- the result of a joint venture between France's Banque d'Escompte and Enba, a technology group -- isn't saying how much it expects to lose by aiming so high. Like other Internet-based groups, First-E's strategy involves luring customers with attractive prices before trying to cross-sell other, more lucrative banking services. Analysts warn that the arrival of high savings rates has brought with it a new investor -- the "rate tart," as one described the breed -- who monitors weekly tables and switches his money back and forth depending on which bank is offering the best returns. 

 BAA Results Cheer Analysts 

 Fiscal first-half earnings at BAA, the British operator of airports, showed that the deterioration of retail sales because of the end of duty-free sales in Europe has stopped. BAA said its pretax profit before exceptional items for the six months ended Sept. 30 was GBP 306 million ($503.5 million), compared with GBP 307 million in the first half of last year. Analysts had braced themselves for gloomy first-half figures after the company issued a profit warning in early October. Duty- and tax-free shopping was scrapped in Europe at the end of June, but BAA pledged to maintain duty-free prices for travelers within the European Union.

 Uruguayan Center Left Advances 

 Uruguay's center-left Popular Front increased its share in Congress in elections on Sunday, becoming the body's biggest political force, preliminary results showed. The Popular Front should increase its standing in the 99-seat lower-house Chamber of Deputies to 40 from 31 seats and its forces to 12 senators instead of nine in the 30-seat upper house. "The Popular Front is now absolutely necessary for laws which might require the passage of two-thirds of the Congress, like naming judicial powers," said Oscar Botinelli, a political analyst with Factum pollsters. The Popular Front's candidate Tabare Vazquez won 39% of the presidential vote and, since none of the four candidates won a majority, will go to a runoff vote Nov. 28 against Jorge Batlle of the center-right, incumbent Colorado party. 

 Globo Unit Sets Brazilian Internet Launch 

 Brazilian pay-television provider Globo Cabo expects to launch its Virtua Internet service provider within the next two weeks, pending regulatory approval. It will be Globo Cabo's first major project launch since the company, a unit of media concern Globo Comunicacoes & Participacoes, sold an 11.5% stake to Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., in August for $126 million. Globo Cabo's two-way cable-modem service allows cable customers to access the Internet at high speeds without tying up their phone lines. The company expects Virtua to attract 50,000 subscribers in the first 12 months. 

 Pemex Official Is Sanctioned 

 Mexico banned an official of state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos from holding any public post for 10 years, after discovering contract irregularities. A watchdog agency said Miguel Angel Fuentes was found to have simulated tender processes on contracts for the leasing of machinery and equipment at a Pemex refinery in 1993 and 1994. There was no response from Pemex.

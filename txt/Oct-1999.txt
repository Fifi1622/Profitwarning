3 to compete for No. 2 job at Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola Co., whose stock is on track for its first annual drop in almost two decades, promoted three executives to set up a horse race to become Chief Executive Douglas Ivester's second-in-command.

Jack Stahl, North American group president, will take over North America, Latin America and Minute Maid juices. Doug Daft, Middle and Far East group president, will add Africa and the new Schweppes unit. And Chief Financial Officer James Chestnut will handle finance, global communications and government affairs.

Ivester has been under pressure to name a No. 2 to help him handle crises such as Coca-Cola's tainted drinks scandal in Europe, four straight drops in quarterly earnings, sluggish sales abroad and a race discrimination suit. Ivester won his job through a similar contest more than five years ago.

Lockheed-Martin president resigns after profit warning

Defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp. warned Friday that profits will be lower than expected next year - prompting the departure of President Peter Teets.

After the announcement, Lockheed shares dropped. They fell $2.683/4, or 12 percent, to $20.25. The stock had traded above $40 in early June, but it fell after the company issued an earlier forecast of lower profits.

Lockheed has begun a search for Teets' replacement.

Tyco stock down amid questions about accounting

Shares of Tyco International Ltd., the world's biggest maker of electronic connectors, fell 9 percent after a New York Times article Friday raised additional concern about its accounting practices.

Tyco fell $4.061/4 to $39.933/4. Tyco has declined about one-quarter over the past three weeks amid speculation about accounting irregularities.

New York Times columnist Floyd Norris wrote that AMP Inc. and U.S. Surgical Co. took large losses just before Tyco's acquisitions of the companies were completed, reducing depreciation charges and making it appear that they have greater growth after Tyco purchased them.

Tyco said Friday its moves adhered to the letter and spirit of generally accepted accounting principles and were clearly disclosed to the public.

 Hewlett-Packard Surprised By 13% Stock Price Drop

 PALO ALTO, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Hewlett-Packard Co. (HWP) said it was surprised by the 13% drop in its stock price Wednesday after the company warned its fourth quarter earnings may be weaker than previously expected. 

 The company reiterated Thursday in a press release that there is "ongoing risk" related to its ability to deliver analysts' average expectation of earnings per share of 77 cents for the computer and imaging company that will continue to operate under the Hewlett-Packard name. 

 As reported, shares of Hewlett-Packard fell $9.625 to $67 Wednesday after the company told analysts that Unix server sales were disappointing. The same problem prompted new Chief Executive Carly Fiorina to give a profit warning Oct. 1. 

 However, Hewlett-Packard said Thursday that the bulk of its business remains strong. 

 "Given the fact that our PC and imaging businesses - comprising some 75% of H-P's overall business - are in excellent health, we are surprised by the magnitude of the decline in our stock price," the company said. 

 Hewlett-Packard said the fourth quarter will reflect weak enterprise sales of UNIX system servers in the North American market; short-term constraints on PC component availability due to the Taiwan earthquake, although overall PC demand and profitability remain strong; and strong growth and excellent profitability in printers, and imaging products and supplies. 

 The company also cautioned about uncertainty related to Year 2000 customer spending. 

 "We have our challenges, and in the coming weeks we'll share our plans to address them and to build on our many opportunities," Hewlett-Packard said. "We remain convinced that H-P is an excellent investment, and we are buying H-P stock aggressively." 

 Hewlett-Packard's fourth quarter ends Oct. 31, and the the company will report its quarterly results after the market closes Nov. 17.

MICROSOFT JOINS DOW AS TECHS JOLT OLD GUARD; STOCK AVERAGE CUTS VENERABLE NAMES

Punctuating technology's dominance on Wall Street and Main Street, Intel and Microsoft are being added to the Dow Jones industrial average, replacing Chevron, Goodyear and other stocks symbolic of an economy once dominated by smokestacks.

Two other venerable names, Sears Roebuck and chemical maker Union Carbide, are also being removed from the Dow, making room for home-improvements retailer Home Depot and the Baby Bell telephone company SBC Communications.

The changes announced yesterday by The Wall Street Journal, creator and custodian of the 30-stock Dow average, take effect Monday. Redmond-based Microsoft joins The Boeing Co. as the only Washington-headquartered companies included in the Dow.

The selection of Intel and Microsoft, both of which trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market, marks the first time the Journal has chosen companies not listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

But more significant than Nasdaq's symbolic victory against the 207-year-old NYSE is the decision to scratch an arbitrary rule that kept some of the most dynamic names in technology and the overall economy from being reflected in Wall Street's best-known barometer.

Intel, for example, is the world's biggest supplier of the semiconductors that serve as the brains for computers. And Microsoft is the No. 1 maker of the software to run those computers and programs for more specific tasks.

Critics of the Dow, created in 1896, had long argued that the average contained too few stocks that reflect the technology and information revolution that has been reshaping the U.S. and global economies over the past two decades.

Intel and Microsoft will join International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard, itself added to the Dow less than three years ago, giving the average four pure technology components.

``I'd say `hooray!' It's been a long time coming,'' said A. Marshall Acuff Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``The Dow has reflected the old economy of the last 50 or more years and these changes today are another step in bringing the index in line with the new economy.''

To that end, the Dow also will get a healthy dose of the Internet economy with the selection of SBC Communications. As the nation's largest local telephone company, the former Southwestern Bell is also the biggest provider of Internet access, its wires reaching into nearly a third of all U.S. homes.

In fact, SBC may be the most suitable successor to the railroad companies that were the driving force in the economy a century ago. While trucks and planes now dominate the shipping industry, railroads have re-emerged as a conduit for a different kind of freight - their tracks providing ready-made routes for fiber-optic cables and the explosion of Internet commerce.

But despite the Internet's growing importance, analysts said it's too soon to add a pure Internet company such as America Online to the Dow because the industry is still so young.

The changes in the Dow's composition will not produce an immediate change in its value. The average is computed by combining the stock prices of all 30 companies and dividing by a special number calculated by the Journal. That divisor will be adjusted to reflect the changes and make sure the ``new'' Dow starts on Monday at the same value where the ``old'' Dow finished on Friday.

But once trading begins next week, the Dow may behave a bit differently: rising more quickly with the addition of some faster-growing companies, and swinging more wildly with the fortunes of its volatile technology components.

Just last week, a profit warning by IBM sent that stock plunging more than 20 points - or the equivalent of more than 100 Dow points. Non-technology stocks rarely gyrate so violently.

If the changes announced yesterday had been in place at the beginning of the year, the Dow would be up 15 percent this year, compared with the current average's 12 percent gain.

While Microsoft is the biggest company by market value, it won't have the biggest impact on the Dow average. That's because the Dow is price-weighted, meaning the companies with the highest stock price have the largest effect on the change in the average's price.

With the loss of Chevron, the Dow's only energy company will be Exxon - although notably, that company is set to almost double in size by merging with Mobil.

Union Carbide was one of only two chemical companies in the Dow. One reason the Journal chose to review the Dow's makeup now is that Union Carbide is being acquired by Dow Chemical Co. - a company unrelated to Dow Jones & Co., the owner of the Journal and the industrial average's namesake.

But although Union Carbide and Dow Chemical will form the world's second-biggest chemical company, the newspaper apparently decided that No. 1 DuPont, the Dow's other chemical company, provides sufficient representation for that industry.

Likewise, Sears Roebuck is still the nation's second-largest retailer, but has been struggling for years to keep up with huge discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores, which was added to the Dow during the last reconfiguration in 1997.

And since Wal-Mart and Sears compete in many of the same areas, Home Depot will help reflect a different, increasingly lucrative part of the retail industry.

Sears said it was disappointed in the decision, noting it comes at a time when customers have begun to respond to changes Sears is making.

``Any suggestion that today's changes `will make the Dow Jones Industrial Average even more representative of the evolving U.S. economy' is misguided,'' the company said in a statement. ``With more than $40 billion in revenues, 300,000 employees and relationships with 65 million households, Sears most certainly plays a relevant role in the U.S. economy.''

Since tires are sold by Wal-Mart and its Sam's Club subsidiary, it may not have seemed so important anymore for the Dow to have Goodyear, the world's largest tire maker.

Some critics argue that the Journal artificially pumps up the Dow by removing companies in decline.

Of the stocks added to the Dow list, two fell yesterday. Home Depot fell $1.25 to $70.68 3/4; Microsoft dipped 6 1/4 cents to $92.37 1/2; Intel rose 12 1/2 cents to $71.37 1/2; and SBC climbed $1.31 1/4 to $45.56 1/4.

All of the stocks taken out of the Dow fell. Chevron fell $2 to $88; Goodyear fell $3.93 3/4 to $41.25; Sears dropped $1.87 1/2 to $27; and Union Carbide slipped 50 cents to $59.

Two other venerable names, Sears Roebuck and chemical maker Union Carbide, are also being removed from the Dow, making room for home-improvement retailer Home Depot and the Baby Bell telephone company SBC Communications, based in San Antonio.

The changes announced Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal, creator and custodian of the 30-stock Dow, take effect Monday.

The selection of Intel and Microsoft, both of which trade on the Nasdaq, marks the first time the Journal has chosen companies not listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Some critics argue that the Journal artificially pumps up the Dow by removing companies in decline - or companies in declining industries - and replaces them with dynamic names in fast-growing markets. A more accurate measure of the economy and the stock market, they say, would endure the bumps and the bruises of a company that's fallen on bad times.

Of the stocks added to the Dow list, two fell Tuesday. Home Depot fell 1 1/4 to 70 11/16; Microsoft dipped 1/16 to 92 3/8; Intel rose 3/16 to 71 7/16; and SBC climbed 1 5/16] to 45 9/16.

All of the stocks taken out of the Dow fell Tuesday. Chevron was down 2 to 88; Goodyear fell 3 15/16 to 41 1/4; Sears dropped 1 7/8 to 27; and Union Carbide slipped 1/2 to 59.

Dow Jones chronology

The following is a brief history of the Dow Jones industrial average, the oldest existing indicator of the U.S. stock market.

November 1882: Financial journalists Charles Dow and Edward Jones form Dow Jones & Co. and begin providing handwritten news distributed by messengers around the Manhattan financial district.

1884: Dow develops an average consisting of 11 stocks to determine how stocks being traded on the New York Stock Exchange were moving in general.

May 26, 1896: Dow introduces the first Dow Jones industrial average, consisting of 12 stocks, based on the average produced 12 years earlier. Only General Electric Co. (ticker symbol GE) remains from the original dozen companies. Stocks that have disappeared from it, such as American Cotton Oil and National Lead, are reminders of turn-of-the-century industrial America.

Oct. 7, 1896: The average begins to be published daily in the Wall Street Journal, the Dow Jones newspaper that is still responsible for the average.

1916: The average is increased to include 20 companies.

Oct. 1, 1928: The average is expanded to 30 stocks and closes that day at 240.01.

July 8, 1932: The average falls to 41.22, an all-time low.

Nov. 14, 1972: The average closes above 1,000 for the first time.

Nov. 21, 1995: The average closes above 5,000 for the first time.

March 17, 1997: Dow Jones makes the most recent changes in the index components prior to Tuesday's activity. Travelers Group, now Citigroup, Hewlett-Packard Co., Johnson & Johnson and Wal-Mart Stores are all moved into the index.

These four companies replace Westinghouse Electric Corp., Texaco, Bethlehem Steel Corp. and Woolworth Corp., now Venator Group.

March 29, 1999: The average closes above 10,000 for the first time.

Oct. 26, 1999: Effective Nov. 1, Dow Jones will add Home Depot, Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and SBC Communications to the index. The four companies replace Chevron Corp., Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Union Carbide Corp.

 Hewlett-Packard Sees 'Additional Risk' To 4th Quarter Earns

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Hewlett-Packard Co. (HWP) warned late Wednesday that there are "additional risks" to its fourth-quarter earnings, leading many analysts on Wall Street to cut their profit estimates. 

 H-P shares fell 8% in regular trading Wednesday to 70 3/8. In after-hours trading, the stock fell to 67 1/4. 

 The warning - that Unix server sales were disappointing - was given out in conversations with Wall Street analysts as they prepared end-of-quarter reports, a spokeswoman said. 

 The server problem is the same issue that caused Carly Fiorina, H-P's chief executive, to give a profit warning Oct. 1. 

 Fiorina warned then that fourth-quarter revenue could fall short of expectations, due in large part to underperforming sales of servers in the U.S. based on the Unix computing language. She vowed to reorganize the server sales force in the U.S., saying both the culture and the incentive program of the group needed to be fixed. 

 On Wednesday, H-P officials pointed again to that area. 

 There is "additional risk to earnings from the continuing enterprise sales force issue in North America," said Marlene Somsak, an H-P spokeswoman. 

 Somsak said it's routine for Wall Street analysts to check in with the company just before it enters its "quiet period" to make sure everything is on track. 

 As analysts called H-P in advance of the Nov. 1 quiet period, company officials warned of the worsening problem with the Unix sales force.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Hewlett-Packard Co. (HWP) warned late Wednesday
that there are "additional risks" to its fourth-quarter earnings,
leading many analysts on Wall Street to cut their profit estimates.



H-P shares fell 8% in regular trading Wednesday to 70 3/8. In
after-hours trading, the stock fell to 67 1/4.



The warning - that Unix server sales were disappointing - was given
out in conversations with Wall Street analysts as they prepared
end-of-quarter reports, a spokeswoman said.



The server problem is the same issue that caused Carly Fiorina, H-P's
chief executive, to give a profit warning Oct. 1.



Fiorina warned then that fourth-quarter revenue could fall short of
expectations, due in large part to underperforming sales of servers in
the U.S. based on the Unix computing language. She vowed to reorganize
the server sales force in the U.S., saying both the culture and the
incentive program of the group needed to be fixed.



On Wednesday, H-P officials pointed again to that area.



There is "additional risk to earnings from the continuing enterprise
sales force issue in North America," said Marlene Somsak, an H-P
spokeswoman.



Somsak said it's routine for Wall Street analysts to check in with the
company just before it enters its "quiet period" to make sure everything
is on track.



As analysts called H-P in advance of the Nov. 1 quiet period, company
officials warned of the worsening problem with the Unix sales force.



As a result, several firms lowered their earnings estimates for H-P.

 EuroCom warns on profits, cites Iridium.

 COPENHAGEN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Maritime communications equipment maker EuroCom Industries (ECI) downgraded its 1999 sales and earnings forecast on Wednesday, citing slow demand for a key product after U.S. global satellite telephone firm Iridium  filed for bankruptcy protection. 

 Issuing its second profit warning within as many months, Danish-based ECI cut its full-year turnover estimate to 580-600 million crowns ($83-85.5 million) from 630-650 million crowns. 

 It now saw break-even on the bottom line, down from a 20-25 million crown profit forecast. By comparison, in January-June, ECI's pre-tax profit more than doubled to 47.7 million crowns. 

 The major problem is that one of ECI's main products is that sales of a terminal designed to transmit and receive signals via global satellite telephone company Iridium's system of 66 satellites in orbit around the earth have been hit. 

 "Sales of the Iridium satellite terminal developed by ECI were adversely impacted by the fact that the company behind Iridium filed for protection from its creditors," ECI said in a statement. 

 "We believe that a financial restructuring of Iridium is likely, so as to allow continued operation of the 66 satellites," ECI said, adding: "a breakthrough in sales is not expected until Iridium's financial situation has been clarified." 

 U.S. Motorola  owns 18 percent of Iridium. 

 ECI's share price has halved since Iridium's mid-August Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing. The small-cap stock, which was listed on the Copenhagen bourse late last year, was untraded at 0715 GMT having closed at 56 crowns on Tuesday. 

 ECI said it would cut its workforce further to 330 people compared with 740 at the start of 1999. 

 "Turnover for 2000 is expected to be significantly lower than in 1999, ECI said, predicting, however, a net profit. 

 "After 2000, ECI expects growth in both turnover and profit." 

 A European Union directive obliging all fishing vessels of a certain length to be equipped with a global distress and safety communications system (GMDSS) would take force next year, boosting sales, ECI said, noting it was a leading supplier of GMDSS equipment.

 Oil dips amid U.S. stocks build - shares hit by profit-taking.

 NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices closed a little lower on Tuesday amid expectations of small builds in U.S. stockpiles of oil and petroleum products last week, which left trade choppy. 

 Energy shares, hit by oil's slide and more profit-taking after recent earnings-related gains, outpaced the wider market which was rattled by the U.S. central bank warning of a growing risk of inflation. 

 December crude settled 16 cents lower at $23.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) while North Sea marker crude Brent closed 12 cents lower at $22.70. 

 Still most of oil's recent gains remain intact, the latest leg in a seven-month recovery from record lows after major oil producers agreed to slash global production last March. 

 Part of the pressure today came from forecasts that widely-watched data from the American Petroleum Institute, which are released after the NYMEX regular session, would show a small rise of 500,000 barrels in U.S. petroleum stocks. 

 But the weekly API report, a short-term price cue and an indicator of how effective the supply cuts are, showed a hefty rise of 3.4 million barrels in stocks for the October 22 week. 

 Yet instead of falling, crude rose about 10-15 cents a barrel in after-hours trade, with some analysts saying that many traders decided to focus instead on the expanding year-on-year crude stocks deficit, now standing at 30.8 million barrels. 

 Also fuelling the gains in low-volume trade on the ACCESS after-hours system was an unexpected distillates draw reported by the API of 2.97 million barrels against a forecast 700,000 barrel rise, and also a gasoline draw of two million versus an expected one million barrel rise. 

 November heating oil futures, which closed 0.15 cent lower, gained 0.47 cent at 61.00 cents a gallon in the aftermarket by 1740 EDT/2140 GMT while gasoline rose 0.35 cent to 64.50. 

 "It's the (expanding crude) year-on-year deficit but people are also focusing on the heating oil situation this time of year. There was concern that there is too much of it around unless the refineries cut runs," said Jim Falvey of Dresder Kleinwort Benson in Boston, explaining crude's late rise. 

 "People are buying crude on the back of the heat oil, but anyway crude is not up that much," Falvey noted. Most players were likely to await Wednesday's stocks data from the U.S. Department of Energy before taking new futures positions. 

 Crude drew some support earlier after non-OPEC oil producer Oman said it backed other major producers arguing in favour of a proposed extension of the global output cutbacks beyond their March 2000 expiry, if warranted by market conditions. 

 Meanwhile, on the stock markets the S&P Oil International Index   posted the biggest sectoral fall, 2.45 percent to 903.63 points with most of the oil majors it tracks falling sharply. Mobil  shed 2-13/16 to 94-1/4, Exxon 2 to 72-1/16 and Texaco 1-7/16 to 60-9/16. 

 Chevron  fell 2 to 88 after reports that the third largest U.S. oil firm was dumped from the Dow Jones industrial average along with three other firms. 

 "Yesterday and today we had profit-taking. Also Chevron got hit because it was removed from the Dow," Carl H Pforzheimer & Co oil analyst Al Anton told Reuters. 

 "It was a situation of things going too far too fast, so there was a little adjustment. There's not a lot of bearish sentiment around, just some profit-taking," Anton said. 

 Even news of fresh oil finds failed to lift oil shares. 

 Chevron-owned Argentine oil firm San Jorge said it found a new important oil field in the Rio Negro Norte block in Argentina, where an exploratory well yielded 3,881 barrels a day of high quality oil. 

 Conoco  said it had made a "significant" oil and gas discovery offshore Indonesia. An exploration well tested at a rate of 38 million cubic feet of gas per day and 2,480 barrels of oil a day. Conoco shares closed 1/2 down at 26-3/4. 


Among indices, the S&P Oil and Gas Index	     tracking the independents fell 2.38 percent to 56.93, the refining index fell 1.95 percent to 91.17 and the Philadelphia oil services index   fell 1.62 percent to 73.71. ((New York Energy Desk, Tel 212 859-1895, haitham.haddadin@reuters.com)).

 Safeco says rate cuts hit third-quarter profits.

 NEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Multiline California-based insurance group Safeco Corp. , which sells its policies through independent agents, reported a cut in third-quarter earnings on Monday due to industry-wide low premium rates and the effect of dropping rates to keep customers of American States Financial Corp., an insurer it bought two years ago. 

 Safeco reported operating income of $9.8 million, or 7 cents per diluted share, down from $94.1 million, or 68 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. 

 Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected consensus operating earnings of 9 cents per share, adjusted after Safeco issued a profit warning in late September. Before that, analysts had expected 49 cents per share operating earnings. 

 Net income for the quarter, including realised gains, was also down, to $16.1 million, or 12 cents per share, from $74.9 million, or 54 cents per share last year. 

 Safeco shares traded down 9/16 in morning trade at 27-1/16, barely above the year low of 26-6/16. 

 The company said profits were hit by underwriting losses in most lines in its property-casualty operations, which reported an overall loss of $35.3 million for the third quarter, compared with a $90.4 million profit for the same quarter last year. 

 Pure underwriting losses for property-casualty operations in the third quarter were $139.1 million, versus a loss of $20.4 million for the year ago period. 

 Safeco said the losses were caused by higher claims and intense price competition in personal and commercial lines at American States Financial Corp. 

 Roger Eigsti, chief executive officer, said Safeco did not significantly increase premium rates during its acquisition of American States, and actually decreased prices in some states to retain its customers. 

 Eigsti said Safeco was now exercising better risk selection and loss control, and pursuing price increases in the loss-making lines of business which he said should restore profit margins to acceptable levels. 

 Safeco's life insurance operation performed better in the quarter, reporting $45.5 million profit, up from $5.7 million loss last year, which included a one-time write-off of $45.8 million in deferred acquisition costs. 

 The company said its credit and asset management operations also reported profits of $6.6 million and $3.7 million respectively for the quarter. Total revenues for the quarter increased only slightly to $1.76 billion from $1.69 billion.

 Fort Wayne, Ind.-Based Fuel-Industry Supplier's Debt Rating Drops

 A week that started off with bad news for Tokheim Corp. ended with news that could be even worse. 

 Friday, Moody's Investment Service cut its ratings on debt of the Fort Wayne-based company. The outlook for the company was downgraded from stable to negative. And the rating service said Tokheim has no margin for error if it is to avoid defaulting on its credit lines. 

 The downgrade was expected, said Douglas Pinner, chief executive officer of Tokheim. And he expressed confidence the company will avoid default. 

 Tokheim a week ago posted a third-quarter loss, as it had warned. It also said lenders agreed to amend current agreements to prevent default. 

 But that agreement requires Tokheim to issue $50 million in new securities by Jan. 25. Moody's questions whether Tokheim can do that. A default could give bank lenders the right to intervene, Moody's said. 

 Pinner called the downgrade "temporary," and expects Tokheim to arrange the financing by the deadline. 

 Even if the securities are sold, bond holders could be penalized, perhaps by restrictions on paying interest, the Moody's warning continued. Cash flow also remains scarce until major oil companies turn on the spending spigot. 

 Since issuing the profit warning on Oct. 11, Tokheim stock has been hammered. From a close of $7 on Oct. 8, it had dropped 56 percent as of Friday. At midday today, Tokheim was trading at $3.3125, up 18.75 cents. 

 Moody's lowered the rating of Tokheim's $210 million of senior subordinated notes to Caa1 from B3, and lowered the ratings of its $120 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $120 million senior secured-term loan to B2 from B1. 

 Tokheim expects major oil companies to resume stronger buying of service station equipment once mergers are digested. 

 Moody's credited Tokheim with success in combining Retail Petroleum Systems with other operations. But that has not offset the sharp decline in sales to major oil customers, the rating service said. 

 "However, the risks for Tokheim remain high, and the situation permits no margin for error," Moody's said.

IBM suffers from Y2K Big Blues; Stock dives over concerns about slower sales due to glitch fears

NEW YORK - The Y2K scare spooked investors on Thursday after IBM warned that some of its largest customers had paused to fix old equipment instead of buying new machines, sending shares of the top computer maker 20 percent lower.

As a group, International Business Machine Corp. shareholders ended the day $40 billion poorer, on paper anyway, as Big Blue's stock market value fell to $162 billion from more than $200 billion in a single day. The stock fell to 91, closing down 16 from Wednesday's closing price.

The share selloff followed a profit warning by IBM late Wednesday that its financial results would fall sharply below expectations for the next two quarters, leading two influential brokerages to downgrade their rating on the bellwether stock.

"Has the long-term outlook for IBM changed?" Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich asked in a note to his clients. His answer: "Probably not. We still expect IBM to be a beneficiary of the e-commerce explosion next year and beyond," he wrote.

Still, Milunovich cut his recommendation to investors on the stock to neutral from buy for the short term.

Market analysts said IBM's warning triggered selling in the already jittery technology sector, especially of big business software makers that feed off demand for IBM mainframes. Houston-based BMC Software lost 7 to close at 53. Computer Associates International lost 5 3/8 to 52 7/8.

IBM's decline sapped 110 points from the Dow Jones industrial average, wiping away much of Wednesday's 187-point gain that had been lighted by optimism in the wake of Microsoft Corp.'s third-quarter results and bullish outlook.

The Dow average closed at 10,297.69, off 94.67 on Thursday. Excluding IBM's effect, the index would have gained 15 points.

On Wednesday, IBM had posted third-quarter profits that met analysts' expectations, but revenues were soft and the company warned of sharply lower profits in the current fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2000. IBM blamed a pause in sales of new equipment to financial services and insurance customers.

Anticipation that IBM might sidestep Y2K threats and see a boom in corporate Internet spending had sent its shares spiraling to record levels near 140 starting six months ago, on the heels of its first-quarter earnings report. But by summer, the e-business blush began to fade as Y2K drew near.

Morgan Stanleycut its rating on IBM to neutral from outperform and slashed his earnings estimates for the full 1999 year to $3.54 per share from $4.01 per share previously and reduced its estimate for fiscal year 2000 to $4.53 from $4.66.

The analysts' profit forecast for IBM's 1999 year had been $3.91 a share and $4.52 for 2000 heading into IBM's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday afternoon according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.

Milunovich said a clearer picture has emerged from recent earnings reports, including IBM's, that suggest a mixed picture on computer spending: The spending pause is focused among big users of old computer systems, not newer Internet machines.

The latter is the terrain of Sun Microsystems, Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Round Rock-based Dell Computer Corp., although IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. are active here, too.

IBM has estimated that 70 percent of the world's business data is stored on its mainframes, often in big, centralized data centers. The threat of a Y2K failure on any of these systems appears to have made corporate computer buyers loath to introduce any changes ahead of the 2000 date change.

On Wednesday, IBM Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine had signaled Wall Street analysts that fourth-quarter earnings were likely to fall 20 percent below Wall Street expectations.

 LONDON -- Asian shares traded in London closed lower Thursday, with an opening slump on Wall Street dragging stocks deeper into the red in late trading. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 214 points after IBM had a disappointing third-quarter result and a profit warning because of a year-2000-related slowdown. 

 "The markets are really fickle at the moment. There's a lot of uncertainty out there," said one trader in London. 

 The U.K.-based Nikkei 50 index of Japanese stocks closed down 15.59 points, or 0.9%, at 1702.65. Blue-chip shares led the declines, with Sony down at 15,277 yen from 15,420 yen. 

 The Hang Seng London reference index lost 172.22 points, or 1.4%, to close at 12350.78 Thursday. 

 Hutchison Whampoa retreated to 76.00 yen in London, after rising 0.7% in Hong Kong on news that Mannesmann will buy the company's stake in Orange. 

 In the Korean market in London, Samsung Global depositary receipts fell as much as $2.42 to $76.05, closing at $76.12, while the Global depositary shares fell as much as $3.43 to $53.37, closing at $53.40.

Rising concern about the lack of positive earnings news in the latest profit reports in the United States injected a cautious note into the Australian market yesterday.

Strong quarterly earnings by Microsoft, which buoyed Wall St yesterday, were ignored after IBM warned after the market closed that its earnings may fall in the next two quarters.

The warning sparked a fall in S&P 500 futures of 1 per cent.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8 per cent, its third rise in succession, though the All Ordinaries Index rose just 4.3 points to 2827.9 as investors took note of the later developments.

Mr Marcus Fanning, head of active equities at AMP Asset Management, said the US third-quarter earnings season was crucial to the direction of the Australian market as strong growth was needed to justify high earnings multiples. He said he expected the market to continue to remain in a tight range as investors waited for a decision by the US Federal Open Market Committee on interest rates.

"Markets will continue to remain twitchy," he said. "Even if the Federal Reserve does raise rates by 25 basis points, people will just focus on when the next rise will come."

Building materials and energy group Boral, was the worst performing stock in the ASX 100 yesterday, shedding 14¢, or 5.7 per cent, to $2.42. This signalled a poor institutional reaction to Wednesday's plans to demerge its energy and building materials divisions.

News Corp bounced off Wednesday's nine-month low, with its ordinary shares up 23¢ to $10.59 and its preference scrip up 20¢ to $9.80.

Lend Lease dropped 21¢ to $18.09 on news the property and financial group paid $250 million for a 55 per cent stake in Hong Kong-based CEF Life Insurance. The group said it was positioning itself to take advantage of Asia's booming life insurance market.

Telstra gained 7¢ to $7.62, with a large European institution rumoured to have been active in the stock, while its receipts jumped 5¢ to $4.76. Cable & Wireless Optus, rose 8¢ to $3.42, and AAPT gained 5¢ to $4.90.

Mr Andrew Brown, director of Australian equities at Rothschild Australia Asset Management, said the market was clogged with new equity, which would keep it flat over the short term.

He said investors returning to the oversold large cap stocks, such as the banks, News Corp and AMP, could lift the market substantially in the New Year.

Internet media group, LibertyOne, slumped 18¢, or 8.6 per cent, to $1.93, with no sign of a much-rumoured takeover bid.

The All Resources Index lost 0.8 per cent, with BHP 16¢ lower at $17.26, despite a 3 per cent jump in the copper price, while Rio Tinto shed 19¢ to $24.70.

Cluff Resources topped the market's trading volume for the second day, falling 0.2¢ to 5.9¢ with 91.4 million shares changing hands. The company said on Wednesday it found diamonds at its Monte Cristo mine.

In Asian markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2 per cent and Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5 per cent.

 BOSTON, Oct. 21 -- The Gillette Company warned today of an unexpected drop in fourth-quarter profit and said that it might sell its Braun appliance and stationery-products businesses like Paper Mate and Parker pens, which have been pulling down its earnings. 

 Gillette, the world's largest maker of razors and blades, also said that its third-quarter profit from operations fell three-tenths of a percent, in line with reduced analyst estimates. 

 The company, based in Boston, said its fourth-quarter results would be hurt as retailers cut inventories of blades, primarily in Europe. The maker of Mach 3 razors, Duracell batteries and other consumer products has now warned four times about its earnings since April. 

 ''Gillette is struggling,'' said Robert Izmirlian, an analyst at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ''The fourth quarter isn't going to be the quarter everyone hoped for early in the year.'' 

 Gillette said its fourth-quarter earnings would decline by a ''middle to high teens'' percentage rate, less than the gain of about 15 percent expected by the company in July. 

 Analysts expected profit of 42 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared with 39 cents in the quarter a year earlier, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings. Analysts had cut their earnings forecasts last month after a warning about sales last month. 

 The company also said it expected earnings to rise by a double-digit percentage rate in 2000 when compared with analysts' forecasts for profit of $1.24 a share in 1999. 

 The results were announced after the close of New York trading. Earlier, the company's shares rose 62.5 cents, to $37.875. 

 Third-quarter net income fell to $352 million, or 32 cents a diluted share, compared with profit from operations of $353 million, or 30 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell nine-tenths of a percent, to $2.51 billion, from $2.53 billion. 

 Earnings per share rose, while profit declined, because Gillette had higher interest expenses as it bought back stock. 

 The third-quarter earnings were in line with Wall Street estimates, according to First Call.

 Gillette Warns That Sales, Earnings Will Be Sharply Lower Than Expected

 Gillette Co. expects fourth-quarter sales and earnings to fall significantly from a year earlier as the U.S. company struggles to reduce inventories. The consumer-products maker issued the warning in a conference call on Thursday. Gillette's third-quarter profit matched Wall Street earnings expectations of 32 cents (30 European cents) a share, compared with earnings of 30 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Sales came in at $2.5 billion, in line with the company's warning last month that revenue would be down about 1% from $2.53 billion a year earlier. Michael Hawley, Gillette's chief executive officer, said the effort to cut inventories, primarily overseas, will reduce sales in the fourth quarter by "a mid-single digit" on a percentage basis from a year earlier. Earnings will fall "significantly" more, in the mid to high teens, Mr. Hawley said. 

  He added that Gillette is trying to deal with all its inventory issues in the fourth quarter, meaning that sales and earnings should rise in the first quarter of 2000. Gillette cut warehouse inventories in the U.S. last year, Mr. Hawley said, but the company now wants to reduce the inventories globally. In Europe, inventories average about 12 to 13 weeks of supply, a figure Gillette wants to cut to about nine weeks, he said. (Dow Jones)

 IBM shares tumble 20 pct on  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The Y2K scare spooked investors on Thursday after International Business Machines Corp.  warned that some of its largest customers had paused to fix old equipment instead of buying new machines, sending shares of the top computer maker 20 percent lower. 

 As a group, IBM shareholders ended the day $40 billion poorer, on paper anyway, as Big Blue's stock market value fell to $162 billion from more than $200 billion in a single day. The stock fell to 91, closing down 21-3/4 from Wednesday's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of 112-3/4. 

 The share sell-off followed a profit-warning by IBM late Wednesday that its financial results would fall sharply below expectations for the next two quarters, leading two influential brokerages to downgrade their rating on the bellwether stock. 

 "Has the long-term outlook for IBM changed?" Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich asked in a note to his clients. His answer: "Probably not. We still expect IBM to be a beneficiary of the e-commerce explosion next year and beyond," he wrote. 

 Still, Milunovich cut his recommendation to investors on the stock to neutral from buy for the stort-term. 

 Market analysts said IBM's warning triggered selling in the already jittery technology sector, especially of big business software makers that feed off demand for IBM mainframes. BMC Software Inc.  lost 7-3/16 to close at 53. Computer Associates International Inc.  lost 5-7/8 to 52-5/8. 

 IBM's decline sapped 110 points from the Dow Jones industrial average, wiping away much of Wednesday's 187-point gain that had been lit by optimism in the wake of Microsoft Corp.'s  third-quarter results and bullish outlook. 

 The Dow average closed at 10297.69, off 94.67 on Thursday. Excluding IBM's effect, the index would have gained 15 points. 

 On Wednesday, IBM had posted third-quarter profits that met analysts' expectations, but revenues were soft and the company warned of sharply lower profits in the current fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2000. IBM blamed a pause in sale of new equipment to financial services and insurance customers. 

 Anticipation that IBM might sidestep Y2K threats and see a boom in corporate Internet spending had sent its shares spiraling to record levels near 140 starting six months ago, on the heels of its first-quarter earnings report. But by summer, the e-business blush began to fade as Y2K drew near. 

 Morgan Stanley cut its rating on IBM to neutral from outperform and slashed his earnings estimates for the full 1999 year to $3.54 per share from $4.01 per share previously and reduced its estimate for fiscal year 2000 to $4.53 from $4.66. 

 The analysts' profit consensus for IBM's 1999 year had been $3.91 a share and $4.52 for year 2000 heading into IBM's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday afternoon according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Bear Stearns, Salomon Smith Barney and SoundView Technology also cut their earnings estimates for the rest of 1999 and the year 2000 but left their "buy" ratings unchanged on the stock. 

 Milunovich said a clearer picture has emerged from recent earnings reports, including IBM's, that suggest a mixed picture on computer spending: The spending pause is focused among big users of old computer systems, not newer Internet machines. 

 The latter is the terrain of Sun Microsystems Inc. , Intel Corp. , Microsoft Corp.  and Dell Computer Corp. , although IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co.  and Compaq Computer Corp.  are active here too. 

 IBM has estimated that 70 percent of the world's business data is stored on its mainframes, often in big, centralized data centres. The threat of a Y2K failure on any of these systems appears to have made corporate computer buyers loathe to introduce any changes ahead of the year 2000 date change. 

 "Y2K finally got us," Salomon analyst John Jones said. "More caution is being experienced in these mainframe data centres than in departmental or PC computing" - the office systems where Microsoft, Intel, Dell and Sun predominate. 

 But Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns advised clients to keep buying IBM stock: "We think Y2K is a one-time event and fears will eventually turn out to be a buying opportunity." 

 On Wednesday, IBM Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine had signalled Wall Street analysts that fourth-quarter earnings were likely to fall 20 percent below Wall Street expectations. 

 He said IBM's profits for the first quarter of year 2000 could be flat or slightly lower than its first-quarter 1999 profit of 78 cents a share - well below the 90 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 However, he advised analysts to stand firm on their estimates for the remaining quarters of 2000, when customers should return to their normal computer buying-patterns.

 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Stocks added to their gains at midday on Friday as bargain hunters fed a broad-based rally that rewarded companies posting strong earnings. 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  was up 133 points, or 1.29 percent, to 10,431. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 36 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,838. The Standard & Poor's 500 index	  rose 17 points, or 1.40 percent, to 1,301.


 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was flat at 6.35 percent, matching a two-year high set on Oct. 22, 1997. 

 "The stock market has shown us it is not too pooped to pop," said Alan Ackerman, the senior vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock & Co. "The bargain hunters are at work." 

 Financial stocks were strong after the White House and Congress reached reached a deal on the U.S. banking reform bill, which would repeal Depression-era laws preventing banks from moving into the securities business. 

 Among the Dow component, American Express Co.  was up 4-13/16 at 149-11/16; J.P. Morgan & Co Inc.  was up 5-9/16 at 122-3/4 and Citigroup Inc.  gained 1-9/16 at 48-11/16. 


The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's banking index	  was up 3.7 percent.



Advancing stocks led decliners 1,756 to 976 on heavy volume of more than 435 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. There were 36 stocks at new highs and 140 at new lows.



The rally was broad-based with several sectors doing well, including technology, oil, transports and retail. Gold stocks, however were down slightly.



"I guess what you've got is a lot of traders getting flat before the weekend. They were coming up short, they probably were a little scared this week," Doug Myers, vice president of equity trading at Wachovia Securities in Atlanta.



International Business Machines Corp.  was retracing a small portion of the steep losses from a day before. IBM was up 1-15/16 at 92-15/16 in heavy trading after losing more than 21 points Thursday when it issued a Y2K-related profit warning.



"IBM is rallying as people realise they're still IBM and they're still going to sell stuff," Myers said of Big Blue's dominant market position.



Internet services consultant Viant Corp.  got a big boost after it reported a surprise profit. Goldman Sachs also raised its rating on the company, which was up 25 at 95-1/2. Viant was priced at 16 when its stock made its public debut in June.



The most active issue on the NYSE was the world's largest tobacco company, Philip Morris Cos. Inc.,  which along with most other tobacco stocks, was recovering from a ruling Wednesday that puts "Big Tobacco" a step closer toward owing multi-billion payouts in a class-action suit.



Philip Morris was up 1-9/16 at 25; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Co. was up 5/8 at 19-7/8; Loews Corp,  the owner of Lorillard Tobacco Co., was up 1-13/16 at 67-3/4.



Biogen Inc.  was down 8-1/16 at 64-1/2 after the company said it halted trials of a new antibody-based drug. The news also persuaded at least four analysts to cut their ratings or price targets on the drug company.



The nation's largest trash hauler, Waste Management Inc.,  was down 10 percent after it warned that its third-quarter earnings would be hurt by an accounting review. The shares were down 1-11/16 at 15-1/8.

 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of wholesale drug distributors including AmeriSource Health Corp.  and Cardinal Health Inc.  fell on Friday after AmeriSource issued a fourth quarter earnings warning. 

 While the Dow Jones Industrial average rose, AmeriSource was off 4-1/8 at 12-1/2 in afternoon trade while Cardinal fell 5-15/16 at 42-3/8. 

 After the close of trading Thursday, AmeriSource said it expected to report 1999 fourth-quarter earnings per share between $0.43 and $0.45, including a $0.03 per share charge to cover a bad debt expense. The forecast was below Wall Street expectations of $0.49, as reported to First Call/Thomson Financial before the earnings warning. 

 AmeriSource said it will report final results on Nov 3. 

 Among other drug distributors Friday, Bergen Brunswig Corp.  was up a slight 1/16 at 6-11/16 and McKesson HBOC Inc.  was off 1-6/16 at 19-9/16. A smaller drug wholesaler, D&K Healthcare Resources Inc.  fell 4-1/4 to 17. 

 AG Edwards analyst Andy Speller said the AmeriSource warning caused the selloff on Friday of that company as well as Cardinal and D&K. 

 "There's more and more bad news for this group. And the sentiment is so negative that it only takes some little thing to impact these guys," Speller said. 

 AmeriSource's earnings warning came only a week after rival Bergen sparked a selloff in its shares with a fourth-quarter earnings warning of its own. Bergen said it expected a profit of 2 to 5 cents a diluted share for the September quarter, compared with the 24 cents forecast by analysts. 

 Cardinal said the Bergen warning caused a sharp selloff of its own shares on Oct. 14, though Cardinal said it remainedcomfortable with Wall Street expectations for diluted earnings per share of $0.53 for the first-quarter and $2.53 for the 2000 fiscal year. 

 On Friday Warburg Dillon Read cut its ratings to hold from buy on Cardinal, McKesson HBOC, and D&K Healthcare. It cut price targets for Cardinal to $51 from $75 and for AmeriSource to $23 from $41.

 IBM SHOWS AGAIN THAT COMPANIES ARE THE REAL STORY: After worrying for weeks about Alan Greenspan, inflation and possible October market crashes, investors enjoyed a refreshing change of pace Thursday when shares of International Business Machines plunged. 

 How invigorating to be talking about a company instead of an abstraction. Thank you, IBM. 

 A few commentators on CNBC and elsewhere chose to spin IBM's profitwarning into a generalized screed about a Year 2000 computer debacle, one of the most bloated abstractions of the decade. 

 IBM, perhaps on purpose, opened the door to such diversion in its third-quarter earnings announcement late Wednesday by blaming its downbeat outlook for the next six months on a sales decline induced by Y2K fears. 

 In the wake of recent stock market volatility, IBM's Y2K references could have exploded a percussion bomb on the entire stock market, sort of like a speech by Alan Greenspan. It didn't happen. 

 Shares of Compaq Computer, another computer equipment maker that might have taken a hit in sympathy with the IBM slide, already are in the tank. Granted, Compaq hit a new 52-week low at $19 and closed down $1.19, but Compaq's problems are its own and hardly related to the Year 2000 rollover of calendar digits. 

 Dell Computer, another big hardware maker, slipped just 50 cents. On Tuesday, Dell warned of disappointing fourth-quarter results because of an unexpected jump in the prices of one of its critical raw materials, memory chips, a temporary supply and demand problem. 

 For many computer companies, including IBM, the Y2K scare has been a windfall, prompting individuals and companies to replace hardware and software just in case. 

 The prospect that such one-time spending would taper off as this year draws to a close should surprise no one. Nor should the likelihood that many computer systems users are reluctant to install new equipment between now and the time when the Y2K scare is officially laid to rest. 

 For the stock market at large, the IBM story resonated hardly at all. The Nasdaq composite index, dominated by computer technology stocks, closed higher. The Dow Jones industrial average would have closed higher, had IBM been excluded. 

 The day's results suggest that investor sentiment is not nearly as fragile as some commentators would have you believe. There was no rush to the exits. The price of gold fell for the fourth straight day. 

 But what about IBM? After years in exile, IBM has been welcomed back as a bellwether computer-technology company, thanks to the company's decision to diversify beyond what is now called "legacy" computer hardware and embrace the Internet. 

 Even with Thursday's drubbing, the stock has gained 28 percent in the last year, beating a 20 percent advance in the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index. 

 Of course, the outlook is fuzzy, based on a survey of comments Thursday by professional stock analysts and amateurs using the venues of investor Web sites. 

 "The Titanic is sinking; the question is what other stocks will get sucked down with her. I hope there are enough life rafts this time," remarked one contributor to investor Web site RagingBull.com. 

 Said another: "Can't wait for a chorus of downgrades. I went long today. Switched my IRA from SPY (Standard and Poor's depositary receipts) to IBM. Sold my MRK (Merck), MSFT (Microsoft), SPY (S&P 500 index) in my other account and bought IBM. This is a gift." 

 According to another investor Web site, stockwire.com, "One analyst told Stockwire that mismanagement rather than Y2K fears may be at the heart of the problem and top management will have to be replaced." 

 Not a word about Greenspan. Not a word about inflation. This is great.

 IBM's  Profit Warning  Stuns Market; Mainframe Sales Sluggish

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of International Business Machines Corp. plunged Thursday, after the computer giant stunned analysts by warning of projected shortfalls in upcoming quarters because of sluggish mainframe sales tied to worries about the year 2000 computer problem. 

 IBM (IBM) shares tumbled $15.625, or 15%, to close at $91.375 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was more than 69 million shares. IBM, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, traded as low as $89 after opening at $90.125, down 16% from Wednesday's close. Every dollar IBM's stock drops sends the Dow down five points. 

 Big Blue's mainframe computer business, which did poorly in the third quarter, will, according to executives, bear the brunt of slower demand as corporations delay buying new computer hardware and services ahead of the Y2K date change. Having spent heavily to repair software that may otherwise be unable to function after the turn of the century, many companies are said to be delaying purchases of new systems until they see whether their fixes work. 

 But as recently as a few months ago, IBM, the world's largest computer maker, had said it wasn't feeling serious Y2K effects, which lulled investors into a false sense of confidence, analysts say. IBM's results "sort of answer a lot of our questions," said Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch in New York. "There is a Y2K effect." 

 The warning came bundled with IBM's third-quarter results, which were in line with expectations. Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said net income came to $1.76 billion, or 93 cents a share on a fully diluted basis, compared with $1.49 billion, or 78 cents a diluted share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue increased 5.2% to $21.14 billion. 

 The latest results included a gain from the sale of a business, an acquisition-related charge and write downs. Excluding items, the company said it would have earned 90 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 90 cents a share. It marked the 14th straight quarter IBM has met or exceeded expectations. 

 Looking ahead, IBM Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine said earnings in the fourth quarter could come in 15 to 20 cents a share below the year-ago number of $1.24 a share. Further, he said earnings in the first quarter of next year could be flat to slightly below the 78 cents a share earned in the first quarter of 1999. 

 Maine said many IBM customers bought System 390 mainframe computers and other server computers as a way to prepare for the year 2000 deadline. But with the bulk of Y2K preparation behind them, there could be a lull in server sales that could last through the first three months of 2000. He said this issue is "unique to IBM," since "70% of the world's business data are served by IBM mainframes." 

 IBM's results highlight just how unevenly the Y2K bug is affecting technology companies, The Wall Street Journal reported. Both Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which reported ebullient earnings Tuesday, and EMC Corp. (EMC), the No. 1 high-end data-storage vendor, reported negligible Y2K effects, and IBM shares rose this week on Microsoft's news. But IBM's hardware business was walloped. 

 IBM's negative Y2K effect has a lot to do with the company's reliance on mainframe computers, which are particularly susceptible to the computer glitch, because many were built before computer makers were generally aware of the Y2K risks, the Journal reported. 

 Many mainframe customers revamped their software or bought new machines as early as last year, hoping to have the Y2K problems under control well before the looming Jan. 1 date. Getting the fixes done early was important because of the crucial sales figures and other financial data generally stored on mainframes. 

 Merrill Lynch analyst Milunovich said Thursday IBM's long-term prospects will get better if the company is successful in resolving some "competitive" issues in its hardware business. "Long term, IBM is very strong," he said. 

 Several brokerages responded to IBM's profit warning by lowering their ratings Thursday. Merrill Lynch's Steve Milunovich cut his near-term opinion to "neutral" from "buy," while Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Tom Kraemer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "outperform." Also, Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst George Elling reduced his rating to "outperform" from "buy." 

 On the heels of IBM's warning, analyst Dan Niles of Robertson Stephens Thursday forecast a bleak outlook for computer software and hardware companies, saying the Y2K effect also is impacting corporate spending on high-end computer servers and desktops. Niles told CNBC Thursday he expects PC maker Dell Computer Corp. (DELL) and computer chip provider Intel Corp. (INTC) to be the hardest hit. 

 And PaineWebber Inc. analyst Don Young downgraded Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) to "neutral" from "buy," citing concern about the Y2K effect on the the company's fiscal third quarter ending in March. 

 Young said that although Sun is the best strategically positioned server company, a buildup of Y2K testing capacity will be reabsorbed after the new year, a risk all enterprise-server vendors will face.

 Euro's Gain On No-News ECB Announcement Shows Market Bias

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The euro's quick upward bounce shortly after the European Central Bank announced no change in interest rates provides compelling evidence of how strongly positioned the market is toward a higher euro. 

 Here was a widely expected piece of news - the market had anticipated the ECB would stand pat - and one that had no inherently euro-supportive elements. Yet, the market took the news as a signal to buy. 

 That, traders say, is because an initial reaction to sell the euro from a minority who expected the ECB to raise rates simply cheapened the currency enough to bring new buyers into the market. 

 "That knee-jerk reaction provided opportunity to buy for people who wanted to be long," said John Cholakis, foreign currency dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo bank in New York. 

 The prevailing market view is that the ECB will raise rates in the near future, regardless of their inaction Thursday. So, with a U.S. stock market decline adding another dollar-negative factor, the immediate and short-lived post-announcement dip seemed simply to invigorate a market that is singularly focused on a stronger euro. 

 European rates are inevitably going higher, analysts say, while the dollar is at risk of a flight from dollar-based assets. The combination of these two factors is overwhelmingly euro-supportive, they say. 

 Thursday's price action brought this into perspective. When the ECB announced that it would keep its 2.50% securities repurchase rate unchanged, the euro quickly dropped to about $1.0759. Five minutes later, it was back at its pre-announcement level of around $1.0790 and, not longer after that, it broke above $1.8000. 

 At 1528 GMT, the euro was trading around $1.0808, up from $1.0742 late Wednesday in New York but still lower than Wednesday's high of $1.0839. 

 The euro's move Thursday signals that the market is still positioned toward a European rate hike in the short term, and that it remains bullish on the euro for this reason, said Stephen Jonathon director of the foreign exchange desk at Merrill Lynch in New York. 

 "It was the classic response of a market that's expecting a rate hike: It's not a matter or if, it's a matter of when," he said. 

 In fact, as ECB President Wim Duisenberg said at a press conference two weeks ago the ECB was prepared to tighten policy as soon as it gets more signs of a strengthening economy. Economists and traders are now looking ahead to the next council meeting on Nov. 4 for an expected increase. 

 "From a trader's perspective, the market is definitely biased toward a stronger euro outlook," said Nathaniel Litwak, chief trader at Credit Agricole, Indosuez. 

 That's why the upward trend of the European currency is not endangered in the short term, he said. 

 "Structurally, nobody is going to get out of euros until they see negative economic numbers coming out of Europe," Litwak said. 

 Though this still remains a realistic possibility, it "might take several weeks to happen," he added. 


Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market's jitters continues to add support to
the euro. At 1529GMT Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down
1.4% in response to an unexpected profit warning from International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM) late Wednesday.

 Neon Reports Spiraling Losses, Unexpected Acquisition Costs >BY Stephen Phillips.

 Applications integration software vendor, New Era of Networks Inc posted widening losses for its third quarter, yesterday, on revenue flat to the previous quarter, excluding sales inherited from acquisitions. The results excluded third-quarter earnings from Neon's reseller partnership with IBM Corp, which accounts for approximately 11% of revenue. But they did include a proportion (less than 50%) of second-quarter earnings from the partnership. 

 The Englewood, Colorado-based firm reported a $34.94m net loss, equivalent to 17 cents a share, excluding acquisition costs, for the three months to September 30, compared to a $11.66m loss in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had tipped the firm to turn an 18 cents a share loss for the quarter according to a  poll conducted by First Call. Revenue for the third quarter stood at $31.87m up 82% on the corresponding period last year but the firm said $5m of sales had come from enterprise application integration software vendors, Microscript Inc and Convoy Corp, which it acquired during the quarter. 

 Net losses do not include higher-than-expected restructuring costs racked up in assimilating the new acquisitions, and the payment of more cash than originally bargained for to close the acquisitions. These additional considerations added total one- time costs of $32m and the firm also laid out $7m in acquisition- related amortization. 

 Restructuring costs spiraled from the $3m-$5m projected in a recent filing lodged with the Securities and Exchanges Commission, to $7m due to rent costs on a higher-than-expected number of duplicate operations arising from the acquisitions the firm said yesterday. The restructuring which also includes the axing of 125 employees, or 12% of the workforce, will cut 15% from operating expenses, Neon said. 

 The firm also said it had set aside additional payments of $25m for the shareholders of Microscript and Convoy. The firm had previously priced the deals at $34m in cash and stock for Microscript, and $42m in stock for Convoy. 

 Neon discounted third-quarter earnings from its reseller partnership with IBM under a ruling handed down by Big Blue that it observe a one-quarter lag in recording the revenue after it booked second-quarter revenue from the partnership too hastily and was forced to issue a profit warning in July. Neon said it earned about $3.6m from the partnership for the second quarter, based on receiving a 30% royalty on IBM's sales of its products. It said it expected third-quarter earnings from this source to be booked in the fourth quarter, to outstrip second-quarter earnings. 

 The firm trumpeted more than 90 new customers for the quarter for its business management software which links incompatible databases and operating systems. Chief executive officer, Rick Adam, said Neon expects sales of its recently-launched E-Business Integrator-branded software, which links back-office transaction systems to web-based front-end systems, to drive earnings for the fourth quarter.

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The Y2K scare spooked investors on Thursday after International Business Machines Corp. warned that some of its largest customers had paused to fix old equipment instead of buying new machines, sending shares of the top computer maker 20 percent lower. 

 As a group, IBM shareholders ended the day $40 billion poorer, on paper anyway, as Big Blue's stock market value fell to $162 billion from more than $200 billion in a single day. The stock fell to 91, closing down 21-3/4 from Wednesday's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of 112-3/4. 

 The share sell-off followed a profit-warning by IBM late Wednesday that its financial results would fall sharply below expectations for the next two quarters, leading two influential brokerages to downgrade their rating on the bellwether stock. 

 "Has the long-term outlook for IBM changed?" Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich asked in a note to his clients. His answer: "Probably not. We still expect IBM to be a beneficiary of the e-commerce explosion next year and beyond," he wrote. 

 Still, Milunovich cut his recommendation to investors on the stock to neutral from buy for the stort-term. 

 Market analysts said IBM's warning triggered selling in the already jittery technology sector, especially of big business software makers that feed off demand for IBM mainframes. BMC Software Inc. lost 7-3/16 to close at 53. Computer Associates International Inc. lost 5-7/8 to 52-5/8. 

 IBM's decline sapped 110 points from the Dow Jones industrial average, wiping away much of Wednesday's 187-point gain that had been lit by optimism in the wake of Microsoft Corp.'s third-quarter results and bullish outlook. 

 The Dow average closed at 10297.69, off 94.67 on Thursday. Excluding IBM's effect, the index would have gained 15 points. 

 On Wednesday, IBM had posted third-quarter profits that met analysts' expectations, but revenues were soft and the company warned of sharply lower profits in the current fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2000. IBM blamed a pause in sale of new equipment to financial services and insurance customers. 

 Anticipation that IBM might sidestep Y2K threats and see a boom in corporate Internet spending had sent its shares spiraling to record levels near 140 starting six months ago, on the heels of its first-quarter earnings report. But by summer, the e-business blush began to fade as Y2K drew near. 

 Morgan Stanley cut its rating on IBM to neutral from outperform and slashed his earnings estimates for the full 1999 year to $3.54 per share from $4.01 per share previously and reduced its estimate for fiscal year 2000 to $4.53 from $4.66. 

 The analysts' profit consensus for IBM's 1999 year had been $3.91 a share and $4.52 for year 2000 heading into IBM's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday afternoon according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Bear Stearns, Salomon Smith Barney and SoundView Technology also cut their earnings estimates for the rest of 1999 and the year 2000 but left their "buy" ratings unchanged on the stock. 

 Milunovich said a clearer picture has emerged from recent earnings reports, including IBM's, that suggest a mixed picture on computer spending: The spending pause is focused among big users of old computer systems, not newer Internet machines. 

 The latter is the terrain of Sun Microsystems Inc., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Dell Computer Corp., although IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. are active here too. 

 IBM has estimated that 70 percent of the world's business data is stored on its mainframes, often in big, centralized data centres. The threat of a Y2K failure on any of these systems appears to have made corporate computer buyers loathe to introduce any changes ahead of the year 2000 date change. 

 "Y2K finally got us," Salomon analyst John Jones said. "More caution is being experienced in these mainframe data centres than in departmental or PC computing" - the office systems where Microsoft, Intel, Dell and Sun predominate. 

 But Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns advised clients to keep buying IBM stock: "We think Y2K is a one-time event and fears will eventually turn out to be a buying opportunity." 

 On Wednesday, IBM Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine had signalled Wall Street analysts that fourth-quarter earnings were likely to fall 20 percent below Wall Street expectations. 

 He said IBM's profits for the first quarter of year 2000 could be flat or slightly lower than its first-quarter 1999 profit of 78 cents a share - well below the 90 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 However, he advised analysts to stand firm on their estimates for the remaining quarters of 2000, when customers should return to their normal computer buying-patterns.

 LOS ANGELES, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Mattel Inc., the world's largest toymaker, reported disappointing third-quarter results on Thursday, with earnings dragged down by a $105 million loss at its educational software division. 

 Earnings were $135.3 million, or 32 cents per diluted share, compared with the year-earlier $233.8 million, or 54 cents per share, before after-tax charges of $65.1 million in the 1998 quarter. 

 The earnings per share surpassed Wall Street expectations of 31 cents, but analysts cut their earnings estimates sharply after an Oct. 4 profit warning from the company. Before the warning, the consensus forecast was 67 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Mattel said the educational software division, Learning Co., had been expected to contribute a profit of $50 million in the quarter. 

 Jill Barad, Mattel's embattled chairman and chief executive, said the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars had lowered its full-year 1999 earnings forecast to a range of 70 to 80 cents per share. The consensus Wall Street estimate is 95 cents. 

 Significant contributors to the third-quarter earnings shortfall were distributor and retailer returns and allowances of $58 million, stemming in large part from the merger of Mattel and Learning Co. Mattel also cited increased bad-debt reserves of $56 million, primarily involving one major distributor, and the decision not to complete a significant Learning Co. licensing agreement that had been budgeted since June to produce $60 million in earnings. 

 "While we are most disappointed in developments at The Learning Co. and by continuing difficulties in international markets, we are encouraged by U.S. sales increases in the quarter for our core Barbie, Fisher-Price, Wheels and American Girl brands," said Barad. 

 Sales for the third quarter were $1.83 billion, compared with $1.88 billion a year earlier. 

 Mattel shares were slightly higher in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, up 1/4 at 13-5/8. ((-New York Equities Desk 212-859-1700)).

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares of International Business Machines Corp. fell 20 percent on Thursday after the world's largest computer maker stunned Wall Street with a profit warning and two influential brokerages downgraded the stock. 

 The stock opened at 90-1/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 22-5/8 from Wednesday's regular session closing price of 112-3/4. Market analysts said IBM's warning would likely reignite selling in the already jittery technology sector. 

 The stock swoon led a 175-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average, wiping out Wednesday's 187 point gain, which had been fuelled by optimism in the wake of Microsoft Corp.'s third-quarter results and the software giant's bullish outlook. 

 Late Wednesday, IBM reported third-quarter profits that matched analysts' expectations, but revenues were soft and the company warned of sharply lower profits in the current fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2000. The company blamed a slowdown in spending on new equipment by its big customers. 

 Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich cut his rating on IBM to short-term neutral from his prior rating of short-term buy. He left his long-term rating unchanged at buy and made no mention of changes to his earnings estimates on the company. 

 "Has the long-term outlook for IBM changed?" Milunovich asked in a note to clients. His answer: "Probably not. We still expect IBM to be a beneficiary of the e-commerce explosion next year and beyond." 

 Morgan Stanley cut its rating on IBM to neutral from outperform and slashed his earnings estimates for the full 1999 year to $3.54 per share from $4.01 per share previously and reduced its estimate for fiscal year 2000 to $4.53 from $4.66. 

 The analysts' profit consensus for IBM's 1999 year had been $3.91 a share and $4.52 for year 2000 heading into IBM's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday afternoon according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Morgan analyst Tom Kraemer was not available to comment. 

 Milunovich said a clearer picture has emerged from recent earnings reports, including IBM's, that suggests any slowdown in computer spending as customers fix older systems for potential Year 2000 software glitches appears concentrated on mainframe and minicomputer systems where IBM is concentrated. 

 However, he said that newer computer systems running Unix or the latest Internet-based software are in less danger of the kind of earnings let-down seen Wednesday from IBM. "Unix and Internet-driven applications are less affected," he said. 

 This is the terrain where Sun Microsystems Inc., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Dell Computer Corp. are focused, although IBM, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp. are active here too. 

 After the IBM report, IBM Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told analysts in a conference call that fourth-quarter 1999 earnings per share could be 15 cents to 20 cents below the $1.24 per share reported in the last quarter of 1998. 

 That would put profits at between $1.04 and $1.09 a share - 20 percent below the $1.33 consensus Wall Street analysts had forecast before his comments, according to First Call. 

 He said IBM's profits for the first quarter of year 2000 could be flat or slightly lower than its first-quarter 1999 profit of 78 cents a share - well below the 90 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. However, he advised analysts to stand firm on their estimates for the remaining quarters of 2000, when customers should return to their normal buying patterns.

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - European telecommunications ADRs, or American Depositary Receipts, rose Thursday after Mannesmann AG bid $33 billion for Orange Plc, brushing off a general market decline on the back of an earnings warning by IBM Corp. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial average was down 174 points at 10,257 in early afternoon trading after the world's largest computer maker issued a profit warning and influential Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock. 

 "Nokia wasn't doing much this morning, but now it's up on good numbers and some of the others are back ...," said one ADR traders. "IBM looks bad. It's not its week, but it doesn't have much impact on telecom issues." 

 Nokia Corp. rose 5-1/4 to 101 in a late spurt afterit posted a 36 percent rise in third quarter profits to a record 937 million euros. 

 Salomon Smith Barney said in a research note that the quarter was characterised by a positive operating margin surprise and a top line surprise to create another blow out quarter for the Finnish firm. The investment firm continues to recommend Nokia with a buy rating. 

 Orange Plc ADRs rose 5-1/8 to 120-3/4. British Telecommunications ADRs gained 9-3/16 to 173-3/4. Vodafone Airtouch's ended its recent losses and the ADR gained 2-3/4 to 45-1/2. 

 However, Baan Co. NV fared less well as its ADRs dipped 2-3/16 to 11-15/16. The Dutch business software firm posted a larger-than-expected third quarter loss as new software sales dropped sharply. 

 Many suppliers of enterprise resource planning software have been suffering as companies delay new software pruchases until the millennium date problem has been solved.

 CHICAGO, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Weak U.S. stocks propelled IMM currency futures higher Thursday, and most contracts ended a day of quiet trade near their session highs. 

 A surprise profit warning from International Business Machines Corp. late Wednesday sent stocks tumbling, and currency futures surged in reaction to the decline. 

 However, U.S. stocks pared losses into afternoon trade and capped IMM currencies' upside potential, one trader on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said. 

 "It (the Dow Jones Industrial Average) hasn't really degenerated further where you can say, 'Let's go hit some more highs for the day in the currencies,'" the trader said shortly before the close. "(The Dow is) still down enough where the dollar can't rebound either. You've got everything sitting where it's at kind of in a holding pattern." 

 Euro futures recovered from overnight losses on the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. However, the Bank's inaction did "not have that much impact on the euro," said Allison Montgomery, currency economist at IDEAglobal.com. Rather, it was the expectation that the Bank will raise rates in November that buoyed the currency. 

 In a Reuters poll, 20 of 38 economists expected the ECB to raise rates before the end of the year. 

 December euros pierced resistance at $1.08450 and seesawed, ending above that level. Further resistance at $1.08730 remained untouched. 

 December sterling set a new contract high of $1.6798 before trimming gains. The contract got a boost from data showing economic growth in Britain and from German telecom and engineering group Mannesmann AG's $33 billion offer to buy British mobile phone company Orange, traders said. 

 Expectations that third quarter British gross domestic product data will show further growth also lifted sterling, Montgomery said. 

 December yen remained in a range for most of the session. The contract broke above resistance at $0.009509, the 18-day moving average, but did not pierce resistance at $0.009550. 

 At settlement, December yen was up $0.000052 at $0.009518, euros up $0.00760 at $1.08590, Swiss francs up $0.0049 at $0.6835, sterling up $0.0136 at $1.6770, Canadian dollars up $0.0026 at $0.6756, Australian dollars up $0.0015 at $0.6484 and Mexican pesos down $0.000025 at $0.101225.

 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares in software supplier Misys Plc dropped on Thursday as a profit warning from IBM  late on Wednesday put the skids under IT and computer stocks, dealers said. 

 Misys stock fell 37p or 7.3 percent to 468p by 1200 GMT in volume of around 1.3 million shares. 

 Other decliners in the IT sectors included Sage Group , down 4.3 percent, Filtronic , off 4.2 percent, and CMG  which shed 4.1 percent. 

 IBM on Wednesday posted mixed third-quarter results, pressured by slower spending as big customers fix older equipment ahead of Year 2000, and warned of sharply lower-than-expected earnings into early next year. 

 Some analysts said Misys shares were likely to remain volatile at least until the company reports half year results early next year. 

 "I don't see that there is any particular reason why some of the problems affecting other software companies, for example the Y2K factor, will not affect Misys as well," said one. 

 Merrill Lynch earlier in the month cut its earnings estimates for the group and warned of further downside risk to estimates and the shares on a three-to-six month view. 

 The investment bank drew attention to worsening trading conditions in the banking and securities division which was being hit by a pre-millennium freeze on the implementation of new systems. 

 Merrill rated the stock as intermediate-term "neutral" and long-term "accumulate".

 LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines Corp fell 11 percent in active London trade on Thursday, after the computer giant issued a profit warning after the U.S. market close, dealers said. 

 In London, IBM was trading on the Instinet electronic system at $100-3/8, down $12-3/8 from the regular session close in New York, but slightly above the low of $99 hit in after-hours trading. 

 Instinet said 100,000 IBM shares had been traded by 0830 GMT. "That is a lot at this time of the day," said one delaer. 

 Losses in the Dow Jones heavyweight stock were expected to knock the benchmark index sharply down at the open. 

 "A 12-dollar decline in IBM is 65 points off the Dow," noted one dealer. 

 The Globex S&P December future contract dropped 7.4 points to 1,285.30, with fair value estimated at around 1,299 - indicating early losses of more than 100 points for the Dow. 

 IBM on Wednesday posted mixed third-quarter results, pressured by slower spending as big customers fix older equipment ahead of Year 2000, and warned of sharply lower-than-expected earnings into early next year. 

 The warning came as an even greater disappointment because stronger-than-expected results from industry bellwether Microsoft Corp.  on Tuesday had set an upbeat tone for the sector. 

 Commenting on its results, Microsoft cited an "awesome" demand for personal computers. 

 Elsewhere, cigarette maker Philip Morris  steadied around its closing level of $27 in New York, where it lost $3-15/16 after a Florida court refused to shelter tobacco companies from punitive damages in a landmark class action suit. 

 After rebounding from six-month closing lows set last week, the Dow looked set to drift lower in the next few days, strategists said. 

 "The IBM news was disappointing and with no more major economic data due this week, I think we'll see a bit of weakness" said HSBC Securities global strategist Richard Batty. 

 He said the next key item of data for market sentiment was the employment cost index next Thursday. 

 Meanwhile, market participants had another batch of corporate results coming up. Companies due to report later in the day included Coca Cola and Gillette .

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares of International Business Machines Corp.  on Thursday were poised to open sharply lower after the world's largest computer maker issued a profit warning and two influential Wall Street analysts downgraded the stock. 

 The stock was indicated to open between $88 per share to $91, down from Wednesday's regular session closing price of 112-3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Market analysts said IBM's warning would likely reignite selling in the already jittery tech sector. 

 Late Wednedsday, IBM reported third-quarter profits that matched analysts' expectations, but revenues were soft and the company warned of sharply lower profits in the current fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2000 due to a slowdown in spending on new equipment by its big customers. 

 Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich cut his rating on IBM to short-term neutral from his prior rating of short-term buy. He left his long-term rating unchanged at buy and made no mention of changes to his earnings estimates on the company. 

 Morgan Stanley cut its rating on IBM to netural from outperform and slashed his earnings estimates for the full 1999 year to $3.54 per share from $4.01 per share previously and reduced its estimate for fiscal year 2000 to $4.53 from $4.66. 

 The analysts' profit consensus for IBM's 1999 year had been $3.91 a share and $4.52 for year 2000 heading into IBM's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday afternoon according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.

 NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Shares of wireless data services provider Aether Systems Inc.  nearly tripled Thursday in its debut following its $16 a share initial public offering amid the enthusiasm for wireless data companies. 

 "Wireless data services-that is the buzzword for telecom. All the smart money, big money and well-heeled money. They are looking to make a head-first dive right into this," said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial Network about the interest. 

 Shares of the Owing Mills, Md.-based firm were last up 29 at 45 on the Nasdaq with 5.7 million shares trading hands. Its shares shook off the decline in the overall market, which was rattled by IBM Corp.'s  profit warning. 

 Aether's initial focus is the financial services industry. It provides real-time data services like price quotes and news to systems such as Reuters MarketClip Holdings Sarl, a unit of news and information company Reuters Group Plc . 

 The wireless data services firm raised $96 million through its offering of 6 million shares, or a 23 percent stake in the company. The deal, which was led by Merrill Lynch, was priced above its expected price range of $13-15. 

 Competitors include Bell Atlantic Mobile, AT&T Wireless , Microsoft Corp. and IBM Corp. 

 Some industry watchers had expected good things for the company, but were surprised at the aftermarket jump. 

 "I expected good things, but didnt expect this especially on a day like this. It's a segmented market," said Irv DeGraw, research director at WorldFinanceNet.com, referring to Aether's performance despite the impact of IBM's warning. "People who are doing IPOs are not the people doing blue-chips. For the right kind of IPO, they are out there regardless of the market."

Blue chips rise, but tech stocks dip

NEW YORK - Blue-chip stocks rose Tuesday after a report of moderate inflation calmed investors' fears of higher interest rates, but their renewed optimism failed to lift technology stocks, which slumped following a profit warning from Dell.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.65 to close at 10,204.93, extending its gain of 96.57 on Monday. The index fell back from an earlier gain of 219 points.

Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 7.19 to 1,261.32, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index fell 0.97 to 2,688.18.

Stocks initially soared after the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index, the government's most closely watched inflation gauge, jumped 0.4 percent in September. That was the biggest increase in five months but in line with Wall Street expectations.

A persistent fear that inflation is accelerating has sent stocks plunging in recent weeks, driving the Dow 10.7 percent below its Aug. 25 record close. Investors fear rising inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the third time this year in a bid to slow economic growth.

While the report is unlikely to prevent the Fed from raising rates, analysts were heartened by components of the report that suggested inflation remains under control. Outside of the volatile food and energy sectors, prices were up 0.3 percent, leaving the so-called core rate of inflation rising at a much more moderate 1.9 percent so far this year.

"The stock market was looking for any piece of good news," said Robert B. MacIntosh, vice president and portfolio manager at Eaton Vance Management in Boston. "Having a number today that was in line with estimates was a major relief."

The market was also reassured by a Commerce Department report that showed construction of new homes and apartments fell by 3.2 percent in September, the second straight monthly decline. Analysts said rising mortgage rates and Hurricane Floyd slowed building.

Bank and financial stocks benefited from the improved outlook for interest rates. The financial and drug sectors also attracted investors in search of bargains, said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott & Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va.

"What you're seeing is a rebound in some of the stocks that have beaten down quite a bit," he said. "There's some substance to it, but maybe less than meets the eye."

Technology stocks lagged the broader market. Dell fell $2.813 to $38.50 after saying late Monday a surge in the price of computer memory chips will likely hurt its third-quarter earnings.

The warning from Dell, the nation's largest direct seller of computers, fostered fears that many computer makers will face similar troubles. Dickson said Dell's warning, coupled with fears that computer sales may slow leading up to the year 2000, rattled the sector.

"These stocks have priced in a lot of really good times," he said. "Now there are some worries being voiced, and they have to slip back."

On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin. NYSE volume totaled 900.04 million shares, compared with 798.13 million Monday.

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent. Germany's DAX index rose 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 2.1 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 2.1 percent higher.

Tuesday marked the 12th anniversary of the 1987 market crash, when the Dow plunged 508 points to 1,738.74. The loss of 22.6 percent still ranks as the Dow's worst percentage loss.

The price of the 30-year treasury bond fell 14/32 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield rose to 6.35 percent from Monday's 6.32 percent. The jump represented the high mark for the yield since hitting 6.42 percent on Oct. 22, 1997.

On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 8-to-7. Composite volume totaled 1.09 billion shares, compared with 986.29 million Monday.

Tuesday marked the 12th anniversary of the 1987 market crash, when the Dow plunged 508.00 points to 1,738.74. The loss of 22.6 percent still ranks as the Dow's worst percentage loss.

In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.28 yen, up from 105.08 late Monday; and at 9.65 pesos, down from 9.74. The peso's value rose to 10.3627 cents from 10.2669. The euro fell against the dollar, dropping to $1.0838 from $1.0842.

        For the second-straight session, earnings cynicism sent several
technology stocks into negative territory, with chipmakers suffering the
most severe losses.
        Computer giant Dell Computer Corp. (DELL) dropped 2 13/16, or 6.8%,
following the company's warning late Monday that higher prices for memory
chips would eat into its profit margins in the third quarter.  Tom Meredith,
Dell's chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts late Monday that
"a surprising spike in DRAM price will hurt us in the third quarter."  Dell
officials said the latest memory chip prices were as much as 25% higher than
before.  That could add as much as $75 to the price of a PC, they said.
        Sending shock waves to the semiconductor sector, Dell said that it
plans to reduce the amount of memory it uses in its personal computers to
offset the higher chip prices.  In response, shares of Micron Technology
Inc. (MU) dove 6 1/2, or 9.5%, to finish at 61 3/4.  Following suit,
National Semiconductor Corp. (NSM) fell 2 7/8, or 10.3%, to finish at 25
even.  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN), which beat third-quarter earnings
estimates, fell victim to the trend, sinking 4 15/16, or 5.8%, to finish at
79 1/2.  Also taking a hit, Intel Corp. (INTC) fell back 4 1/4, or 6.1%, to
close at 65 1/8.  In the end, the FFBN Semiconductor Index lost 4.44%.
        After topping analysts' third-quarter earnings estimates, Texas
Instruments Inc. (TXN) dropped 5 3/16, or 6.1%, to 79 1/4.  In an interview
with Dow Jones Newswires, the company's CFO, Bill Aylesworth, said that the
strong communications market is driving sales of TI's DSP and analog chips.
However, Aylesworth said, DSP sales in two other markets, the modem market
and the disk drive industry, continued to be slow.
        Elsewhere, America Online Inc. (AOL) shot up 5 1/8, or 4.7%, to 115
1/4, after it was reported that the Internet service provider is expected to
beat analysts' expectations for its first fiscal quarter.  AOL is expected
to report earnings of 13 cents per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up
from 5 cents per share a year ago, according to a First Call/Thomson
Financial survey of analysts.  The company is scheduled to release results
today after the markets close.
        Verio Inc. (VRIO) turned in a solid performance, vaulting 2 15/16,
or 10.5%, to finish at 31 even.  BroadVision Inc. (BVSN) rallied ahead 5
5/8, or 3.7%, to close at 158.  After markets closed yesterday, the company
posted a third- quarter net income of $4.5 million, or 5 cents per share, up
from $1.8 million, or 2 cents per share, in last year's third quarter.  All
told the FFBN Internet Index gained 3.51%.
        Lexmark International Group Inc. (LXK) managed to recover some of
the ground lost a day earlier, when the company warned that fourth-quarter
results may miss estimates.  Following a ratings upgrade from Merrill Lynch
& Co., Lexmark shares regained  7 3/16, or 11.1%, to close at 72 3/16.  As a
result, our peripheral index advanced 4.69% on the day.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 88.65, or 0.88%, to close at
10204.93.  The Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 0.97 points, or 0.04%, to end
at 2688.18, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index stepped up 7.16 to
1261.32.

KEYWORD-HIT. Dow rises on heels of inflation report

NEW YORK -- Blue-chip stocks rose Tuesday after a report of moderate inflation calmed investors' fears of higher interest rates, but their renewed optimism failed to lift technology stocks, which slumped following a profit warning from Dell.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.65 to close at 10,204.93, extending its gain of 96.57 on Monday. Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 7.19 to 1,261.32, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index fell 0.97 to 2,688.18. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-7 margin. Composite volume totaled 1.09 billion shares, compared with 986.29 million Monday.

The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.03 to 410.93. Tuesday marked the 12th anniversary of the 1987 market crash, when the Dow plunged 508.00 points to 1,738.74. The loss of 22.6 percent still ranks as the Dow's worst percentage loss. Consumer prices jump 0.4 percent WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Consumer prices jumped 0.4 percent, the biggest increase in five months, as energy and tobacco costs rose sharply. But outside of a few troublesome areas, prices remained generally well-behaved in September, the government reported Tuesday, helping spur a relief rally on Wall Street.

The Labor Department said September's increase in the Consumer Price Index was the biggest price surge since a 0.7 percent rise in April. But much of the increase reflected rising energy prices and another big jump in tobacco prices pushed through to pay for court settlements.

Excluding energy and food, the core rate of inflation is up just 2 percent over the past 12 months, which Clinton administration chief economist Martin Baily noted is the best showing in more than three decades. IBM pulling PCs from retail stores NEW YORK -- IBM, whose name has been synonymous with personal computers for two decades, said Tuesday it is pulling its money-losing line of PCs from retail stores in the United States and will sell them exclusively over the Internet in a drastic move to cut costs.

Aptiva PCs will disappear from shelves starting Jan. 1. IBM's ThinkPad laptops, which are profitable, will continue to be available in stores.

The retreat underscores the enormous pressure facing the nation's third-largest PC maker. IBM's Personal Systems Group, which sells PCs to both consumers and businesses, lost about $150 million in the second quarter and nearly $1 billion last year.

 FOCUS-Allstate profits battered by Hurricane Floyd.

 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. auto and home insurer Allstate Corp. said on Wednesday its third-quarter earnings fell sharply amid losses from Hurricane Floyd, increased reserves for old asbestos and environment claims and sinking premium rates. 

 The company reported operating income of $401 million, or 51 cents per diluted share, down from $625 million, or 76 cents per share in the comparable quarter a year ago. 

 Earnings met the consensus estimate of 51 cents per share of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial, who cut their earlier estimate of 78 cents after Allstate issued a profit warning in late September. 

 Allstate said total revenue rose slightly to $6.55 billion in the third quarter from $6.44 billion a year earlier, but net income fell to $490 million, or 62 cents per diluted share, from $713 million, or 86 cents per share last year. 

 Allstate shares were up 1/2 early in the afternoon, at 24-1/8. 

 Alain Karaoglan, insurance analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the results held no real surprises after Allstate's warning in September. But he said he was disappointed Allstate made no announcement it would try to raise premium rates as other insurers have done this quarter. 

 In a conference call, Allstate Chief Financial Officer John Carl said the company did not plan to let low premiums stop its underwriting business or cut its market share, second only to State Farm at about 6 percent of the U.S. property casualty market. 

 The company said earnings suffered because Hurricane Floyd pushed third-quarter pretax catastrophe losses up to $265 million from $192 million in the year-ago quarter. Karaoglan said this did not mean catastrophe claims for the whole year would exceed Allstate's normal level. 

 In its core auto business, Allstate said its base standard auto insurance rates declined by an average three percentage points in in the quarter, amid more frequent auto claims. 

 It reported a $74 million charge for strengthening reserves on discontinued asbestos and environmental reinsurance. This helped push property and casualty operating income down to $302 million from $535 million in the year-ago quarter, even though overall premiums rose to $5.16 billion from $5.07 billion. 

 Allstate's said it had a pure underwriting loss in the third quarter as measured by a rise of almost eight points in its property and casualty combined ratio to 101.6 from 94 a year earlier. The combined ratio for the first nine months of 1999 rose to 96.4 from 93.3 a year earlier. 

 Allstate's life and savings business fared better, with operating income edging up to $103 million from $100 million last year. Total statutory premiums and deposits rose to $2.28 billion in the third quarter from $1.43 billion last year. 

 Allstate's chairman Edward Liddy said he was disappointed with the results, but said recent moves would help propel growth in the future. He pointed to the company's variable annuity cross-selling alliance with Putnam Investments, the $1.2 billion acquisition of CNA's personal lines business in June, and the expected closing of Allstate's $1.1 billion acquisition of life insurer American Heritage Life. 

 Liddy said Allstate was reviewing ways to improve its strategic and competitive position, and would announce the results of a review of its core business in the fourth quarter. 

 Analysts said the company might incur charges in the fourth quarter for an Internet-based policy-selling initiative. Allstate already has direct selling operations in Germany and Japan, and Carl said the company plans to start an operation in Italy next year. 

 Allstate also said it repurchased 32.7 million shares for $1.11 billion in the third quarter, partly to finance the acquisition of American Heritage.

 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. insurer Allstate Corp. reported a sharp drop in third quarter earnings on Wednesday, citing losses from Hurricane Floyd, increased reserves for old asbestos-related claims and low premium rates in its core auto and home insurance business. 

 The company reported operating income of $401 million, or 51 cents per diluted share, down from $625 million, or 76 cents per share in the comparable quarter a year ago. 

 Earnings met analysts' consensus estimate of 51 cents per share, cut in late September after Allstate warned it expected a decline in profit. Before that warning, analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had a consensus estimate of 78 cents per share. 

 Allstate said total revenue for the quarter was up slightly to $6.55 billion from $6.44 billion in the year ago quarter, but net income for the quarter was down to $490 million, or 62 cents per diluted share, from $713 million, or 86 cents per share, last year. 

 Allstate shares added 9/16 in early trade to 24-3/16. 

 The company said third quarter pretax catastrophe losses, pushed up by Hurricane Floyd, rose sharply to $265 million from $192 million in the year-ago quarter. 

 The catastrophe losses, along with low rates, a higher frequency of auto claims, and additional reserve strengthening for asbestos-related losses, cut Allstate's core property and liability operating income to $302 million from $535 million in the year-ago quarter, despite a rise in premiums to $5.56 billion from $5.44 billion. 

 Allstate's life and savings business fared better, with operating income up slightly to $103 million from $100 million last year, on total statutory premiums and deposits in the third quarter of $2.28 billion, up from $1.43 billion in the third quarter last year. 

 Allstate's chairman Edward Liddy said he was disappointed with the results, but said the company's strategic growth initiatives - including its alliance with Putnam Investments, the recent acquisition of CNA's  personal lines business, and the expected closing of Allstate's acquisition of American Heritage Life - would help the company toward future growth. 

 Liddy said in a statement that the company was reviewing ways to improve Allstate's overall strategic and competitive position, and said the results of a review of its core business, started last month, would be announced in the fourth quarter.

 Medialink Shares Plummet On 3rd-Quarter Earnings Warning, Downgrade

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of broadcast-media public relations company Medialink Worldwide Inc. plummeted to a new 52-week low Tuesday after the company's third-quarter profit warning and an analyst's downgrade worried investors. 

 In late afternoon trading Tuesday, Nasdaq-traded shares of Medialink (MDLK) were down $3.938, or 44%, at $4.938. Volume was heavy at 1.7 million, compared with average daily volume of 20,756 shares. 

 During the day, the stock traded as low as $4.719. The previous 52-week low was $8.375, set March 16. 

 After the closing bell Monday, the New York-based video and audio press-release distributor said it expects to earn 1 cent a share for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, less than its year-earlier 13 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for third-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share. 

 Medialink attributed the shortfall to "disappointing" results at its London-based international unit and development costs for the Newstream.com Internet venture, set to launch at the end of October. 

 Last year, Medialink acquired two U.K. concerns - corporate-video producer London Bureau and public-relations photography agency Eye Catchers Press - for a total that may exceed $8.2 million in cash and stock. 

 Although he warned of "disappointing" results for the third quarter, Medialink Worldwide's chairman, chief executive and president, Laurence Moskowitz said Medialink didn't recognize a conflicting sales approach between the New York and the London operations - which led to a slowdown during July and August - until it was too late. Medialink subsequently began building the London sales force and made structural changes in terms of compensation, training, and accounting. 

 Medialink said it expects to report improved fourth-quarter results of 7 cents a share to 9 cents a share, and fourth-quarter revenue 15% higher than third-quarter revenue. The company projects fiscal-year 2000 revenue to rise 20% from 1999, and fiscal 2000 earnings 25% above 1999's figures. 

 But First Union Securities analyst Bennett Notman told Dow Jones Newswires that not only does the third-quarter outlook fall short of expectations, but so does the company's fourth-quarter guidance. "You can assume the fiscal year 2000 numbers are below (expectations) as well." 

 Because of Medialink's depressed earnings forecast, First Union's Notman downgraded his rating to "hold" from "buy." 

 Notman reduced his rating because this is the second quarter in a row Medialink has experienced "sluggish results in its core business. Until that turns around, we are cautious." 

 However, Notman believes Medialink has "some pretty good things to offer" and can boast of a "leadership presence in its market." 

 He thinks the Newstream.com venture could empower the company with stronger results because the company will be able to take advantage of its expertise and extend it to the Internet forum. 

 Notman sees the Internet portal making a "small contribution, maybe a couple of million next year, but down the road, it could be a very significant contributor."

 Profit Dip, Bleak Outlook Sink Xerox Shares to 3-Year Low >BY Stephen Phillips.

 As expected, Xerox Corp notched its first quarterly decline in three years yesterday, stung by a distracted sales force, price competition and reduced sales of high-margin products. The imaging and document management giant also painted a bleak short- term outlook with these factors expected to depress earnings through the first half of 2000. 

 The bad news sent Xerox's shares crashing to a three-year, closing-price low yesterday of $23.81, down more than 13% for the day. Investors rushed to jettison their holdings and the firm was the most- actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange with around 31.24 million shares changing hands. The firm has had 60% of its share value wiped off so far this year, clocking up the biggest decline among the 65 companies comprising the Standard & Poor's High Technology Composite Index. 

 Xerox reported net income down 11% on the year-ago period to $339m, or 47 cents a share, matching analysts' projections, which were downgraded from 58 cents a share 11 days ago after the firm issued a profit warning for the quarter. Earnings for the three months to September 30 included 10 cents a share in one-time gains, 7 cents of which came from liquidating an unclaimed $70m pool set aside to reward high sales performance in the first two quarters. Revenue was up less than 1% to $4.63bn from $4.61bn last year. 

 Chief financial officer, Barry Romeril piled on the doom, warning that per-share profit for the fourth quarter would be down around 20% on the same period last year, when the firm earned 84 cents a share. The announcement prompted analysts to downgrade their fourth-quarter projections to around 67 cents a share, from a pervious mean of 82 cents, according to financial pollster First Call. 

 The September quarter is the first time Xerox's profits have fallen since the third quarter of 1996, when it dropped 2.3%. Aside from this blip, profits have been up at least 12% every quarter since the start of fiscal 1994. 

 Gross profit margin for the three-month period declined three points to 43.3%, due to what the firm called "unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures." A Xerox spokesperson told ComputerWire that cheap network printers and desktop printers aimed at the retail market and sold via resellers claimed sales at the expense of high-end products with larger mark-ups. Poor sales of Xerox's DocuTech-brand high volume production publishing systems which retail for between $60,000 and $320,000, was particularly damaging the spokesperson said. 

 Meantime Xerox is coming under fierce competition from Canon Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co who are whittling Xerox's lead, particularly in the digital copier market, by undercutting prices and beefing up product lines. Chief executive Richard Thoman branded the results "totally unacceptable". He said: "[The firm's] shareholders have a right to expect better execution at a time when the competitive environment has intensified." 

 The companies is in the throes of repositioning itself to sell products in customized bundles of consulting services, software and office hardware from which it aims to tap half of its revenue within the next decade. The makeover is designed to increase cross-selling opportunities for Xerox's product range, which spans printers, scanners and copiers and, latterly, consulting and outsourcing services. To this end the firm is reconfiguring its sales force around vertical industry sectors as opposed to geographical boundaries and is centralizing its customer administration centers, which will also ratchet down costs. 

 But the company admitted yesterday that the productivity-sapping internal upheaval has lasted longer than expected. "While realizing the benefits of our strategic direction is taking longer than anticipated, the positive effects of these changes should be reflected in stronger results towards the end of the next year," Thoman added. 

 The company said revenue was also crimped by lower-than-expected results from Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Japan's Fuji Photo Film, economic weakness in Brazil, and the dollar's strength against the European currencies. Excluding the effects of a rising US dollar and results in Brazil, revenue rose 6%, the firm said. Including Brazil but before the dollar's effect, revenue rose 2%.

 BancBoston sees profit forecasts falling on Dell.

 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Earnings estimates are poised to fall in the wake of Dell Computer Corp.'s  warning on Monday that the computer maker's third-quarter profit margins would be hurt by a spike in key component prices, an analyst said. 

 BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Dan Niles said Wall Street's consensus forecast for Dell's third quarter ending later this month would "probably have to come down a penny or two" to reflect the impact of the lower profit margin outlook. 

 The analyst consensus prior to Dell's warning was for the company to post earnings per share of 20 cents, compared with 14 cents in the year-ago October quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which surveys broker estimates. 

 Niles said he expected to trade down $3 to $4 on Tuesday "and it could go lower," from Monday's closing price of $41.32, which was itself down $1-during regular trading from Friday's closing stock price. 

 Niles said he was alone among brokerage analysts in predicting Dell's troubles. He downgraded the stock Oct. 1 and cut earnings estimates for its fiscal year ending in January 2000 to reflect the threat of a rapid price rise in computer memory chips used to power Dell PCs and those of other PC makers. 

 He said he had reiterated his comments to clients during a morning conference call early Monday, but was unaware that Dell would be making any specific warning on its quarterly outlook. 

 At the time of his downgrade, Niles cut his earnings forecast for the current fiscal year to 74 cents from 77 cents previously and downgraded the stock's rating to long-term attractive from his prior buy recommendation. 

 The analyst consensus remains at 76 cent per share ahead of the warning. 

 Noting one strategy announced by Dell to combat the rising price of computer memory was to encourage customers to buy machines using less memory, Niles warned this "may backfire on them." 

 "People buy from Dell to get the biggest, fastest, latest machines," Niles said. "Customers may turn elsewhere" he said of the stop-gap plan. "We will have to see what happens with demand if that is their strategy." 

 He said Dell's warning was likely to add fuel to concerns over earnings reports from International Business Machines Corp.  - due to release results on Wednesday - and from Compaq Computer Corp. , due to report next week. 

 Other analysts said they were preparing notes to clients but declined to comment immediately on the Dell announcement.

 Xerox Reports 11% Net Drop, Issues Warning

 Xerox Corp. reported an 11% drop in net income for the third quarter and warned of a 20% earnings decline in the fourth quarter, further rocking its stock price after a plunge last week when it forecast disappointing results. 

 Xerox Chief Executive G. Richard Thoman, calling the results "totally unacceptable," attributed the slumping earnings to many factors, including snafus in debt collection from customers, increasing competition in the digital copier market, a reorganization of its sales force, and weakness in Japan and Brazil operations. 

 Net income of the Stamford, Conn., company dropped to $339 million, or 47 cents a diluted share, from $381 million, or 53 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1998, marking its third straight quarter of disappointing results. Revenue rose slightly to $4.63 billion from $4.61 billion. 

 Mr. Thoman said the company's strategy to compensate for customer anxiety over year-2000 computer problems backfired. Anticipating that uncertainty would cut into fourth-quarter sales, Xerox lowered prices in the third quarter. But it didn't get the hoped-for increase in sales volume, he said. Xerox officials also said low-margin products boomed at the expense of more profitable lines. For example, customers opted for a 30-page-a-minute color copier over a more expensive 40-page-a-minute model. 

 "We did not see the kind of late surge in high-end, high-profit equipment we usually sell in the last week of a quarter," Mr. Thoman said. 

 Xerox closed down $3.625, or 13%, at $23.8125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Xerox has shed $24 billion, or about 60%, of its stock-market value since July, when it began ratcheting down earnings expectations. 

 While third-quarter results were in line with a negative forecast that the company gave last week, analysts said they hadn't expected the earnings would include a one-time benefit of seven cents a share derived from adjusting projected costs of profit-sharing with employees. Before last week's warning, analysts had been expecting earnings of 58 cents a share. 

 Mr. Thoman said he expects many of the problems to persist through the first half of next year, accounting for the projected 20% drop in this year's final period. In the fourth quarter of 1998, Xerox had earnings of 84.5 cents a share, adjusting for a stock split, and net income of $615 million.

 Not-So-Perfect 10s: Are these stocks broken, or merely bruised?

 Each week, it seems that at least one high-profile company announces a significant profit shortfall and sees its stock price crater on heavy volume. The most notable recent blowup involved Raytheon, the big defense contractor, which warned on Tues day that its 1999 and 2000 profits would fall significantly below Wall Street expectations because of a host of operating and financial issues, including difficulties integrating two large acquisitions. Raytheon's Class B shares plunged 38%, to 26 5/8, leaving them 65% below their summer peak of 76 1/2. 

 Wall Street often applies a rule of 10 to tainted stocks like Raytheon, valuing them at about 10 times their revised projected profits. This blanket treatment can present opportunities for investors to purchase solid companies at discounted prices. The trick, however, is to distinguish between a bruised apple and one that's rotten to the core. 

 Making this judgment can be tricky. Managements invariably insist that problems are temporary, but that often isn't the case. Service Corp, Waste Management, Fruit of the Loom and even Raytheon offer examples of companies where one dose of bad news was followed by even worse developments. Boeing, which announced surprisingly strong third-quarter earnings last week, has rebounded from the low it hit last December after its profit warning for 1999 and 2000. Among other earnings-related disasters from 1998, farm-equipment makers have revived this year, especially Case, which has tripled from its 1998 low following a takeover offer from rival New Holland. Dell Computer, Procter & Gamble and Pfizer also have rallied back from admittedly minor revenue- or profit-related shortfalls in the past two years. 

 The accompanying table lists a bunch of the more prominent profit offenders since midyear. It includes some well-known companies, including Allstate, Bank One, Mattel, Maytag and Xerox. Investors have punished these stocks severely; many now trade at half their 52-week highs. 

 A few words of caution. In many cases, the big initial drop in the stock following bad news doesn't represent a bottom, even if no more negative news is forthcoming. Bank One, for instance, declined to 43 from 55 in late August after saying its profits wouldn't meet expectations because of a shortfall at its FirstUSA credit-card operations. Its stock has since fallen to 33. Maytag plunged to 41 from 64 over a three-day period that culminated in an earnings warning on September 10, then continued to slip to a low of 31. Ditto for Allstate, which issued its doleful profit news on September 24. It fell to 28 from 33 and now trades for 24. 

 The situation gets even worse if more bad profit news ensues, because investors typically cut the value of the stock again to where it trades at 10 times the revised profit estimate. Sometimes, the market uses 1999 earnings estimates and in other cases, 2000 projections. 

 Another caveat. These stocks may look inexpensive in a market trading at 25 times earnings. But the reality is that cheap stocks are abundant. "There are hundreds and hundreds of companies trading for 10 times earnings," says Jeff Petherick, a value-oriented portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles in Michigan. "But valuation means nothing now in terms of driving portfolio performance. You'd better have an earnings catalyst. Everyone has plenty of cheap stocks in their portfolios." 

 The earnings-related casualties could come under further pressure by yearend because of tax-related selling, as institutions seek to rid themselves of losers to offset any realized gains in their portfolios. Yet some think that such selling, especially from mutual funds, could be near an end because funds generally like to act before the end of October, in order to make distributions by yearend. 

 Robert Sanborn, manager of the Oakmark Fund, argues that Mattel and Bank One have solid businesses and look very attractive at current levels. "I'd say that Bank One is an above-average financial institution, yet it trades at the bottom of its peer group," Sanborn says. Bank One, at 33, now trades for around nine times projected 2000 profits, versus a multiple of about 13 for other large regional banks. 

 Sanborn argues that Mattel is so attractive at its recent price of 13 that it could draw takeover offers from the likes of Disney or even attract a financial buyer. Sanborn acknowledges that Mattel's franchise isn't as strong as it once was, given the problems at the Learning Co., the software outfit it purchased for $3 billion in May. But he thinks the stock is worth at least $20 a share. 

 It amazes Sanborn that fledging Internet toy retailer eToys, which now trades at around 71, or roughly 65 times projected 1999 revenues, has a market value of over $8 billion. By contrast, Mattel, the secondlargest toy maker in the country with such brands as Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher Price, commands about one times revenues and is valued at $5.5 billion. Mattel and rival Hasbro are being treated as if the toy business is in decline, while eToys reflects a buoyant outlook. 

 Allstate, meanwhile, is suffering from stagnant revenues, larger catastrophe losses and higher marketing expenses as it tries to stave off erosion in its core homeowners' and auto-insurance businesses from low-cost operators like Progressive and Geico that don't rely on agents to sell their policies. Allstate now is expected to earn about $2.85 in 2000, down from an estimate of $3.55 before its profit warnings last month. 

 The bullish case for Allstate is that investors now are paying little more than book value of $21 for the company, the country's No. 2 property and casualty insurer. Allstate conceivably could attract takeover interest at its current price-although its board and management probably would be loath to sell for anything less than $40 a share. 

 Coca-Cola and Gillette aren't the only branded consumer companies that have taken it on the chin in the past year. The entire apparel industry has suffered, including VF, the leading maker of blue jeans. Its brands include Lee and Wrangler. VF said its third-quarter profits would fall below year-ago levels because of such factors as declining jeans sales at mid-priced department stores. VF, at 29, now fetches about 10 times projected 1999 profits. 

 VF may be having a tough time generating investor interest because other apparel makers also trade for depressed valuations. Liz Claiborne, which has a spotless balance sheet and active stock buyback program, trades for 11 times projected 1999 profits, as does Tommy Hilfiger, one of the strongest operators in recent years. 

 Maytag, which became a Wall Street darling in recent years as it developed innovative high-end appliances like a front-loading washing machine, gave too little attention to the lower end of the market and paid the price. Citing weakness in that segment, Maytag last month announced a weaker outlook that prompted analysts to lower their 1999 and 2000 profit estimates. Maytag now trades for nine times projected 2000 profits and for less than one times sales. But things may be looking up. On Thursday, the company reported third-quarter net of 92 cents a share, above the reduced estimates of 84 cents and better than last year's 84 cents. Maytag gained 3 7/8 that day, closing at 36 7/8.

 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Stocks remained mixed in late trading on Monday as investors turned cautious ahead of a key gauge of inflation. 

 Analysts said investors were reluctant to commit to stocks ahead of Tuesday's release of the Consumer Price Index for September. 

 The CPI will be scrutinised after Friday's Producer Price Index for September showed wholesale prices unexpectedly had their biggest monthly spike in nine years. The news rocked financial markets. 

 "Everyone is going to be very jittery until the CPI comes out and gives some direction of interest rates," said Gary Campbell, chief investment officer at Commerce Bank in St. Louis, Mo. 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  was up 9 points, or 0.11 percent, at 10,029 after sliding for the second straight session, below the psychologically important 10,000 level. The Dow is now at the lowest level since April and in correction mode, or at least 10 percent off its record high of 11,326 set in late August.



The volatility comes after Friday's 267-point plunge in the Dow and a day before the anniversary of the market crash of Oct. 19, 1987.



The Nasdaq composite index	   was down 84 points, or 3.08 percent, to 2,647. The Standard & Poor's 500 index	  slipped 7 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,239.
The technology sector fell steeply, with TheStreet.com's Internet index 	 down more than 3.71 percent, or 25 Earnings for major U.S. companies continued to pour in.



The third-largest U.S. bank, J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. , led the gainers in the Dow component after posting quarterly profits that were nearly tripled from a year ago. The stock was up 5-13/16 at 111-1/2.



Citigroup Inc. , the No. 1 U.S. financial services company and another Dow 30 member, topped expectations. The stock was up 1 at 43-1/4.



But photography company Eastman Kodak Co.  and a Dow component, slipped 5/16 to 70-9/16 after reporting a 20 percent gain in third quarter earnings over last year. points, at 659.



"It's probably a game of catch-up, more than anything else," Jim Benning, a trader at BT Brokerage, said of the technology losses on Nasdaq, which has risen at a faster pace this year than the Dow and S&P 500.



The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 16/32, with the yield at 6.30, compared with 6.27 percent on Friday.



Among the losers in the technology sector was printer maker Lexmark International  after it issued a fourth quarter profit warning. Despite reporting third quarter earnings that topped expectations, its stock was down 27-5/8 at 65-3/8.



Chipmaker Intel Corp.  was down 3-1/8 at 67-3/4 after disappointing earnings.



Adding to gloom, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan remarked last Thursday evening that investors should not under-estimate the risk of today's stock market.



"The market just has great nervousness about what may be changing in the overall blend of the economy," said Joseph Battipaglia, the chief investment officer at Gruntal & Co. "No one is going to make a big commitment until they see what the Consumer Price Index has to bring in the morning."



Declining stocks outpaced advances 2,737 to 1,256 on active trading of more than 400 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. While 191 stocks were at new lows, only 32 were at new highs.

 NEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks skidded at midday on Monday, shedding early gains built on strong banking profits in favour of worries about technology earnings and inflation jitters. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) was down 31 points, or 0.32 percent, at 9,987, sliding through Friday's low of 9,998. The Dow is now at the lowest level since April. 

 The pullback follows a 267-point plunge Friday that amounted to 2.6 percent loss for the blue-chip index. 

 "The market has just great nervousness about what may be changing in the overall blend of the economy," said Joseph Battipaglia, the chief investment officer at Gruntal & Co. "No one is going to make a big commitment until they see what the Consumer Price Index has to bring in the morning." 

 The market is anticipating the Tuesday morning release of the CPI data following Friday's news that wholesale prices unexpectedly had their biggest monthly spike in nine years in September. 

 That news spooked the market, along with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks that investors should not under-estimate the risk of today's stock market. 

 The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 6/32, with the yield unchanged from Friday. 


The Nasdaq composite index	   was down 76 points, or 2.8 percent, to 2,655. The Standard & Poor's 500 index	  slipped 10 points, or 0.80 percent, to 1,237.



Blue-chip stocks see-sawed in morning trading, running from negative territory, to up more than 100 points then back down to session lows at midday. A handful of influential market analysts added to downward momentum.



Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. said its director of market strategy, Charles Blood, who had already turned bearish on the stocks, has adopted an even more pessimistic view on the market.



And, PaineWebber Inc. chief investment strategist Edward Kerschner said the market still would no be considered truly cheap unless it drops an additional 5 percent to 10 percent. But he left his year-end 2000 fair value predictions for the Dow unchanged at 11,500 and the S&P 500 at 1,400.



Brown Brothers said in a brief that Blood lowered his outlook on stocks to bearish from neutral for the next three months.



Over the intermediate term, which looks forward six months, Blood is now "strongly bearish" on the market, a downgrade from his previous "moderately bearish" stance.



Banking stocks led the market higher after sector leaders reported strong earnings.



Leading the Dow up was J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. , the No. 3 U.S. bank, with quarterly profits that were nearly tripled a year ago. The stock was up 3-3/16 at 108-7/8.



Citigroup Inc. , the No. 1 U.S. financial services company and a Dow component, topped expectations. The stock was up 11/16 at 42-15/16.



Bank of America Corp.  also beat expectations and the stock rose 15/16 to 49-3/16.



Declining stocks outpaced advances 1,911 to 917 on active trading of more than 400 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. While 269 stocks were at new lows, only 8 were at new highs.

For 30 years Nucor has been defying the steel industry's way of doing things. Is it about to give up?

WHEN Wall Street collapsed in 1929, John Pierpont Morgan famously strode into the market to buy shares of US Steel, America's biggest steel company. When the next stockmarket collapse comes, anyone seeking to imitate his act of defiance will look to Nucor. That is because this obscure firm from North Carolina is about to become America's largest steel company. Nucor's rise owes much to Ken Iverson, the plain-speaking engineer who led the company for three decades. Mr Iverson masterminded the firm's transformation from a small producer of low-grade steel into a low-cost juggernaut with some 10m tonnes in output and $4 billion a year in sales. He achieved this by placing two bets that enabled him to outmanoeuvre established firms (chief among them US Steel). One was on a flexible, low-cost technology known as minimills; the other was on decentralised, non-union plants situated away from the large cities. Big firms with blast furnaces long maintained that minimills could produce only the lowest grades of steel; but, thanks to Mr Iverson's persistence and investment, Nucor today produces almost every grade of steel, except for the type used in cars. Yet, despite their success, both Mr Iverson and John Correnti, his hand-picked successor, have recently been unceremoniously booted out by Nucor's board of directors. Egos and ambitions played a role, but the main reason for their ejection was that the current boss, David Aycock, thought it was time for a shift in strategy. Since last year, the firm's financial performance has been poor (see chart). The Asian economic crisis is partly to blame: cheap imports of steel into America forced a price drop last year that hurt all domestic producers. But some worry that there may be more to Nucor's ills than that. There are signs that the new management is tinkering with the firm's successful approach to making steel. Mr Aycock, a Nucor veteran who led the boardroom coup against Mr Iverson, has just added a layer of management at headquarters, something Mr Iverson always resisted. He now talks of expanding overseas. He even utters what seems like heresy: he wants to build a blast furnace, the very symbol of old, integrated steel making. The key to Nucor's success, says Lou Pahountis of Andersen Consulting, has been in "serving niche markets in the lowest-cost fashion...and now I smell a deviation from that." What in the world is going on ? One concern raised by Mr Aycock's new layer of management is that the firm could eventually become top heavy, just like the rest of the steel industry. The American steel market has always been a surprisingly local business; even now, much of America's steel is sold within 100 miles (160km) of the plant that produces it. That is why Nucor's decentralised style has given it such an edge over what many call the "command-and-control" approach of integrated steel makers. Mr Iverson explains how pushing decisions down to the plant level and giving every employee profit or production incentives has cut costs by allowing Nucor flexibility in procurement and in its product mix. Some also worry about Mr Aycock's thoughts of setting up plants overseas. He says he has his eye on South America and Asia, so as to serve both local markets and the United States. "Nucor does not have to go overseas," insists Mr Iverson, who worries that the firm's culture will be difficult to export. "The company can continue to grow rapidly within the domestic market." Mr Aycock concedes that it will not be easy to go abroad, though he thinks local partners will help. But to be international is important, he says: "Steel is not just a local market any more, and our product must be global." At first sight the idea about blast furnaces is even more of a departure. For 30 years, Nucor has run rings around the firms that made steel using these inflexible, capital-intensive pieces of heavy-industrial machinery. Yet Mr Aycock says the blast furnace can deal with a weakness that could become critical as the firm grows. Unlike integrated firms, which use pig iron produced by blast furnaces, minimills rely mostly on scrap metal. According to Mr Aycock, a blast furnace can diminish the firm's reliance on the notoriously fickle scrap market. Mr Aycock insists that "it is a terrible misconception that integrated firms have to stay 'integrated', and minimills must stay 'mini'." Yet such words chill old Nucor lags. When Mr Aycock talks of growth, he leaves the door open for acquisitions. Mr Iverson set up plants from scratch. The new bosses at Nucor also want to expand, in time, beyond steel, the firm's base, to "other manufacturing areas where the Nucor model will work." Bigger and better? Mr Aycock wants to keep stoking growth: he claims that over the next five years, Nucor can increase its output by half, to 15m-16m tonnes, while delivering annual growth in earnings per share of 10-15%. To achieve this, he wants to add institutions and practices so that its bosses are not perpetually flying by the seat of their pants-something that even Mr Iverson admits was a weakness. "Our size", insists Mr Aycock, "means the boss simply can't know everything that goes on." He has decreed that each top executive must have no more than seven plant managers reporting to him. In the past, the number reporting to Mr Iverson had grown to more than 20. He reckons this will mean better oversight and monitoring of costs. It may also provide a broader base of talent to succeed him. In a jibe at Mr Iverson, who is now 73, he says the firm will soon put in place a mandatory retirement age for its boss, of somewhere between 63 and 67. Mr Aycock, who is himself 68, promises to retire within the next three years. There is clearly some sense in what Mr Aycock says. However, there is also a big danger that, by admitting that Nucor needs to make all these "investments", the firm sheds its distinctive low-cost discipline. Whatever Mr Aycock intends, the effect of his changes could be to make Nucor seem more like an integrated steel maker. In the past, the firm's very identity has been based on its eschewing the methods of the old steel makers-even when they said it could not be done. As Andersen's Mr Pahountis notes, "the real difference between minimills and the integrated firms is a lot more than just the unions or the asset base: it is the business mentality." It is a tribute to the effectiveness of that mentality that, over the years, so many big integrated firm have tried to copy Nucor's methods by setting up their own minimills. And it is a warning to Mr Aycock that they have failed.

 Insurers Chubb, Old Republic Warn Of Lower 3rd-Quarter Results

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Chubb Corp. warned Friday that third-quarter earnings will be much lower than expected, primarily because of losses related to Hurricane Floyd. 

 Separately, insurer Old Republic International Corp. also issued a third quarter profit warning, citing a decline in underwriting and costs associated with continuing litigation directed at the company's title insurance business in California. 

 Hurricane Floyd deluged parts of the eastern U.S. in September with heavy rains. 

 Chubb also said increasing competition in the insurance sector also harmed results. 

 For the quarter, the insurance holding company said earnings are expected to be 40 cents to 45 cents a share. The mean estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 93 cents a share. Last year, Chubb earned 90 cents a share. 

 Chubb said its expects losses related to the hurricane to total about $135 million, compared with $69 million in catastophe losses a year ago. This quarter's losses will lower earnings by 50 cents a share, wider than the 27 cents a share in catastrophe losses the company recorded a year earlier, which were mostly related to Hurricane Georges. 

 Most of the storm-damage losses for this year come from policyholders in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, the company said, with a large number of its claims resulting from the broad coverage offered by its Masterpiece policies. 

 The company also noted that lower prices reflected "extremely competitive" markets during the past few years. 

 Chubb said it continues to reprice standard commercial business policies and trim unprofitable accounts, but warned it would take time before benefits from the pricing initiatives reverse losses. 

 Chubb's announcement follows a warning from Allstate Corp. (ALL) that claims related to Floyd would depress third-quarter earnings. The insurer expects net income to fall to between 50 cents and 55 cents a share, compared with 76 cents a year earlier. 

 Analysts said the Chubb news didn't come as a big surprise. 

 "They were one of the few larger companies that hadn't actually preannounced earnings, and we had suspected that they would after they quantifed losses related to Hurricane Floyd," said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Kenneth Zuckerberg. 

 Meanwhile, Chicago-based Old Republic (ORI) expects to report operating income of 28 cents to 31 cents a share for the quarter, compared with 51 cents a share last year. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial put earnings at 47 cents a share. 

 The company is expected to release third-quarter results on Oct. 28. 

 Most of the drop stems from lower earnings from Old Republic's largest insurance segment, property and liability,. Property and liability insurance suffered from higher truck claims. 

 The company said it intends to combat reduced operating earnings, which have occurred for six consecutive quarters, by raising prices and strengthening underwriting standards even if it loses saome customers. 

 Regarding litigation in California, where Old Republic is among the leading title insurers in the San Francisco area, the company expects costs of nearly $36 million, with $10 million coming in the third quarter. 

 In the case, Old Republic allegedly collected fees for services that either weren't performed or were paid for by other parties, and pocketed about $30 million in interest income that accumulated in customer accounts while real estate transactions remained in escrow. That money, California regulators allege, should have been paid to customers. The company also illegally kept about $10 million in unclaimed customer funds that should have been turned over to the state, regulators alleged.

 FRANKFURT, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) on Thursday cut its recommendation on SAP AG to "market performer" from "outperformer" after the German-based business software maker issued a profit warning on Wednesday. 

 SAP warned that sales would grow by only 15-20 percent this year, substantially less than previously expected, as it suffers from a slowdown in demand for its Y2K products and struggles to make its software Internet compatible. 

 "We have the impression that the upper end of SAP's forecasts is ambitious and there might be further revisions of the figures from our side after the conference call next week," BNP said in a research note. 

 BNP added that it was cutting its 1999 earnings per share forecast for SAP to 5.95 euros from 6.20 euros. 

 But the bank said it was optimistic about SAP's medium-term outlook as the company expected demand for its Internet based products to pick up. ((Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 ANALYSIS-Beware Raytheon experience, Europe warned.

LONDON, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The new aerospace giant to be forged from Aerospatiale Matra  and DaimlerChrysler AG		unit Dasa will have to take heed of unhappy U.S. merger experience in the sector, analysts said on Thursday.



The big-three U.S. defence and aerospace firms - Boeing Co , Lockheed Martin Corp  and Raytheon Co  - have all suffered indigestion after swallowing other companies in the sector this decade, they said.


 Analysts blamed the U.S. problems on top management becoming so distracted with integrating the new businesses that it failed to adequately control what its units were doing. 

 So a similar challenge awaits the new Franco-German group, the European Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co (EADS), into which Aerospatiale and Dasa said on Thursday they would merge. 

 "While they are putting the business together, management needs to know what is going on down in the units," Salomon Smith Barney analyst Nick Cunningham said. 

 Investors dumped Raytheon shares this week after the company issued a profit warning that analysts blamed partly on the company's trouble pursuing efficiency after acquisitions. 

 But EADS will be bigger than Raytheon. 

 Based on 1998 figures, and assuming that Spain's CASA will also be included, the Europeans are pulling together a group with combined annual sales of about $25 billion, compared with Raytheon's $20 billion. 

 COST CUTS UNMENTIONED 

 Neither of the parties to the deal seems to have mentioned cost savings on Thursday - following the continental European tradition that job cuts are nothing to crow about, especially while politicians applauding the deal. 

 But analysts have little doubt that the group can and will seek savings in its businesses. 

 One analyst, closely connected with the deal, said EADS would produce savings only slowly, but the pay-off should be apparent by 2004. 

 "This will be a four to five year process," he said. 

 For example, much of the group will be accounted for by its 80 percent share of civil planemaker Airbus Industrie, whose total 1998 sales are estimated at $13.3 billion, and analysts are confident that there are savings to be made there. 

 Because Airbus is a consortium, not a company, its work allocation is determined above all by the need to give each partner the share of the work to which it is entitled - 37.9 percent in the case of Aerospatiale Matra, for example. 

 So one partner might undertake part of the fabrication not because it can do it most efficiently but because it is entitled to more work. 

 But as a single company, Dasa, Aerospatiale and CASA should be able to shift work to where it can be done most cheaply, analysts said. 

 Much duplication in other areas could be cut out, too, although one analyst noted that the merged firm planned to keep two head offices, one in Munich and one in Paris.

CPI Corp. said the $367 million buyout it announced in June, by a group including management, collapsed when the buyer terminated the accord. CPI, which last week disclosed that near-term earnings would fall short of expectations, said the buyer, an affiliate of  American Securities Capital Partners LP, New York, asserted that CPI's change in fortunes would have a "material adverse effect" on the transaction, citing provisions of the buyout agreement. CPI, of St. Louis, operates  Sears Portrait Studios, which provide photography services under license from  Sears, Roebuck & Co. The photography concern said yesterday that the profit warning reflects the "ordinary course of business fluctuations" and that it considers failure to complete the buyout a breach of the agreement. Officials of American Securities Capital couldn't be reached for comment.   

CPI shares, which dropped dramatically on the company's disclosure last week, yesterday fell $4.625, or 19%, to $20.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

 HELSINKI -(Dow Jones)- Raisio Group Oyj's (Y.RSY) warning that profits are falling has significantly hurt shares and analysts don't see a recovery soon for the manufacturer of cholesterol-cutting Benecol spread. 

 The outlook for the Benecol product has become uncertain ahead of stiffening competition and many observers feel the company has stumbled in communicating details with the financial market, providing too little data on the company's prospects. 

 Raisio, a foodstuffs manufacturer based in the southwestern Finnish city with the same name, said Sept. 13 it expects its 1999 earnings to fall substantially below last year's because of difficulties with margarine exports and schedule changes for the U.S. launch of Benecol. The company estimated its full-year sales will drop about 7% to EUR770 million. 

 After the announcement, Raisio's restricted K class shares fell 11% to EUR8.05 and the nonvoting V class shares fell 22% to EUR7.00 in Helsinki. K shares fell further Tuesday, closing at EUR7.25, while the V share had revived to EUR7.17. 

 Hans Bostrom, analyst at Paribas in London, said Raisio should have more actively toned down overly positive analyst reports published earlier this year on the stock's potential. 

 "The company could have suggested analysts take a more conservative view, but it chose to say nothing," Bostrom said, adding that he has a sell recommendation on the stock. 

 According to the monthly statistics of the Finnish Central Securities Depositary, foreign investors reduced notably their ownership in Raisio in September. Foreign investors owned 48% of Raisio's shares at the end of September, down from 53% a month earlier and 62% at the end of 1998. 

 Sten von Hellens, a spokesman for Raisio, says the company was in a difficult position ahead of the profit warning as it had identified several equally likely business scenarios for Raisio's future. 

 Finally, "we decided to come out with a profit warning," von Hellens said, adding that Raisio was unable to interfere beforehand with individual analyst reports without risking free flow of data to all market participants. 

 Raisio's eight-month pretax profit after extraordinary items slumped to EUR11.8 million from EUR32.2 million a year earlier, while sales were down around 10% at EUR512.7 million. The Benecol division's operating profit was cut in half to EUR12.1 million from EUR23.6 million. The margarine division made an operating loss of EUR8.0 million, compared with a profit of EUR2.1 million a year earlier. 

 Benecol To Face Tougher Competition 

 Benecol spread is the crown-jewel in Raisio's product line and the main reason for foreign investors' interest in Raisio during the past four years. 

 Plant stanol ester, Benecol's key ingredient, has been shown to reduce cholesterol, a fact that made the product an immediate hit among Finns suffering from elevated cholesterol. 

 After Benecol's Finnish introduction in late 1995, Raisio set its eye on the lucrative U.S. market, where the company sees roughly 100 million potential Benecol users, but it was forced to postpone this plan several times. 

 In 1998, Raisio signed a deal with McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a unit of Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), to give the U.S. company Benecol's worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights. 

 The deal dwarfed Raisio's role as the provider of plant stanol ester for McNeil, but it contributed to Benecol finally receiving approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 

 The FDA categorized Benecol as a conventional food product, rather than labeling it a health food. This has increased pressure on Raisio, because the British-Dutch consumer products giant, Unilever PLC (UL), has launched a similar product, called Take Control, in the country earlier this year. 

 "Being an ordinary consumer product with no possibilities to differentiate, Benecol faces a much tougher competitive environment," Paribas' Bostrom says, adding that this also makes Benecol's higher price unsustainable. 

 In Finland, Benecol costs around 100 Finnish markkaa ($1=FIM5.5734) a kilogram in Finland, roughly two and half times more than ordinary margarine. 

 Ritva Ojala, analyst at the Helsinki-based Conventum Securities, still believes in Benecol's potential and remains long-term positive on Raisio's stock. 

 "The company possesses a high knowledge level and a strong position as a raw material supplier" to Benecol, Ojala says, adding that she sees the September profit warning relating to Raisio's plunging ordinary margarine exports to Russia. 

 While Paribas's Bostrom says he was disappointed on the Benecol division's boost to Raisio's eight-month earnings, he and Coventum's Ojala agree that spinning off the unit is not necessarily the best strategy. 

 "If separated, Benecol would lose all the synergy that comes from producing ordinary margarine," Ojala says.

FRANKFURT, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Merck Finck & Co on Wednesday cut its rating on German software provider SAP AG		    to "market performer" from "outperformer" after the company revised its 1999 sales outlook downwards.



"It is very bad. It's always bad if there's a profit warning and this is very unexpected. I will reduce my estimates for this year and next year," Merck Finck analyst Theo Kitz told Reuters.


 SAP said earlier it had reduced its 1999 sales growth forecast to 15-20 percent from 20-25 percent. 

 SAP said it expects a lower pre-tax profit margin in 1999 than last year's 21.6 percent and cut its forecast for a one percentage point rise. ((Melanie Cheary, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com)).

FRANKFURT, Oct 13 (Reuters) - German business software provider SAP AG's		    shares plunged 10 percent on Wednesday after it warned that sales would grow by only 15-20 percent this year, substantially less than previously expected.



The news comes amid ongoing weakness in the global software market with some analysts saying SAP has suffered from a slowdown for its Y2K products and others saying that the group hesitated too long in making its products Internet compatible.


 SAP's warning, which it issued in a brief statement and offered no reason for, knocked its shares to a five-week low within the first half an hour of trade and alarmed European investors who hurriedly pulled out of other such stocks as well. 

 Dutch software firm Baan  fell more than six percent, but has since recovered, and analysts were worried about Oracle  when U.S. markets open later. 

 "It is always bad if there is a profit warning and this is unexpected," said Theo Kitz, at Merck Finck & Co in Munich, who cut his rating on SAP to "market performer" from "outperformer" and will reduce his earnings estimates for this year and 2000. 

 SAP, Europe's leading and the world's third biggest producer of enterprise software used to integrate business operations, previously forecast 1999 sales growth of 20-25 percent. 

 "SAP AG anticipates its 1999 revenues to be lower than initially expected," the company said, expecting a lower pre-tax profit margin this year than last year's 21.6 percent. 

 SHARES PLUNGE AND SAP PROBED 

 SAP's share price slide extended a more than five percent fall on Tuesday which Germany's securities watchdog says it will investigate in a routine probe. 

 Although recovering slightly by midday, SAP shares again slipped following a fall in their New York-listed stocks. By 1339 GMT SAP shares were 5.5 percent weaker in Frankfurt at 413.50 euros and almost three percent down in New York at $37. 

 Goldman Sachs boosted the share slightly when it earlier raised its share price target to 420 euros, dealers said. Goldman also reaffirmed its "market outperformer" rating and forecast of a significant upturn in earnings from the second quarter of 2000. 

 Since closing trade on Monday at 459.25 euros, SAP has lost almost five billion euros of its market capitalisation. 

 SAP's drop on Tuesday is not the first time its shares have fallen sharply ahead of a profit warning. 

 In 1997 several SAP executives were investigated for trading ahead of a steep drop in the stock on October 23, 1996. The executives agreed to pay charitable contributions and charges were dropped. 

 "Naturally, it gets your attention that the shares fell so much the day before the news, but what can you say," said BHF analyst Michael Schatzschneider who has a "hold" rating on SAP. 

 Schatzschneider said that the stock could fall further. 

 Y2K AND INTERNET HESITANCY HIT SAP 

 Analysts have said since the start of the year that SAP will face sluggish demand in 1999 but that sales will pick up in 2000 once the millenium computer compatibility problem has passed. 

 They say companies have put off making major investments in new software programmes in order to prepare for the Y2K problem. 

 "My view on what's happening is that we've got to the middle of 1999. People have finished off their Y2K projects and they are hesitating on their ERP (enterprise resource planning) projects," said Devika Malik at J.P. Morgan in London. 

 Malik said she was maintaining her "buy" recommendation on SAP based on the outlook for the company in 2000. 

 But other analysts said SAP is pressured because it did not secure quickly enough a place in the fast-growing market for Internet-compatible software products and ensure sales momentum. 

 "They were way behind the front of the curve here," said one analyst at a leading investment bank who declined to be named. 

 Last month SAP introduced its mySAP.com product which aims to link data between front and back offices inside a company with external suppliers, business partners and customers. 

 Analysts said SAP's revised 1999 forecast would threaten the group's management credibility. 

 "They have repeated their outlook all year and now they cut it. Management could have a credibility problem in future," Merck Finck's Kitz said. 

 The company, which said it would provide further details at a news conference on October 20, pledged to reach its revised sales target. It said third quarter sales rose seven percent. 

 "This analysis is chiefly based on the continuously strong fourth quarter sales pipeline and the increasingly positive response among customers to the Internet product mySAP.com, launched in September," SAP said. ((Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525, frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com)).

 FRANKFURT, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Germany's BAWE securities watchdog said on Wednesday it would conduct a routine investigation into dealings in software maker SAP AG's shares conducted ahead of its latest profit warning. 

 "We routinely look at the development of share prices after companies make official statements," a BAWE spokesman said. "In this case, we will naturally take into account the share's reaction to the news." 

 SAP shares fell as much as 10 percent in early Wednesday trade after the group cut its 1999 sales growth forecast to 15-20 percent from 20-25 percent. It also said that its pre-tax profit margins would decline. 

 The shares fell more than five percent on Tuesday ahead of the announcement. 

 The investigation is not the first time trading in SAP shares has drawn the attention of authorities. 

 Last June, German authorities conducted a routine probe into what they termed "unusual trading patterns" in SAP options and in 1997 several SAP executives were probed for trading ahead of a steep drop in the stock on October 23, 1996.

 BAe shares under fire after Raytheon warning.

 LONDON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Shares in British Aerospace Plc came under attack early on Wednesday in the wake of a profit warning from U.S. defence and aerospace giant Raytheon Co.,  , dealers said. 

 BAe shares traded 16-1/2 pence or four percent lower at 392 pence by 0728 FMT, among the biggest fallers in a weak FTSE 100 index at that time. 

 On Wall Street, Raytheon stock crashed $18.75 to $24.25 after the company said earnings this year and next will fall far below expectations. 

 The company said it would take a charge of $638 million in 1999, higher than previously forecast, including $170 million related to performance issues on Pentagon contracts and $125 million on four contracts at the company's Engineers & Constructors unit. 

 Raytheon cut its earnings estimates to $1.40 to $1.50 a share for 1999, including the charges as well as the impact of delays in customer purchase decisions and a shortage of software engineers. It added that a recent spate of acquisitions had put a strain on the company. 

 Analysts played down the relevance of Raytheon's statement for BAe, saying the impact was mainly in terms of sentiment, though it may also have raised concerns about BAe's integration plans following its planned seven billion pounds acquisition of General Electric Co Plc's defence arm. 

 "BAe is in a very different position from Raytheon, its exposure is on a number of different platforms with good long-term prospects," said William Mackey, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Europe. 

 "You can't draw parallels...but Raytheon was seen as successful in a consolidating industry and this may not help the belief that BAe can achieve cost saving targets," Mackey said. 

 The Credit Lyonnais analyst added that other uncertainties dogged the outlook for BAe stock - which languishes near yearly lows around 380 pence set in March - with the GEC acquisition expected to dilute earnings next year. 

 "There's no compelling reason to chase after BAe shares expecting them to quickly take off, because they won't," Mackey said.

 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Shares of Bermudian speciality insurer Mutual Risk Management  rose slightly against a falling stock market on Tuesday as its chairman and chief executive, Robert Mulderig, bought 500,000 shares in the company - about half the day's volume traded. 

 Mulderig told Reuters he bought the shares in the open market at prices between $10 and $11 in personal transactions that were not part of the three million share buyback Mutual Risk announced last week. 

 Mutual Risk shares ended the day up 1/8 at 10-3/4. 

 Mulderig told Reuters he thought his company's shares were significantly undervalued, and said the current price was an "incredible opportunity to buy". 

 Mutual Risk shares hit a year low of 9-7/8 last week after losing a third of their value in the wake of a profit warning last Monday. 

 Mutual Risk - which specialises in insuring hard-to-place risks via insurance pools - warned last Monday that third-quarter earnings would be cut by a charge for some discontinued programme business, which involves packaging primary risk and passing it on to reinsurers. 

 Mutual Risk said third-quarter earnings would be between 33 and 38 cents per share against the 44 cents consensus of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Mutual Risk said in a statement on Tuesday that Mulderig had also sold 15,350 shares of the company's zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures, due 2015. 

 Mulderig said Tuesday that he could not discount buying more Mutual Risk shares. As a result of Tuesday's transactions, Mulderig now owns 1,022,698 Mutual Risk shares, valued at about $11 million at Tuesday's close.

 NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wall Street is expected to open lower on Tuesday, despite the record high set Monday by the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. 

 The Standard & Poor's futures index for December was down 4.4 points at 1,342. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 10/32 with a yield of 6.21 percent. 

 Analysts said the declining bond and futures markets and weakness in the dollar all pointed to a lower opening. 

 "Even the Nasdaq high wasn't convincing," said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson and Co. in Portland, Ore. "It was narrow in the technology and telecom sectors." 

 Semiconductor stocks will be in the limelight, following better than expected earnings from Novellus Systems Inc. and reports expected later Tuesday from Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc.. 

 Novellus late Monday reported third-quarter earnings of 54 cents per share compared with 22 cents a year ago. The stock was up sharply on Instinet at 78 from its close at 72-15/32. 

 "It will be interesting to see how much more the semiconductor sector can run.... They already had a good run yesterday," said Bill Meehan, the chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Darien, Conn. "I believe there's just so much money concentrated in the technology sector that we're likely to see some selling." 

 Earnings reports are also expected Tuesday from International Paper Co., a Dow component, as well as Phelps Dodge Corp. and Whirlpool Corp.. 

 Brokerage companies Tuesday morning came in with earnings above expectations. PaineWebber Group Inc. reported third-quarter earnings of 86 cents per share compared with 51 cents a year ago, and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. reported operating earnings of $1.34 per diluted share, up from 28 cents. Analysts were expecting 83 cents per share and $1.29 respectively. 

 Drug store chain Rite Aid Corp. said it expects to post a loss in its second quarter. The stock was down in pre-market trading on Instinet at 9-3/4 from its close at 12-13/16. 

 Defence and aerospace giant Raytheon Co. is over budget or behind schedule on more than a dozen Pentagon fixed-price contracts, people familiar with the programmes told the Wall Street Journal. 

 In merger news, the Wall Street Journal reported that Consolidated Edison Inc. is in advanced talks to acquire Northeast Utilities in a deal that would make Con Ed the largest U.S. electric utility based on clients. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) on Monday closed 1.58 points lower, or 0.01 percent, at 10,648.18. 

 The Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC) rose 29.39 points, or 1.02 percent, to 2,915.96, setting a new record close. Its previous high close was 2,887.06 on Sept. 10. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX) fell 0.81 of a point, or 0.06 percent, to 1,335.21. 

 The Wall Street Journal's "Heard on the Street" column reports that the decline in trades at on-line brokerages is starting to hurt the bottom lines for Internet brokerage stocks, evidenced Monday by the profit warning from Knight/Trimark Group Inc.. 

 The New York Times' "Market Place" story reports that chief executive Linda Wachner would stand to gain $47.9 million if her Warnaco Group Inc. bought back its Authentic Fitness Corp., which was previously a Warnaco division. Wachner is CEO of both companies.

Abreast of the Market
 Big Deal, Big Return? It's a Little Complicated

 The bull market officially enters its 10th year today. So it seems a fitting tribute that investors now are digesting the first merger pact topping $100 billion -- MCI WorldCom's bid for Sprint and its cellular division. 

 But while ever-rising stock prices have generated ever-bigger mergers, the reverse isn't necessarily true: Many companies' stocks badly underperform the market after a big merger. 

 The 30 largest deals of the past five years have on average underperformed Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to figures compiled by CommScan LLC, a New York investment-banking research firm. 

 Yet the trend is more complicated than that number suggests. It includes some spectacular successes, such as WorldCom's purchase of MCI Communications, and some equally spectacular fumbles, such as the First Union Corp. takeover of CoreStates Financial Corp. 

 Indeed, those two deals underscore a clear pattern, notes CommScan analyst Greg Streibig: Telecommunications deals have thrived while bank deals haven't. 

 It is too early to judge the success of many recent deals. Furthermore, the S&P 500, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, has been a tough benchmark to beat, in part because of the rampaging performance of a handful of enormous technology stocks. Last week, the S&P 500 rose 4.1%, leaving it up 39% from 12 months ago at the depth of the debt-market crisis. The industrial average, which rose 376.76 points last week to 10649.76, is up 38% in the same period. The industrials are up 350% since the current bull market began nine years ago, on Oct. 11, 1990, when it closed at 2365.1. 

 Even in studies that compare merged companies to their peer group, the results are underwhelming. That is despite the fact that today's deals are more likely to be driven by cost-cutting or cross-selling synergies, as opposed to financial engineering or diversification. 

 "The overall track record is at best a 50-50 proposition," says John Harbison, a vice president in the Los Angeles office of management consultant Booz Allen & Hamilton, who has studied merger-success rates. "The upfront homework is better than 15 or 20 years ago. The driving force behind many, if not most, of the failures is inadequate attention to the details in the post-merger integration process." 

 Toy maker Mattel Inc.'s purchase of education-software concern Learning Co. earlier this year appears to be a textbook example of a poorly executed acquisition. Mattel cited problems at the new unit in warning this week third-quarter profit could be less than half of Wall Street estimates. Mattel's stock plunged. 

 It revived memories of disasters that followed some big recent mergers, especially McKesson Corp.'s $13.7 billion purchase in January of HBO & Co. (down 68% since completion of the merger), and CUC International Inc.'s December 1997 merger for $14.1 billion with HFS Inc. (down 17%), to become Cendant Corp. In both cases, problems at the acquired company came to light only after the merger was consummated. 

 Other deals stumble on more prosaic issues, such as handling the sheer size of the merger and different cultures. The stocks that resulted from the four largest bank deals of the last year and a half -- NationsBank Corp.'s purchase of BankAmerica Corp. (now Bank of America), Norwest Corp.'s acquisition of Wells Fargo & Co., First Union's purchase of CoreStates Financial and Banc One Corp.'s purchase of First Chicago NBD Corp. -- all have been lackluster performers. 

 They may simply be victims of diminishing returns, says Daniel Bandi, a portfolio manager at National City in Cleveland. 

 "It's tough to grow a large institution in a mature market," he says. "For the most part, the cost savings are gone. If you're already $80 billion in assets, it's hard to steal [market share] and continue to grow 10% or 15% a year." Indeed, the most successful big bank merger of the past five years was the earliest: Chase Manhattan Corp.'s merger with Chemical Banking Corp., four years ago. Citigroup stock, created from the merger of Travelers Group Inc. and Citicorp, has been a standout performer, but in part that is because it closed one year ago, just when financial stocks began to bounce back strongly from the global financial crisis. 

 In fairness, all financial stocks this year suffered from rising interest rates, and many of the merged banks' problems aren't merger related, such as Bank One's credit-card woes. 

 The story is reversed for telecommunications. While conventional local and long-distance business is relatively mature, data and wireless offer enormous growth, which has benefited merger partners in the sector. 

 "In a lot of the telecom mergers, you can leverage the assets of one with the customers of the other," says Jim Leach, a telecom analyst at Conseco Capital Management. That is one reason Conseco bought more MCI WorldCom stock when it sold off briefly after last week's merger announcement. "WorldCom now has one of the better wireless spectrums out there. They're going to leverage all their assets with Sprint." Also in that deal's favor is WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers' track record: His acquisitions of MFS Communications Co. in 1996 and MCI Communications last year rank among the most successful of large deals. 

 But Charles Calomiris, professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School in New York who has studied bank mergers, says it is too early to draw conclusions about the success of many of these mergers, especially because they are unprecedented. 

 "How long does it take to work out the kinks when banks the size of NationsBank and BankAmerica marry? Based on mergers of much smaller banks, I'd say two to three years. These are large, complex organizations, and the dust hasn't settled yet." 

 And don't rush to sell just because a merger hasn't perked up your stock. Prof. Calomiris notes poorly performing acquirors themselves usually get restructured or acquired by a company that can do a better job.

 Friday's Market Activity 

 Investors resumed their occasional flirtation with consumer and cyclical issues, offering a hint the market's breadth may expand enough to position U.S. stocks for another rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 112.71 points higher, or 1.07%, to 10649.76. For the week, the index rose 376.76 points, or 3.66%. 

 Online brokers, including Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Waterhouse Group fell after Morgan Stanley analyst Henry McVey lowered his rating on both stocks to "neutral" from "outperform," citing pricing pressures in the industry. He cited American Express Co.'s planned free Web trades for customers with more than $100,000 with the firm. Mr. McVey also downgraded Merrill Lynch, which is getting into the online business. Schwab fell 6.1%, or 2 3/16, to 33 9/16; TD Waterhouse dropped 4.6%, or 5/8, to 12 7/8; and Merrill fell 2%, or 1 7/16, to 68 9/16. 

 Bank of America fell 11/16 to 56 in heavy trading after an analyst at Friedman Billings lowered her rating and earnings forecasts for the nation's second-largest bank. Analyst Carla D'Arista forecasts fourth-quarter earnings of $1.20 to $1.22 a share, down from her previous $1.30. She said recent comments by the company in an internal newsletter increased her concerns about shrinking interest margins and market-sensitive revenue. "It made me really sit up and take notice," said Ms. D'Arista, who cut her rating to "accumulate" from "buy." 

 Wal-Mart Stores jumped 4 1/16 to 55 3/8, while Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq) gained 4 15/32 to 82 19/32, and CVS improved 2 1/8 to 42 13/16. Shares of International Business Machines fell 2 7/8 to 113 1/2, as some worries about third-quarter earnings performance cropped up. 

 Xerox tumbled 10 1/4 to 32 1/2, sinking to a 52-week low, after the company warned it would not live up to Wall Street's third-quarter profit targets. But Credit Suisse First Boston, which anticipated the profit shortfall earlier in the week, came out after the stock declined to raise its rating to a "buy," saying the worst for the stock was over. 

 Consolidated Papers rose 1 15/16 to 29 7/8, after the paper maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits. 

 Providian Financial increased 9 to 97, as concerns eased further about the San Francisco consumer lender's exposure to litigation. In May, the San Francisco district attorney's office began investigating Providian's lending practices. The San Francisco Chronicle reported the company is talking with the district attorney's office about a settlement. 

 Enron rose 1 15/16 to 38 15/16 as First Boston reiterated its buy rating on the Houston utility concern, citing confidence the company will live up to earnings expectations. 

 Shares of i2 Technologies rose 6 5/32 to 48 15/16 on Nasdaq as First Boston raised its price target on the stock of the supply chain management-software developer to $60 from $40. 

 Metromedia Fiber Network rose 3 1/8 to 36 on Nasdaq; the New York fiber-optic-communications-network operator will provide Internet technology to eBay's Web sites in a pact announced Friday. 

 Biogen fell 3 3/4 to 84 5/16 on Nasdaq after the Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter results Thursday, but Salomon Smith Barney made some pessimistic comments about the stock. Salomon said based on estimated earnings for 2000 the stock is expensive. 

 Quantum-DLT & Storage Systems fell 1 7/8 to 11 1/2. Robertson Stephens cut its rating on the Milpitas, Calif., tape-driver maker, citing expectations of weakness in the company's earnings in the final quarter of the year.

 Report on Business: International 
 U.S. corporations warn of grim quarterly results But numbers will reveal one of strongest times in years

 New York --  Some of the best-known corporate names in the United States have prepared investors to expect unpleasant surprises when they release their third-quarter results. 

 Coca-Cola Co. led off the quarterly parade of woe a month ago. Seagram Co. Ltd. sounded a warning about cash flow from its music division. Gillette Co. shaved several points off sales forecasts. Apple Computer Inc. said earnings would fall 20 to 30 per cent short of estimates. Mattel Inc.'s grim pronouncement that its profit would fall substantially below analysts' forecasts prompted shareholder lawsuits and calls for the head of chief executive officer Jill Barad. 

 Xerox Corp. joined in the litany of misery Friday, warning that profit would be at least 10 per cent below estimates. As in most of the other cases, the impact on the company's stock was immediate and brutal -- a 25-per-cent plunge in one day. 

 So all this means U.S. corporate profits are on the downward slope and jittery investors have legitimate cause to worry, right? 

 Wrong, at least for now. 

 When the numbers start pouring in in earnest this week, they will reveal not a dud of a quarter but one of the strongest periods in years, analysts say. 

 "The good news is that it's going to be a terrific quarter for earnings," said Charles Hill, director of research with Boston-based First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' estimates. 

 The buoyant earnings are "one of the justifications why people can look at the market and still remain bullish, even in this high interest rate environment," said Barry Hyman, a senior market analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc. 

 The consensus forecast for the quarter calls for overall profit growth of 19.3 per cent from a year ago for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index, Mr. Hill said. 

 "We expect 22 per cent." 

 That would be the strongest year-over-year gain since 1995 and likely the highest it will reach for some time. 

 "Enjoy it while you can. This is the peak. But we don't mean to suggest things are tanking," Mr. Hill said. 

 The picture looks exceptionally healthy in comparison with the disastrous period a year ago when the Asian financial crisis, the Russian meltdown and severe problems in Latin America hammered the profits of U.S. multinationals and the big financial services companies. 

 A couple of sectors, notably consumer staples, which includes the Coca-Colas, Gillettes and Avons of this world, and transportation, have been slow to recover, mainly because of the strong U.S. dollar. 

 Other companies face industry-specific problems that have been worsening. The makers of personal computers and office machines, for example, are trapped in cutthroat competition amid falling prices. The U.S. airlines are battling tooth-and-nail for market share at the expense of profits. 

 Insurance profits have been swept away by hurricanes and floods. U.S. insurers will have to pay out more than $2-billion (U.S.) to meet third-quarter damage claims, most of them related to the devastation caused by Hurricane Floyd. 

 As a result, Allstate Corp., Chubb Corp. and others slashed earnings projections. In its first such warning, Allstate said operating profit would be about 30 per cent below the analysts' consensus. 

 Although other extremely high-profile companies and long-time stock market darlings have issued profit alerts in what has become a quarterly ritual -- the "preannouncement season" -- the totals are close to what they were a year ago. 

 Of more than 100 S&P 500 companies that have so far given what the analysts like to call "guidance" in advance of the actual results, 42 per cent have issued negative warnings, according to statistics provided by First Call. That compares with 43 per cent at the same point a year ago. 

 Gillette, the giant maker of razor blades, pens and other consumer products, has signalled negative surprises for so many quarters that analysts are no longer surprised. 

 Another 19 per cent of companies have advised that profit will be higher than forecast, compared with 15 per cent a year earlier. The rest have confirmed analysts' estimates, often to assuage concerns among investors stemming from warnings by other companies in the same industry. 

 For every Apple, Xerox and Gillette, there is a Dell Computer Corp., with a projected profit gain of more than 30 per cent from a year earlier; General Electric Corp., which has already reported a 16-per-cent improvement; General Motors Corp., which was saddled last year with the effects of a crippling strike; and the major oil companies, which have been raking in the benefits of higher oil prices. 

 In fact, oil companies as a group go to first from worst among the S&P 500 companies, with a projected profit gain of 47 per cent in the third quarter and 99 per cent for the final three months. That follows a 20-per-cent decline in the second quarter. 

 Most companies with good news prefer to save it for the actual release of results. That way, analysts say, they will look better for having beaten the Wall Street estimates. 

 Profit growth among S&P 500 companies will be about 17 per cent for the full year, declining to about 13 per cent in 2000, Mr. Hill said. Both numbers are well above the long-term average of 7 per cent. 

 The corporate outlook is so positive thanks in large measure to the still booming U.S. market, the recovery abroad and the remarkable productivity gains of the past few years. 

 Analysts generally underestimated how well corporations would perform this year, said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist with New York-based Gruntal & Co. LLC. 

 "This is the first year in 28 years that the analysts have been raising their estimates [of profit expansion] throughout the year." 

 Mr. Battipaglia, a noted Wall Street bull, expects about 12-per-cent profit growth next year, as U.S. companies post gains in the high single digits from domestic operations alone, and key foreign markets continue their recovery.

 Design-Software Concern Structural Dynamics Issues  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Structural Dynamics Research Corp. tumbled Wednesday after the software company warned earnings and revenue for the third quarter will fall well short of analysts' expectations. 

 On the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of Structural Dynamics (SDRC) closed Wednesday down $3.563, or 23%, at $11.938. 

 The firm, which is based in Cincinnati, develops computer-aided design software for auto makers and other companies. Structural Dynamics is best known for supplying Ford Motor Co. with design software. Ford has been able to cut the cost of designing key parts while also greatly trimming the time it takes to design and build them. 

 Excluding acquisition-related charges, the company expects to post third-quarter earnings of about 12 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of around 30 cents per share. Structural Dynamics said revenue will be about $109 million, shy of analysts' estimates of around $116 million. 

 The company said revenue for its Metaphase software was $30 million, up 23% from the year-ago quarter. However, revenue from its older I-DEAS software rose just 2% from last year, which the company attributes to a global softening in the mechanical design software market. Structural Dynamics said it remains positive about its outlook for the growth of Metaphase, particularly the products expanded use by the automotive industry.

 Fertilizer Profits Expected to Fall In Third Quarter --- Big Producers Feel Pinch From Poor Planting, Low Demand and Prices 

 By Scott Eden 
Dow Jones Newswires

6 October 1999

 NEW YORK -- A terrible planting season grew into an even worse summer for fertilizer companies, with demand sickly, prices weak and third-quarter earnings expected to be sharply lower. 

 Going into the period -- typically the year's slowest because farms in North America have finished planting -- the industry faced bloated inventories. The fortunes of the fertilizer trade rest squarely on the shoulders of North America's farmers, who suffered from their own problems this summer, namely cheap corn and grain prices. Pinching pennies and hoping to curb supply, farmers seeded fewer fields and, as a result, needed less fertilizer. 

 Domestic consumption of fertilizer fell sharply from a year ago. Instead of the widely foreseen 2% to 4% drop from 1998 levels, consumption declined, according to Credit Suisse First Boston's David Silver, 4% to 12% across the industry's three major product offerings: nitrogen, phosphate and potassium -- the last more commonly known as potash. 

 To burn off excess inventory, companies idled factories and slashed prices to move merchandise overseas. 

 "It's a combination of weak volumes and weak prices, and obviously that doesn't augur well for earnings," Donald Carson, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities, said. 

 Prices for Gulf of Mexico natural gas, the most important ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers, rocketed during the quarter, squeezing already razor-thin profit margins. Natural gas consumes about 70% of the cost to make ammonia-the principal nitrogen fertilizer. "Prices were already weak, and then they got smacked from the cost side," Mr. Silver said. 

 Nitrogen- and phosphate-based products felt the biggest sting from plummeting prices, caused by oversupply from other countries and miserable demand in North America, analysts said. Prices for di-ammonium phosphate, or DAP, tumbled to $140 a metric ton from $185 at the beginning of the year, Salomon Smith Barney analyst James Wilbur said, depressed by low demand and fears new plants opening in India and Australia would dilute an already flooded marketplace. 

 Of the biggest fertilizer producers, Mississippi Chemical Corp. in Yazoo City, Miss., could see the worst year-over-year declines. "Mississippi Chemical is heavily slanted toward nitrogen," Mr. Silver said. "They've been battered." 

 To deal with the market's nitrogen oversupply, the company temporarily shut down nitrogen plants in Louisiana. Last week, the company told investors that to save money it will slash its quarterly dividend to three cents from 10 cents. 

 Given its proximity to the Gulf Coast, the company has suffered from weak prices and high natural-gas costs. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial believe Mississippi Chemical will lose 26 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30; it had a 30-cent profit last year. 

 Another big nitrogen producer, Agrium Co., should avoid some pitfalls experienced by heavy users of Gulf Coast natural gas, Mr. Carson said. Agrium, Calgary, Alberta, buys gas drawn from Western Canada, which hasn't seen the same explosive price increases as the Gulf. Agrium "locked in 45% of their gas needs at well below market value," Mr. Carson said. 

 He expects Agrium to post earnings of five cents a share in the third quarter, below the First Call/Thomson Financial mean target of eight cents. Last year, the company earned 15 cents a share. 

 Because it generates a smaller percentage of business from nitrogen sales, Potash Co. of Saskatchewan, the largest fertilizer company in North America, should fare somewhat better than its peers. Despite its name, the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, company is evenly divided between the nitrogen, phosphate and potash businesses, according to Mr. Silver. 

 In an early September profit warning, Potash guided estimates to "about a quarter" of what it earned in the 1998 period, $1.01 a share. First Call/Thomson Financial has a mean target for the third period of 30 cents a share, with Mr. Silver and Mr. Carson closer to company guidance at 25 cents. 

 Potash said it will take a $57 million charge to permanently close two nitrogen plants in Iowa and Nebraska; it also said it would cut phosphate production at plants in Florida. 

 Elsewhere, sinking phosphate prices will likely maim earnings from IMC Global Inc., the world's biggest DAP supplier. "Each $10 reduction [per metric ton] in DAP prices costs 30 cents a share in annual earnings for IMC," Mr. Carson said. "That's how tethered they are to prices." 

 Like many of its peers, IMC, Northbrook, Ill., tried to stanch collapsing phosphate prices by suspending production at a Florida plant, operated by a joint venture between IMC and Phosphate Resource Partners LP. 

 Analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, see IMC earning 13 cents a share in its third quarter, down from 43 cents a year ago. Mr. Carson recently "slashed" his third-quarter estimate for IMC to 10 cents based on lower DAP prices.

 Oil resumes fall after recent gain, pressures shares.

 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell for a second day running Tuesday, pressuring energy company shares, amid market fears an upcoming meeting of the oil ministers of three key oil producers would discuss global output level changes. 

 NYMEX November crude settled 31 cents lower at $23.45 a barrel, with trade buying helping it recover half of the day's losses that took it 10 cents below the $23.00 barrier. 

 That decline shaved $1.50 off crude's value on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) since Monday, when players pocketed profits from the latest leg in oil's seven-month-long rally. 

 Widely-watched trade group data citing a small build in U.S. crude inventories pushed the contract a little lower in Tuesday's aftermarket, but most traders will seek confirmation of the numbers in Wednesday's data from the U.S. Department of Energy before taking on new positions. 

 The report from the American Petroleum Institue (API), issued after the close of regular NYMEX trade, said crude stocks in the United States rose 1.00 million barrels to 306 million barrels in the week ended October 1. 

 Despite a consensus view forecasting a draw of 1.5 million barrels, some market players had anticipated a build in crude stocks arguing there would be less demand for oil now that many U.S. refiners were entering the fall turnaround season. 

 European refinery cutbacks because of low profit margins may have trimmed offtake there also, they said. 

 Traders said the decline in oil prices on Tuesday were partly blamed on news that the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, will meet in November in Riyadh. Despite denials from a senior Saudi official that the meeting will discuss production, some traders were sceptical. 

 Oil markets are very sensitive now to talk of any increases in global crude production - with output cuts orchestrated by the main producers being the key fundamental factor behind the doubling of oil prices from record lows late last year. 

 On the stock markets, Halliburton lost sharply, down 6-1/16 at 34-1/4, after the world's largest oil services company warned its third-quarter earnings, likely to be 11 to 13 cents a share, will fall short of analysts' estimates. 

 The Philadelphia Oil Services Index was down a hefty 7.00 percent at 69.00 at one point before closing 5.44 percent down at 70.16, as other firms in the sector eased, like Schlumberger Ltd. and Baker Hughes Inc., off 3-7/16 to 58-5/16 and 1 to 26-9/16 respectively. 

 "The profit warning from Halliburton...was enough to get some people spooked, trading some 14 million shares. It was a desire by some to protect profits," John Lovoi, oil industry analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, told Reuters. 

 "Obviously there is feeling that something will happen in the oil market, it is tight and soon inventories will be at late 1996 levels and OPEC will be forced to do something... There are rumblings from many places about production increases," Lovoi added. 

 Big Oil shares were also pressed by oil's fall. The biggest two, Exxon and Mobil, saw sentiment sapped also after Deutsche Banc Alex Brown lowered their third-quarter earnings estimates by five and 10 cents a share respectively. 

 But Alex Brown analyst Michael Young said major oil company results overall should be "up sharply" from a year ago. 

 Exxon closed 3/4 lower at 72-1/8, Mobil eased 1-7/8 to 94-5/8, while Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. eased 1-10/16 and 2-8/16 to 84-9/16 and 60-7/16, respectively. 

 Standard & Poor's Oil International Oil Index fell 1.64 percent or 15.00 points to 899.48 while the Dow Industrial Average closed with a marginal change, down 0.01 percent at 10,400.59 points. 

 The wider share market shed early mild gains after the Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged but said it was leaning towards an increase futurely. ((New York Newsdesk 1 212 859-1895; fax 212 859-1629; email haitham.haddadin@reuters.com)).

 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Stocks held onto gains at midday on Tuesday as Wall Street showed increasing confidence the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates. 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  was up 61 points, or 0.59 percent, at 10,462. The Nasdaq composite index	   rose 24 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,820. Declining stocks were only slightly outpacing advancers, but 85 stocks had set new lows while only 45 were at news highs.


 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 4/32 with the yield at 6.09 percent, unchanged from Monday. 

 "Right now we are in a holding pattern until later today," said Arnie Owen, managing director of capital markets, Cruttenden Roth in Newport Beach, Calif. 

 Traders were waiting for the 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT) announcement on interest rates from the Federal Reserve's policy setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee. Analysts expect there will be no increase, but many think the FOMC may lean toward a future hike by switching to a tightening bias. 

 "When the news comes out at 2:15, expect anything," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc. 

 Traders may opt to take profits after the rally that began Monday, or it could extend its gains further, but not too broadly, Hyman said. On Monday, the Dow jumped 128 points. 

 "I think the market's on good footing here," Hyman said, citing the positive prospects for third quarter earnings that should prevent the Dow from slipping 10-percent from its all-time high of 11,326 set on Aug. 25. 

 "The upward gains should be consistent, but compared to previous rallies, not as exciting," Hyman said. 

 The leading corporate news was the confirmation that Sprint Corp. , the third-largest long-distance company in the United States, will be acquired by MCI WorldCom Inc. , the No. 2 long-distance carrier. 

 The deal, valued at $115 billion excluding debt, is the largest corporate takeover ever. 

 MCI shares were down 3-1/4 at 68-3/8 and Sprint was up 3/16 at at 60-3/16. 

 Elsewhere in the sector, AT&T Corp, , the No. 1 telephone company and a member of the Dow component, was up 1-1/4 at 44-7/8. It was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Other stocks in the news included America Online Inc. , which was up 2-3/8 at 111-1/8 on active volume as it launched a major software upgrade for the 18 million members on its flagship Internet service. 

 MCN Energy Co.  was up 6-5/16 at 24 after electric utility DTE Energy Co.  said it would buy the natural gas holding company in a $2.6 billion cash and stock deal to create the largest electric and gas utility in Michigan. 

 DTE was down 2-13/16 at 34-3/16. 

 Oil services company Halliburton Co.  fell 5-9/16 to 34-3/4 after the company issued a profit warning for the third quarter. 

 Micron Technology Inc.  was up 5 at 79-1/8 after reporting a quarterly loss far less than what Wall Street was expecting. 

 In economic news, the Conference Board said the widely-watched Index of Leading Economic Indicators, a measure of future economic activity, fell 0.1 percent in August, the first drop since April. The decline matched expectations of Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters. 

 The decline was due to slow vendor deliveries and falling stock prices.

 Wall Street to open flat, telecom strength predicted.

 NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Wall Street with its eyes glued to the afternoon Federal Reserve interest rate meeting expects a flat opening on Tuesday, with strength in the technology sector offset by weakness in oil services. 

 Ahead of the Fed meeting, the market will react to the largest merger in history - between long-distance companies Sprint Corp.  and MCI Worldcom Inc.  - as well as corporate earnings and profit warnings. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 future index for December was down 1 point at 1,317. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 6/32 with a yield of 6.1 percent. 

 "We'll be quiet and sideways," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., Boston. "There's probably no no real reason to give it back." 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  on Monday closed up 128.23 points, or 1.25 percent, at 10,401.23. The Nasdaq composite index   rose 58.88 points, or 2.15 percent, to 2,795.73. The Standard & Poor's 500 index	  gained 21.79 points, or 1.70 percent, at 1,304.60.



"We had a nice move yesterday which is an expectation of no change. The Fed will do no harm," said Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.



But he expects profit-taking in the morning, weakness in the oil service sector due to a profit warning from Halliburton Co.  and a positive bounce for the technology sector after Micron Technology Inc. beat earnings expectations.



"But the blue chips might meander around waiting for the Fed," he said.



The leading corporate news of the day was the confirmation that Sprint Corp. , the third-largest long-distance company in the United States, will be purchased by MCI WorldCom Inc. , the No. 2 long-distance carrier.



The deal, valued at $129 billion, is the largest corporate takeover ever.



On Monday, excitement over the prospects of the deal and a rival offer from BellSouth Corp.  helped lead the market to a strong rally. Hogan said he expects the same enthusiasm on Tuesday.



"There's going to be more consolidation in that sector," Hogan said. "The rest of the telecoms will be up today."



The afternoon session will be dominated by the Fed's interest rate decision.



The Federal Reserve's policy setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee will meet Tuesday afternoon to decide if interest rates should be raised for a third time this year.



Analysts almost across the board are convinced there will be no raise in rates, but some think the FOMC may announce at 2:15 p.m. EDT (1815 GMT) that it is leaning toward a future increase, with a tightening bias.



"I think the market has clearly discounted any move the Fed could take," Hogan said, citing the market's recent declines. "We could easily withstand whatever they do."



If they do tighten, Hogan said he expects a knee-jerk decline that could last 30 minutes or through the end of the day. But if they do nothing: "We make a beeline to 12,000 for the end of the year," he said.



Other economic data expected on Tuesday includes the August leading indicators and the September non-manufacturing numbers from the National Association of Purchasing Management.



The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column reports that even though the principals in the AMFM Inc.  and Clear Channel Communications Inc.  merger handled most of the deal themselves, they shared the wealth and brought in the financial teams that have helped the companies in the past as a nod of gratitude.

 NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Stocks racked up big gains at midday on Monday as Wall Street showed a certain comfort level, a day before the Federal Reserve meets to decide if interest rates will be raised a third time this year. 


The Dow Jones industrial average	  was up 132 points, or 1.29 percent, at 10,405. The Nasdaq composite index	   was up 33 points, or 1.24 percent, at 2,770.


 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was flat with the yield slipping to 6.13 percent from 6.14 percent on Friday. 

 Financial stocks were strong among the Dow component, with American Express Co.  up 2-5/16 at 133-11/16, Citigroup Inc.  up 1-3/16 at 44-5/16 and JP Morgan & Co. Inc.  gaining 1-5/16 at 117-1/16. 

 Most analysts expect the Fed will not change rates and many are already trying to put behind them Tuesday's interest rate-setting meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. 

 "Regardless of the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, there remains little evidence of a credible inflation threat while profits continue to expand," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer of Gruntal & Co. in a note to investors. 

 Overnight, the "tankan" quarterly survey of Japanese business sentiment was released, showing an across-the-board improvement of sentiment but cuts in capital investments. 

 The dollar rose against the Japanese yen to 106.1 from 105.17 in late U.S. currency trading Friday. 

 Peter Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments, characterised the Japanese report as "lukewarm" and cited the capital spending decline for the strength in the dollar. 

 Paul Rich, a trader at BT Brokerage said the stock market was reacting favourably to a lot of good news, including positive U.S. economic indicators, strong reports from automakers and enthusiasm in technology stocks. 

 "There's still a lot of long term confidence here and I think it's showing through," Rich said. 

 Telecommunications shares were active, with all three of the nation's long-distance companies in the news. 

 Shares in Sprint Corp. , the No. 3 U.S. long-distance company, were up 2-15/16 at 59-15/16, amid reports it was entertaining rival bids from MCI WorldCom Inc. , the No. 2 long-distance company as well as BellSouth Corp. . 

 MCI stock was up 1-1/4 at 71-13/16 and BellSouth was down 2-14/16 at 42-11/16. 

 Among the Dow component, AT&T Corp. , the No. 1 long-distance company, was up 1-11/16 at 43-3/8 as analyst warmed to speculation that the company might issue three stocks to track the performance of its wireless unit, cable and Internet ventures and business outsourcing unit. 

 Among other stocks in the news, Barbie-maker Mattel Inc.  issued a profit warning and saw its stock drop 3-7/8 to 13. 

 Walgreen Co.  rose 5/16 to 25 after the nation's largest drug store chain reported a rise in quarterly profits.

 Airport Operator In U.K. Sees Hit From EU Action

 LONDON -- BAA PLC warned that fiscal full-year profit was likely to be hit by this past summer's abolition of duty-free sales in the European Union. Shares in the airport operator plummeted 17%. 

 BAA said Friday that pre-exceptional pretax profit for the year ending March 2000 is likely to be GBP 30 million ($49.6 million) to GBP 45 million below current market forecasts of GBP 505 million. The warning triggered a string of profit downgrades by analysts, sending the shares skidding. By the day's close, the shares were down 1.075 to 5.075. BAA's shares already had underperformed the FTSE All Share Index by 17% in the year to date based on Thursday's closing price. 

 BAA also said sales at World Duty Free America, BAA's U.S. retail arm, were below last year's performance during the six months to September 1999. 

 Formerly known as the British Airports Authority, BAA owns and operates seven U.K. airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. BAA also has won a contract to manage Eurotunnel's retail sales at the channel-tunnel operator's two terminals in Calais and Folkestone. 

 Analysts said the warning undermined confidence in the company, because BAA had been generally upbeat about its results since the abolition of duty-free sales in Europe. 

 Duty-free and tax-free sales disappeared on June 30 within the European Union, but BAA pledged to maintain dutyfree and tax-free prices for passengers traveling within Europe. It blamed the decline in its duty-free sales on customer confusion about the new rules.

 Earnings woes deadly for funeral stocks DEATH CARE IN THE DOLDRUMS Companies blame declining mortality rates for their troubles, but analysts point to ill-advised acquisitions, poor management and failures to keep pace with consumers' changing tastes.

 After Service Corp. International, the world's largest chain of funeral homes and cemeteries, lowered estimates of quarterly earnings last Jan. 26, the mood at a cross-town competitor was anything but cheerful. 

 "We knew that wasn't good news," said Tom Livengood, chief financial officer of Carriage Services Inc., based, like its rival, in Houston. 

 SCI linked its shrinking profits to declining death rates in its main markets. Predictably, its stock price reeled. So did those of its competitors as many investors reasoned that a slowdown in the death toll meant weaker business for funeral homes generally. 

 Shares of the four biggest companies have lost about three-quarters of their value since Jan. 1. In June, Burnaby, B.C.-based Loewen Inc., the No. 2 funeral home operator, filed for bankruptcy protection after its shares fell 93 per cent. 

 The carnage continues as SCI shares fell $2.69 (U.S.) to $7.87 in trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange on a warning that third-quarter profit will be less than expected. 

 But don't blame fatality counts for gloomy times in the $14-billion (U.S.), so-called death care industry. A spree of ill-advised acquisitions, poor management of local operations and failures to keep pace with consumers' changing tastes are largely to blame for the industry's problems, analysts and executives say. 

 "They overpaid for assets," Terrence Dwyer, a debt analyst at KDP Investment Advisors, said of the struggling funeral home and cemetery operators. "A lot of companies do." 

 SCI -- with an empire of 3,824 funeral homes, 520 cemeteries and 198 crematoriums worldwide -- said in January it made fewer acquisitions than expected in the fourth quarter because prices had gone up too much. 

 For investors who had assumed the industry would continue to consolidate, this was as troubling as SCI's complaint about shrinking death counts. 

 "Without acquisitions, they couldn't make their numbers," said John Ransom, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates. 

 Companies that grew big by buying many funeral homes lost business to local competitors when they failed to lower prices or improve services and products -- the very reasons why many companies tout acquisitions in the first place, said Joshua Rosen, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. As for the death rate, fluctuations are inevitable. U.S. deaths declined from September, 1998, to February, 1999, according to a Raymond James report. Deaths slowed again last summer. 

 Yet, the toll has risen this decade. About 2.3 million Americans died in 1997, the last year for which figures are available, compared with 2.1 million in 1990. 

 At different times, Loewen and Hillenbrand Industries Inc. of Batesville, Ind., the world's largest casket maker, joined SCI in citing a sluggish death count as the source of disappointing earnings. News reports picked up the angle "and drew into it more than what was warranted," Mr. Livengood said. 

 Carriage Services, the fourth largest funeral home operator, didn't experience significant slumps in business this year. Second-quarter net income rose 61 per cent this year to $2.9-million, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Still, Carriage shares fell 71 per cent from a high of $29 on Jan. 11 in the suction caused by SCI's nosedive. 

 "Companies have used death rates as a reason for poor performance," said Melvin Payne, Carriage's chairman and chief executive officer -- a claim, he said, that's "not valid." 

 Death care began to go corporate in the 1960s when Houston mortuary operator Robert Waltrip started buying local funeral homes and running them on a standardized basis to trim administrative, purchasing and marketing costs. His Service Corp. was soon joined by other consolidators. 

 Competition heated up in 1996 when SCI offered to buy rival Loewen. Loewen wouldn't sell and made a spate of acquisitions to fend off the hostile bid. Rather than pull back when prices continued to spiral higher, SCI kept buying, too. 

 Jefferies & Co. analyst Peter Martin said he suspects the acquisition rivalry between Loewen and SCI was driven "more on [gaining] market share and ego than on sound business decisions." 

 In all, publicly traded companies, which own 13 per cent of the United States' 21,989 funeral homes, spent $3.2-billion on acquisitions in 1997 and 1998, Mr. Rosen said. They paid 70 per cent more for properties in 1998 than they did in 1993. 

 Those days are over; Mr. Rosen predicts the consolidators will spend only $370-million this year. 

 Many properties failed to justify their prices. Loewen lost $599-million in 1998, blaming a lower than expected death rate in North America that cut the number of funerals performed by 8 per cent. Last March, Loewen sold 124 cemeteries and three funeral homes. In June, $2.3-billion in debt, the chain of 1,100 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries in the United States, Britain and Canada filed for bankruptcy. 

 As for SCI, its stock has fallen 70 per cent this year. Much of the drop came Jan. 26, the day the company warned of lower than expected earnings, sending its share price down 44 per cent. 

 It wasn't the last time funeral home companies and their suppliers warned of lower than expected profits and fewer acquisitions. 

 A month after the January warning, SCI president L. William Heiligbrodt resigned. In April, the company said it would slash 800 jobs and reported quarterly earnings that were 22 per cent lower than the year before. 

 In August, casket maker Hillenbrand Industries warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' expectations, primarily because of lower sales in its hospital equipment business. The company also said business lagged because of fewer deaths. Hillenbrand stock promptly dropped 22 per cent. 

 On Aug. 13, Stewart Enterprises Inc., the third largest funeral home operator, warned that fiscal third-quarter and fourth-quarter earnings would be worse than expected because more customers were choosing cremation and less expensive funeral services. The Metairie, La.-based company later said its acquisition activity had slowed because it was refusing to pay inflated prices. 

 Despite the doldrums, analysts say there's no need to write the industry's obituary. In the long run, death care companies will recover by cooling on acquisitions, cutting costs, reducing prices and improving customer services -- "boring but essential" moves, Mr. Ransom said. 

 Successful funeral homes will adapt to consumer trends, including the growing popularity of cremation and customized funerals, caskets and urns, analysts said. 

 Consolidation still makes sense in the death-care industry -- so long as companies don't overpay. By buying funeral homes in clusters, chains can share services, generating profit margins more than twice those of their independent counterparts, Mr. Rosen said. 

 The pace of acquisitions eventually will accelerate as local operators pare their asking prices to match what the big chains are willing to pay. Time, too, is on the industry's side. The first baby boomers turn 65 in 2011. U.S. deaths are expected to balloon to three million a year by 2020 and to four million by 2050. "The demographics of the population are working in our favour," said Stewart's chief executive officer, Joseph Henican. 

 This is one business that won't go away, Mr. Dwyer said. "People," he said, "are going to continue to die."

 =Appeals Court Reinstates Georgia Rollover Case Vs. Ford

        WASHINGTON (FFBN) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a Georgia
product liability action against Ford Motor Co. (F) arising from a 1994
rollover accident of a Bronco II in which one occupant was killed and three
others seriously injured.
        The lower court granted summary judgment for Ford and dismissed the
suit, finding that Georgia law barred claims filed more than 10 years from
the original sale of the vehicle.  The Bronco II at issue was a pre-owned
1986 model and the suit was filed in November 1996.
        The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta
reversed, ruling that the plaintiffs provided sufficient evidence to support
a finding that Ford acted with a "willful, reckless or wanton disregard for
property or life," which is an exception to the 10-year limitation.
        The unanimous Sept. 29 opinion, authored by Senior Circuit Judge
Peter T. Fay, held that plaintiffs presented "an array of evidence
addressing Ford's knowledge of stability problems with the Bronco II and its
decision to forgo recommended safety alterations in the design because it
would either delay production or profits would be sacrificed."
        For example, the opinion continued, Ford was aware of a "60 Minutes"
television program that revealed severe rollover and stability problems with
the Jeep CJ -- a vehicle the Bronco II was closely patterned after.  Ford
engineers, responding to the stability problems, submitted five proposals
intended to increase the stability of the Bronco II.  Management selected
the least expensive proposal, according to the opinion, rendering the Bronco
II less stable than the Jeep CJ.
        "The appellants' design expert clearly stated that had Ford chosen
proposal #5, at an additional cost of only $83.00 per vehicle, the Bronco II
would have been a stable vehicle.  By selecting the least expensive measure,
proposal #2, Ford made profit a priority over the safety of the consumers,"
according to the opinion.
        This type of evidence, the court noted, has supported findings of a
reckless disregard for property or life, conscious indifference to
consequences and punitive damages in other Georgia cases.
        Plaintiffs' attorney Lance Cooper called the opinion well-reasoned
and said his clients are very happy that they will have their day in court.
"When all the evidence has been submitted to a jury," Cooper said, "Ford
will be held accountable for its actions regarding the Bronco II."
        Cooper said his clients are seeking damages for wrongful death, pain
and suffering and punitive damages, but he declined to specify the amount
sought.
        Ford spokesman Jim Cain said, "If this case is tried before a jury,
that will give us the opportunity to demonstrate using the engineering
history of the vehicle and the on-road performance of the vehicle that the
Bronco II is safe and reliable.  We'll also have the opportunity to cross-
examine their experts, and we're confident that the jury, when it has
possession of all the facts, will make the same decision other juries have
made -- that there is not a defect in the Bronco II."
        Cain noted that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) addressed the Bronco II rollover issue in a May 1999 letter to a
plaintiff's attorney who petitioned to reopen a safety investigation.  The
letter stated, "[T]he Bronco II has a first-event single-vehicle rollover
rate similar to several other vehicles, notably the [Jeep] CJ 5, 6 & 7,
Toyota 4Runner, Suzuki Samurai, Isuzu Trooper II, and GM S-10/S-15."
        Cain said that several things referred to in the court of appeals
opinion concern the way plaintiffs' attorneys have characterized
pre-production testing and development testing.
        However, the NHTSA wrote, "When viewed from a defect investigation
perspective, the fact that test reports suggest a relatively high rollover
propensity in pre-production Bronco II vehicles illustrates the extent of
the problem at the pre-production stage.  A variety of modifications were
made to the Bronco II after those tests that were likely to affect its
rollover propensity to some degree.  Thus, the in-service history of the
Bronco II with respect to rollover incidents is far more significant than
developmental and pre-production testing."
        Cain contends that a significant number of rollovers are caused by a
combination of driver error, such as traveling off-road and over-steering,
or the vehicle being tripped by a curb or being struck by another car or
truck. "The incidents of rollover from maneuvering, generally speaking, are
quite low," Cain said.
        The lower court also found that plaintiffs' "failure to warn claim"
was simply a restatement of the negligence claim and dismissed it as well.
The appeals court disagreed, ruling that plaintiffs introduced evidence
"tending to show" that Ford had "knowledge of stability problems," prior to
and after distribution of the 1986 Bronco II.
        In 1988, Ford's statisticians reported to management that the Bronco
II had a rollover fatality rate 3 1/2 times that of a standard utility
vehicle, according to evidence submitted in the lower court and relied on by
the appeals court.  In 1991 the NHTSA published the results of five
different static stability tests on 57 production vehicles and the Bronco II
rated worst overall, the opinion notes.  Ford failed to issue any post-sale
warnings regarding these stability problems, according to the opinion.
        Ford argued before the appellate court that summary judgment was
warranted because even had a more complete warning been given, it could not
have prevented the accident.  This argument is unpersuasive, the court
reasoned, because under Georgia law, a manufacturer breaches its duty to
warn if it fails to "adequately communicate the warning to the ultimate user
or fails to provide an adequate warning of the product's potential risk."
        Although a warning may have the net effect of preventing an
accident, that is not what is required by the law, according to the court.
"The law merely requires the warning to inform the consumer of the nature
and existence of the hazard, allowing him to make an informed decision
whether to take on the risk warned of."
        Because the Bronco II had a greater propensity to rollover, a
reasonable fact finder could conclude that Ford was required to provide a
more detailed warning for this vehicle than other sports utility vehicles,
the court concluded.
        Accordingly, the appeals court vacated the lower court's judgment
and remanded the case for trial.  Ford has 21 days to file a motion for
reconsideration.
        Other cases involving Bronco II rollovers have resulted in a $14
million award in a 1998 Ohio case, which is on appeal, and a $62.4 million
award in an Indiana case that was later reduced to $18.2 million and upheld
on appeal in February.

 Fertilizer Cos Seen Posting Dismal 3Q On Weak Demand

 By Scott Eden 

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A terrible planting season grew into an even worse summer for fertilizer companies, with demand sickly, prices weak and third-quarter earnings seen sharply below the previous year's. 

 Going into the period - typically the year's slowest because farms in North American have finished planting - the industry faced bloated inventories. The fortunes of the fertilizer trade rest squarely on the shoulders of North America's farmers, who suffered from their own problems this summer, namely cheap corn and grain prices. Pinching pennies and hoping to curb supply, farmers seeded fewer fields and, as a result, needed less fertilizer. 

 Indeed, domestic consumption of fertilizer fell sharply from a year ago. Instead of the widely foreseen 2% to 4% drop from 1998 levels, consumption declined, according to Credit Suisse First Boston's David Silver, 4% to 12% across the industry's three major product offerings: Nitrogen, phosphate and potassium - the last more commonly known as potash. 

 To burn off some of that excess inventory, companies idled factories both temporarily and permanently and slashed prices to move merchandise overseas. 

 "It's a combination of weak volumes and weak prices and obviously that doesn't auger well for earnings," said Donald Carson, analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities. 

 Meanwhile, prices for Gulf of Mexico natural gas, the most important ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers, rocketed during the quarter, squeezing already razor-thin profit margins. Natural gas, for instance, consumes about 70% of the cost to make ammonia - the principal nitrogen fertilizer. "Prices were already weak and then they got smacked from the cost side," Silver said. 

 Nitrogen- and phosphate-based products felt the biggest sting from plummeting prices, caused by oversupply from other countries and miserable demand in North America, analysts said. Prices for di-ammonium phosphate, or DAP, for instance, tumbled to $140 a metric ton from $185 at the beginning of the year, Salomon Smith Barney analyst James Wilbur said, depressed by low demand and fears that new plants opening in India and Australia would dilute an already flooded marketplace. 

 Of the biggest fertilizer producers, Mississippi Chemical Corp. (GRO), Yazoo City, Miss., could see the worst year-over-year declines. "Mississippi Chemical is heavily slanted toward nitrogen," Silver said. "They've been battered." 

 To deal with the market's broad nitrogen oversupply, the company temporarily shut down nitrogen plants in Louisiana. And only last week, the company told investors that to save money it will slash its quarterly dividend to 3 cents from 10 cents. 

 Given its proximity to the Gulf Coast, the company has suffered not just from weak prices, but also from high natural gas costs. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial currently believe Mississippi Chemical will lose 26 cents a share in its fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30; it had a 30-cent profit last year. 

 Another big nitrogen producer, Agrium Co. (AGU), should avoid some of the pitfalls experienced by heavy users of Gulf Coast natural gas, Carson said. Calgary-based Agrium buys gas drawn from Western Canada, which hasn't seen the same explosive price increases as the Gulf. Agrium "locked in 45% of their gas needs at well below market value," Carson said. 

 He expects Agrium to post earnings of 5 cents a share in the third quarter, below the First Call/Thomson Financial mean target of 8 cents. Last year, the company earned 15 cents a share. 

 Because it generates a smaller percentage of its business from nitrogen sales, Potash Co. of Saskatchewan (POT), the largest fertilizer company in North America, should fare somewhat better than its peers. Despite its name, the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, company is evenly divided between the nitrogen, phosphate and potash businesses, according to Silver. 

 In an early September profit warning, Potash guided estimates to "about a quarter" of what it earned in the 1998 period, $1.01 a share. Nonetheless, First Call/Thomson Financial has a mean target for the third period of 30 cents a share, with Silver and Carson closer to company guidance at 25 cents. 

 Potash said it will take a $57 million charge to permanently close two nitrogen plants in Iowa and Nebraska; it also said it would cut phosphate production at plants in Florida. 

 Elsewhere, sinking phosphate prices will likely maim earnings from IMC Global Inc. (IGL), the world's biggest DAP supplier. "Each $10 reduction (per metric ton) in DAP prices costs 30 cents a share in annual earnings for IMC," Carson said. "That's how tethered they are to prices." 

 Like many of its peers, IMC tried to stanch collapsing phosphate prices by suspending production at a plant in Florida, operated by a joint venture between IMC and Phosphate Resource Partners LP (PLP). 

 Analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, currently see IMC Global, Northbrook, Ill., earning 13 cents a share in its third quarter, down from 43 cents a year ago. Carson recently "slashed" his third-quarter estimate for IMC to 10 cents, the low end of the First Call/Thomson Financial range, based on lower DAP prices.

Shares of Redmond-based Apex fell as much as 36 percent today after the maker of switching systems and integrated cabinet systems for computer networks said second-half profit and revenue would be hurt by lost sales to Hewlett-Packard and problems with new products.

The stock fell as much as $6.813 to $11.875 in heavy trading today. At the close of the session, the stock was down $3.75, or 20 percent, to $14.938.

Profit in the third quarter, ending today, will be 21 cents to 23 cents a share, below the 27-cent average estimate of analysts polled by First Call, Apex said. The shortfall was caused by problems in the introduction of new products for an unidentified customer, the company said. Revenue is expected to be $23.75 million to $25 million. Robert Stone, an analyst at SG Cowen in Boston, was expecting revenue of $27.8 million.

The likely loss of Hewlett-Packard as a private-label, original-equipment-manufacturer customer will cut into profit and revenue in the fourth quarter, Apex said.

Hewlett-Packard accounted for 10 percent of Apex's sales in the first half.

 NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks and bonds pushed lower at midday Friday after a report showing surprising strength in the U.S. manufacturing sector fanned fears that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates on Tuesday. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) was down 98 points, or 0.95 percent, at 10,238. The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC) was down 21 points, or 0.77 percent, at 2,725. 

 "The markets are jittery," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. "No one wants to go too far out on the limb because we have the Fed meeting next week." 

 Wall Street stocks fell after the September National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index jumped to a reading of 57.8. 

 The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond also fell sharply, and was down 1-11/32 at midday with a yield of 6.14 percent 

 "The bonds didn't take the NAPM report that well, which was much stronger than consensus," said A.C. Moore, the chief investment strategist at Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. "It's one of the more reliable reports available." 

 Economists had expected the index, a measure of business conditions in the manufacturing sector, to edge up to 54.3 from a reading of 54.2. A reading above 50 on the index indicates expansion in the sector. 

 "This is an extremely negative signal to the market right now," said George Rodriguez, senior vice president of equities at Guzman & Co. in Jersey City, N.J. 

 August personal income and consumption figures were released. The data showed a rise of 0.5 percent, compared with the 0.4 percent rise expected by economist polled by Reuters. There was a 0.9 percent increase in spending and a 1.5 percent decline in savings. 

 The Dow is on its way to its sixth straight week of losses, including its record-setting loss a week ago of 524 points. 

 Among the Dow component, losses were broad-based Friday but heaviest in computer and financial stocks. 

 As bond yields shot higher, American Express Co. was down 3-1/4 at 131-3/8; J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc. was down 1-1/16 at 113-3/16 and Citigroup Inc. was down 15/16 at 43-1/16. 

 Hewlett-Packard Co. was down 4-7/16 at 87-9/16 after chief executive Carly Fiorina said the company had a "decent shot" at meeting fourth quarter earnings estimates. International Business Machines Corp. was down 2-15/16 at 118-7/16. 

 Ongoing analyst concerns about how the semiconductor industry would be impacted by the Sept. 21 Taiwan earthquake also sent down shares of Dell Computer Corp.. It was trading down 1-5/16 at 40-1/2. 

 A number of companies were trading lower after issuing profit warnings. 

 Cosmetics giant Revlon Inc., which was down 25 percent after it warned it will have a third-quarter loss and will not be in compliance with certain financial covenants. Shares were down 4-11/16 at 13-9/16. 

 The world's largest death care company, Service Corp International, was down 27 percent after warning its profits would not meet expectations based on lower cemetery income and labour problems in France. The stock was down 2-13/16 at 7-3/4. Earlier this year, the stock was selling as high as 40-9/16. 

 York International Corp., a maker of heating and and cooling products, fell 12-5/8, or 35 percent, to 23-5/16 after issuing a profit warning, citing poor Latin American performance and operating inefficiencies. 

 But shares in Worthington Foods Inc. were up 8-5/8 at 23 after Kellogg Co., the world's largest cereal maker, said it would buy the vegetarian and health foods company for $24 a share. 

 Kellogg shares were down 9/16 at 36-7/8.

 NEW YORK, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks remained down in late morning trading on Friday, but off session lows hit after new economic data aroused fears the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next week. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) was down 48 points, or 0.47 percent, at 10,288. The Nasdaq composite index .IXIC) was down 16 points, or 0.60 percent, at 2,729.

 "This is an extremely negative signal to the market right now," said George Rodriguez, senior vice president of equities at Guzman & Co. in Jersey City, N.J. "This, on top of the numbers that came out this morning are causing concerns about inflationary pressure leading into next Tuesday."

 Among active stocks on Friday morning was cosmetics giant Revlon Inc., which was down 25 percent after it warned it will have a third-quarter loss and will not be in compliance with certain financial covenants. Shares were down 4-11/16 at 13-9/16.

 FOCUS-Service Corp stock tumbles on  profit warning .

 HOUSTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Service Corp. International , the world's biggest provider of funeral and cemetery services, issued its third profit warning of the year Friday, triggering a steep fall in the company's stock price. 

 The Houston-based company, with over 3,800 funeral parlours and 500 cemeteries in 20 countries, said third-quarter earnings would fall well short of Wall Street analysts' estimates due to slower death rates and delays to a downsizing programme in France. 

 Service Corp. said it expected third-quarter earnings of 10 to 13 cents per share, roughly half of analysts' consensus forecast of 22 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 1998 were 32 cents. 

 The statement, which followed similar warnings of earnings shortfalls issued by the company in January and July, triggered heavy selling of the company's stock. 

 Service Corp. shares closed down $2.69, or 25.4 percent, at $7.88 on volume of 7.4 million shares. The stock is now worth about one sixth of its July 1998 peak of $47.13. 

 The company said it was looking at ways to increase its cash flow and generate higher returns, including making fewer acquisitions, lowering capital spending and selling some assets. 

 Service Corp. said third-quarter operating income at its North American cemetery business would fall short of projections by $20-$25 million due to factors such as slower death rates and the recent flooding and evacuations along the Atlantic Coast. 

 The number of deaths fell two percent in the United States in the third quarter, although the number of Service Corp. funerals fell only one percent, company executives said. 

 A reduction of the company's workforce in France by 600 people proceeded more slowly than expected, leading to a shortfall of $6-$8 million in projected third-quarter operating income from the company's French funeral operations. 

 But company executives said during a conference call with analysts and reporters that the job cuts would still yield annual savings of $20-$25 million by next year. 

 Gerry Pullins, Vice President for International Operations, said the high cost of acquisitions had led Service Corp. to decide that it would no longer pursue growth through acquisitions, but would grow its business organically instead. 

 "We are restructuring the company from an acquisition company to an operating company," he said. 

 Chief Financial Officer George Champagne said Service Corp. would focus on "heritage" sales of cemetery lots and mausoleum spaces because of their potential for follow-on sales of goods and services, even though the initial sale was often difficult. 

 "These customers will provide the opportunity for further sales down the road," he said. 

 Service Corp. said some factors that had adversely affected the company's earnings in the third quarter might also impact fourth-quarter results. 

 Champagne said the company would provide guidance on its fourth quarter earnings and an indication for 2000 when it publishes full third-quarter results in late October. 

 Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones, said she was surprised by the extent of the decline in third-quarter earnings and had downgraded Service Corp's stock to Hold from Buy. 

 "We are now questioning management's ability to be able to execute a turnaround, at least in the near term, for this company," she said.

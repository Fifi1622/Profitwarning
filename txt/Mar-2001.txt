 CHICAGO, March 29 (Reuters) - Telecommunications equipment giant Nortel Networks Corp.'s troubles may spark a new round of profit warnings in the industry, analysts and portfolio managers said on Thursday. 

 In an industry slammed by declining customer spending and an overall economic slowdown that is spreading overseas, Nortel's slashing this week of its first-quarter profit estimates may set the stage for similar actions by telecom customers, suppliers and competitors, analysts said. 

 Among those likely to warn, analysts and portfolio managers said, are New Economy bellwethers Cisco Systems Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corp. , both of which already have either warned of the slowdown's impact or cut estimates. 

 "All the companies are in the same boat and the boat is taking water a little bit," said Stephen Gauthier, portfolio manager with Pictet & Cie in Montreal. 

 Other prime candidates include France's Alcatel , telecom equipment giant Lucent Technologies Inc. and Sweden's Ericsson , the No. 3 maker of cell phones behind Finland's Nokia and Motorola Inc. , analysts said. 

 Cisco, JDS Uniphase and Lucent officials declined to comment, while those at Alcatel and Ericsson couldn't be reached. 

 The problem is the economic slowdown that led many U.S. carriers to cut or delay capital spending, ING Barings analyst Tom Lauria said. That problem has begun spreading overseas. 

 "The telecom service provider environment is so difficult right now that every dollar of spending is being extremely scrutinized," he said. 

 Cisco has lately pointed repeatedly to the overseas impact, a sign that many analysts said is the networking giant's subtle way of warning them to cut their profit forecasts for the upcoming fiscal third quarter. 

 The San Jose, Calif.-based firm's exposure to smaller customers - now being squeezed in the slowdown - led Chris Bonavico, portfolio manager of the $200 million Transamerica Premiere Aggressive Growth Fund, to sell all his Cisco shares last year. 

 "Everything is slowing down," he said. "Telecom is slowing down the hardest because it's got too much easy money lent and invested in the sector, so it's going to feel the most pain." 

 JDS Uniphase could cut its third-quarter estimates a third time based mainly on the fact that it is a major supplier for Nortel, analysts and portfolio managers said. 

 Alcatel hasn't cut profit or revenue forecasts, but that may not last as the slowdown spreads to Europe and Asia where the French cell-phone maker collects most of its sales. 

 Profit margins are being squeezed as companies suffer with smaller markets and more intense competition, analysts said. 

 The broader-based companies will be the first to cut their estimates, Lehman Brothers analyst Steven Levy said. 

 Cisco may make a profit warning next week, followed by Alcatel and Lucent, he said. Speculation also has centered on British telecom equipment maker Marconi Plc. 

 "Every company in this sector is a candidate to pre-announce (lower earnings), even companies that have already pre-announced," Sanford Bernstein analyst Paul Sagawa said. 

 Some analysts and portfolio managers said that even companies so far unaffected by the slowdown - Ciena Corp. , Juniper Networks and Redback Networks Inc. - may eventually be hurt. Juniper and Redback declined comment, Ciena couldn't be reached for comment. 

 "The slowdown has not found the bottom yet, so most companies that warned once in January or February and their business is continuing to deteriorate, they will be back for more warnings," said Jaye Morency, portfolio manager with Boston-area investment advisor David L. Babson & Co.

 Companies News: New Invensys Woes

 Investor confidence in Invensys took another knock last week when the automation and controls group issued its second profits warning in little more than six months. Management blamed the US slowdown for its current woes with the control and power systems division bearing the brunt of the slump in demand. 

 With the US residential construction market softening, demand for appliance and climate control products has fallen away, although process automation operations have benefited from oil and gas companies stepping up infrastructure investments. 

 The downturn in power systems is more worrying given the company's previously stated plans to float off the division. Sales slumped on the back of a continued decline in investment in telecoms and IT infrastructure. An initial public offering in July remains the goal, although management-accepted delays in the process are now more than likely. 

 Selling the power systems business is still an option, but with rivals like Tyco and GE also suffering from reduced demand, Invensys could struggle to find a buyer prepared to meet its demands. Analysts have reduced their valuation of the division by almost 20 per cent to GBP2.7bn. 

 Although the market was less surprised by this latest profit warning from Invensys than the last, which led to shares falling by more than 30 per cent, the group's valuation has slumped to around a third of last year's GBP11.8bn peak. 

 The power systems division was one of the bright spots at the interims in November, but pricing pressures and development costs hit the automated systems and software division, leading to a 74 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits. 

 Management expects software and systems to show an improvement in the second half, but sceptical analysts point to management's questionable past track record in delivering shareholder value. 

 "Investors seem to have completely lost trust in the company," said one broker.

 Toronto stocks could open up, but mood bearish.

 TORONTO, March 30 (Reuters) - Toronto stocks could open flat to higher on Friday after a sharp sell-off, as investors scour the market for bargains on the last trading day of the quarter. 

 Analysts said there could be a slight uptick, but the market's overall mood remained bearish. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index has fallen 2.6 percent this week and stands 35 percent below its all-time Sept. 1 closing high of 11,388.82. 

 "Unlike previous downturns, when you have a fall in markets, there is a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines. This time, it seems like the cash has been committed. People are not too keen to reallocate money into stocks," said Jeff Cheah, a strategist at Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto. 

 Uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy has pummeled earnings at technology companies in the past six months. 

 Electronics maker SMTC Corp. said on Friday its first and second quarter will be hit by contract cancellations as customers are slow to commit in a slowing U.S. economy. 

 A Robertson Stephens analyst downgraded electronics manufacturer Celestica Inc. to buy from strong buy. 

 The TSE 300 closed down 61.74 points, or 0.82 percent, at 7444.78 on Thursday - its lowest close in 16 months. 

 Bellwether Nortel Networks Corp. , hammered on Wednesday by a profit warning, tried to rally but ended down 21 Canadian cents at C$21.27. 

 Reports on the Chicago area manufacturing sector and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment report will grab investors' attention early in the trading session. 

 Investors will be looking to the Chicagoland Purchasing Management Index and the Michigan final consumer sentiment index for March, both expected at 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) to give hints on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will further cut interest rates. 

 "What we need to see is improvement in investor confidence not consumer confidence," said Cheah said. 

 "I think if you have a very short-term horizon like the next month or two, the economy is not going to rebound," Cheah said. 

 "In this market, you really need to look eight months forward," he added.

 Weak telecom and technology shares hit the FTSE 100 once again yesterday. 

 Investors in the sectors took cover and the blue chip index fell 25.6 points to 5,588.4 as the US Nasdaq index added to Wednesday's 6% drop and the Dow reined back losses. The telecoms sector lopped 20 points off the FTSE. 

 The index had lost more than 180 points over the past two sessions after another wave of tech company profit warnings rippled out from the US. After the US market closed on Wednesday, JNI Corp and Tech Data warned that future results would fall below expectations due to weakening demand. 

 European telecom companies led blue chips lower, with Marconi, the telecoms equipment maker, and Spirent leading the retreat. 

 Marconi, which lost 9.1% on Wednesday after a profits warning from Canada's Nortel Networks, dropped a further 18p to 355p. The shares have fallen more than 50% so far on the year with investors betting on a profit warning to come in the fallout from a weakening US economy. Despite protestations that it is less exposed to the US downturn, the company has not convinced the market that it will not be jolted into issuing a warning. 

 Deutsche Bank cut its earnings estimates for the group, which further hit the shares. Analysts were said to have reduced earnings per share forecasts to 17.7p from 19.1p for 2001 and to 19.4p from 23.6p for 2002. 

 Deutsche Bank also cut estimates for Alcatel and Ericsson for the next two years, reflecting the recent stream of bad news for the industry. Spirent, the telecoms test equipment maker, saw its shares drop 21.75p to 362.25p. 

 Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone operator, saw its shares drop 7p to 197p despite announcing that its debt was likely to stand at #7bn at its year end next week. The figure compares with #13.2bn at the end of the half year in October and the company's promise to reduce it to #10bn or less by the end of the financial year. The new debt forecast was accompanied by news that Vodafone had completed the sale of Italian operator Infostrada to Enel. 

 Shares in ARC International, the specialist chip designer, were down 9.5p to 98.5p after analysts at investment bank UBS Warburg revised upwards their loss estimate for the group in 2001 from #20.6m before interest and tax to #27.4m. The increase reflected higher costs in sales and marketing and increased spending on research. 

 Marks & Spencer took the market by surprise and saw its shares rise 17.5p to 266.5p after announcing it was selling much of its non-core business, cutting more than 4,000 jobs and planning to return #2bn to shareholders by March 2002. 

 Selfridges, however, saw no change despite announcing it would open its second store in the Manchester area by acquiring half the floorspace in Marks & Spencer's recently rebuilt city centre outlet. Selfridges will pay up to #30m for a long leasehold of floorspace in the M&S store. 

 Dinkie Heel, the company that makes safety shoes, was not one of the bullish retailers. Shares fell 0.5p to 8.25p after the company reported a widening full year loss. 

 Po Na Na was also struggling. Shares plummeted 23.5p to 91.5p after the group issued a profit warning due to disappointing trading at its largest venue, the former Hammersmith Palais in west London. 

 A handful of media stocks were down yesterday on a darker outlook for television advertising revenues. Carlton, which dropped 34p on Wednesday, fell a further 20p to 395p after the Guardian reported talk of a profit warning being on the way. 

 Aukett, the architectural firm that issued a profits warning this week due to delayed contracts, remained stable yesterday. Expect further positive news for the group in Europe.

 Suppliers laid low by Nortel's ills: C-MAC among casualties: Revenue fears rise as U.S. comes off worst quarter in years

 When Nortel Networks Corp. is sick, its suppliers become ill as well. 

 Montreal-based C-MAC Industries Inc. is especially vulnerable to catching the flu. Some 50% of C-Mac's revenues are tied to Nortel. For other electronic manufacturing services providers, it's a similar story: Solectron Corp. of California has 12% of its revenues tied to the networking giant. And for SCI Systems Inc. and Sanmina Corp., two other U.S. EMS players, it's 10%. 

 "There is weakness for all the EMS companies. It's a tough environment, there's no doubt about it," said analyst Pierre-Yves Terrisse of Yorkton Securities Inc. 

 The weakness has been transferred to the stock prices. C-MAC (CMS/TSE) was down $2.50 to $32.50. The company has lost 17% of its share value since Nortel gave its warning. Solectron (SLR/NYSE) hit a new 52-week low at US$18.46 in yesterday's session, a 10% drop since the Nortel news. 

 Nortel and the EMS sector are not the only ones feeling the pinch. U.S. corporate profits are on track for their biggest decline in a decade this quarter. As of yesterday, first-quarter earnings for Standard & Poor's 500 index companies are forecast to fall 8%, according to analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, the first year-to-year decline since 1998's third quarter and the steepest since 1991. Technology companies were hit hardest, with analysts projecting a 35% earnings drop in the sector's profits. 

 Other tech bellwethers are expected to follow Nortel with repeat warnings. Sun Microsystems Inc. may be next, said Bear Stearns & Co.'s Andy Neff. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun sliced its revenue forecast last month, and said earnings will be US7 cents to US9 cents a share, about half what analysts expected. 

 Todd Coupland, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, downgraded his outlook and rating on C-MAC yesterday, given Nortel's latest profitwarning and abandonment of its earnings outlook for the full year. 

 Mr. Coupland lowered his recommendation from "strong buy" to "buy," cut his earnings expectations to a range of $2 to $2.25 per share from $2.60, and reduced his 12-month target price to $50 from $70. 

 "We believe the reduced visibility in telecom capital spending and issues with product pricing call into question the timing of a market recovery," he said in a research note. 

 Mr. Coupland is confident the company will meet its first-quarter numbers, given that Nortel's reduced outlook for the period "was not significant." 

 But he added his 2001 outlook was reduced to a range because of "market uncertainties." 

 Mr. Terrisse said it was important to point out the latest Nortel warning was an earnings warning and not a revenue warning, which for C-MAC is the most important number. 

 The second Nortel warning showed only a marginal decrease in revenues. 

 "What C-MAC cares about is revenue growth," said Mr. Terrisse, who is sticking to his 2001 earnings projections of $2.40 for the year for the moment. 

 "I'm optimistic C-MAC will meet its Q1 numbers." 

 But beyond the first quarter, Mr. Terrisse said it was difficult to tell because Nortel has abandoned any projections for the year. 

 "Nortel doesn't have visibility on their second half, so I don't think their suppliers will have visibility," said Mr. Terrisse.

        WASHINGTON (FFBN)--The following is a summary of high yield news
stories for the week ending 3/30:



UNFAVORABLE
ELOT Inc. (ELOT) requested a hearing with Nasdaq officials to determine the
listing status of the company's common stock, according to eLOT's annual
report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As reported, the
Nasdaq Stock Market issued a letter to eLOT on Dec. 26, 2000, warning the
company that it didn't meet the minimum bid price requirement of at least $1
a share for continued listing. ELOT had 90 days to raise its stock price
above the minimum requirement for 10 consecutive days.  However, the filing
notes that the company was unable to do so. The hearing will determine if
eLOT is allowed to maintain its listing on either the Nasdaq National Market
System or the Small Cap Market.  If Nasdaq rules that the company cannot keep
its listing, eLOT will trade on the over-the-counter market. The company
warns that moving to the over-the-counter market "could have a material
adverse effect on the price and liquidity" of the common stock, according to
the filing. -3/27
AmeriKing Inc.'s (AKNG) independent auditor Deloitte & Touche said there is
substantial doubt that the company can continue as a going concern. According
to the company's annual report for the year ended Dec. 25, 2000, filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the auditor cited AmeriKing's losses
from operations, a stockholders' capital deficiency and added that the
company wasn't in compliance with certain financial covenants of its
long-term debt. AmeriKing said in the filing it has obtained a waiver from
its banks for its non-compliance with certain financial covenants of its
revolving credit line and acquisition credit line the end of its fiscal 2000.
The company added that, due to the waiver, there is no existing debt
subject to acceleration. AmeriKing said it's working with its lending
institutions to amend certain covenants or other necessary actions to bring
it into compliance with the credit lines. In addition, the company said it's
considering financing alternatives that would reduce existing cash
obligations for capital expenditures and debt service, which it has discussed
with the its lending group Burger King Corp. (X.BKG) and other investment
advisors. The company's fiscal 2001 plan contemplates improved operating
performance and doesn't include significant capital improvements other than
those obligated under its existing franchise agreements, vendor incentive
agreement and the completion of the development of stores that were
substantially in progress as of Dec. 25, 2000, the filing said. AmeriKing
believes that available cash on hand combined with its forecast of increased
operating cash flow in fiscal 2001 will be enough to meet current debt
service obligations. The company is in discussions with Burger King Corp. to
defer certain capital obligations should its available cash be insufficient
to meet them, the filing said. If the company is unable to fund these
obligations and doesn't reach an agreement with Burger King, it may be in
technical default of its franchise agreements for those affected restaurants.

Arch Wireless Inc. (ARCH) is seeking shareholder approval to raise its
authorized common shares to 500 million from 300 million, the company
reported in a preliminary proxy statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. If approved, Arch said the additional shares would be
used for possible future financing transactions, acquisitions, management and
employee incentive plans and other general purposes. -3/23
United Rentals Inc. (URI) expects to close or consolidate a number of
underperforming branches over the next several months, resulting in a pretax
charge between $20 million and $40 million, according to the company's annual
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The estimate relates
primarily to the cost of employee severance and vacating facilities, the
filing said. United Rentals said it would take the charge in 2001. The
company said the consolidation is in response to softening economic
conditions, forcing it to focus on measures to cut costs and reduce cash
outlays.  United Rentals also said in the filing that it's negotiating with
various lenders to replace its existing credit line and term loans. If the
company completes the refinancing, it estimates that it would record a pretax
extraordinary charge in 2001 of $16 million to $27 million, primarily
relating to the write-off of financing fees, the filing said.  -3/23
Fleming Cos. (FLM) expects a strategic plan pretax cash charge of $4 million
in fiscal 2002 ending Dec. 30, 2002, according to a Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said the charges represent
future severance-related expenses, anticipated inventory markdowns and exit
costs related to divesting its conventional retail stores. As reported Feb.
14, Fleming expects a strategic plan charge of about $20 million in fiscal
2001 ending Dec. 30. The company had fourth quarter 2000 strategic plan
pretax charges of $98.1 million, including $72.7 million of cash-related
charges and $25.4 million of non-cash charges. Separately, Fleming said it
will record an extraordinary after-tax charge of $3 million once the
redemption of its $300 million, 10.625% senior notes due Dec. 15 is final.
Fleming Cos. expects capital expenditures of $225 million for fiscal 2001,
compared with about $150.8 million in fiscal 2000. -3/23
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) is in talks to extend the maturity
and revise the terms of its $1 billion bank credit line, according to the
company's annual filing released by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The company said that if its banks agree to an extension and revise the
line's terms, it would result in scheduled maturity requirements, higher
financing costs and certain restrictions on its financial management.
The company is scheduled to pay about $200 million in 2001 on debt payments
and preferred stock maturities, $1 billion in 2002 and $500 million in 2003,
based on year-end 2001 gold and silver prices, the filing said. Its $1
billion bank line matures in December 2002. The outstanding balance at Dec.
31, 2000, was $760 million, the filing said. -3/23
At current shipment levels, every $10 drop in gypsum wallboard price reduces
USG Corp.'s (USG) operating profit by $90 million to $100 million on an
annualized basis, according to a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Industry shipments of wallboard for the first quarter
are expected to be slightly below the year-ago level. However, while
experiencing lower demand from slightly lower housing starts, sluggish repair
and remodeling expenditures and winter weather, industry capacity will have
increased an estimated 10% versus the level of the 2000 first quarter. As
reported, the price per thousand square feet of wallboard is near $90 and
remains under pressure. January's effort to retain a price increase was
largely unsuccessful. The current price level compares with an average
realized price of $99.32 in the fourth quarter and $159.80 in the first
quarter 2000. Profit margins on wallboard sold by USG's L&W Supply Corp. have
declined between $10 and $15 per thousand square feet during the quarter,
compared with levels for the first quarter of 2000. It's USG's practice to
hedge its natural gas purchases, and as the company entered 2001, it was 60%
hedged, as it has been in previous years. According to the filing, by March,
the hedge ratio was increased to 75% in accordance with USG's hedging policy.
Higher gas prices in January and February, combined with only 60% of gas
consumption being hedged, and the impact of higher gas usage in winter,
resulted in a $6 per thousand square foot manufacturing cost penalty versus
the fourth quarter of 2000, according to the filing. In asbestos liability
matters, new personal injury cases were filed against USG's unit U.S. Gypsum
during the first two months of 2001 at approximately the same average monthly
rate that was experienced in the fourth quarter of 2000, the filing said.

NOTEWORTHY (CONT.)
PG&E Corp. (PCG) said the banks that provided the company's $1 billion
revolving credit line have agreed to extend the forbearance agreement to
April 13, according to a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Previously, the lenders had agreed to forbear on the line until
March 6. The lenders of the $1 billion credit line weren't named in the
filing. Also in the filing, PG&E said it may take an after-tax charge of up
to $4.1 billion on its fourth quarter and year-end 2000 financial results.
The size of the charge, if one is taken at all, will depend on the company's
belief that it will recover some or all of the undercollections through the
regulatory process. PG&E said that undercollections for electricity sold by
the company to consumers can be recorded as a regulatory asset on the balance
sheet rather than being charged against earnings "if it is probable that the
undercollections will be recovered through the ratemaking process." The
company said that this comes from accounting rule FAS 71. According to the
filing, "probable" in FAS 71 means that a future event is "likely to occur
and is a higher level of certainty than 'reasonably possible.'" If PG&E
determines that it's no longer probable that all or a portion of the existing
undercollections will be recovered through the regulatory process, then the
company must record the undercollections, or the portion believed
unrecoverable, against earnings. However, if any undercollections were
charged to earnings as uncollectable, then recovered in the future, PG&E
would then have a corresponding increase in earnings in that future period,
according to the filing. Currently, PG&E can't estimate the size of the
charge due to various uncertainties, including discussions for potential
regulatory relief in California. -3/26
Avado Brands Inc. (AVDO) plans a 1-for-4 reverse stock split to boost its
share price, according to a preliminary proxy statement released with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said in the proxy that its
stock price doesn't comply with the Nasdaq SmallCap Market's minimum bid
price requirement of $1 a share, but the company thinks the reverse split
will qualify the stock. If approved, the reverse split will reduce the number
of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 28,259,761 to about
7,064,940 shares, the filing said. The company's stock was recently quoted at
56 cents a share. -3/26
Kerr-McGee Corp. (KMG) paid Chairman and Chief Executive Luke Corbett an
$892,596 salary in 2000, compared with a $717,500 salary in 1999, according
to the company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Corbett's 2000 bonus will be determined in May, the filing said.
In 1999, Corbett received a $730,000 bonus. Corbett also received restricted
stock awards in 2000 valued at almost $1.9 million based on the closing price
of the company's stock at the time of the grant, and he received 150,000
stock options, the filing said. -3/26
Federal-Mogul Ignition Co., a unit of Federal-Mogul Corp. (FMO), plans to
sell one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, according to Federal-Mogul's
annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subsidiary,
which wasn't named in the filing, had net sales of $68.6 million for the year
ended Dec. 31, 2000, and total assets of $113.7 million. Federal-Mogul
Ignition doesn't expect the gain or loss on the sale, net of tax, to be
material, the filing said. -3/26
Res-Care Inc. (RSCR) said it began implementing plans to cease some of its
operations in Tennessee in February and expects to take a $1 million to $2
million charge in the first quarter related to the closings. According to a
company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Res-Care said it
has operated group homes in Tennessee under its disabilities services
division since 1993. However, the company says in the document that after
discussions with Tennessee regulators, it doesn't expect to achieve its
desired level of profitability because of the "rate environment" in the
state. -3/26
Reebok International Ltd. (RBK) expects capital expenditures of between $40
million and $45 million for 2001, according to a Form 10-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company didn't specify its use for
the expenditures in the filing.  However, Reebok did reiterate from its Feb.
1 press release that it plans increase its worldwide spending for advertising
and other working media to generate greater consumer demand for its products
and greater sell-throughs for its retailers. -3/26
Safeway Inc. (SWY) expects capital expenditures of more than $2.1 billion for
2001, according to a Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The company also said it plans to open between 90 and 95 new
stores in 2001 and remodel about 250 stores. Safeway had capital expenditures
of about $1.8 billion in 2000.  It opened 75 new stores in 2000 and remodeled
275 stores. -3/26
Arch Wireless Inc. (ARCH) said it expects capital expenditures for 2001
through 2003 to amount about $130 million a year, the company reported in a
Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Arch said its
expenditures would be used primarily for subscriber equipment, network
infrastructure, information systems and expansion of its two-way messaging
network. The company said the actual amount of capital to be required,
however, would depend on a number of factors, including subscriber growth,
the type of products and services demanded by customers, service revenue and
the nature and timing of its strategy to enhance its two-way messaging
networks, according to the Form 10-K. Excluding acquisitions of wireless
messaging businesses, Arch's capital expenditures were $140.3 million in
2000. -3/27
Agrilink Foods Inc. (X.PFC) said it expects to see net sales of $1.3 billion
in fiscal year 2001 ending June 23 on a gross margin of 30.5%, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it also
expects annual net sales of $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2002 through 2004,
with gross margins of 32%. Agrilink reported net sales of $1.2 billion in
fiscal year 2000 on gross margin of 31.5%. The filing also reports results
from its Voila! line of $52 million in sales for the first half of the fiscal
year on a gross margin of 49%, compared with $103 million and gross margin of
47% in fiscal year 2000, and $75 million on 44% margin in 1999. Agrilink
expects that its Simply Grillin' line will see sales of $25 million to $40
million in fiscal year 2002, on gross margins of 45% to 50% and an investment
of $5 million to $10 million. -3/27
The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland on Jan. 23 dismissed a
consent decree against Advantica Restaurant Group Inc. (DINE) regarding a
class action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination, according to the
company's annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Advantica has a second consent decree outstanding, but the company believes
it will be dismissed shortly, according to the filing. As reported, the
company entered the consent decrees on May 24, 1994, to resolve class action
lawsuits that alleged the company's Denny's Inc. division engaged in a
pattern or practice of racial discrimination. The consent decrees forbade the
company from racial discrimination and required Advantica to implement
certain employee training and testing programs and provide public notice of
the company's nondiscrimination policies. Class Counsel, along with counsel
for the U.S., submitted reports to the courts on Jan. 16, 2000, reporting
that Advantica had completed the requirements of the consent decrees and
recommending that the courts grant early dismissal of the consent decrees,
according to the filing. -3/27

Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE) said its bank group has waived the company's
noncompliance of a financial covenant through Friday, and the company is
negotiating a new credit line totaling $100 million. According to a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company agreed in connection
with the waiver to extend its pledge of securities as collateral over an
additional $50 million of the credit that had been unsecured and is due to
mature in April. The company said that as of Dec. 31, 2000, there were no
amounts outstanding under the credit lines and the availability was $118
million. Availability can be up to $300 million depending on the market value
of securities the company has pledged as collateral. If the stock markets
decline significantly, the availability under Safeguard Scientifics' credit
lines could be reduced significantly and could hurt its ability to borrow
under the lines, the filing said. The company said its cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments at Dec. 31, 2000, and other internal
sources of cash flow are expected to be enough to fund cash requirements
through 2001, including commitments to existing affiliates, its current
operating plan to acquire interests in new affiliates and general corporate
requirements. -3/27
Alaris Medical Inc. (AMI) said it doesn't expect to meet certain "future
financial covenants" under its bank credit agreement and is negotiating with
its senior lenders to amend the pact. The company said that was the reason it
couldn't file it 10K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
time, according to the non-timely filing. Alaris said that if the
negotiations are successful, the liquidity and the report of its independent
auditors included in the 10K filing would be materially different. Alaris
said it intends to file its annual report by April 17 and include a
description of the outcome of the amendment process. As reported, Alaris said
in January it expected break-even earnings per share and sales of at least
$100 million for the fourth quarter. The company also said it would eliminate
100 jobs in its North American operations over several months, which would
result in a pretax charge of $3 million in the first quarter. The infusion
therapy company said that despite the charge, it expected to comply with all
of its bank covenants for the first quarter. -3/27
Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) said it plans further debt cuts of $756
million, resulting in year-end 2001 total debt of about $5.6 billion,
according to a filing released by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Dale R. Laurance, president of Occidental Petroleum, presented the debt
reduction estimate at an energy conference in New Orleans, the filing said.
Laurance said the estimate was calculated using First Call's earnings
estimate of $3.05 for the company in 2001, assuming the company's planned
capital expenditures of $1.1 billion equals its depreciation, depletion and
amortization and subtracting a $1 annual dividend. The company then
multiplied the difference of $2.05 times the number of outstanding shares
which equals the free cash flow available for debt reduction, the filing
said. Laurance said the company's total debt-to-capitalization ratio was 57%
at the end of 2000, and "we expect that ratio to be no higher than
50-percent by the end of 2001, bringing us closer to our mid-40s target."
Also in his presentation, Laurance said the company estimates 2001 oil and
gas production of 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up from 461,000 in
2000. -3/28
Pentair Inc. (PNR) said it expects capital expenditures of $85 million to $90
million in 2001, according to the company's annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The budgeted capital expenditures
represent an increase from the $68 million spent in 2000, according to the
filing. Pentair expects increasing its investments in the areas of new
product development, factory expansion, additional machinery and equipment
for cost reductions and capacity expansions.  Pentair received a waiver from
its lenders in December modifying its interest coverage and leverage ratio
covenants, according to the annual report. The company said poor operating
results in its tools and discontinued equipment segments as well as
restructuring charges taken in the fourth quarter could "potentially" cause
the company to be in violation of the covenants. Pentair amended its credit
line agreement to modify these ratios through Sept. 30.  The company will be
required to meet its original interest coverage and leverage ratios by the
end of 2001, according to the filing. Separately, Pentair said that because
of the December announcement that Standard & Poor's and Moody's were
reviewing the company's bond ratings for possible downgrade, the company has
been unable to tap the commercial paper market. The company has been
refinancing maturing commercial paper with borrowings under its credit lines,
according to the filing. Pentair said that if it's unable to tap the
commercial paper market, or if its bond ratings are lowered, its borrowing
costs will increase. As of Dec. 31, the company had $423.3 million of
commercial paper outstanding that matured within 60 days.  Pentair said it
believes it has enough liquidity under its credit lines to refinance all
outstanding commercial paper. -3/28
P.H. Glatfelter Co. (GLT) said it expects its capital spending in 2001 to be
about $67 million, compared with the $29.2 million it spent on capital
projects in 2000, and $24.2 million in 1999. According to the company's
annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company
expects $8.9 million of the capital expenditures to be spent on
environmental-related projects initiated in 2001, with another $22.3 million
for that in 2002. The company spent about $2.6 million on environmental
capital projects in 2000, the filing said. Because these capital expenditures
for controlling pollution aren't expected to increase the productivity or
efficiency of its mills, the company said its earnings have been and will be
hurt. The company said it anticipates environmental regulation of its
operations will continue to become more burdensome and that capital and
operating expenditures for that will continue, and perhaps increase, in the
future. -3/28
Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) expects to spend $72 million annually between 2001 and
2005 for environmental monitoring and to dispose of hazardous materials and
waste from its nuclear power plants. According to the company's annual report
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this represents an
increase from the $64 million spent in 2000 and $55 million in 1999. The
company also expects about $132 million in capital expenditures to comply
with environmental regulations in 2001 and $297 million through 2005.  These
include the costs of constructing spent nuclear fuel storage casks. In 2000,
the company spent $57 million on environmental improvements at its utility
facilities.  Separately, Xcel Energy said in its annual report that as of
Dec. 31, 2000, a 100-basis point change in interest rates would affect the
company's net income by about $15.8 million. As reported, the Federal Reserve
has made three interest rate cuts since Dec. 31, lowering the Federal Funds
rate by 1.5%. In addition, NRG Energy Inc. (NRG), a division of Xcel Energy,
entered into a $2.5 billion revolving funding program in the first quarter,
according to Xcel's annual report.  NRG intends to use the line to finance a
significant portion of its acquisitions and development projects over the
next five years. NRG plans to repay borrowed funds by refinancing projects in
the long-term capital or bank markets when construction projects reach
commercial operation or market conditions are favorable. Xcel Energy said it
will take a charge of $42 million to other comprehensive income due to the
adoption of accounting rule SFAS 133. However, there was no material impact
from SFAS 133 to net income, the filing said. SFAS 133 regulates how
companiess account for derivative instruments as well as other hedges. -3/28

Regal Cinemas Inc. (X.RGL) intends to develop about 40 screens during 2001,
and expects the capital expenditures associated with new theaters will total
about $7.4 million, according to Regal's 2000 annual report filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday. As widely reported,
Tennessee-based Regal is in serious financial trouble, having defaulted on
its debt to bondholders, and is considering bankruptcy. Regal has hired
financial advisers and is evaluating a longer-term financial plan to address
various restructuring alternatives and liquidity requirements. The financial
plan would provide for the closing of underperforming theater sites,
potential sales of non-strategic assets and a potential restructuring,
recapitalization or a bankruptcy reorganization. Regal's deteriorating
operating results, shareholders' equity deficiency, and defaults under its
financing arrangements raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern, according to accountants Deloitte & Touche. Regal closed
328 screens in 54 theaters during the 2000 fiscal year. The company recorded
$20.9 million as the net loss on disposal of these locations as well as the
write-off of certain costs incurred to develop sites where the company has
discontinued development. Regal's restructuring plan includes the closing of
an additional 900 to 1,000 screens in the 2001 fiscal year. Michael L.
Campbell, Regal's chairman, president and chief executive, was awarded a
bonus of $150,000 in 2000, on top of a salary of $547,060. -3/28
Harrah's Entertainment Inc. (HET) said its total capital expenditures for
2001 are expected to be between $450 million and $525 million, compared with
about $568.3 million the company spent in 2000. Harrah's also said it
repurchased 12.4 million shares of the its common shares in the open market
in 2000 for a total of about $277.6 million. Shares the company purchased
during the second quarter of 2000 completed a 10 million share repurchase
plan approved by the company's board in July 1999. The remaining shares were
repurchased under a similar, April 2000 plan, which authorizes the repurchase
of 12.5 million shares in open market and other transactions as market
conditions warrant, the filing states. The company said it may repurchase
another 4.5 million shares under the April plan, which expires Dec. 31. The
2000 repurchases were funded through available operating cash flows and
borrowings from its bank facility, according to the company. -3/29
Kerr-McGee Corp. (KMG) has budgeted a record $1.24 billion for its capital
program in 2001, according to the company's 2000 annual report filed
Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This level represents
a 60% increase over 2000. Kerr-McGee estimates that the direct capital and
operating expenditures and expenditures charged to reserves in response to
direct and indirect costs to the company of government environmental
regulations will be approximately $145 million in 2001 and $130 million in
2002. Some expenditures to reduce the occurrence of releases to the
environment may result in increased efficiency; however, most of these
expenditures produce no significant increase in production capacity,
efficiency or revenue, according to the annual report. During 2000, direct
capital and operating expenditures related to environmental protection and
cleanup of existing sites totaled $51 million. Additional expenditures
totaling $116 million were charged to environmental reserves. Kerr-McGee has
budgeted $205 million for exploration activities. Chemical capital
expenditures in 2001 will primarily be directed toward improvements to the
company's pigment business, including upgrades of the facilities acquired in
2000. -3/29
Viacom Inc. (VIA) repurchased 2.8 million shares of its Class B common stock
from Feb. 1 through March 19 for about $141.5 million, the company reported
in a Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
purchases came under a buyback program begun on Feb. 1 that calls for the
repurchase of up to $2 billion of Class B common stock from time to time, the
filing from Wednesday said. Viacom also said in the annual report filing that
it expects capital expenditures, including information systems costs, to
total around $625 million to $675 million for 2001. The company said that
these expenditures are primarily related to capital additions for cable
networks, television and radio equipment, new and existing video stores and
theme park attractions. On March 7, Viacom entered into two new credit
facilities totaling $3.5 billion, according to the 10-K filing. The
facilities comprised a $1.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and a
$2 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, the filing said. On the same
date, the company canceled all of its credit agreements other than its $1.45
billion Infinity Broadcasting facility.  As reported, Viacom completed its
acquisition of Infinity Broadcasting on Feb. 21. -3/29
United Stationers Inc. (USTR) purchased 857,100 shares of the company's
common stock for about $22.4 million during 2000, according to the company's
annual report filed Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
United Stationers authorized the repurchase on Oct. 23, 2000, of up to $50
million of its common stock. During 1999, under a previous authorization, the
company purchased 3,250,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of about
$49.6 million, according to the annual report for 2000. As reported, United
Stationers was owed a balance of approximately $26 million from U.S. Office
Products Inc. (OFIS) as of that company's bankruptcy filing on March 5. For
the 12-month period ended with the date of the bankruptcy filing, U.S. Office
and its affiliates accounted for approximately 8% of United Stationers' total
revenue. United Stationers' annual report didn't disclose whether any of the
above amount has been paid. -3/29
Westpoint Stevens Inc. (WXS) said it will ask shareholders to approve the
creation of a new class of 100 million preferred shares at its annual meeting
on May 9 in Atlanta. According to a preliminary proxy statement filed
Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the preferred stock up
for approval is commonly referred to as "blank check" stock because it would
have any voting rights, participating, option and conversion or other special
rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions, as the board
may designate for each class or series issued from time to time. -3/29

NEW YORK - Wall Street made an expected retreat Wednesday, sending technology and blue chip stocks sliding on a mix of earnings worries and profit-taking from the Dow Jones industrials' big three-day rally.

The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index fared the worst, falling 6 percent on a profit warning from Nortel Networks that stoked fears of more problems ahead for networking and telecom stocks.

The Dow closed down 162.19 at 9,785.35, a 1.6 percent loss. The decline ended the Dow's three-day, 558-point winning streak, but the blue chips managed to hang on to 70 percent of their gains.

Broader stock indicators also lagged. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 28.88 at 1,153.29, a 2.4 percent loss, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 118.13 to 1,854.13.

The profit warning from Nortel, which also announced an additional 5,000 job cuts after regular trading ended Tuesday, sent tech stocks down in the market's extended session and set up Wednesday's selling.

The Russell 2000 index fell 10.68 Wednesday to 442.20.

Declining issues led advancers more than 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to nearly 1.52 billion, compared with 1.59 billion Tuesday.

The 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value, to yield 5.46 percent, unchanged from a day earlier.

In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 88.61 cents, down from 89.36 cents. The dollar was quoted at 122.33 Japanese yen, up from 122.15. The dollar fell to 9.53 pesos from 9.54. The peso rose to 10.4932 cents from 10.4822.

In Mexico, the bolsa fell 87.11 points to finish at 5,700.37 points.

Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.9 percent. Germany's DAX index slid 2.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost nearly 2.0 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.6 percent.

 Europe Changes Tune on Economy --- Question Is How Much Slower? Answer Is Not as Slow as the U.S.

 Europe's economy is slowing more than expected. The question now is whether it will grind down as much as other regions of the world. 

 In just the past months, equity markets nose-dived, the telecommunications and technology sector cut thousands of jobs, the German economy abruptly turned down, auto sales sagged and farm diseases raged. 

 The combined effect: Sentiment is souring. 

 "Obviously it will affect our growth," said Luc Willame, chairman of Glaverbel SA, a Brussels-based glassmaker for the automotive and building sectors. "Europe is not immune." As a result, the company has decided to "accelerate" existing plans to cut up to 1,000 of its 12,000 workers, he says. 

 The dimming outlook for Europe has touched off concerns at the European Central Bank, which in recent days has signaled it will cut interest rates -- if not at today's meeting then perhaps in two weeks. So far, the ECB has been the only major central bank to resist cutting rates as the world economy slows. 

 Just a few weeks ago, Wim Duisenberg, the ECB president, boasted that the Euroland economy should remain "fairly robust," growing at close to 3%, not far below last year's 3.4% pace. He changed that tone last week: The U.S. looks worse than previously anticipated, which "would have implications . . . for the euro area," he said. 

 The German and the Belgian business confidence indicators, closely watched gauges of future corporate activity, fell more sharply than expected last week, mirroring the growing pessimism. Expectations for corporate profits are also collectively headed downward. Profits for 600 large German companies in different sectors are expected to grow by 16% this year, down from estimates closer to 20% in December, according to Thomson Financial IBES, a financial research firm. 

 Still, most companies can live with that sort of growth. Last year, the profits of those companies grew by 17%. Indeed, chief executive officers and economists caution that though the outlook is worsening considerably from late last year, they don't expect Europe's economy to skid anywhere near as much as the economies of the U.S. and Japan, which are threatened with recessions. 

 At the moment, growth in Euroland for this year is expected between 2% and 2.5%, 

 compared with 1.5% in the U.S., and around 0.5% in Japan. 

 Europe has several reasons to feel at least relatively more secure than elsewhere as global economic trouble simmers: 

 -- Inflation-adjusted short-term interest rates in Euroland last year rose less than in the U.S., by 1.8 percentage points, compared with 2.5 percentage points in the U.S. 

 -- The euro remains weak, helping exports. 

 -- Tax cuts amounting to 0.8% of annual output took effect in January in Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere. 

 -- Corporate and household debt, together about 90% of Euroland's gross domestic product, is much lower than the 140% in the U.S., according to Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 -- Fewer Europeans than Americans own stocks, lessening the effect of market falls on consumer spending. 

 But a big question remains: As in the U.S., will the current woes in the European tech sector spill over into the broader economy? There's no question that the North American tech troubles are hitting Europe hard, and with immediate effect. In mid-February, for example, Nortel Networks Corp., the Canadian fiber-optic-equipment maker, warned it would post a first-quarter loss and halved its revenue projections for the year. Bookham Technology, a U.K. fiber-optics specialist that depends on Nortel for half its revenue, a few weeks later began paring 150 workers from its payroll, following its own profit warning. On Tuesday, Nortel again lowered its first-quarter forecasts. 

 Faced with possible saturation in the mobile-phone market, companies like Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson are in the midst of cutting staff and spending. And big telecom companies are struggling under a mountain of debt after forking over billions of euros for third-generation mobile-phone licenses. Telecom-operator borrowing this year accounts for 20% of total syndicated borrowing in Europe, compared with 6% last year, according to J.P. Morgan. Such debt makes profits harder to attain. 

 Despite their headline-grabbing problems, those sectors represent a much smaller portion of the total economy in Europe than they do in the U.S. Telecom companies account for 2.5% of Euroland industrial output, compared with 6.1% in the U.S., and other high-tech activity makes up just 1.2% of industrial production in Euroland, half the level of the U.S., according to J.P. Morgan. 

 Other than in technology and telecoms, weakness to date is mainly apparent in the auto sector. Registrations of new cars in Europe declined 8.7% in February from a year earlier to 1.08 million units, compared with a fall of 0.5% in January, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. 

 That slowing is already showing up in the bottom line of Glaverbel, the Belgian glassmaker. Mr. Willame says weaker orders so far this year suggest sales to the auto sector will shrink 1% this year. But that will be more than compensated for by sales to the building market, he says. "The slowdown is not going to affect our overall forecasts," he says, which calls for more than 20% growth this year, about the same as in 2000. 

 In Germany, where growth slowed to 0.2% in the fourth quarter compared with the third, CEOs are worrying more, though they're not yet feeling any slump. "Some clouds may come up in the last quarter of 2001," said Uwe Loos, chairman of FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schafer AG, a large producer of ball bearings based in Schweinefurt. "Maybe the automotive industry downturn will shift from the U.S. to Europe." 

 G. Siempelkamp & Co., a maker of hydraulic presses located near Duesseldorf, has noticed a softening in demand and prices for its machinery that builds wood-paneling, among other products. "This may mean there is a lot of material in the market," says Ralf Griesche, head of marketing. "We don't yet feel it in our books, but we guess it will come." 

 That growing unease is shared by Jean-Pierre Rhodier, CEO of French aluminum maker Pechiney SA, which caters mainly to auto and transport sectors. Typically, customers indicate their needs months in advance. Now, they're not saying much. "We have no visibility as to what demand will be like in the coming months," he said. The U.S. downturn has made "sentiment among our clients more fragile."

 Analysts  cautious  on Ericsson's cost cutting plan.

 STOCKHOLM, March 29 (Reuters) - A $3.4 billion cost-cutting plan from loss-making telecoms equipment firm Ericsson was received with caution by analysts, who said on Thursday they would need more details before changing recommendations. 

 Sweden-based Ericsson, the world's largest maker of mobile network systems and third-biggest handset supplier, said on Tuesday that job cuts, a hiring freeze and slashing the number of consultants would save it 20 billion crowns from next year. 

 These savings would come on top of a 15 billion crown savings programme announced in January, when the company said it would outsource making of mobile phones to Singapore-based Flextronics as well as cut jobs and reshape its product portfolio. 

 "35 billion crowns ($3.4 billion) is a lot of money but it remains to be seen if they can reach the 35 billion," said Jonas Eixmann, analyst at Handelsbanken. 

 However, the planned cost cuts made it easier to keep his "Buy" rating on the firm, he said. 

 "These programmes rarely reach what they aim at. But even if they reach 75 percent or 50 percent (of the plan) it is still a lot of money," he added. 

 After a Tuesday rally on the new cost-cut package, Ericsson shares dropped again on Wednesday on a profit warning from competitor Nortel and a weak outlook for Ericsson's business in the United States this year. 

 The share lost a further five percent on Thursday, hitting 22-month lows at 58 crowns in afternoon Stockholm trade. 

 The company has lost three quarters of its value since its early March 2000 peak of 229 crowns amid a global technology sector slump and four profit warnings from the company over the last nine months. 

 "We have had cost-cutting programmes from Ericsson before and it's usually been fairly difficult to locate where the benefits are," said Angela Dean, analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London, who has a neutral recommendation on Ericsson. 

 "I would like to see more detail of what they are doing for this 20 billion, how much it is going to cost them and signs that its beginning to work. Given the generally difficult environment industry-wide, we stay very cautious," she said. 

 Ericsson said it would announce more details of the savings package, which includes 3,300 job cuts, on April 20. 

 ERICSSON GOOD LONG-TERM, NOKIA FOR NOW 

 Deutsche Bank said in a research note it cut its earnings per share estimate for Ericsson by 15 percent for this year and pointed out that the global infrastructure market, where the company is number one, continued to deteriorate. 

 "Long-term, Ericsson may be a good buy, for now it seems better to buy Nokia, which we think will continue to outperform Ericsson and switch to Ericsson later," a Swedish analyst said. 

 Since the technology's sector peak values in early March 2000, Ericsson has underperformed Nokia , the world's biggest mobile phone maker, by 25 percent. 

 But although not destined for an immediate rally, Ericsson was still a bargain in the long term, some analysts said. 

 Fisher Partners said in a research note Ericsson was a "top pick" in the sector with a 12-month price target of 110 crowns and 180-200 crowns in 18 to 24 months. 

 "After the recent sharp decline in Ericsson's share price, we believe current price levels provide the best long-term buying opportunity in Ericsson in many years," the brokerage's analysts Bo Edvardsson and Hakan Wranne said.

 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Shares of Ingersoll-Rand Co. fell in pre-open trade on Thursday after the multinational manufacturer cut its first-quarter earnings estimates. 

 Ingersoll-Rand, whose products range from golf carts to air compressors, saw its shares fall to $38 from a Wednesday close at $41.68 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Early Thursday, the company lowered its first-quarter earnings estimate to a range of 50 to 52 cents from 60 to 65 cents. It said revenues could be down 7 percent from a year earlier.

 More warnings darken profit outlook.

 NEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - The list of corporate casualties continues to grow as the weakening U.S. economy takes a bite out of earnings, and it could be months before the carnage ends. 

 Stock market investors are reeling after being slapped by a fresh slew of profit warnings this week out of companies ranging from high-tech heavyweights to smokestack stalwarts. 

 "Overall, earnings are terrible and no one knows when we're going to get out of it right now," said Donald Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisors. 

 The latest gloomy announcement came from paper and forest products giant International Paper, which said on Thursday the weaker economy and higher energy costs would push its earnings well below Wall Street estimates. 

 IP's warning came on the heels of similar profit warnings from a couple of the technology sector's marquee names. Telecommunications gear maker Nortel Networks and handheld computer maker Palm Inc. spooked Wall Street after they both announced job cuts late Tuesday and warned that their earnings would be pinched as the U.S. economy softens. 

 The news reawakened investors' fears about the gloomy profit picture in a slowing economic environment, and sent the market into a nosedive on Wednesday. The losses snapped a three-day winning streak for the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI) and sent the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC) down 118 points, or nearly 6 percent. 

 A record number of companies have issued gloomy profit outlooks for the first quarter. Out of a total 957 companies that have issued profit forecasts, 662, or 69 percent, have said earnings would be worse than expected, according to Thomson Financial/First Call, which tracks earnings forecasts. 

 The number of profit warnings so far this quarter is the highest since the group began tracking earnings in 1995. 

 Another 163 companies, or 17 percent, said their earnings would be on target, while 132, or 14 percent, had a positive outlook. 

 "Profits are dismal," said John Forelli, portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates, which oversees $25 billion in assets, adding earnings could actually be down 5 to 10 percent in 2001. "They will be dismal up until the fourth quarter, which is the first time you can see the environment will lead to potentially positive comparisons for the market as a whole." 

 Analysts have been rapidly whittling away at profit forecasts. First-quarter corporate earnings are expected to show a drop of 8 percent, the steepest decline since the third quarter of 1991, when earnings dropped 17.9 percent. Just three months ago, analysts were predicting first-quarter earnings would gain 5.3 percent and six months ago, they were expecting a 14.2 percent gain. 

 The high-tech sector has been the hardest hit, as technology companies struggle to unwind the inventories built up during the 1999 boom. 

 "The biggest casualties are in technologies and there is zero assurance of when we can expect some positive growth in that area," Berdine said. 

 Market experts are still betting, however, that profits can make a comeback in the second half of the year as the United States' economic engine revs up again and the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts begin to have an impact. 

 The Fed lowered interest rates by a full percentage point in January and another half a percentage point in March in a effort to spur the U.S. economy. 

 Operating earnings for companies in the S&P 500 index are expected to drop 6 percent in the second quarter, and then reverse course and climb 1.9 percent in the third quarter and shoot 12.9 percent higher in the final quarter of the year. For all of 2001, corporate earnings should eke out a gain of 0.3 percent, a mere shadow when compared with last year's 16.2 percent profit growth, Thomson Financial/First Call said. 

 "The bottom line is, I don't think you're going to get wonderful earnings growth in any of the periods," said Brian Rauscher, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "Really what's important is the inflection point - when have we gotten to the bottom and when are we improving again?"

 UPDATE 1-Toronto stocks hit 16-month low on tech woes.

 TORONTO, March 29 (Reuters) - Toronto stocks closed lower on Thursday as North American equity markets grappled again with disappointing earnings forecasts in the tech sector. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 composite index closed 61.74 points, or 0.82 percent, lower at 7444.78 - its lowest close in 16 months. Volume was 144.4 million shares worth C$2.9 billion. 

 Market momentum was negative as decliners beat advancers 566 to 458, with another 233 stocks unchanged. 

 The blue-chip S&P/TSE 60 index was down 3.9 points, or 0.89 percent, to 433.56 on volume of 51.8 million shares. 

 More negative news hit the tech sector on Thursday when computer equipment distributor Tech Data Corp. , storage network parts maker JNI Corp. and Internet security services firm SafeNet Inc. cut quarterly profit expectations amid slowing demand. 

 Conor Bill, senior vice-president at BayStreetDirect.Com Inc. said that although the continuing string of warnings was unnerving investors, it helped bring market expectations back to realistic levels. 

 "We need to ratchet down expectations to the point where people can over deliver...certainly that is in progress," said Bill. 

 Bellwether Nortel Networks Corp. , hammered on Wednesday by a profit warning, tried to rally on Thursday but ended down 21 Canadian cents at C$21.27. 

 In Canada, MGI Software Corp. reported bigger fourth-quarter losses on Thursday amid slumping retail demand for its video and photo software and warned analysts to halve 2002 revenue estimates to growth of 20-25 percent. 

 Its shares ended down 85 Canadian cents at C$2.00. 

 Twelve of the TSE's 14 subindexes were down, with the tech-heavy industrial products sector leading the way, off 1.4 percent to end at 4558.72. 

 Pipelines was up 1.38 percent and real estate and construction was up 0.21 percent. 

 The technology-rich Nasdaq composite index slumped 33.56 points, or 1.81 percent, to 1820.57. That marked its lowest close since early November 1998 and moved the market deeper into bear market territory, which is defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from the high. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average managed to eke out a small gain of 13.71 points, or 0.14 percent, at 9799.06. 

 John Kinsey, a portfolio manager with Caldwell Securities Ltd., said underperforming stocks may have fallen victim to fund managers who may be reshuffling their portfolios ahead of performance rankings, or so-called quarterly window-dressing. 

 "We're coming up to the quarter end, some of it is probably window-dressing on behalf of the funds and the institutions....Maybe they want to get rid of the techs so they don't show on their quarterly statement," he said. 

 Sierra Wireless Inc. ) shares fell C$7.20 to C$28.90, Celestica Inc. . dropped C$3.22 to C$43.28, and Siebel Janna Systems Inc. was down C$3.50 to $39.50. 

 Kate Warne, a strategist at Edward Jones in St.Louis, Missouri, said the warnings were secondary to the general fear that the market had not yet hit bottom. 

 "What we were seeing is that the market does not have any confidence that this will be over soon. It tried to rally earlier and I think people sold into it, being nervous about whether we've seen more down days to up days," she said. 

 Shares of Imax Corp. slipped 12 Canadian cents to C$4.98 after the big-screen cinema company said on Thursday that it will take up to a year before it recovers from the effect of cinema chains going bankrupt, although operating earnings in 2001 should break even after a string of losses. 

 Analysts anticipated release of U.S. economic data on Friday, including the Chicago purchasing managers index for March and the Michigan sentiment numbers, which could give the market a boost if they signal the U.S. economic outlook is not totally bleak. The Michigan figures are of particular importance in the wake of Tuesday's U.S. consumer confidence index which showed a surprising jump. 

 "I think the market will react strongly to what the numbers are. Clearly the U.S. market and the Canadian markets are looking for direction. It's very clear the market is swinging from good news to bad news depending on what comes out," said Warne.

 LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Marconi Plc shares fell to a 29-month low on Thursday as an earnings downgrade from analysts at Deutsche Bank piled on the agony for investors in the British-based telecoms equipment stock. 

 Marconi shares traded 26 pence or seven percent lower at 347p by 1042 GMT, having earlier dropped as low as 338-1/2p, their lowest since October 1998. 

 Reflecting the recent stream of bad news for the industry, Deutsche cut estimates for Marconi in the year ending March 31 and the following two years, as well as for Alcatel and Ericsson around Europe. 

 For the current year, Deutsche cut its Marconi earnings per share forecast to 17.7 pence from 19.1p, while for 2002 it cut to 19.4p from 23.6p. 

 Analysts had been forecasting 19.5p and 24.1p, according to pollsters Barra. 

 Deutsche also lowered its 2003 forecast to 23.4 pence from 28.4p, suggesting much slower overall growth in coming years than was previously expected and further undermining Marconi's status as a highly-rated growth stock. 

 NEGATIVE SURPRISES 

 Marconi shares traded above 900p as recently as November, but have been driven lower by a succession of negative surprises from industry leaders - leaving some concerned that Marconi might be forced to issue a profit warning. 

 Deutsche's cautious stance on Marconi hit a market still nervous on the sector in the wake of a warning of first-quarter losses from Nortel Networks , the world's top fibre-optic equipment vendor. 

 Ericsson heightened anxieties over the U.S. outlook with a warning on Wednesday that it expected very low or zero growth in the world's biggest market this year - against growth of 20-30 percent in 2000. 

 The statements increased the negative feeling around Marconi, which reports full-year figures on May 17. Marconi has so far declined to comment on whether it will produce a trading update ahead of those results. 

 Deutsche analysts said Marconi still looked expensive against European rivals despite having fallen some 50 percent through the last quarter. 

 "On new 2002 forecasts the company is trading on a PE (price-earnings mutliple) of 18 times...which does not appear attractive against its peer group," they said in a research note. 

 Deutsche analysts said their lower earnings reflected lower 2001 sales growth of 15 percent against a previously forecast 17 percent, along with margins falling to 12.7 percent from 13.2 percent. For 2002 they cut sales growth to 11 percent. 

 "We believe that the next two quarters will present an extremely tough environment for Marconi," the note added. Deutsche's rating remained a cautious "market perform".

 Dow Jones Reveals Plans to  Cut  Staff at Online Version of Wall Street Journal

 NEW YORK -- Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. will lay off staff at WSJ.com, the online counterpart of its flagship newspaper, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. 

 "As we said on March 7th, there will be a limited number of layoffs in some areas," according to spokeswoman Karen Miller Pensiero. "This will include layoffs at The Wall Street Journal Online." 

 Ms. Pensiero declined to specify the number or types of jobs affected but said the company will offer more detail on April 12 when it reports first-quarter earnings. 

 WSJ.com employs approximately 250 staffers. 

 For Wall Street, the move should come as little surprise. While Dow Jones (DJ), which also owns this news service, enjoyed the fruits of a swelling bull market for stocks in 1999 and part of 2000, the economic bubble has apparently burst, taking with it the technology and financial-services advertising that spurred The Wall Street Journal on to double-digit advertising-revenue growth during that time. 

 Earlier this month, Dow Jones told analysts it would miss first-quarter earnings estimates by a wide margin. The New York publisher of financial information said it expected first-quarter earnings to total between 16 cents a share and 20 cents a share, sharply below a Thomson Financial/First Call estimate at the time of 56 cents a share. In last year's first quarter, Dow Jones reported operating earnings, excluding a gain, of $79.2 million, or 88 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $579 million. 

 A current Thomson Financial estimate calls for Dow Jones to earn 18 cents a share for the first quarter. 

 The profit warning was the second Dow Jones has issued in as many quarters. The company also told analysts that it couldn't offer guidance for earnings in 2001, due to the volatile advertising climate. 

 "In Dow Jones' case, they are faced with pretty severe drop-off in top-line growth overall, and I guess it is spilling down," said Edward Atornio, a publishing analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities. While WSJ.com is "very tiny," he said, "it is a spectacular success." 

 According to Dow Jones, the Web site, which launched in 1996, is the largest paid-subscription site on the World Wide Web. As of Dec. 31, WSJ.com had 535,000 paid subscribers, according to the company. 

 At the time of the profit warning, Peter R. Kann, Dow Jones's chairman and chief executive, said the company anticipated making staff reductions, most of which he hoped could be achieved through attrition. What layoffs took place, he said in a memo to employees, "will constitute a very small fraction of a company of 8550 employees." 

 Dow Jones has made cuts to other Internet operations. The company has delayed the launch of WeekendJournal.com, an online counterpart to a weekly section of The Wall Street Journal focused on leisure and entertainment. The company also announced that it would wind down Work.com, a Web site aimed at small businesses created as part of a joint venture with Excite@Home Corp. (ATHM). 

 Despite the fact that WSJ.com will endure staff reductions, Dow Jones says it's not scaling back the online newspaper's operations, according to Ms. Pensiero, the company spokeswoman. Neil Budde, WSJ.com's editor and publisher, couldn't be reached for immediate comment; other executives either weren't available or referred calls to Mr. Budde. 

 In addition to this and other newswires, Dow Jones publishes The Wall Street Journal and its international and online editions, Barron's and SmartMoney magazines and other periodicals, dowjones.com, Dow Jones Indexes and the Ottaway group of community newspapers. Dow Jones is also co-owner with Reuters Group PLC (RTRSY) of Factiva and with General Electric Co.'s (GE) NBC of the CNBC television operations in Asia and Europe. Dow Jones also provides news content to CNBC and to radio stations in the U.S.

 WRAP: Australia Pacific Dunlop Ratings, Pft Numbers  Cut

 MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- International ratings agency Standard & Poor's Corp. Thursday downgraded its ratings on Australia's Pacific Dunlop Ltd. (PDLPY), one day after the company announced it would exit all businesses except its Ansell healthcare unit. 

 Analysts also slashed their profit forecasts to account for Pacific Dunlop's shrinking portfolio and management's warning that second half profit will deteriorate 20% to 30% on the first half result of A$51.6 million. 

 Merrill Lynch reduced its 2000-01 profit forecast 23% to A$82.6 million, from A$107.1 million, and lowered its 2001-02 number by 21% to A$94.3 million, from A$119.2 million. 

 The investment bank said the underlying reason behind the profit forecast reduction this fiscal year is a higher loss from Pacific Dunlop's South Pacific Tyres joint venture with Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) of the U.S. 

 Merrill Lynch now predicts the tires business will lose A$30 million in the year to June 30, from its previous estimate of between A$5 million and A$10 million. 

 Rating Pacific Dunlop accumulate, it expects the sale of the auto distribution, brands and tires businesses to fetch well above A$1 billion. 

 "This would leave Ansell within the current Pacific Dunlop corporate structure, effectively free of debt and generating around A$150 million earnings before interest and tax," Merrill Lynch said in a report. 

 Pacific Dunlop's net debt currently stands around A$1 billion. 

 Wednesday, the company finally surrendered to intense shareholder pressure, announcing it intends to sell all its businesses except for Ansell. 

 Chief Executive Rod Chadwick will depart at the end of the week and nonexecutive director Tony Daniels will take up the task of overseeing the asset sales. 

 S&P cut Pacific Dunlop's corporate credit ratings to BBB-/A3 from BBB+/A2, with a negative outlook. 

 The ratings agency said this reflects Pacific Dunlop's profit warning and the fact that underlying cash flow this fiscal year is expected to support only a BBB- rating. 

 S&P also noted the company's planned asset sales process will be protracted, given management wants to conduct an orderly divestment to maximize value for shareholders. 

 "The rating outlook is negative, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Pacific Dunlop's asset divestment program in terms of timing, proceeds raised, and the application of those proceeds," S&P said. 

 "Pacific Dunlop's narrowing business focus and emerging capital structure are expected to support a long-term rating no higher than BBB-," it added. 

 Moody's Investors Service said yesterday its review for a possible downgrade of Pacific Dunlop's ratings continues. 

 Shares in Pacific Dunlop fell two cents or 1.5% to A$1.33, erasing a portion of its 6.7% rally Wednesday. 

 The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1%.

 JNI Earnings Warning May Indicate Bad Times At Sun

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The latest comments from JNI Corp. (JNIC) may indicate things are worse at Sun Microsystems Corp. (SUNW) than previously thought. 

 Late Wednesday, JNI, a small fibre channel host bus adapter maker, warned first-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations. 

 The San Diego company, which derives the majority of its revenue from sales of Sun Solaris-based products, blamed continuing weakness in the Sun server marketplace for its profit warning. 

 While a slowdown for Sun's products has been widely noted, Shelby Seyrafi, an analyst at A.G. Edward & Sons, said JNI's warning shows that sales at Sun may be slower than expected. In fact, the analyst said Sun's third-quarter revenue growth forecast of 10% to 13% could be at risk. 

 Officials at Sun weren't immediately available to comment. 

 Sun, like many other computer hardware companies, has been reeling from a slowing U.S. economy and cutbacks in corporate information technology spending budgets. The computer hardware and software company has felt more pronounced pain because it enjoyed abnormally high growth in the heyday of the tech boom. 

 In February, Sun cut its fiscal third-quarter earnings forecast, citing weak U.S. economic conditions. Sun forecast earnings between 7 cents and 9 cents a share, while analysts, according to Thomson Financial/First Call, expected 15 cents. 

 Investors are trying to figure out the magnitude of the weakness in the tech sector, and JNI's warning, although coming from a small company, makes investors nervous, said William Shope, an analyst at ABN AMRO. JNI expects to earn 3 cents to 4 cents a share, excluding amortization, compared with a First Call consensus of 13 cents. 

 Even though Sun isn't losing market share, there is a possibility Sun could either issue another earnings warning for the third quarter or temper earnings guidance for future quarters because of continued weakness in sales, said Shope, adding that a slowdown in corporate IT spending had gotten worse at the end of February. 

 John Jones, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said Thursday that JNI's preannouncement "augurs poorly" for Sun. While server softness at Sun isn't surprising, said Jones in a research note Thursday, it was contrasted against recent improvements on other platforms. 

 Jones, who has a neutral rating on Sun's stock, reaffirmed his cautious stance. 

 Sun Microsystems stock recently was down 95 cents, or 6%, to $14.92, surpassing its 52-week low of $15.50, set Wednesday.

Markets take another tumble - Investors nail Nortel on  profit warning , Palm for low earnings

Stocks fell yesterday as investors absorbed more bad news about corporate profits and layoffs.

The Nasdaq composite index plunged 118.13points to 1,854.13, which is 63 percent off its historic high last March.

The giant Canadian firm Nortel Networks Corp.led the way down for tech companies after it warned profits would be off and that it was cutting another 5,000 jobs, bringing the total to 15,000 for the year. Nortel closed at $14, down 16 percent, yesterday.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 162.19 points to 9,785.35, ending a three-day winning streak. The S&P 500 index dropped 28.88 points to 1,153.29.

Wall Street watchers are still reluctant to predict when the market will hit bottom, or what will spur a turnaround.

"It's going to take a change in psychology by the investment community in general, and that change might not occur until we see some light on the horizon in terms of corporate earnings," said Bruce Addison, a managing director with First Union Securities Inc., in Boston.

Among the day's hardest-hit companies was Palm Inc., the San Jose, Calif.-based maker of a popular line of handheld computer organizers. Investors cut the once high-flying company's value in half, to $8.06, after it reported lower-than-expected earnings and warned that sales growth would continue to slow.

"We have more earnings hurt to go, especially in tech," said Jay Evans, who manages the Galaxy Equity Value Fund in Boston.

Part of the profit problem, Evans said, is that companies don't have a clear picture themselves of when things will turn around, so they are not providing investors with a time frame for when things will get better.

Evans said there's a lot of money waiting to get back into the market, but people are loath to do so until they are convinced that most of the risk is gone.

 Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO/NASDAQ), down US$2 3/8 to US$15 3/4, on volume of 184.5 million shares. 

 Shares in the leading supplier of computer networking equipment tumbled as a pair of analysts cut their earnings estimates for the company. Cisco's market value was also battered in a broader networking sector slump caused by profit warnings from Nortel Networks Corp. (NT/TSE) and ADC Telecommunications Inc. (ADCT/NASDAQ). 

 In a research note yesterday, Lehman Brothers analyst Tim Luke slashed his earnings estimate for Cisco's third quarter ending in April to US5 cents a share from US12 cents. Mr. Luke also cut his fourth-quarter view to US6 cents from US12 cents. 

 Robertson Stephens analyst Paul Johnson lowered his estimates for Cisco's fiscal year to US50 cents a share from US59 cents. 

 --- 

 SMTC Manufacturing Corp. of Canada (SMX/TSE), down $2.38 to $6.52, on volume of 67,962 shares. 

 In another rough day for electronics manufacturing services providers, SMTC shares fell as investors bet it will release negative news in a conference call scheduled for tomorrow, analysts said. 

 "While the market is obviously expecting the worst since SMTC put out a press release ... we believe that the company's business trends remain stable," said Lehman Brothers analyst Lou Miscioscia. 

 The analyst called the market's response yesterday an "overreaction," and said he expects SMTC's share price will bounce back to trade "significantly above" its current level. 

 --- 

 Interact Commerce Corp. (IACT/NASDAQ), up US$3 7/8 to US$11 13/16, on volume of 7.7 million shares. 

 Interact shares jumped about 49% yesterday after Sage Group, a British accounting software company, said it was making a US$263-million offer for the company. 

 --- 

 Siebel Systems Inc. (SEBL/NASDAQ), down US$4.05 to US$27.46, on volume of 18.6 million shares; Siebel Janna Arrangement Inc. (SBL/TSE), down $6 to $43, on volume of 2,852 shares. 

 Shares of the San Mateo, Calif.-based company tumbled about 12% as investors worried that the company may soon issue a profit warning. 

 On Tuesday, research firm Thomson Financial/First Call released analysts' revised consensus estimates for Siebel's first quarter, which took earnings down a penny to US14 cents per share and lowered revenue expectations to US$572.6-million from US$578-million.

Wall Street retreats after three-day rally

NEW YORK - Wall Street made an expected retreat Wednesday, sending technology and blue chip stocks sliding on a mix of earnings worries and profit-taking from the Dow Jones industrials' big three-day rally.

The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index fared the worst, falling 6 percent on a profit warning from Nortel Networks that stoked fears of more problems ahead for networking and telecom stocks.

The Dow closed down 162.19 at 9,785.35, a 1.6 percent loss. The decline ended the Dow's three-day, 558-point winning streak, but the blue chips managed to hang on to 70 percent of their gains.

Broader stock indicators also lagged. The Standard & Poor's 500 index was down 28.88 at 1,153.29, a 2.4 percent loss, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 118.13 to 1,854.13.

The Russell 2000 index fell 10.68 Wednesday to 442.20.

Declining issues led advancers more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to nearly 1.52 billion, compared with 1.59 billion Tuesday.

-- Long-awaited IPO gets lukewarm response

PHILADELPHIA - Investors greeted Agere Systems Inc.'s long-awaited initial public offering with a lukewarm response Wednesday, pushing shares of the Lucent Technologies Inc. spinoff up slightly in early trading.

After postponing its IPO last week and reducing the share price, Agere sold 600 million shares late Tuesday at $6 a share.

The company had previously planned the second largest domestic IPO ever, with 500 million shares to be sold at $12 to $14 each to raise $6 billion to $7 billion, trailing only a $10.6 billion offering last year by AT&T Wireless Group.

-- Walt Disney shares fall almost 3 percent

NEW YORK - Shares of The Walt Disney Co. fell almost 3 percent Wednesday after the company said it plans to eliminate 4,000 full-time jobs, or about 3 percent of its work force, citing ''increasingly pressing challenges of the softening economic environment.''

The media and entertainment giant said late Tuesday it will try to achieve the cuts through a voluntary program within the next month, but that layoffs will occur if the full reduction is not achieved.

-- GE to sell satellite unit to Luxembourg firm

STAMFORD, Conn. - General Electric Co. will sell its satellite unit to a Luxembourg company for $5 billion in cash and stock, creating a satellite services provider with a global reach, the companies announced Wednesday.

Societe Europeenne des Satellites SA will provide GE with $2.7 billion in cash and a 25 percent stake and a 20 percent voting interest in SES Global, a new company in Luxembourg created by the deal. The new company consists of SES and GE Americom, the company's satellite unit which had been run by Stamfordbased GE Capital.

 Networking giant 3Com said last week it is to make another 170 job cuts following poor third-quarter results. It also announced the departure of its UK managing director, Adrian Hurel.The additional redundancies follow on from the 1200 announced last month and will hit the firm's US consumer broadband operation.It is hoped these job cuts will save the company $18m (12.6m) a year and help redress its recent poor financial showing.Following a profit warning at the beginning of March, 3Com posted a loss of $122.8m for its third quarter ended 2 March, compared with a profit of $80.3m in the same period last year.Turnover for the quarter fell 18 per cent to $629m.The company is focusing on three areas to improve performance, according to Sandra van Vreedenbaad, director of international corporate communications at 3Com. 

 "We are concentrating on Gigabit Ethernet, wireless and network telephony products, and building networks for businesses of all sizes," she said."We project a return to profit in the fourth quarter of the next financial year, which will be in the summer of 2002."Meanwhile, Hurel left after nearly 12 years at the company and will be replaced by PaulMalcolm, who becomes country manager for the UK and Ireland.Malcolm was previously director of the network service provider unit of 3Com, which he joined atthe beginning of this year.Van Vreedenbaad said: "Adrian has left to pursue other opportunities after being instrumental in the implementation of a number of changes to ensure success in the future. The appointment of Paul Malcolm will support the company's increased focus on selling through service providers."The company blamed a combination of lower demand in the US and slower than expected growth in the DSL and cable modem markets for the poor results. The failure of consumer categories to generate a high enough turnover, and the move from high-margin to low-margin products due to price pressures, also played a part, the company said.However, even with the new product focus, 3Com will still face price pressures, warned John Bateman, operations director at 3Com reseller Satelcom.Also published in Computer Reseller News

 UPDATE 2-Ericsson says U.S. weak, cuts phone sales forecast.

 STOCKHOLM, March 28 (Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Ericsson said on Wednesday it expected very weak, maybe zero, growth in the U.S. market this year, undermining investor confidence and sending its ailing shares down further. 

 Ericsson's view of the outlook for the United States echoed that of Canadian Nortel Networks Corp., which cut its first-quarter forecasts earlier in the day. 

 Ericsson also cut its view on worldwide mobile phone sales this year by 50 million units from an earlier estimate of 500-540 million. 

 The stock market did not seem impressed by Ericsson saying it was continuing to win market share in the mobile systems segment, where the Sweden-based company is the global leader. 

 "In the United States we are expecting a very weak development in the entire telecoms market, perhaps zero growth," Ericsson Chief Executive Kurt Hellstrom told the company's annual general meeting. 

 In 2000, the U.S. telecoms market grew by 20-30 percent. 

 Ericsson expected worldwide growth this year in the telecoms market of 8-10 percent, Hellstrom said. 

 "But if the slowdown continues in the U.S. it will have an effect in Europe and in Asia," he told a news conference. 

 SLOW MARKET 

 Hellstrom dismissed talk that Ericsson had begun to lose ground in the mobile networks business, the segment where it is the global leader. 

 "We are not losing market share there but continuing to win market share...However, the overall market is developing at a slower pace," he said. 

 Ericsson has been surrounded by turmoil, including demands for the resignation of Hellstrom and Chairman of the board Lars Ramqvist, for the past two weeks following a first-quarter profit warning. 

 Ericsson said on March 12 it would make a 4-5 billion crown ($400-500 million) loss in January-March instead of breaking even as a global economic slowdown hit both the handset unit and the profitable networks division. 

 However, Hellstrom said on Wednesday Ericsson now expected a small profit in the first quarter when a 5.5 billion crown capital gain from the sale announced on Tuesday of its remaining stake in U.S. computer network company Juniper Networks is included. 

 COST CUTS 

 On Tuesday the company also unveiled sweeping cost-cutting measures that it said would generate savings of 20 billion crowns a year from 2002, sending the Ericsson stock almost 10 percent higher. 

 Hellstrom said these new cost cuts together with earlier measures announced in January entailed total annual savings in the region of 35 billion crowns. 

 "I don't expect that we are gaining market share with the programme we have announced," he told Reuters Television, referring to the troubled mobile handsets division. 

 Ericsson is the world's third biggest maker of mobile phones after Finnish Nokia and U.S. Motorola but lower ranked rivals have been closing in fast. 

 Ericsson's share, down almost 50 percent year-to-date, shed most of Tuesday's gains on Wednesday, extending its slide after Hellstrom's gloomy assessment of the U.S. market, stock market players said. 

 "We are quite bearish about the stock and it's a sell at 60 crowns," Aaron Barnfather, a fund manager at Royal & Sun Alliance in London, told Reuters. 

 Ericsson closed 8.9 percent down at 61.50 crowns in Stockholm. Its U.S. shares were 12.6 percent off at 1920 GMT. 

 BAD LUCK 

 As anticipated, calls were raised at the annual general meeting for Hellstrom and Ramstrom to go. 

 "We demand that Ericsson immediately appoints a replacement for Ramqvist. Confidence in the board and its chairman is gone," said Lars Forsgardh, speaking on behalf of an association of small private shareholders. 

 Chairman Ramqvist told shareholders the board had done all in its powers but been dogged by bad luck. 

 "The board has been extremely active but we have not had luck on our side," he said. 

 Ericsson's main owners, who control the company through holdings of vote-strong A-series shares, reaffirmed their support for the board in its entirety. The board, for its part, expressed continued confidence in Hellstrom as CEO.

 WRAPUP 3-Palm warning drags down rival gadgetmakers.

 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Palm Inc.'s surprise profit warning, blamed on the slumping U.S. economy and growing inventories, dragged down shares of handheld computer makers on Wednesday, pushing some to all-time lows. 

 Shares of Palm, the dominant leader of in the nascent handheld device market, fell 7-7/16, or about 48 percent, to close on Nasdaq at 8-1/16 and touched an all-time low of 7-7/8. Volume topped 134 million, nearly 10 times its daily average, making it Wednesday's second most active stock on Nasdaq. 

 Gadget maker Handspring Inc.'s shares also tumbled by about a third to a lifetime low, while Canada's Research In Motion Ltd. , known for its two-way paging devices, fell about 18 percent to its lowest level in about 2 years. 

 The dramatic slide came after Palm surprised investors late on Tuesday with a forecast for a wider-than-expected loss and softer revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in May, as well as job cuts, blamed on the soft U.S. economy. 

 After four consecutive quarters of 100 percent revenue growth, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palm was expected to reel in its growth outlook a bit. 

 But Palm stunned investors with its forecast that revenues would fall to less than $315 million in the quarter, off from $350 million one year ago, and well short of the $572 million previously predicted by analysts. 

 INVENTORY BUILDUP ALSO CITED 

 While Palm's blamed the brunt of its woes on the economy, analysts also pointed to a possible misstep in the debut of new products and the buildup in inventory of older, cheaper models. 

 Palm revealed on Tuesday that significant volumes of its high-end m500 series would hit retail shelves only near the very end of its fiscal fourth quarter, limiting the revenues that those products could reap in the period. 

 "I don't think anyone expected it to be as bad as they make it look," said CIBC World Markets analyst Thomas Sepenzis. "We expect some slowdown due to the economic environment, but this seems to be a Palm product transition issue." 

 Palm's bad news overshadowed a strong fiscal third-quarter report, where pro forma profits of 2 cents a share outstripped estimates. But the data offered hints of Palm's problems, such as its inventories, which jumped to $102 million from $34 million in the second quarter. 

 A chorus of Wall Street analysts downgraded their opinions and forecasts for Palm, citing the companies overestimation of demand for its popular devices, although most reiterated their long-term belief in Palm and its products. 

 Lehman Brothers cut their 2001 earnings per share estimate to 3 cents from 14 cents, while Bear Sterns trimmed it stock price target to $17 from $45. Merrill Lynch reduced its rating to neutral from accumulate. 

 RIVALS SHARES INFECTED 

 Palm's woes infected its rivals on Wednesday, depressing shares in Britain's Psion despite its low U.S. exposure, and in U.S. peer Handspring, despite its upbeat outlook. 

 Psion stock lost as much as 13 percent in reaction to Palm's warning. In London, shares in Psion, Europe's biggest maker of handheld computers, closed at 117-1/2 pence, 10 percent down. The shares had recently made a painstaking recovery from 27-month lows of around 96p. 

 North America accounts for only one-sixth of Psion's revenue and the company said this month that it was shifting its focus from consumer to industrial products. 

 Shares in Palm's smaller U.S. sister, handheld computer maker Handspring, closed down 5-5/16, or 32 percent, to $10-7/8, and hit a new low of 10-25/32. 

 The fall comes despite an attempt by Handspring, which has already started shipping its new line of Visor Edge high-end products, to quell concerns. Late Tuesday it reaffirmed its revenue projections for the fiscal year ending June 30. 

 "While no company is immune to current economic conditions, we see continued sales growth in our business at this time," said Handspring founder and Chief Executive Donna Dubinsky. 

 Canada's Research In Motion, which makes a competing handheld device, also suffered. Its shares fell $4.43, or about 18 percent, to $20.25 on Nasdaq. 

 Palm's warning also pummeled shares of software company Extended Systems Inc. , which Palm agreed earlier this month to buy for about $264 million in stock. Extended's shares ended down 45 percent to 10-9/16, off 8-1/2. 

 In addition to some 250 job cuts from its 1,524-strong employee and 400 contract worker rolls, Palm said it would delay construction of its corporate headquarters in California. Further job cuts are expected after the Extended deal closes. 

 With its branded machines and those powered by its Palm operating system, Palm dominates the $25 billion market for personal digital assistants, the information management gadgets popular with teenagers and chief executives alike.

 UPDATE 2-Marconi hit by fears of  profit warning .

 LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - Fears of a profit warning returned to haunt telecoms equipment maker Marconi Plc on Wednesday, after Canada's Nortel Networks delivered the latest signal of slackening demand in the United States. 

 Marconi was due to post full-year results on May 17 - covering the period ended March 31 - and dealers noted that any pre-results update would have to be given in the next few days. 

 "Marconi hasn't formally had a profits warning yet, but it's hard to believe they can avoid one," said one senior fund manager. 

 A spokesman for Marconi declined comment on the move in the shares and the outbreak of speculation around the stock. "There has been a babble of speculation and rumour and we are not making any comment," he said. 

 Nortel's warning of a first quarter loss ambushed a nascent recovery in Marconi shares, sending them down 37 pence or 9.1 percent to 373p by the London market close. The stock was among the biggest losers in a falling FTSE 100 index, which dropped two percent amid a general selloff in recently recovering telecom stocks. 

 Marconi shares traded above 900p as recently as November, but have been repeatedly pummelled since then by a succession of negative statements from the industry in the United States. 

 The stock has dropped 45 percent so far this year. 

 INDUSTRY SLOWDOWN 

 In its latest statement, Nortel - which in February cut its 2001 revenue growth forecasts by a half to 15 percent - warned that it now expected a loss from operations of 10-12 cents a share in the first quarter, due to an ongoing industry slowdown and pricing pressure from rivals. 

 Nortel underscored the gloomy picture in comments before Wednesday's opening, when it said that the industry downturn was continuing week by week and that it was cautious over conditions in Europe. The stock was down $2.71 at $14.05 by 1620 GMT in New York. 

 Yet Nortel's comments were only the latest indicator of slackening demand from industry leaders ranging from Corning Inc. , the world's biggest maker of fibre-optic cable, to JDS Uniphase Corp . 

 In Britain, Marconi's fellow telecoms equipment maker Bookham Technology Plc - which traded down 38 pence or 10.6 percent - in January warned that fourth quarter losses would be higher than expected at 15-15.5 million pounds. 

 But so far no update has come from Marconi, leaving some company followers frustrated at the lack of news. 

 "The share price is telling you that people are expecting some bad news," said one telecoms equipment analyst. "These sort of stocks are going to be sensitive to sentiment, particularly in the case of Marconi which hasn't been communicating with the market that well." 

 However, the analyst said plenty of bad news should already be reflected in Marconi's poor stock market performance. 

 "At these sorts of prices, if you assume that margins stay roughly where they are Marconi is discounting about five percent (earnings) growth over the next 10 years or so," the analyst said. "However bearish you are, you have to say the business is worth more than that." 

 In its first half results last November, Marconi posted a 26 percent underlying rise in operating profit before one-off items to 320 million pounds on turnover up an underlying 19 percent to 3.2 billion pounds. It said it had received six billion pounds worth of orders in the first half.

 STOCKHOLM, March 28 (Reuters) - Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson said on Wednesday it continued to win market share in mobile systems, the segment where it is the world leader. 

 "I don't understand where the talk is coming from that we would have problems on the systems side. We are not losing market share there but continuing to win market share on the systems side. However, the overall market is developing at a slower pace," Ericsson CEO Kurt Hellstrom told the company's annual general meeting. 

 "Only today we saw Nortel issuing another profit warning. The slowdown is in full swing and it is a big problem for everybody," Hellstrom said. 

 He was referring to rival Nortel Networks Corp. , which cut its first-quarter forecasts earlierin the day. 

 Ericsson shares extended early losses in late afternoon trade on Wednesday after the company said it expected very weak, maybe zero, growth in the U.S. market this year.

 NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds underperformed Treasuries on Wednesday as traders once again fretted about equities, where the year's second warning of lower-than-expected earnings from Nortel Networks Corp. and Palm Inc. weighed heavily. 

 In secondary trading, spreads - the yield difference between corporate bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries - widened about 0.02 percentage points. 

 "Spreads are open a couple of basis points wider after a nice rally on Tuesday," said one trader. "We're just going to follow the stock market for the next 12 years." 

 NORTEL LOSS TO GROW, BONDS WEAKEN 

 Nortel, the world's No. 1 supplier of telecommunications equipment, was a big loser Wednesday morning, after the company warned of a bigger-than-expected first quarter loss and lower-than-expected revenues because of the slowing U.S. economy and rising competition. 

 It also said it will cut 5,000 more jobs, or about 5 percent of its workforce, by mid-year, on top of 10,000 already announced cuts. 

 Nortel, which issued a profit warning in February, now expects a first quarter operating loss of 10 to 12 cents per share on revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $7.7 billion. 

 Its 6.125 percent notes maturing in February 2026 were bid on Wednesday to yield about 2.2 percentage points more than Treasuries, up from 1.9 to 1.95 on Tuesday, and 1.47 when the company sold them on February 1. 

 SUPPLY 

 Three companies sold bonds late on Tuesday, all in sales they increased in size. 

 American Transmission Co., a Waukesha, Wisc.-based electric transmission system operator, privately sold $300 million, up from $275 million, of 10-year notes yielding 2.25 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

 Iron Mountain Inc. , a Boston-based record and information management services company, privately sold $225 million, up from $200 million, of 12-year subordinated junk bonds yielding 3.625 percentage points more than Treasuries. 

 And Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing , the world's No. 3 chip foundry, said it sold $500 million of five-year senior convertible notes with a yield to maturity of 5.25 percent and roughly 33 percent conversion premium. A 5.25 to 5.5 percent yield and 27 to 33 percent premium were expected. The sale was increased in size from an original $350 million. 

 On Wednesday in Europe, General Electric Capital Corp., the finance arm of Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co. , added 100 million euros ($89 million) to an issue maturing in 2015. 

 At least two billion-dollar-plus sales sit on the calendar. Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.'s PSEG Power LLC plans to privately sell $1.6 billion of three-, five-and 10-year notes to buy more generation assets. PSEG's debt is expected to be rated "Baa1" by Moody's Investors Service, and is rated "BBB" by Standard & Poor's. 

 Also, TransOcean Sedco Forex Inc. , a Houston-based offshore drilling contractor, plans to sell $1.2 billion of debt in two parts. The debt should be rated "Baa2" by Moody's and "A-minus" by S&P. 

 Other expected sales come from: Apogent Technologies Inc. , a Portsmouth, N.H.-based laboratory and life sciences products maker, $300 million; Avista Corp. , a Spokane, Wash.-based energy company, $300 million; and Maytag Corp. , the Newton, Iowa-based No. 3 U.S. appliance maker that warned on Tuesday of lower-than-expected quarterly earnings, $185 million. 

 In junk, sales are expected from: Century Aluminum Co. , a Monterey, Calif.-based aluminum producer, $315 million; Sequa Corp. , a New York-based industrial company, $200 million; and TeleCorp PCS , an Arlington, Va.-based regional phone company, $425 million. 

 Ten-year Treasuries rose 11/32 in early trading, as their yields fell to 4.965 percent.

 Shares of Hand-Held Computer Makers Take Beating After Palm's  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -- Personal digital assistants were always seen as a red-hot area of technology that wouldn't succumb to the slowing economy. 

 But that theory was shattered late Tuesday when Palm Inc. (PALM), the maker of the popular Palm hand-held device, missed sales expectations for the third quarter and warned it will post a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter. 

 Investors, who were banking on strong growth out of the PDA sector, showed their dismay Wednesday. 

 As of 4 p.m. EST on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Palm (PALM) was down $7.44, or 48%, at $8.06 on heavy volume. The stock traded as high as $67.38 on Nov. 3. 

 Palm wasn't the only PDA maker to feel the pain Wednesday. Shares of competitor Handspring Inc. (HAND) were down 33%, while Research In Motion Limited (RIMM) was off 18%. 

 After the close of trading Tuesday, Palm posted revenue of $470.8 million for its third quarter, up 73% from a year ago, but short of analysts' expectations of revenue of $474 million. 

 The company was able to exceed analysts' profit projections for the quarter. Palm came in with operating earnings per share of two cents, while analysts were anticipating earnings of a penny. 

 As for the fourth quarter, Palm said it expects a loss of eight cents a share on revenue of $300 million to $315 million, compared to a Thomson Financial/First Call mean estimate for a profit of three cents a share. The company blamed the deteriorating economy for the projected loss. 

 If the profit warning wasn't bad enough, Palm also said Tuesday that it plans to lay off 250 workers over the next month. The company had 1,524 employees and about 400 contract workers at the end of the third quarter. 

 The company will also postpone plans to build a new headquarters in San Jose, Calif., and is trying to reduce how much it spends on real estate. 

 Following the earnings announcement and forecast of a loss in the fourth quarter, the stock was downgraded by a slew of investment firms, including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Robertson Stephens. 

 While Palm's shares were taking a beating Wednesday and may look attractive to investors, some analysts recommend avoiding the stock. 

 In addition to Palm slashing its guidance for the fourth quarter, there are more reasons not to buy Palm, said Melanie Hollands, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., in a research note Wednesday. 

 For one, an inventory buildup for older products suggests further price reductions and writedowns for Palm, she said. 

 Investors should also avoid the stock because there is a near-term "saturation of device sales" and there are competitive shifts going on, she said. 

 Ms. Hollands downgraded shares of Palm to near-term neutral from near-term accumulate and to long-term accumulate from long-term buy. The analyst also lowered her rating on Handspring. 

 Echoing Merrill, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Richard Gardner, also said he wouldn't buy Palm shares Wednesday, despite the sell-off. 

 In a research note, Mr. Gardner said he is concerned that the recent slowdown in U.S. demand will spread to the company's two largest international regions, Europe and Japan. 

 Mr. Gardner, too, said that previous inventory commitments on older products could lead to inventory writedowns in the May quarter and even further out. The analyst added that Palm is facing increased competition from Handspring. 

 Even though many Wall Street analysts were quick to cut their ratings on Palm in light of the earnings warning, Andrew Neff, an analyst at Bear Stearns & Co., who is bullish on the PDA sector, maintained his buy rating, although he did lower his estimates. 

 In a research note, Mr. Neff said he kept his rating unchanged based on "our view of the secular growth trend in the hand-held market and Palm's position within it." According to Mr. Neff, Palm's earnings should benefit from the launch of its m500 and m505 hand-held devices as well as the launch of a new wireless Palm in the fall that offers wireless e-mail for enterprises. 

 The Palm m500 and Palm m505 are nearly as thin as the Palm V and feature a bundle of new capabilities. Some of the highlights include sleek models with color screens, postage stamp-size expansion slots, software that shows off digital photos and video footage as well as and updated operating system that boosts the hand-held computer's wireless connectivity. 

 The weak outlook from Palm sent shares of Extended Systems Inc., which agreed earlier this month to be acquired by Palm, reeling. As of 4 p.m. EST, Extended Systems (XTND) traded at $10.56, down $8.50, or 45%. 

 According to the deal, if Palm trades between $16 and $22 a share, Extended Systems should get $22 a share worth of Palm stock, said Rich Valera, analyst at Needham & Co. 

 "But once Palm fell below $16, the ratio is maxed out," said Mr. Valera, who doesn't expect Extended Systems to back out of the deal, now estimated to be worth around $130 million from its previous $260 million value.

 ADC Telecom CEO Says Spending Slowdown 'Unprecedented'

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- After 29 years in the business, ADC Telecommunications Inc. (ADCT) Chief Executive Rick Roscitt has  never seen such a big drop-off in telecommunications equipment  spending. 

 Having been on both sides of the fence, Roscitt should know. He's the former head of AT&T Corp.'s (T) business services unit, once the big dog in the North American telecommunications market. 

 On Wednesday, ADC warned it will lose 10 cents to l5 cents a share on sales between $650 million and $700 million in its fiscal second quarter ending next month. The company was expected to earn 9 cents a share on revenue of $852.2 million. ADC's announcement came a day after Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) issued a profit warning. 

 "I've seen these slowdowns two or three times," Roscitt told Dow Jones Newswires. "But I've never seen it as severe or  as sudden. It is a bit unprecedented to the extent that everything (within the industry) was green." 

 After two years of staggering sales growth, telecommunications companies have put their capital spending in  a lockbox. The slowdown in the U.S. economy has been the main culprit, with little investment going to startup phone companies that were building new networks and adding customers.  So dominant carriers like AT&T, WorldCom Inc. (WCOM) and the Baby Bells have not had to spend as much to protect their customer base. 

 "I think the big carriers are all taking a chance to get a  breather and improve their balance sheets," Roscitt said. 

 ADC had expected robust spending in 2001. The whole market geared up to meet that demand, flooding companies with products  that now are collecting dust on the shelves. Roscitt expects it will take the rest of this quarter and part of next to reduce the inventory. 

 He also believes it will take a return of funding to startup phone companies to kick-start spending. 

 But Roscitt also believes AT&T's decision this month to buy  bankrupt Northpoint Communications Inc.'s equipment to provide  digital subscriber line services to businesses and consumers may be the kind of new competition to the Bells that the market  needs. 

 "That's a well-heeled big national player in DSL that could spur some spending," he said. 

 ADC expects to report positive earnings in the second half of the year, but the Wednesday announcement that the company will cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs indicates that a quick uptick in spending is not expected. The job cuts are in addition to 3,000  jobs the company already planned to trim. ADC also plans to increase operating reserves to get it through the spending slowdown. 

 Roscitt tried to put a positive spin on the profit warning. 

 "(The slowdown) provides us some air cover to reposition ourselves," Roscitt said. "I think that this is an opportunity to aggressively move in the direction we wanted." 

 Roscitt said ADC will increase its focus on making products  for the optical DSL, Internet Protocol, cable and software markets. 

 Industry insiders believe that demand for high-speed telecommunications services will double every year for at least  the next decade, which would create demand for the kinds of connectivity and access products that ADC makes. 

 The warnings by ADC and Nortel reverberated throughout the telecommunications equipment sector Wednesday, with most companies taking a double-digit hit to their stock prices. 

 Nortel's announcement had the most profound impact because of its prominence as the leading supplier of optical systems. Companies like JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) and Corning Inc. (GLW) sell optical components to Nortel and competitor Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU), which has long characterized 2001 as a turnaround year due to market and company-specific issues. 

 Last week, Corning lowered earnings guidance for 2001, citing the much talked about slowdown in carrier-spending growth. The company did not adjust estimates for the first quarter, and will not do so since it is now in a quiet period, a company spokesman said Tuesday. 

 JDS Uniphase officials had no comment on its own guidance after the Nortel warning. 

 Within the optical sector, only systems makers Ciena Corp. (CIEN) and ONI Systems Inc. (ONIS) have raised guidance for the year. Both are pure optical plays and have no exposure to the legacy circuit-switched equipment market dominated by Lucent and Nortel. Even as telecommunications spending growth has weakened, spending on optical equipment is growing as a percentage of all sales. 

 Corning Chief Executive John Loose told Dow Jones Newswires last week the company expects demand for broadband services to increase 100% annually for the next 10 to 15 years. 

 "I think that number is conservative," he said. 

 But the lack of funding for startup phone companies has clearly extinguished the inferno of spending the telecommunications industry saw last year. 

 And with JDS Uniphase and Corning executives saying visibility is the worst they can remember, investors have abandoned the optical sector. 

 Corning, JDS Uniphase and Nortel all traded at 52-week lows Wednesday. 

 "There is no doubt these are painful times for shareholders since telecom stocks are under significant near-term pressure," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst. "But unless you believe the information revolution is a fad and the networked economy is a fluke, you've got to see these low prices ... as a bargain." 

 Kagan said he believes the slowdown in spending is a short-term issue. 

 He also said ADC would have made cuts to its work force under Roscitt's leadership even without the downturn. 

 "Without the industry issues, (Roscitt) would be streamlining the operation and focusing on the high-growth areas, making the organization leaner and meaner," Kagan said. 

 Mark Langley, telecommunications equipment analyst with Epoch Partners, said in a morning note that while further preannouncements in the sector are likely, much of the risk is already priced into the stocks. 

 "We believe current valuations represent a good entry point for long-term investors, but short-term investors should remain on the sidelines while the market searches for a bottom," he said. 

 Additionally, he said Nortel's warning represents a decrease in expected revenues of approximately 2.4% from earlier guidance to the midpoint of the new guidance. 

 Langley figures any anticipated hit to Nortel's optical systems sales could reduce JDS Uniphase's sales this quarter by a meager 0.61%. 

 But fear has gripped Wall Street, and the lack of concrete estimates for the remainder of the year only adds anxiety. 

 For example, shares of optical component and manufacturing automation equipment maker Newport Corp. (NEWP) continued to sell off Wednesday on rumors that Corning has canceled orders, even after Newport Chief Executive Robert Deuster told Dow Jones Newswires that was not true and any potential delay in sales to Corning was figured into the company's guidance issued March 6. 

 Such volatility may remain the norm until telecommunications equipment companies can provide more long-term guidance to Wall Street - neither Nortel nor ADC gave full-year guidance when they issued their latest revisions.

 DOOM-and-gloom merchants were last week talking the Footsie down to 5200, or even 5000 in the short-term. Yesterday it traded above 5700. It closed 151.5 points up at 5728.1 amid speculation that the European Central Bank will shave its interest rate (by 1.4pc) for the first time tomorrow, ahead of an expected cut in UK rates by Sir Eddie George and his chums at the Bank of England next week. 

 DeAnne Julius, Queen dove of the monetary policy committee, told the British Chambers of Commerce that the US is heading for a 'shallow recession'. It will affect the UK and she therefore believes there is 'ample scope' for further interest rate cuts. 

 Wall Street's early performance was the icing on the cake. It jumped 143 points and Nasdaq 55 points, after US consumer confidence data showed a gain the first for six months. The index was 117 in March, up from a revised 109.2 in February. 

 Dorothy Perkins-to-Top Shop and Evans retailing group Arcadia soared 213.4p to 1863.4p, on news that an investment vehicle led by Iceland's biggest retailer, Baugur, bought a further 9m shares on Monday, increasing its stake to 20.1pc and giving it a powerful influence over future boardroom strategy. Other investors include investment bank Kaupthing and private company Gaumur. 

 Baugur has a Swedish subsidiary which runs stores franchised from Arcadia, including Top Shop and Miss Selfridge. Its investment has always been considered 'friendly' but dealers are now not so sure. 

 New chief executive Stuart Rose has promised to restructure the sprawling retail group. Analysts expect job cuts once he starts chopping its ragbag of retail brands. They expect Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins will stay, but Miss Selfridge, Warehouse, Racing Green and Wade Smith could all go. 

 If the Icelanders dislike the plans, they could easily turn aggressive. A 20pc shareholding is the perfect launch-pad for a bid. 

 Financials took on a new lease of life on cheaper money hopes. Lloyds TSB advanced 44 1.2p to 699 1.2p, Bank of Scotland 38p to 690p, Barclays 100p to 2100p and Royal Bank of Scotland 69p to 1514p. 

 Automotive parts giant GKN accelerated 47p to 746p after broker UBS Warburg advised clients to buy up to 900p. The broker fancies retailer Dixons, 8p better at 265p. Its target price is 310p. 

 British Telecom buzzed 271.2p higher to 547 1.2p on expectations of board changes and speculation that merger talks with AT&T are on again. 

 Logistics company Exel rose 43p to 755p after chairman John F. Devaney bought 4,106 shares at 719p. 

 Gary Smith's AIM-listed Winchester Entertainments, the UK buyer of distribution rights to Hollywood movies, rose 101.2p to 2391.2p. Heartbreaker, a US comedy starring Gene Hackman and Sigourney Weaver, achieved the No 1 box-office rating in its opening weekend in the US. The film grossed $12m and opens in the UK in June. 

 Roofer and conservatory builder Ultraframe plummeted 491.2p to 354p, following a shock profit warning. Wet weather drowned profits in the first-half. It expects interim pre-tax profits to be not less than #9m, below the figure for the equivalent period last year. 

 Support services company Aukett crashed to 71.2p, before closing 51.4p down at 91.4p following a profit warning. Margins have suffered from new projects commencing at a slower rate than had been anticipated. Broker Williams de Broe downgraded its full-year forecast to #1m from #2.4m but says buy. Four directors did, buying 320,000 shares between them at the common price of 81.2p. 

 Isle of Man retailer Shoprite touched 83.4p before closing 31.2p off at 11p. Competition on the island is eroding its margins and full-year profits will be substantially below budget. 

 News that management buy-out talks have been terminated left wallpaper company Walker Greenbank 61.2p down at 161.2p. David Medcalf and Peter Harkness, part of the buy-out team, impressed during the discussions and have been appointed to the board.

 ATTENTION - RECASTS, UPDATES rates 

 LONDON, March 28 (AFP) - European shares slumped Wednesday, dragged down by a sharp drop in early Wall Street trade and fresh fears over the global economy and corporate profits. 

 "A reversal was to be expected," said one trader in Paris, after two days of gains in Europe were abruptly halted by profit warnings from US technology heavyweights Nortel Networks and Palm. 

 "You have to take profits at the moment and stay calm," he  said. 

 Investors were already cautious on the eve of a European Central Bank meeting on interest rates and also ahead of first quarter corporate results to hit the market in the coming weeks. 

 London's FTSE 100 dropped 114.1 points, or 2.0 percent, to close at 5,614.0 while Paris' CAC-40 index fell 85.17 points, or 1.6 percent, to finish at 5,150.43. 

 In late Frankfurt trade, the DAX was at 5,797.92, down 140.29 points or 2.4 percent. 

 The Euro Stoxx 50 index of stocks in the 12-nation euro zone was down 74.68 points, or 1.8 percent, at 4,155.13. The euro dropped to 0.8886 dollars in late trade from 0.8934 dollars in New York the previous day. 

 In early Wall Street trade, the blue-chip the Dow Jones industrials index was down 221.36 points, or 2.2 percent, at 9,726.18 and the Nasdaq had tumbled 74.32 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,897.94. 

 The weak US performance hurt sentiment across Europe, particularly among technology stocks, brokers said. 

 In London, Marconi shed 37 pence to finish at 373, spooked by  the warning from Nortel. 

 Handheld computer firm Psion slumped 13 pence to 117.5 in reaction to the fourth quarter profit warning from Palm. 

 Market heavyweight Vodafone dropped nine pence to 204,  undermined by talk of a rift between Vodafone and its US partner  Verizon over next-generation mobile telephone technology. 

 In Paris, telecommunications equipment manufacturer Alcatel dropped 3.07 euros, or 7.2 percent, to 39.75. 

 STMicroelectronics fell 1.78 euros to 40.70. 

 In late Frankfurt trade, one broker said any rate cut by the European Central Bank to help the euro zone economy was unlikely to help the markets. "The market has already priced in a rate cut by 25 basis points," the trader said. 

 Business software giant SAP was down 8.88 euros, or 6.1 percent, at 138.00. Siemens had slumped 4.65 euros to 120.35 and its microchip arm Infineon was down 1.80 euros at 44.30. 

 Deutsche Telekom was down 1.1 euros at 27.10. 

 Elsewhere, Amsterdam's AEX fell 1.0 percent to 552.77 points, Zurich's Swiss Market Index dropped 0.6 percent to 6,966.9 points, Madrid's IBEX-35 slipped 1.1 percent to 9,163.4 points, Brussels' Bel-20 eased 0.4 percent to 2,759.79 and Milan's Mib 30 retreated 1.3 percent to 38,247. 

 On the fixed-interest markets, the yield on the benchmark  10- year bund fell to 4.66 percent from 4.67 percent late Tuesday.

 German Stocks PM - DAX slips further, after Wall Street losses.

 Mar 28, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - Frankfurt, March 28 (BridgeNews) - German shares slipped further into the red in early evening trade, with the combination of profit-taking, Nortel's profit-warning and Euro zone M3 data dampening sentiment, and dragging the DAX lower. The DAX's woes were compounded when Wall Street opened lower, with the Nasdaq down 47 points to 1924 points, while the Dow Jones fell 114 points to 9829 points. At 1725 CET, the DAX-30 was down 2.2% to 5807.11 points. 


			*			 *			 *



 Euro zone M3 money supply rose an unadjusted 4.7% on the year in February, unchanged fromJanuary. The three-month moving average of the annual growth rate reached 4.8% after a revised 4.9%. The latter figure compares with an ECB "reference value" of 4.5% and matches market expectations. Analysts expect February's M3 growth might decrease the likelihood of the European Central Bank cutting interest rates when it meets on Thursday. 

 Lehman Brothers cut its Nortel Networks Corp.'s 2001 earnings estimate to 25 cents a share from 47 cents after Nortel said it will lose as much as 12 cents per share in the first quarter, as the economic slowdown continues to hurt demand for telecommunications equipment. The company now plans to cut 15,000 jobs by mid-year, 50% more than it said last month. 

 German TMT issues squirmed on Nortel's news and lead the DAX's decline, with SAP AG the main loser, down 6.5% to 137.40 euros. Semi-conductor producer Infineon AG dropped 3.37% to 44.50 euros, after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter decreased its EPS estimates on Infineon Technologies to 0.5 euros from 0.75 euros in 2001 and to 1.25 euros from 1.50 euros in 2002 on the back of lower DRAM and wireless revenues. 

 Infineon's parent company Siemens AG didn't fare much better, and slipped 3.6% to 120.61 euros. 

 Financials were generally in negative territory, with HypoVereinsbank the main downward mover, down 4.2% to 57.05 euros. Deutsche Bank AG fell 2.1% to 82.10 euros. 

 Bucking the trend, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank AG were both higher, buoyed by comments from Commerzbank's incoming CEO that he wouldn't rule out restarting merger talks with Dresdner Bank. Klaus-Peter Mueller's remark3 at the bank's full-year press conference in Frankfurt today came a year after negotiations between both banks broke down. Commerzbank last traded 2% higher to 29.54 euros, while Dresdner Bank was up 0.3% to 46.10 euros. 

 Lufthansa AG climbed back into the black, up 1.6% to 21.12 euros. The airline's operations returned to normal after pilots completed their warning strike, which took place from 0630 and 0900 CET and disrupted short-haul flights for several hours. Germany's main pilots union Cockpit on Monday called on the carrier's 4,200 pilots to take part in the warning strike to push for wage increases averaging 30%. 

 Deutsche Post World Net AG upped 1.5% to 19.99 euros, after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet approved draft legislation seeking a five-year extension of Deutsche Post AG's monopoly on letter delivery. The step was requested by Economics Minister Werner Mueller to protect the former government agency until state monopolies are lifted in other European Union countries. 

 Utility RWE AG gained on the news that its unit, RWE-DEA, and Shell Deutschland GmbH, plan to merge their existing German refinery and petrol station activities in a 50/50 joint venture, which will become the biggest 

 player in the German market. RWE AG added 3.9% to 40.81 euros. 

 German pharmaceutical Schering AG saw its shares rise 1.1% to 53.29 euros after it received its first approval for its liver-specific contrast agent Resovist in Sweden. The agent, developed by Schering's own research and development department in cooperation with Japan's Meito Sangyo, will be launched in mi2-2001. Market authorization within the EU is expected within the next six months.

 CeBIT: Technology Weakness Hits Europe --- Buzz Cools at Hannover's CeBIT Fair as Company's Face a Spreading U.S. Slowdown --- `Everyone Is Concerned'

 HANNOVER, Germany -- Evidence is mounting that the slowdown in the U.S. technology market is spreading across the Atlantic. 

 Technology executives say companies in Europe are putting off buying new computers, and analysts are forecasting that the European market will experience slower growth this year. Price cuts in the U.S. also are beginning to spread to Europe, as computer and mobile-phone companies attempt to kick-start demand for their products. 

 The industry's jitters are tangible here at Europe's massive CeBIT technology exhibition, which is set to end today. About 400 companies, or about one in 20 of those due to exhibit, canceled their exhibition-stand reservations in the six months leading up to the show, compared with 300 last year, the organizers say. 

 Although attendance for the first three days was up slightly from 2000, exhibitors noticed from the first day of the show that the normally hype-filled event was more subdued than last year. 

 Gautam Sharma and James Balog, executives of U.S. electronics company Royal Consumer Business Products, spent much of the event watching visitors drift by their stand. "It is a little slower than in the past," says Mr. Sharma, international director at Royal Consumer, which is owned by Italy's Olivetti SpA. 

 The two are trying to boost their business in Europe to make up for slowing U.S. sales. It isn't working. They have only one sure sale from one day's work and are certain that the European technology market is slowing, too. "The fallout in telecoms is going to affect the Nordic region," says Mr. Sharma. 

 He isn't alone. Some of the biggest companies in the computer industry are worried. "Everyone is concerned about how the U.S. is going to impact the European economy," says Carol Hess-Nickels, head of Compaq Computer Corp.'s server business in Europe. 

 If the European market does crash, it would be a bitter pill for the global technology industry to swallow. As the U.S. has gone into reverse, technology companies from around the world have been betting that Europe will take up the slack. That is partly because the European economy is growing faster than the U.S. economy. In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product in Europe rose at a 1.9% annual rate, compared with a 1.7% pace in the U.S. There is also a widely held view that the European market has far more room to grow than the U.S., because computer and Internet usage are lower. 

 Many technology companies are still seduced by the promise of Europe. At the four-story CeBIT stand of Fujitsu Siemens Computers -- a joint venture of Siemens AG and Fujitsu Ltd. -- no expense has been spared. Flying acrobats and high-energy dancers entertain visitors, while young women dressed in shiny silver outfits auction portable computers. Sitting on a leather sofa in the executive suite on the top floor, Paul Stodden, chief executive of Fujitsu Siemens, says the U.S has over-invested in technology over the past few years, but Europe has been less reckless. "That builds a cushion for additional market growth," he says. 

 While the slowdown in Europe isn't expected to be as severe as in the U.S., research released last week suggests the European technology market is unlikely to escape untouched. Growth in the market for computer and telecommunications equipment and services in Western Europe will slow to 11% this year from 13% last year, according to the European Information Technology Observatory, an industry organization whose semiannual forecasts are closely watched. Next year is expected to be even slower, at 8.9% growth. Those growth levels would be outstanding for many industries, but are well below what technology businesses have enjoyed in recent years. The trade group predicts the hardest hit sectors will be telecommunications equipment and services, and computer hardware, particularly personal computers. 

 At the CeBIT stand of U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard Co., a small crowd gathers around a display showing two innocuous racks of beige boxes. They are casting an eye over a range of computer servers H-P has begun discounting heavily. Although the LP1000r Netserver just was introduced in January, H-P has cut the list price by 28%. 

 Alberto Bozzo, operations manager for H-P, says the price cuts are designed to tempt European businesses back into the market. "The corporate sector is taking a bit of a break," he says. Germany, the U.K. and Scandinavia are "where we have noticed it most." 

 Dell Computer Corp. has cut the price of its servers and portable computers sharply in Europe in recent weeks, while Compaq also is planning to reduce prices in Europe. "With the pressure on the U.S. economy, we are looking to the European market to help the U.S. out," says Compaq's Ms. Hess-Nickels. 

 The price cuts by the computer giants are made possible by the falling cost of components. The slowdown in the U.S. has hit component makers hard. Although prices for dynamic random access memory chips, which are widely used in computers, communications equipment and some consumer electronics, have begun to stabilize in the past few weeks, investment bank UBS Warburg LLC says prices have fallen about 70% in the past six months. As a result, UBS Warburg forecasts the global DRAM market will be $20.6 billion this year, a 28% drop from 2000. 

 Although computer companies are confident that the fall in the cost of the technology will give the market a boost, not everyone is convinced it will make a difference. U.S. communications-equipment maker 3Com Corp. says Europe's chief financial officers have been clamping down on technology purchases. But Stanimira Koleva, director of 3Com's segment management team in Europe, doesn't believe cutting prices will persuade nervous businesses to buy. 

 When it comes to price cutting, some companies don't have much choice. Mobile-phone makers are facing serious overcapacity, which is forcing them to drastically reduce the prices they charge telecom operators for handsets, analysts say. Per Lindberg, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, estimates operators are paying 25% less for comparable handsets now than a year ago. 

 "There are unprecedented supply-and-demand imbalances," he says. However, Mr. Lindberg doesn't believe cash-strapped operators will pass these price reductions on to consumers. 

 Mobile-phone makers are loath to discuss the prices they charge operators. In its recent profit warning, Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson said excess capacity has placed the mobile-phone market under price pressure, but a spokeswoman declined to say whether Ericsson has cut prices. However, Ericsson was clear that the slowdown isn't confined to the U.S. "In Western Europe, in markets with high penetration, operators are delaying investments," the company said. 

 A recent rash of such warnings by U.S. and European technology companies has sent European technology shares plummeting in recent months, creating problems for young companies looking for financing. GastroFix AG, a fast-growing start-up based in Saarbrucken, Germany, which supplies software for cash registers, is exhibiting at CeBIT for the first time, in the hope of raising its profile ahead of selling shares on Germany's technology stock market, the Neuer Markt. But since the decision to list was made last year, the retrenchment in technology stocks is forcing GastroFix to rethink its plans for an initial public offering. 

 The collapse of tech stocks means the prevailing mood at CeBIT is much more sober than in the past few years, when everything was booming. Another sign of a slowdown: Compared with last year, fewer visitors are brandishing bags stuffed with corporate giveaways. Hype has been unusually absent at most of the fair's media briefings, where companies have tended to focus on what they are doing now, rather than the future.

American Greetings Plans to  Cut  1,500 Jobs, Issues  Profit Warning

CLEVELAND -- American Greetings Corp. warned earnings for the current fiscal year will fall short of estimates, announced plans to eliminate 1,500 jobs, or about 13% of its full-time work force and named a new president and chief operating officer.

American Greeting said the job cuts are part of a broad restructuring plan that will result in pretax charges of about $200 to $220 million. The company expects the moves, which also include consolidating six facilities and reduce product lines, will result in annual pretax savings of about $90 million beginning in fiscal 2003.

American Greetings said it expects the reorganization to begin immediately and conclude by the end of fiscal 2002, which ends in February 2002.

The company said fiscal 2002 earnings will be hurt by weak pricing, continued unfavorable retail trends and the economic downturn. American Greetings sees 2002 earnings in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 a share, excluding nonrecurring items. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call was for 2002 earnings of $1.38 a share.

In addition to the restructuring charge, American Greeting said it will record pretax charges of $80 million to $90 million for fiscal 2002 to install scan-based trading at select retailers and an $18 million charge to cover contractual changes in relationships with partners.

Firm Swung to 4th-Quarter Loss on Tax Charge

For its fiscal fourth-quarter ended Feb. 28, the company reported a net loss, primarily because of a $143 million reserve for tax exposure related to corporate-owned life insurance plans.

American Greetings posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $127.7 million, or $2.01 a share, compared with net income of $51.6 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 7.8% to $663.2 million.

Excluding charges, the company said it would have posted a profit of $48.4 million, or 76 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call was for earnings from operations of 75 cents a share. American

The Internal Revenue Service has been contesting deductions on interest payments related to corporate life insurance plans. The IRS claimed the practice, which involves purchasing life insurance on broad pools of employees using funds borrowed from the insurer and then deducting the interest payments from the company's tax bill, is little more than a tax shelter.

Restructuring Chief Named President

American Greetings named Jim Spira president and chief operating officer. Mr. Spira, who has been leading the restructuring effort, will assume added responsibility for the management of the company's core businesses and help develop growth strategies.

Last summer, American Greeting said its former president and chief operating officer, Edward Fruchtenbaum, had resigned. At the time, the company named Chairman and Chief Executive Morry Weiss to the added posts of president and chief operating officer.

In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Greetings (AM) was down $1.89, or 13%, to $12.45.

 UPDATE 1-Specialty chip stocks pounded after warnings.

 NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Investors pummeled shares of communications chip makers on Tuesday for the second day in a row, as the market digested an earnings warning by Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. and a series of cutbacks in analysts' profit expectations. 

 Late on Monday, Vitesse slashed its fiscal-second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook by 50 percent, the second reduction in a month. The news capped an already bad day for communications chip stocks, in which PMC-Sierra Inc. and Conexant Systems Inc. both cut jobs and profit expectations. 

 Network equipment makers such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. have lost some of their appetite for microchips in recent months as an expected boom in telecommunications and data services has failed to pan out. 

 Last year's ravenous ordering of microchips built up such a large surplus that equipment makers have had to cut back their orders drastically, if they ordered at all. 

 "The Ciscos and Lucents of the world wanted to make sure they could have enough components to serve their customers, who were ordering products hand over fist," Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Lipacis said. "As a result you got double ordering and triple ordering." 

 "When demand stops, first you get the companies canceling the double orders, then you get them canceling the single orders," he added. 

 That analysis matched the reality painted by PMC-Sierra, whose chief executive said in a conference call on Monday that "several of our customers have basically net bookings of close to zero this quarter." 

 Shares of PMC-Sierra dropped 97 cents, or 3 percent, to $31.29 after falling 5 percent on Monday. Conexant stock dropped 2 percent, falling 3/16 to $10-5/16. 

 Hardest hit were the two companies who gave profit warnings after the bell on Monday. 

 Shares of Vitesse were down 9/16, or 13.4 percent, at $29-3/8 after hitting a 52-week low of $27-13/16. 

 TranSwitch Corp., which on Monday gave its second earnings warning in March, saw its stock sink $3-3/8, or 17.9 percent, to $15-1/2 after hitting a 52-week low of $14-1/2. 

 Wall Street analysts took little mercy on chip makers, with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Bros. cutting profit expectations. 

 "We believe (PMC-Sierra) stock, while likely not to go much further down, could be 'dead money' for the next several months," CSFB analyst Charlie Glavin wrote in a research note.

 NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Investors pummeled shares of communications chip makers on Tuesday for the second day in a row as the market digested a late-day earnings warning by Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. and a series of cutbacks in analysts' profit expectations. 

 Late Monday, Vitesse slashed its fiscal second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook by 50 percent, the second reduction in a month. The news capped an already bad day for communications chip stocks, in which PMC-Sierra Inc. and Conexant Systems Inc. both cut jobs and profit expectations. 

 "We believe that new orders were extremely weak for all the communications (chips) players in February and March," a Lehman Brothers research note stated. 

 Lehman said order backlogs, which generate revenue even when times turn bad, shrunk during the period as Internet equipment companies canceled and delayed orders. 

 Network equipment makers such as Lucent Technologies Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. have lost some of their appetite for microchips in recent months as an expected boom in telecommunications and data services has failed to pan out. 

 Shares of Vitesse hit a 52-week low of $27-13/16 in early trade. Later in the session, they were at $30, down $3-15/16, or 11.6 percent. 

 Echoing the bad news, TranSwitch Corp. on Monday gave its second earnings warning in March. Its shares were down $3-1/16, or 16.2 percent, at $15-13/16 on Tuesday morning after earlier losing more than a fifth of their value to hit a year low of $14-1/2. 

 In notes to investors, Lehman, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs took a knife to their profit expectations for communications chip companies.

 NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Robertson Stephens on Tuesday said it cut its earnings outlook for Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASM International NV following the firm's profit warning Monday. 

 Analyst Sue Billat reduced her first-quarter earnings estimate for the company to 30 cents from 49 cents a share, and for 2001 to 58 cents from $1.91 a share. 

 "Due to the softness in the semiconductor capital equipment sector, the company is no longer confident of meeting its prior guidance of flat growth for 2001," Billat said in a research note. She said she projects revenues for its front-end equipment segment to decline 20 percent, in line with its estimates for other leading equipment suppliers. 

 The company's shares gained $1-1/8, or nearly 8 percent, to $15-3/8 in Tuesday morning trade on Nasdaq. The stock's 52-week range is $9-1/4 to $37-5/8.

 Siemens would be happy as No 2 in handsets - CEO.

 HELSINKI, March 27 (Reuters) - Germany's Siemens would be glad to be the world's second biggest handset maker, conceding that for now the lead of Finland's Nokia is unassailable, its head said in a newspaper interview published on Tuesday. 

 "Challenging Nokia at this point would be too much, but second (place) would be good," Siemens Chief Executive Heinrich von Pierer told business daily Kauppalehti. "Technologically we are not behind them, in marketing perhaps we are a bit." 

 Siemens currently is number four globally in mobile phone production, behind Sweden's Ericsson and U.S. Motorola . In Europe, the German electronics giant has surged to number two in terms of market share behind Nokia. 

 A Siemens spokesman said at the CeBIT technology fair last week in Hanover, Germany, that its market share in mobile phones would continue to rise despite an overall slowing market. 

 Last week, also at CeBIT, Nokia said it was well on its way to grabbing a 40 percent market share of the global handset market, taking advantage of troubles in the cellphone divisions of Ericsson and Motorola. 

 Von Pierer also glossed over his company's profit-warning given two weeks ago, just a day after it listed its shares on the New York stock exchange, saying Siemens was overdue to make its presence felt in the U.S. market. 

 "In a long-term strategic process, one day is not that important," he told Kauppalehti. 

 "The date had been decided six months earlier... It was already time to list in the United States. We have 19,000 people working for us there, all of our competitors are there, and we can now use our shares for acquisitions," he said. 

 Von Pierer said Siemens would decide on outsourcing more production when it made sense to do so, saying that while the group now outsources around a quarter of production, it would not give up manufacturing, which it sees as a core competence. 

 Telecom equipment makers have recently moved to outsource more production or shift manufacturing to low-cost countries and cut staff as markets cool and competition intensifies.

 Chip Makers' 01 Outlook Seen Uncertain On Slowing Demand

 CANNES, France -(Dow Jones)- Chip manufacturers and analysts see the downturn in the sector continuing this year but are uncertain as to how deep the trough will be. 

 Attending SG Cowen's global technology conference in Cannes, France, Franco-Italian STMicroelectronics (STM) said the semiconductor market was still uncertain, while Germany's Infineon Technologies (IFX) tried to sound more positive - no easy task just a week after issuing a profitwarning. 

 Analysts have stuck to a wide 2001 market growth estimate range of -10% to +10%, but most concede that the latter figure now looks unlikely, mainly because of slowing demand from telephone handset manufacturers. 

 "The ultimate trough will happen sometime later this year," said SG Cowen analyst Tia-min Pang. The only indication of how deep it could be is given by previous slowdowns. 

 "Chips makers have seen five such downturns in the past 20 years," he added. Of these, the 1998 downturn had a similar profile to what is happening today, that is, it was also driven by falling demand. But "three months into 2001, we are already half way down the 1998 crisis, in a much shorter time," Pang said. 

 STMicroelectronics strategic planning vice president Alain Dutheil said Monday that the company would wait until the second quarter to see if its 2001 investment plan needed to be changed. 

 He said regular meetings with client  - STMicro has long-standing partnerships with the likes of Motorola Inc. (MOT) and Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) - each bring their share of order cancellations or postponements. 

 STMicro two weeks ago reduced its first-quarter earnings per share estimate to $0.39 from $0.45, and scaled down its overall investment for the year to $1.9 billion from $2.5 billion. 

 Infineon's corporate and investor communications vice president, Guy Wolff, for his part said his company is comfortable with its outlook - one it scaled back last week - saying the market will pick up in the second half, but that profit prospects for the company are in question. 

 "We have things on the books," Wolff said. But he acknowledged that order cancellations and scaling down can always occur. He said Infineon in theory sticks to its 30% of revenue capital expenditure target, but "we are very cautious when we actually place physical orders for equipment," he added. 

 He said the memory market, which has been hit by slowing demand from personal computer manufacturers, seems to have reached its bottom. However, Infineon is currently losing money on its D-RAM products, he said.

 Ericsson's Latest Cost Cuts Send Welcome Signal

 STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Telefon AB LM Ericsson (ERICY), under pressure to respond to slowing revenue growth, said Tuesday it would slash spending on consultants and cut more than 3,000 jobs in an effort to reduce its annual costs by at least SEK20 billion. 

 The Swedish telecommunications giant also said it would freeze recruiting across the entire company, with a goal of reaching the cost-reduction target by next year. 

 Analysts said the moves sent a welcome signal to the markets that Ericsson's leadership recognizes the scale of the challenges confronting the company, which two weeks ago warned that it expects to lose as much as SEK5 billion in the first quarter of 2001. 

 The measures were unveiled a day before Ericsson's shareholders gather here for the company's annual general meeting. 

 "The magnitude of this (the cost cuts) is so huge that it should be evident beyond any shadow of a doubt that the management realizes that it is in deep trouble and that they have to do something more than fine-tuning costs," Hagstroemer & Qviberg analyst Johan Brostroem said. "It's not one moment too early." 

 The analysts said it should help Ericsson weather the economic ills that have also hit rivals such as Motorola Corp. (MOT) and Alcatel SA (ALA). 

 But they said it remains to be seen whether the measures would be enough to right Ericsson, which has been battling for more than a year to invigorate its ailing mobile phone unit and warned two weeks ago that its network sales were likely to be below expectations because of sluggish economic conditions. 

 "This is a sign of positive ambitions," said an analyst at one Stockholm brokerage. "But we do not see this as a breakthrough that will change the company's position significantly." 

 Full Impact Of Cost Cuts Still Unclear 

 The company said the projected annual savings of SEK20 billion would come on top of the SEK15 billion in annual savings that it expects from its January agreement to outsource phone production to Singapore-based Flextronics International Ltd. (FLEX). 

 Brostroem said one unanswered question is what impact, if any, the latest cuts will have on the company's growth prospects. "I'd be very surprised if you can take away another SEK20 billion in costs without taking away from some further business," he said. 

 Still, the news helped boost Ericsson's shares, which plunged after the company's profit warning two weeks ago and are now nearly 75% lower from a year ago. Around 1110 GMT, shares were trading hands at SEK66.00, up SEK4.5 or 7.3% on the day. 

 Ericsson said a team is reviewing the company's internal operations and that it plans to detail further cost-cutting measures next month. The company said the review is focused on non-manufacturing operations. 

 Ericsson's net sales in 2000 were about SEK270 billion. 

 "In today's uncertain state of the economy with negative signals, Ericsson must react, and we are now taking unnecessary measures," Chief Executive Kurt Hellstroem said in a statement. "We have to drive efficiency much harder, with the dedication to become more competitive than ever before." 

 Ericsson said Tuesday it plans to lay off 600 additional workers at its Linkoeping, Sweden phone plant. Production there will be transferred to Flextronics later this year. Ericsson had previously announced 500 job cuts there. The latest cuts will trim the work force to 475, Ericsson said. 

 And Ericsson said mobile phone production would cease at plants in Carlton and Scunthrope in the U.K at the end of the third quarter. The plants employ 1,500, including 300 temporary workers, an Ericsson spokesman said. 

 The company said it is working with Flextronics to find a buyer for the two plants. 

 In addition, Ericsson said it would trim the work force at its plant in Kumla, Sweden, where it makes network equipment, to 1,700 employees from 3,200 to reflect slower-than-expected growth in sales. 

 The company also said it would "substantially" reduce the number of external consultants, more than 50% in some areas, and would shift the work to internal staff. Company spokesman Roland Klein said the cuts would come across the entire company and that the targets would include traditional consultancies as well as engineers and others who work on a freelance basis. 

 The companywide recruiting freeze expands on Ericsson's decision two weeks ago to freeze hiring in its networks unit, which generated about 70% of Ericsson's revenues last year. 

 Johan Carlstroem, an analyst at Handelsbanken in Stockholm, said the effort to further trim costs in the mobile phone unit could help Ericsson find a partner to help sell and market its phones. "They're taking care of the immediate problems now," he said.

 Nortel's Lower View For 1Q Will Likely Come As Surprise

 TORONTO -(Dow Jones)- Nortel Networks Corp.'s (NT) latest profitwarning won't come as a surprise to many analysts who were already forecasting earnings for 2001 well below the Canadian networking company's previous guidance. 

 However, many analysts and investors will likely be stunned at the extent of the shortfall Nortel is now expecting, particularly in the first quarter, and Nortel's inability now to provide guidance for the rest of the year. 

 "The stock's going to tank," said Paul Sagawa, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. "I'm taking my numbers down; everyone's taking their numbers down," Sagawa noted. 

 Nortel's woes will also deflate the hope among some that the slowdown in carrier spending on networking equipment would rebound later this year. 

 Among Nortel's rivals, Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) will be the hardest hit, said Tom Lauria, analyst at ING Barings, because of their big carrier base. 

 Nortel's troubles are further proof that its component suppliers, particularly in the optical networking arena such as JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) and Corning Inc. (GLW) will continue to have a tough time, analysts said. 

 After the close Tuesday, Nortel, Brampton, Ont., for the third time this year, lowered its guidance, citing the economic slowdown in and outside the U.S. Nortel now projects a loss from operations of 10 cents to 12 cents a share for the first quarter versus the previous guidance of a 4-cent loss. In addition, Nortel lowered its first quarter revenue projection to $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion, down from the previous guidance of $6.3 billion. 

 Moreover, Nortel said it cannot give a meaningful guidance for the rest of the year, because of the company's lack of visibility into the duration and breadth of the economic slowdown. 

 For the year, analysts, based on forecasts compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial, had been projecting earnings of 61 cents a share, well below Nortel's previous forecast of slightly above 80 cents. 

 However, according to First Call, analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents for the first quarter, which was in line with Nortel's previous guidance. 

 Company Web Site: http://www.nortelnetworks.com

 Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) isn't the only big name technology company to give up providing guidance for the year because of the uncertain economic outlook. 

 Recently, Motorola Inc. (MOT), Yahoo Inc. (YHOO) and Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW) have all taken similar positions. 

 Furthermore, John Chambers, Cisco Systems Inc.'s(CSCO) chief executive, recently told the Financial Times that the sales slowdown at his company is perhaps "the fastest deceleration that any company had ever experienced." 

 Analysts subsequently interpreted these comments as a sign that Cisco was setting the stage for it to lower its financial guidance. 

 Nortel's latest guidance is clear evidence that the company's fixed costs are too high for its growth outlook and its gross margins are under pressure, a signal that Nortel and other equipment vendors are in a price war. 

 "If you look at it, the revenue guidance (for the first quarter) is not much lower than last time round; it's the earnings guidance that has just really fallen quite significantly," said Harshad Thanki, analyst at HSBC Securities. "That suggests quite severe cost pressure and margin pressure," the analyst said. 

 Recognizing the need to cut costs further, Nortel also announced, after the close of markets Tuesday, plans to cut 5,000 jobs in addition to the 10,000 it has already eliminated since the end of December, for a total of 15,000 job cuts by mid-year. 

 Tom Lauria, analyst at ING Barings, said the additional job cuts at Nortel suggests that Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) will also be forced to cut more than the 10,000 jobs it has already announced. Lucent is forecasting for the current fiscal year a 30% decline in revenue from network equipment sales to carriers, but it is only reducing its workforce by a significantly smaller percentage, the analyst noted. 

 Paul Sagawa, the Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, is projecting no growth for Nortel this year, citing the ongoing price war that the analyst believes is poised to get worse as an increasing amount of used network equipment becomes available for sale. 

 "I think there is a lot of price competition, exacerbated by a used equipment market that is starting to look pretty attractive to the carriers. And it is going to get worse, because there are several carriers teetering on the brink of bankruptcy out there," Sagawa said. 

 Though Nortel Networks Corp.'s (NT) latest guidance, particularly for its first quarter loss, was significantly wider than expected by a number of analysts, some believe that many investors won't be surprised by the new guidance. 

 "My perception is Wall Street will be encouraged that they came out and cleaned the slate," said Jim Jungjohann, telecommunications equipment analyst at CIBC World Markets. "This was absolutely not unexpected. 

 Still, Nortel's stock was down about 5% in late trading, indicating that the extent of the warning might not have been fully priced into the stock by investors. 

 The sell-off may also stem from the lack of information Nortel provided in its release. 

 A Nortel spokesman declined to comment beyond the contents of the announcement. 

 Nortel develops both legacy phone equipment and high-speed optical gear. 

 But "it's very hard to discern which areas are getting impacted," Jungjohann said. "My belief is a lot of the legacy business is rising to the top and getting exposed," he said. 

 Officials at JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) and Corning Inc. (GLW), two of Nortel's big suppliers of fiber-optic network components, would not comment on what Nortel's announcement would mean to either company.

 TALES OF THE TAPE: DuPont Photo Still Strong, Relatively

 AUSTIN, Texas -(Dow Jones)- Investors in DuPont Photomasks Inc. (DPMI) can be forgiven for doubting the conventional wisdom that chipmakers "design their way" out of downturns. 

 The Round Rock, Texas, company, which makes products essential to semiconductor design, had been one of 2001's few high-flyers, with its shares topping $88 in February, up 68% on the year. 

 But on March 19, DuPont Photomasks issued an earnings warning for its fiscal third quarter, capping several days of rumors on Internet chat-rooms that such a warning was on the way. 

 Since then, the company's stock has slid. It was trading recently around $50, down 43% from its February high. It's joined many of its customers, such as Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) and Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU), for whom shares have lost ground so far this year. DuPont shares traded Tuesday at $48. 

 Nevertheless, DuPont Photomasks Chief Executive Peter Kirlin said the conventional wisdom still holds true most of the time. A double whammy not seen in recent years - a semiconductor slump and an overall economic downturn - is to blame for DuPont Photomasks' recent sales-and-profitwarning, he said.  Absent the overall economic slowdown, Kirlin said, chip design activity likely would have continued to be strong, fueling demand for his company's products, despite the semiconductor slump. 

 Analysts generally agree and still expect the firm to outperform the broader market this year, even though most were caught off guard by its earnings warning. 


     Co Strong Compared With Other Sector Players



While semiconductor slumps traditionally drive up chip design activity
- and thus demand for photomasks, which are precision quartz or glass
circuitry templates - economic downturns dampen demand overall.



"If your customers are profoundly suffering, eventually you will as
well,  but, relatively speaking, we're doing much better," Kirlin told
Dow Jones Newswires. "Look at anyone else in the semiconductor food
chain, and you'll be hard-pressed to find this kind of a bright spot."



A slump in the market for photomasks usually lags a semiconductor
slump by  up to eight quarters as a result of ongoing design activity,
he said, but the  lag has been cut short this time because of overall
business conditions.



"I've not seen a cycle where the business climate has deteriorated as
quickly since 1985," Kirlin said.



The "bright spot" he touts is his projection for sequential quarterly
revenue growth, albeit at a slower pace than previously forecast. He
said demand for "leading edge" photomasks - those that are the most
technologically advanced and bring the highest margins - remains very
strong, even though sales of "trailing edge" photomasks have tapered
along with the slowdown in the overall economy.



DuPont Photomasks makes both, but about 75% of its sales still come
from the trailing edge masks.



The company expects fiscal third-quarter sequential sales growth
between 1% and 5%, it said in its recent warning, with earnings of 53
cents to 66 cents a share. The firm previously projected sequential
sales growth between 5% and 11%, and Wall Street expected earnings of 79
cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.



While the revision clearly has taken the shine off DuPont Photomasks -
which surpassed earnings forecasts as recently as its fiscal second
quarter - analysts noted that the new projection calls for growth
nonetheless, at a time  when the semiconductor sector faces flat sales
or worse.



"They're profitable and they're growing - that's much better" than
many other players exposed to the sector, said Needham & Co. analyst
Cristina Osmena.



Still, Osmena said she's "surprised and disappointed" by the earnings
warning and blames it partly on poor execution by DuPont Photomasks
during the  quarter.



She has cut her 12-month price target on the stock to $53 - it opened
the year at $52.84 - from a previous target of $93. But she is
maintaining her buy  rating on the company, saying it should outperform
the broader market and already "is in the penalty box," meaning the
stock probably doesn't have much farther to fall.



  Photomask Sector Considered Buffered From Downturns



Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Jay Deahna expects the shares to
climb to $60 within 12 months, down from his previous $95 target, but
still a 13% increase from where they opened the year. Deahna cut his
rating on the stock to outperform from strong buy, but agrees that it
will likely perform better than many others.



"Longer term, we expect the company to continue to fundamentally
outperform the broader industry, and accordingly, the stock to also
follow suit and also outperform the broader market," Deahna said in a
recent research note.



But the conventional wisdom regarding photomasks did suffer somewhat
of a blow as a result of the recent warning, said Klaus Rinnen, an
analyst with the  research firm Gartner Dataquest, who follows the
photomask industry but doesn't rate stocks.



Photronics Inc. (PLAB), for instance, one of DuPont Photomasks' main
competitors, is off about 10%, trading around $27, since the earnings
warning even though it hasn't issued a warning of its own.



Nevertheless, Rinnen agrees that the traditional thinking regarding
photomasks remains valid, at least on a relative scale.



"It is a safer marketplace," Rinnen said of the photomask industry.
"But nobody is immune. It's buffered, but not quite immune, from down
cycles" that hit the semiconductor sector.



Gartner Dataquest still expects overall photomask industry sales
growth this year of 10% to 15%. That rate is down from the estimated 20%
revenue growth rate for 2000, Rinnen said, but it's much better than
what's expected to be a "flattish" performance for the semiconductor
industry as a whole.



That is the relevant comparison, said Kirlin.



"I'm very confident we'll outperform our customers," he said. "But
we're talking about relative performance. The key question for all of us
is what they will do."



Kirlin considers Gartner Dataquest's photomask industry sales
projections for 2001 to be realistic, and he thinks his firm will equal
or exceed the industry rate.

 VANCOUVER - PMC-Sierra Inc., the wunderkind of the British Columbia high-tech scene, said yesterday it would slash 13% of its workforce and as much as US$52-million from its first-quarter revenue forecast because of weak demand. 

 PMC, which designs computer chips used in telecom equipment, has been hit because of production cuts by its major customers, including Nortel Networks Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. 

 "PMC experienced a significant number of cancellations and reschedulings in the first quarter," Bob Bailey, the company's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday. Net bookings -- new orders PMC has received minus cancellations -- have dribbled to zero and the industry slowdown is leaving lots of inventory in the pipeline. 

 "Several of our customers have had their projected revenue from Q1 to Q4 drop greater than 50%, so that's giving us the net result you're seeing," Mr. Bailey said. 

 PMC, based in suburban Burnaby, is one of several chip designers to get caught in the telecommunications downdraft. 

 Also yesterday, Conexant Systems Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif., cut one-fifth of its workforce and said its second quarter sales will fall between 35% and 40% from the last quarter's results of US$410-million. 

 Earlier this month, Broadcom Corp. of Irvine, Calif., issued a profitwarning. Applied Micro Circuits Corp. cut its revenue estimates on March 1. 

 Arun Veerappan, analyst with Robert Stephens Inc. in San Francisco, said PMC got caught in the squeeze created when its major customers are both reducing orders and grappling with higher inventories of equipment that will not be sold due to the slowing economy. 

 He said that even if the telecommunications market were to stabilize today, it would take PMC's customers six months to work through the inventory they have on hand. "These are tough times and they're feeling the pain," Mr. Veerappan said after PMC's revenue cut. "Business has been weak for a while and this was fully anticipated, in my view." 

 PMC said it is chopping 230 jobs from of its workforce of 1,740. It did not reveal where the cuts would take place because it has yet to notify the employees who will be let go. 

 Mr. Bailey did say some research and development projects will be cut, some smaller design locations will be closed, and some locations will be consolidated. Employee and management bonus plans have been cancelled. 

 The layoffs will trigger a one-time first quarter charge of between US$18-million and US$22-million. 

 First-quarter revenue expectations were reduced to US$118-million to US$120-million, down from between US$160-million and US$170-million forecast in January. 

 The cut reduces PMC's profit outlook for the first quarter to between US2 cents to US3 cents per share. Analysts had expected PMC to report profit of US12 cents. 

 First-quarter results are expected to be released on April 19. PMC traded as high as US$246.25 on Nasdaq at the beginning of September. It closed yesterday at US$32.26, down US$1.6775.

 Tech Weakness Hits Europe --- As Slowdown Spreads From US, the Buzz Is Dimmer at CeBIT Fair --- Under the Flying Acrobats, Prices Are Being  Cut

 HANNOVER, Germany -- Evidence is mounting that the slowdown in the U.S. technology market is crossing the Atlantic. Technology executives say companies in Europe are putting off buying new computers, and analysts are forecasting that the European market will experience slower growth this year. Price cuts in the U.S. are also beginning to spread to Europe, as computer and mobile-phone companies attempt to kick-start demand for their products. 

 The industry's jitters are tangible here at Europe's massive CeBIT technology exhibition. About 400 companies, or about one in 20 of those due to exhibit, canceled their stands in the six months leading up to the show, compared with 300 last year, the organizers say. 

 Although attendance for the first three days was up very slightly from 2000, exhibitors noticed from the first day of the show that the normally hype-filled, exuberantly confident event is more subdued than last year. Late in the afternoon, Gautam Sharma and James Balog, executives of U.S. electronics firm Royal Consumer Business Products, sit watching visitors trickle by their empty stand. "It is a little slower than in the past," says Mr. Sharma, international director at Royal Consumer, which is owned by Italy's Olivetti SpA. 

 The two are trying to pick up business in Europe to make up for their slowing U.S. sales. It's not working. They have only one sure sale from their day's work and are certain that the European technology market is slowing, too. "The fallout in telecoms is going to affect the Nordic region," frets Mr. Sharma. 

 He isn't alone. Some of the biggest companies in the computer industry are worried. "Everyone is concerned about how the U.S. is going to impact the European economy," says Carol Hess-Nickels, head of Compaq Computer Corp.'s server business in Europe. 

 If the European market does crash, it would be a bitter pill for the global technology industry to swallow. As the U.S. has gone into reverse, technology companies from around the world have been betting that Europe will take up the slack. That is partly because the European economy is growing faster than the U.S. economy. In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product in Europe rose at a 1.9% annual rate, compared with a 1.7% pace in the U.S. There is also a widely held view that the European market has far more room to grow than the U.S., because computer and Internet usage are lower here. 

 Many technology companies are still seduced by the promise of Europe. At the four-story CeBIT stand of Fujitsu Siemens Computers -- a joint venture of Siemens AG and Fujitsu Ltd. -- no expense has been spared. Flying acrobats and high-energy dancers entertain visitors, while young women dressed in shiny silver outfits, similar to those worn by the Charlie's Angels movie and TV characters, auction portable computers. Sitting on a leather sofa in the executive suite on the top floor, Paul Stodden, chief executive of Fujitsu Siemens, says the U.S has over-invested in technology over the past few years, but Europe has been less profligate. "That builds a cushion for additional market growth," he says. 

 While the slowdown in Europe isn't expected to be as severe as in the U.S., research released last week suggests the European technology market is unlikely to escape untouched. Growth in the market for computer and telecommunications equipment and services in Western Europe will slow to 11% this year from 13% last year, according to the European Information Technology Observatory, an industry organization whose semiannual forecasts are closely watched. Next year is expected to be even slower, at 8.9% growth. Those growth levels would be outstanding for many industries, but are well below what technology businesses have enjoyed in recent years. The trade group predicts the hardest hit sectors will be telecommunications equipment and services, and computer hardware, particularly personal computers. 

 At the CeBIT stand of U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard Co., a small crowd gathers around a display showing two innocuous racks of beige boxes. They are casting an eye over a range of computer servers H-P has begun discounting heavily. Although the LP1000r Netserver was only launched in January, H-P has just cut the list price by 28%. 

 Alberto Bozzo, operations manager for H-P, says the price cuts are designed to tempt European businesses back into the market. "The corporate sector is taking a bit of a break," he says. Germany, the U.K. and Scandinavia are "where we have noticed it most." 

 Dell Computer Corp. has cut the price of its servers and portable computers sharply in Europe in recent weeks, while Compaq is also planning to reduce its prices in Europe. "With the pressure on the U.S. economy, we are looking to the European market to help the U.S. out," says Compaq's Ms. Hess-Nickels. 

 The price cuts by the computer giants are made possible by the falling cost of components. The slowdown in the U.S. has hit component makers hard. Although prices of DRAM memory chips, which are widely used in computers, communications equipment and some consumer electronics, have begun to stabilize in the past few weeks, investment bank UBS Warburg LLC says prices have fallen about 70% in the past six months. As a result, UBS Warburg forecasts the global DRAM market will be $20.6 billion (23.2 billion euros) this year, a 28% drop from 2000. 

 Although computer companies are confident that the fall in the cost of the technology will give the market a boost, not everyone is convinced it will make a difference. U.S. communications- equipment maker 3Com Corp. says Europe's chief financial officers have been clamping down on technology purchases. But Stanimira Koleva, director of 3Com's segment management team in Europe, doesn't believe cutting prices will persuade nervous businesses to step up purchases. 

 When it comes to price cutting, some companies don't have much choice. Take mobile-phone makers, which are racked by serious overcapacity that is forcing them to drastically reduce the prices they charge telecom operators for handsets, according to analysts. Per Lindberg, a London-based analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, estimates operators are paying 25% less for comparable handsets now than a year ago. 

 "There are unprecedented supply-and- demand imbalances," he says. However, Mr. Lindberg doesn't believe cash-strapped operators will pass these price reductions on to consumers. 

 Mobile-phone makers are loath to discuss the prices they charge operators. In its recent profit warning, Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson said excess capacity has placed the mobile-phone market under price pressure, but a spokeswoman declined to say whether Ericsson has cut prices. However, Ericsson was clear that the slowdown isn't confined to the U.S. "In Western Europe, in markets with high penetration, operators are delaying investments," the company said. 

 A recent rash of such warnings by U.S. and European technology companies has sent European technology shares plummeting in recent months, creating serious problems for young companies looking for financing. GastroFix AG, a fast-growing start-up based in Saabrucken, Germany, that supplies software for cash registers, is exhibiting at CeBIT for the first time, in the hope of raising its profile ahead of selling shares on Germany's technology stock market, the Neuer Markt. But since that decision was made last year, the retrenchment in technology stocks is forcing GastroFix to rethink its plans for an initial public offering. 

 "We want the money for international expansion," says Ann-Katrin Schlote, a spokeswoman for GastroFix. But she says selling shares isn't feasible in the current market. 

 The collapse of tech stocks means the prevailing mood at CeBIT is much more sober than in the past few years, when everything was booming. Val Rahmani, general manager of global wireless solutions at International Business Machines Corp., is still confident of strong growth in the European wireless market this year. But as she looks around CeBIT, she says, "I am conscious that we are one of the few companies still saying that." 

 Another sign of the slowdown: Compared with last year, far fewer visitors are brandishing bags stuffed with corporate giveaways. Hype has been unusually absent at most of the fair's media briefings, where companies have tended to focus on what they are doing now, rather than the future. 

 The vast halls in Hannover's exhibition center usually buzz with chatter about the next big thing - Bluetooth and WAP are just two of the technologies that have been hyped to the skies in previous years. But at this year's CeBIT, the industry has lacked a sexy, futuristic technology to rally around. Ms. Rahmani at IBM says technology companies are now focused on making existing technologies work, rather than promising the sky, the moon and the stars as in previous years. 

 "Have you seen anything really exciting" at CeBIT? she asks.

 NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - TranSwitch Corp . dropped in after-hours trading on Monday after the semiconductor maker became the latest player in the industry group to warn of slower-than-expected growth. Other technology shares were little changed. 

 TransSwitch, which had already lowered its first-quarter outlook earlier this month, cut its earnings forecast this time by about 38 percent. The company also said second-quarter revenue and net income growth would likely be flat, compared with the first quarter. 

 TranSwitch shares slumped to $16-5/8 on the Instinet electronic brokerage system from a Nasdaq close of $18-7/8. During Monday's regular session, TranSwitch slipped 11/16. 

 Intel Corp ., the world's top computer chip maker, rose to $28.56 on Instinet after ending the regular trading session at $28.31. Computer networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. dropped to $17.69 from a close of $17.88. 

 Tech shares were little changed after exchanges closed as investors declined to buy computer-related stocks that are expensive relative to their earnings. 

 During regular trading, the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 10.19 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,918.49, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 182.75 points, or 1.92 percent, to 9,687.53. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 12.86 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,152.69. 

 Stocks in the Nasdaq sell for an average of about 100 times their earnings. In contrast, stocks in the broader S&P 500 index sell for a ratio of just 20 times earnings. 

 Dow component Johnson & Johnson continued sliding in extended trading, as investors speculated its proposed purchase of drugmaker Alza Corp. could hurt profits. The consumer-products maker fell to $83 on Instinet, from a close of $85.38 on the New York Stock Exchange. In contrast, shares of Alza Corp. advanced to $39 on Instinet from a close of $38.75 on the Big Board. In regular trading, Johnson & Johnson lost $2.83, while Alza surged $8.70.

 U.S. blue chips rose on bets recession won't bite.

 NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Blue-chip stocks rose on Monday, as investors snapped up big consumer and industrial names in a bet that the U.S. economy won't slide into a recession. 

 Tech shares slid, though, as investors shunned computer and semiconductor shares as too pricey - even after a 62 percent slide in the Nasdaq market over the last year. 

 "Investors are betting that the economy isn't going into a recession and some areas are going to do all right," said Gil Knight, a portfolio manager with Allied Investment Advisors Inc., which oversees $13 billion. "Tech isn't strong across the board since there are people out there saying that even though the market's rallying, you can't expect tech stocks to go too far." 

 Manufacturing giant United Technologies Corp.and building-products retailer Home Depot Inc. were among Dow Jones industrial average components that shot higher as investors crossed their fingers that the market is headed for a recovery. Last week, the blue-chip index briefly slipped into bear territory, defined as a 20 percent drop from a market's peak. 

 The Dow gained 182.75 points, or 1.92 percent, to 9,687.53. The Nasdaq slipped 10.19 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,918.49. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 12.86 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,152.69. 

 Some stocks rose on anticipation the U.S. Federal Reserve's three interest-rate cuts this year may halt the economic slowdown. Lower rates spur spending by consumers and businesses and could prop up flagging corporate earnings. 

 All but five stocks in the 30-member Dow average rose as investors bet it was the blue-chip index's turn to rally after tech shares bounced higher last week. 

 "We saw relative strength in the Nasdaq last week and now the Dow is playing a little bit of catch-up," said Peter Coolidge, managing director of equity trading at Brean Murray & Co. 

 Boosting optimism for a stronger economy and stocks were comments by Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Anthony Santomero, who said technological advancements could help the economy sustain productivity growth of 2 to 3 percent for the foreseeable future. 

 The earnings picture isn't rosy yet. Companies in the S&P 500 will likely report a 7.5 drop in first-quarter profit from a year ago - the bleakest first-quarter profit outlook since 1991, according to market research firm Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 For the year, profit growth is expected to total just 1 percent - disappointing to market watchers who have gotten used to years of double-digit gains. 

 That's made investors wary of over-valued tech stocks, especially given a steady drip of corporate profit warnings as the U.S. economy slowed. Communications chip maker PMC-Sierra Inc. fell $1.68 to $32.26 after warning of job cuts and disappointing results in the face of weak demand and order cancellations. 

 Some communications-related chip companies dragged down the Nasdaq, after investment bank Goldman Sachs slashed their earnings estimates. Broadcom Corp., for one, slumped $5.60, or 18.7 percent, to $24.34 during Monday's session, after Goldman cut its 2001 profit forecast by 22 percent. Broadcom staged a substantial recovery, closing at $33.90, down 22.5 cents. 

 But investors combed the market for good buys. Defense contractor and manufacturer United Technologies, a Dow component, gained the most in the blue-chip average, surging $4.76, or 7.1 percent, to $71.76. 

 Home Depot jumped $1.68 to $41.35, after investment firm Salomon Smith Barney raised its investment rating on the stock and said the world's largest home improvement retailer may provide "solid returns over the next several years." Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's No. 1 retailer and a Dow component, climbed $2.03 to $49.60. 

 "People are coming back to some of the great bargains that are out there," said Donald Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisors, which oversees $65 billion. "People are saying right now, 'God, there are values everywhere.' People are willing to move into the market." 

 The coming week marks one of the busiest periods for corporate profit warnings and could put any rally to the test. About 70 percent of the 903 earnings forecasts for the first quarter have been negative so far, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. That's the highest percentage seen in the five years that the market research firm has tracked such data.

 HONG KONG (Dow Jones)--Hong Kong-based VTech Holdings Ltd. (H.VTH) said Monday that it is restructuring its operations. 

 The restructuring news follows its profit warning earlier Monday. 

 The company said in a statement it "will streamline its global operations, reduce operating costs by approximately US$30 million and focus on higher-margin products." 

 VTech is the world's largest manufacturer of cordless telephones and electronic learning products. 

 The company also said it aims to improve economies of scale and boost synergies within the group's units. 


VTech added that the senior management will be strengthened through
its recent appointment of Paddy Law Wai-leung as chief operating
officer.
- - 26/03/01 11-42G



VTech has been cutting jobs since the end of last year and expects to
trim its worldwide workforce by 16%, or about 4,500 people, of which
about 3,000 will be from its Mexico factories.



VTech's U.S. consumer telephone operations will be centralized in
Portland, Oregon, and the Mexican factories acquired from Lucent
Technologies Inc. (LU) will be sold. The company will also reorganize
its research and development operations.



It will centralize its electronic learning products activities in
Europe and streamline its operations in Hong Kong and Dongguan in
mainland China.



VTech said it will integrate several activities in order to boost
synergy and cut costs. Internet-related services, which don't yet
contribute to group results, will be downsized and reorganized.



"Executive directors have agreed voluntarily to reduce their pay by
20%," the company added.



"VTech nevertheless warned that temporary factors and one-off charges
are expected to result in a substantial operating loss for the full 2001
financial year, before the positive effects of the restructuring begin
to impact on performance," the company said.



Earlier Monday, VTech said it will post a substantial operating loss
for the financial year to March 31, because of exceptional items,
currently estimated at $133 million.



The company said that the losses will mainly result from its
acquisition of Lucent Technologies consumer wired telephone business.



At 1038 GMT, VTech shares in London were down 42%, trading at 27.5
pence from Friday's close of 47.5 pence.

 U.S. economic slump far from over, Chambers says: 'At least three more quarters,' says Cisco CEO

 SAN FRANCISCO - The U.S. economic downturn will continue for "at least three more quarters" and possibly longer, according to John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems and one of the leading business executives in Silicon Valley. 

 Mr. Chambers said in an interview that the outlook for the U.S. economy had deteriorated significantly since Cisco, the leading supplier of computer networking equipment, warned in January that it expected the downturn to last for two quarters or more. 

 Cisco shares fell by US$1.06 to US$18.69 on Friday amid rumours the company would issue a further profit warning for its third-quarter results in May. Although Mr. Chambers did not warn on profits, his comments are likely to fuel anxiety about the deterioration of the U.S. economy. 

 The company, which is considered to have one of the most advanced "real-time" internal systems for monitoring day-to-day worldwide customer demand, missed its quarterly earnings target last month for the first time in six years. 

 As recently as November, Cisco enjoyed a growth rate of more than 70%. By February, orders had dropped below those of the same month last year. It may have been the "fastest deceleration that any company had ever experienced," Mr. Chambers said. 

 "We thought this [downturn] would last for two quarters. Now we are saying that it will last for at least three quarters. 

 "The slowdown that we saw in January is continuing in February and March. We have seen the issues expand to Asia-Pacific and we see the early signs in Europe." 

 Mr. Chambers' comments add to the growing private-sector pressure on the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve for stronger measures to combat the sharp deterioration in the U.S. economic outlook and steep fall in corporate earnings. 

 Last week's decision by the Fed to reduce U.S. interest rates by half a percentage point -- the third cut since January -- failed to produce a convincing rally in the equity markets, although the Dow Jones industrial average closed up slightly on Friday. 

 Leading business executives, including Mr. Chambers, have expressed concern that the Bush administration's proposed $1.6-trillion tax cut will not come rapidly enough to offset declining consumer confidence. 

 The National Association of Business Economics, in a twice-a-year economic policy assessment to be released today, said for the first time in five years that it had "major reservations" about the conduct of monetary policy. 

 Thirty-four percent of its policy panel said it was "too tight," up from 9% in August. 

 Mr. Chambers, a supporter of George W. Bush, the President, urged U.S. government agencies to take more drastic remedial action. 

 One "big problem," he said, is that "business leaders are making decisions based on real-time data, while governments are making decisions based on data that often lags by one to three months, and old economy data rather than new economy data."

 GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Hurt by competitive pricing pressure and a shift to sales of products with lower profit margins, office-furniture maker Steelcase Inc. reported a 42% decline in net income for its fiscal fourth quarter and said earnings for the current fiscal year will fall short of estimates.  

 Steelcase (SCS) expects a tougher market to continue into 2002, compounded by economic uncertainty. Even if the economy doesn't deteriorate, Steelcase said revenue could fall as much as 5% in the first half of the current fiscal year.  

 For the full year, which ends next February, Steelcase expects to earn between $1 and $1.15 a share. The company was expected to earn $1.43 a share for the current fiscal year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.  

 For the fourth quarter ended Feb. 23, Steelcase said net income fell to $25.7 million, or 17 cents a share, from $44 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier.  

 Excluding nonrecurring charges in both periods, Steelcase said it would have earned $41.2 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $49.7 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. The mean estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call was for earnings of 28 cents a share in the fourth quarter.  

 Revenue rose 2.5% to $942.4 million from $919.6 million a year earlier. The company said sales have slowed since December and added that operating margins it had achieved earlier in the year were now coming under pressure because of competitive pricing and a sales shift to newer, lower-margin products.  

 In February, Steelcase announced that it would cut 10% of its hourly work force in North America, streamline its manufacturing operations and close a milling and woodworking unit. The company also plans to eliminate 200 to 300 salaried positions because of a slowdown in economic growth. A Steelcase spokesman said office-furniture maker has about 11,000 hourly and salaried workers in North America.

 Best Buy (BBY-NYSE) 

 by Southwest Securities 

 (40.97, March 19) 

 We are initiating coverage of Best Buy, a leading specialty retailer of consumer technology and entertainment software, with a Neutral rating. Based on near-term economic uncertainty, we are looking for only modest gains in same-store sales this year as consumers defer purchase of big-ticket discretionary items like consumer electronics. Our EPS estimates of $1.90 for 2001 and $2.35 for 2002 are below the consensus. We believe management may guide estimates lower when they report fiscal-year results in early April. 

 Charles River Laboratories (CRL-NYSE) 

 by PMG Capital 

 (20.40, March 21) 

 Buy. We continue to recommend purchase of Charles River Labs. With a global presence, a strong service organization and an expanding array of services, it appears well-positioned to benefit from the accelerating opportunities for drug discovery sciences. The company's shares sell at less than two times anticipated 2001 revenues and at P/E ratios of 29 and 23, respectively, based on our estimates for 2001 and `02, well below its peer groups'. We believe the stock could be trading at the $30 level with 12-15 months. 

 Coach (COH-NYSE) 

 by Bear Stearns 

 (27.27, March 19) 

 We are initiating coverage with an Attractive rating. The company's products are known for craftsmanship and durability, and we believe Coach is well-positioned as an upscale brand name that offers quality and prestige through its own outlets, department stores, catalogs and e-commerce. Our 12-18-month price target is almost $35 per share. 

 Darden Restaurants (DRI-NYSE) 

 by Lehman Brothers 

 (23.30, March 19) 

 We reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating and our $32 price target. Darden operates mainly Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants. Strong promotions and store remodelings should drive healthy results despite the slowing economy. Lifestyle shifts and Darden's value-priced concepts provide a healthy positioning in an economic downturn. 

 DiamondCluster International (DTPI-NNM) 

 by WR Hambrecht 

 (11.63, March 20) 

 Last week, Ericsson, a significant client, issued a profit warning. We believe that DiamondCluster is likely to be adversely affected by Ericsson's plight, probably beginning in the June quarter. While we are reducing our 12-month price target to $20 from $25 per share, we strongly feel there is ample optimisn for long-term investors seeking a compelling risk/reward opportunity and are maintaining our Buy rating. 

 Gadzooks (GADZ-NNM) 

 by Tucker Anthony Sutro 

 (19.13, March 13) 

 Gadzooks is a leading mall-based specialty apparel retailer focusing on 14- to 18-year-olds. It reported solid fourth-quarter earnings of 69 cents, three cents ahead of our estimate. Sales for the quarter rose by 25%. The company is entering the important spring season in good financial shape, and we believe it is well positioned for a solid year ahead. We are maintaining our Strong Buy rating and our $34 price target. 

 Granite State Bancshares (GSBI-NNM) 

 by Sandler O'Neill 

 (19.38, March 16) 

 Granite State Bancshares is the $955 million holding company for Granite Bank, a state-chartered commercial bank with 19 branches in the southern part of New Hampshire. It is the largest independent bank in the state, with a solid franchise in an attractive marketplace. Management is seasoned, effective and -- with a 9.7% owership interest in the company -- motivated. We initiate coverage with an Outperform rating and a 12-month price target of $22. 

 Harley-Davidson (HDI-NYSE) 

 by Raymond James 

 (39.66, March 14) 

 We are raising our rating on Harley-Davidson shares to Strong Buy from Buy. We feel we now have an inviting buying opportunity and look for the shares to outperform the market over the next 12 months. We see an increase in production for 2002 of about 10.5% over our 2001 estimates. All evidence we can find points to continuing strong demand for Harley motorcycles. We conclude that the stock market has focused too much attention on volatile monthly registration data, while we believe actual sales are stronger than those time-lagged figures. We maintain our 2001 earnings estimate of $1.35 per diluted share and our 12-month price target of $55 per share. 

 International Business Machines (IBM-NYSE) 

 by Bear Stearns 

 (90, March 19) 

 We reduced our estimates for IBM for 2001 from $5 to $4.50 to reflect our concerns about increasing signs of global weakness in PCs, servers, services and just about everything IBM is involved in, as well as international markets, which represent 58% of its revenues. We retain our Buy rating to reflect the company's valuation and its potential for relative outperformance during the first three quarters of 200, but lowered our price target from a range of $150-$160 to $115-$125, which reflects a 30% premium to its market multiple. 

 KeyCorp (KEY-NYSE) 

 by Sandler O'Neill 

 (25.53, March 19) 

 Market Performer. We reiterate our rating at the same time we are lowering our EPS estimates for the first quarter and full-year 2001 from 56 cents to 53 cents and from $2.45 to $2.30, respectively. Our lowered estimates are based upon a more cautious outlook on near-term credit quality and weaker non-interest income fron the continued softness in capital-markets revenues. 

 Kroger (KR-NYSE) 

 by Hilliard Lyons 

 (22.59, March 16) 


 We are changing our rating from Hold to Buy. The strong fundamentals
haven't changed, the stock price just got better. Kroger reported
strong fourth-quarter and yearend results. Fourth-quarter operating
EPS were 48 cents, versus 37 cents (restated); for the full year,
operating EPS were $1.34, compared with $1.11 (restated) in fiscal
1999. Kroger is more than a pure "defense" recommendation. We think it
is a solid growth story and should be considered a core holding in a
well-diversified, conservative portfolio. Our 12-month target is $30 a
share.



Main Street Bancorp (MBNK-NNM)



by Sandler O'Neill



(9.22, March 20)



Main Street, based in Reading, Pennsylvania, operates a network of 42
branch locations in the southeastern part of its home state. Its shares
have been beaten down after more than two years of internal turmoil at
the company. But a new management team has outlined a realistic strategy
for restoring the value of the franchise and putting the company on
target for sustained profitability. We feel that Main Street is trading
at too deep a discount to its peer group, making its stock particularly
attractive at current levels. Accordingly, we are initiating coverage
with a Buy recommendation and a 12-month price target of $12.



Maximus (MMS-NYSE)



by Lehman Brothers



(34.35, March 16)



We are initiating coverage of Maximus with a 1-Strong Buy rating and
a $45 price target. The company is the only pure play in the new field
of social-welfare privatization. It has a stellar history of growth, and
we expect the company to outgrow the market with low-mid 20% for the
next several years. Maximus has a large and growing backlog and because
many contracts call for increased revenues as welfare rolls increase, we
see its business as recession-resistant.



Public Storage (PSA-NYSE)



by Merrill Lynch



(25.67, March 20)



We are raising our 2001 funds-from-operations estimate from $2.78 to
$2.80 to account for accelerated stock-buyback activity in the first
quarter and are instituting a 2002 FFO estimate of $3.08. We are
maintaining our Accumulate rating, with a 12-month price objective of
$27.75.



Qualstar (QBAK-NNM)



by Needham



(6.50, March 21)



Qualstar pre-announced lower-than-expected fiscal-third-quarter
results in the range of $11.4-$12.4 million in revenues and earnings per
share of about 11-12 cents, feeling the effects of lower or deferred IT
spending. We are lowering our 12-month price target to 15 times our
FY2002 EPSS estimate of 80 cents, or $12 per share, down from 18, but we
maintain our Buy rating.



Sanmina (SANM-NNM)



by ING Barings



(28.50, March 20)



We are lowering our rating on Sanmina to Buy from Strong Buy because
of the gloomy near-term industry outlook, in which customer demand
across a broad range of end-markets appears to be deteriorating more
rapidly than anticipated. Until these conditions stabilize, we believe
the urgency to buy Sanmina shares will be diminished, but we recommend
building a position in the stock to those willing to look beyond the
next two quarters. We have lowered our price target from $50 to $45.



Scholastic (SCHL-NNM)



by ING Barings



(41.63, March 14)



A solid performer in what has become a challenging environment for
many companies, Scholastic should continue to deliver double-digit
growth given its attractive collection of assets and its unique position
as a beneficiary of an increased emphasis on children's literacy and
education nationwide.



Scientific-Atlanta (SFA-NYSE)



by Josephthal



(48.31, March 14)



We consider Scientific-Atlanta's shares to be attractively valued. We
project over 80% earnings-per-share growth in fiscal 2001 and 28% in
2002. The stock's current P/E multiple is less than the company's EPS
rate. We reiterate our Strong Buy rating and our $75 12-month price
objective.



TTR Technologies (TTRE-NNM)



by Brean Murray



(5.47, March 16)



Recent news coverage of Napster have focused investor attention on
the issue of music piracy. TTR develops anti-piracy technologies that
provide copy protection for electronic content on optical media and over
the Internet. While the company is not profitable at this time, cash of
$8.2 million is sufficient to fund operations through this calendar
year. To our knowledge, there is currenty no technology available that
provides copy protection for audio CDs. TTR is in the final stages of
developing a solution. We are assuming profitability for TTR in 2003. We
rate the stock Accumulate and are maintaining our $12 price target.

 Corporate Profits Getting Squeezed on All Sides Finance: Pressure is coming from slowing consumer and business sales, increased price competition, rising energy costs and growing wage demands.

 NEW YORK -- Economists are still debating whether the United States is headed for, or indeed is already in, a recession. 

 But the debate on the corporate profit picture is pretty much over: Earnings continue getting mugged so badly that Wall Street analysts are nearly ready to abandon hope of any growth for many firms in 2001. 

 An "earnings recession"--at least two quarters of lower profits compared with a year earlier--is already a foregone conclusion for the first half of this year. 

 Now, even the second half of the year seems shaky. The consensus of analysts is that there will be close to zero profit growth in the third quarter for the blue-chip companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 and about 6% growth in the fourth quarter. 

 Charles L. Hill, research director at earnings-tracker First Call/Thomson Financial, noted that the fourth-quarter growth estimate has been trimmed from 15% in just the last two weeks. Before long, the analysts will slash their estimates for both quarters well into negative territory, Hill predicted. 

 Fears over corporate America's fading bottom line have been a driving force in the stock market plunge, now the deepest since at least 1987 for most market indexes. 

 Yet many experts insist the U.S. economy has merely slowed and isn't actually contracting. Why, then, are corporate earnings faring so badly? 

 The most obvious answer is weaker sales. Manufacturing, business and retail sales are poised for their worst combined quarter since 1991, at the end of the last recession, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. 

 More cautious consumer spending is only part of the story. Many companies, worried about the economic outlook, are opting to reduce or suspend capital-spending programs. A new machine tool, phone system or software package may promise savings down the road, but canceling the order means savings now. 

 Software giant Oracle last week said it would lay off 900 employees, citing customers' abrupt postponements of planned purchases. Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Intel and Motorola--to cite just a few tech giants--'fessed up earlier to declining orders and have announced even deeper staff cuts. 

 Well beyond technology, sales overall are grinding down to the point where Lonski projects barely a 1% gain for the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2000. 

 Worse, profits are tumbling even faster than sales, for a number of reasons. 

 One factor is increased competition from abroad. The dollar last week soared to a 22-month high against the Japanese yen and a three-month high against the euro. This is happening despite record U.S. trade deficits and the Federal Reserve's most aggressive interest-rate-cutting campaign since the early 1990s. 

 "Import prices are still falling," said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. The competition from Japanese exporters has been unremitting since the Asian crisis of 1998, Yardeni said, but it only intensifies as the strong dollar makes those imports cheaper for Americans. 

 To hang onto market share, U.S. companies are cutting prices and offering more generous financing terms, he said. 

 And not all the price competition is foreign: No less a free-market guru than Warren Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, complained recently that State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance was competing unfairly against his Geico unit by charging too little for its auto policies. 

 Buffett, in a letter to Berkshire shareholders, said State Farm has been selling policies at a loss to grab customers. "The willingness of the largest player in the industry to tolerate such a cost makes the economics difficult for other participants," he griped. 

 The rest of the dismal profit story is on the cost side. Oil, natural gas and electricity had their biggest price surges in a decade last year, saddling firms with costs that, for the most part, they lacked the muscle to pass along to their customers. 

 Procter & Gamble, America's largest household-products company, Thursday announced 9,600 new layoffs on top of more than 7,000 cuts announced earlier. The Cincinnati-based maker of Pampers diapers and Ivory soap has been hurt by rising costs and economic problems in overseas markets, such as Turkey. 

 Although it is the market leader in many product categories, P&G found out last year how tough it is to be a price leader when it tried to push through some price hikes to reflect rising raw materials costs. Rivals refused to match its moves and started taking away customers, so P&G was forced to rescind the increases. 

 For many companies, wage and benefit costs also continue to rise, despite soaring layoffs. Average hourly earnings for 97 million U.S. workers rose at a 4% annual rate in January and February, even as the economy slowed, government data show. 

 Those are increases that companies could comfortably absorb in recent years because worker productivity was rising even faster than pay. But now, with productivity growth threatened by the economy's slowdown, higher wage costs have to come out of the bottom line. 

 Seattle money manager William A. Fleckenstein, long one of the most bearish voices on the stock market, puts his finger on one source of higher wage costs. 

 "Companies for years have been paying their employees in bloated stock options," Fleckenstein said. Now, as stock prices keep falling, more workers will spurn options in favor of cash, leading inevitably to rising wages, he said. 

 An economic slowdown also exposes the risks inherent in companies' use of leverage. Many big businesses borrowed heavily in the 1990s, often using bond debt to finance stock repurchases. Corporate bond issuance has hit record levels in recent years. 

 Even as sales slow, interest costs still have to be paid--though that burden will be lessened as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates. 

 Another drag on the profits of such tech companies as Yahoo and Cisco Systems are the drooping fortunes of venture-capital investments that they made in smaller tech firms, especially ones they hoped would grow into major buyers of their products and services. 

 The failure of many such firms has left the investing companies with worthless stock. Worse, it also has eliminated the start-up companies as potential customers for the bigger firms and in some cases has resulted in a flood of used equipment into an already saturated market. 

 Arguably, some of the current wave of profit disappointment stems from companies' efforts in recent years to keep investors happy at all costs, some experts say. 

 Wall Street constantly admonishes investors to be in the market for the long haul, yet it ranks companies by their quarter-to-quarter performance. Miss the earnings consensus by a penny a share and watch your stock get pummeled. 

 The pressure to meet Wall Street expectations pushes chief financial officers to squeeze for every last nickel of profit--and sometimes more. 

 "When the earnings environment gets tough, like it did last fall, they'll try any trick in the book," said David M. Blitzer, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's. But the bag of tricks--legitimate ones, anyway--has a limit, and at this point in the downturn, many companies have used up all their lifelines, he said. 

 Without a cushion of further accounting creativity or inflated dot-com shares, then, some companies are feeling every bump in the economic road. That's why each new jolt results in a new profit warning, and why layoff notices have come in a series at some firms, analysts say.

 The Fading Bottom Line 

 Companies across a broad swath of industries have warned that earnings this year will be down from 2000, or up only modestly. A sampling of companies, their 2000 earnings per share and analysts' average estimate for 2001 results: 


                    2000       2001   Est. change,
Company              EPS   est. EPS   2000 to 2001

 Enodis cuts 900 jobs as US slowdown hits profits.

 ENODIS, THE catering equipment maker formerly known as Berisford, yesterday became the latest victim of the US economic downturn. 

 The group said it was cutting 900 jobs as it announced the departure of its chief executive, David Williams. It warned that first-half operating profit for its core food service equipment division would fall to "not less than #32m", compared to #51.6m in the same period the previous year. 

 The announcement followed an earlier profit warning in January this year. Shares in the company yesterday closed down 54p at 101p, wiping 35 per cent off Enodis's market value. 

 Andrew Allner, finance director, said: "The worst hit area has been our chains business, which supplies fast food companies, such as McDonald's." He said customers in this sector had "significantly cut back" on new store openings and the replacement of non-essential catering items, leading to an estimated 10 per cent slump in demand for food service equipment across North America so far this year. 

 Demand in Europe is also slowing. But Mr Allner said the 900 job cuts would mostly fall in the US with only "a handful" occurring in the UK. The company has already closed its Conyers, Georgia, plant with the loss of 400 jobs and has a list of six other sites earmarked for possible closure. 

 Mr Allner has been named interim chief executive. Mr Williams is entitled to one year's severance pay of #300,000. 

 One analyst said: "They did a restructuring last year which didn't really work out. Combine that with [the company's] high debt levels and the market moving in the wrong direction and these guys have got serious problems." 

 Separately yesterday, there were a raft of profit warnings from companies operating across the consumer, property and software sectors. 

 Stanley Leisure, the betting and gaming firm, warned that its full-year earnings would fall by an estimated #4.5m because of the success of several of its high-rolling customers. Meanwhile, shares in Mentmore Abbey lost 32 per cent to 118p after the firm said next year's earnings would fall short of market expectations due to higher investment costs. 

 PIC International, the world's top provider of genetically enhanced pigs for breeding, said foot-and-mouth disease will probably cost it #750,000 in the third quarter. The network systems firm XKO halved in value after it warned of a "material" slowdown in sales.

 Companies: UPS Says First-Half Results Will Miss Targets --- U.S. Parcel Deliver Cites Weak Domestic Economy

 ATLANTA -- United Parcel Service Inc., acknowledging a much sharper economic downturn than it anticipated only two months ago, said its profit in the first and second quarters would fall short of previous estimates. 

 The profit warning, the parcel-delivery giant's second in three months, is a sign that no corner of the U.S. economy appears unscathed by the current slump. UPS said growth of its domestic deliveries slowed to about 1% in January and February, down from a 2.8% increase in the fourth quarter. 

 As a result, UPS said it now expects profit to reach a range of 49 cents to 51 cents (55 European cents to 57 European cents) a diluted share in the first quarter. For the second quarter, the company expects profit in the range of 55 cents to 60 cents a share, unless the economy picks up. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected profit of about 57 cents in the first quarter and 64 cents in the second quarter. Last year, UPS had first-quarter profit of $813 million, or 67 cents a share, including one-time items that added 11 cents a share to the bottom line, and second-quarter profit of $695 million, or 60 cents a share. 

 "We thought the domestic core growth would at least stay strong enough that we could exceed ever so slightly the prior year's numbers," a UPS spokesman said. "The full-year outlook is very cloudy now." 

 The bad news flustered investors and irritated some analysts who had hoped UPS would get only a few bruises from what the company was calling "economic speed bump" as recently as late January. UPS shares fell $1.81, or 4.5%, to close at $55.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. FedEx Corp., which reported a 3.5% decline in fiscal third-quarter profit on Wednesday and also lowered its profit target for the current quarter, was down $1.57, or 3.7%, to $41.03. Airborne Inc. tumbled 36 cents, or 3.6%, to $9.56, also on the Big Board. 

 Some analysts criticized UPS for being slow to recognize the full impact of the deteriorating economy. "The company gave wildly optimistic guidance," said Peter Coleman, an analyst at Banc of America Securities LLC. A UPS spokesman said the company's previous comments were "based on everything we knew back in January."

 UK feels the chill wind from America.

 THE Confederation of British Industry could be forgiven for saying "I told you so". 

 While a plethora of domestic economic data has suggested the US slowdown had yet to pierce Britain's economic bubble, the CBI has consistently said the UK would catch America's cold sooner rather than later. 

 Yesterday, three UK firms warned the continuing US slowdown will have a severe impact on their profits. 

 Engineering and electronics group Laird, which employs more than 3,000 people at its plant in Ayrshire, saw its share price plummet after it warned that the drop off in the US electronics industry would have a "significant impact" on its first half profits. 

 At the same time industrial controls group Invensys blamed the US crisis for its second profit warning in six months and announced its intention to increase the number of employees it had earmarked for job cuts from 3,000 to 5,000. 

 And plasterboard manufacturer BPB, which employs some 400 people in its Aberdeen plant, added to the gloom with its own profit warning, blaming lower selling prices and higher energy costs in North America as well as a recession in the German construction industry. 

 Should we be worried? A number of economists believe the manufacturing profit warnings are the first tangible signs of a crisis that will eventually envelope sectors of the domestic economy. And the CBI yesterday revealed that manufacturing order books slumped to their lowest level since July 1999 last month. 

 The collapse in US demand has left many UK manufacturers with more stocks than sales orders. The end result is what Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan calls an "inventory imbalance", but the result is manufacturers will be forced to slash prices to sell goods, always assuming they can find a market. 

 HSBC UK economist John Butler agrees the profits warnings are the first sign that the chill economic winds from the US have finally reached this side of the Atlantic. 

 "UK manufacturing is going to be in for a rough ride simply because 45 per cent of its sales are dependent on exports," says Butler. 

 "The companies that issued warnings this morning are being realistic about future prospects." 

 The general consensus among manufacturers is that the bounce-back in the US economy predicted by Greenspan is not about to happen in a hurry. Instead, many now believe that the US is going headlong into a recession. 

 All this comes hard on the heels of Wednesday's news of a downturn in eurozone industrial production and a slide in German business confidence. 

 Whatever European Central Bank head Wim Duisenberg says, few economists believe the eurozone will not become ensnared in the fall out from the US crisis. 

 Yesterday the euro hit a new three-month low dropping below US$0.89 for the first time since December last year. 

 Despite the fall, Duisenberg was busy reiterating his creed that the eurozone exists in an economic vacuum to the rest of the world, although he did concede that the US slowdown may "have implications for world economic growth and thus for the eurozone". 

 For the record, the US purchases around 13 per cent of eurozone exports, and is still the biggest foreign investor in the region. 

 It is also Germany's biggest export market. 

 ECB chief economist respected German banker Otmar Issing was this week a good deal more forthright than Duisenberg, admitting that the outlook for the eurozone was not as encouraging as it had been at the end of last year. Gernot Nerb, head of the Germany's most important economic indicator, the Ifo business index, went further and said that if the Bundesbank were in charge of euro-zone monetary policy, it would have moved quickly to cut rates following the survey results. 

 The ECB remains the only major central bank not to have yet cut rates this year. Its overly cautious "wait and see" approach is still primarily concerned with the fact that at 2.6 per cent, inflation is too high. 

 The ECB's target is two per cent. 

 For all that though there is an increasing feeling among many economists that both the ECB and UK may find they are powerless to do anything to combat the effect of the continuing US slowdown. 

 As the old adage says: When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.

 UPDATE 1-Putnam Lovell cuts Schwab estimates.

 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Putnam Lovell on Friday said it lowered its profit estimates for Charles Schwab Corp. in anticipation of lower revenues amid a stock market slump. 

 Schwab on Thursday said it would cut up to 13 percent of its work force and warned it would miss first-quarter Wall Street forecasts by 27 percent because of a poor environment for stocks. 

 Schwab's marketing spending "could be up to $100 million in the (first) quarter as Schwab could not sell committed marketing slots," analyst Richard Repetto said in a research note. Failure to rein in first-quarter expenses was likely a culprit behind Schwab's profit warning, he said. 

 Putnam Lovell lowered its 2001 estimate to 45 cents a share from 51 cents a share. It expects the San Francisco-based company to earn 60 cents a share in 2002, down from 65 cents a share. 

 Because of uncertain market conditions, Repetto said he was maintaining his hold rating on Schwab shares. 

 Despite profit estimate cuts from Salomon Smith Barney and a price target downgrade by J.P. Morgan, Schwab shares were trading higher in the New York Stock Exchange's afternoon session. Brokerage shares moved higher as the major market indexes rallied. 

 Schwab shares were up 78 cents, or 5 percent, at $15.98, well below their 52-week high of $44.75. Brokerage shares have taken a beating as people are trading less and opening fewer accounts amid a prolonged stock market slump.

 ATLANTA -- United Parcel Service Inc., acknowledging a much sharper economic downturn than it anticipated only two months ago, said profit in the first and second quarters would fall short of previous estimates. 

 The profit warning, the parcel-delivery giant's second in three months, is a sign that no corner of the nation's economy appears unscathed by the current slump. UPS carries roughly 5% of U.S. economic output at any moment, but growth of its domestic deliveries slowed to about 1% in January and February, down from a 2.8% average daily increase in the fourth quarter. 

 As a result, UPS said it now expects profit to reach a range of 49 cents to 51 cents a diluted share in the first quarter. For the second quarter, the company expects profit of 55 cents to 60 cents a share, unless the economy picks up. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected per-share profit of about 57 cents in the first quarter and 64 cents in the second quarter. 

 Last year, UPS had first-quarter profit of $813 million, or 67 cents a share, including one-time items that added 11 cents a share to the bottom line, and second-quarter profit of $695 million, or 60 cents a share. 

 "We thought the domestic core growth would at least stay strong enough that we could exceed ever so slightly the prior year's numbers," a UPS spokesman said. "The full-year outlook is very cloudy now." 

 The bad news flustered investors who had hoped UPS would get only a few bruises from what the company was calling an "economic speed bump" as recently as late January. UPS Class B shares fell $1.81 to $55.89 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4 p.m. Shares of other delivery concerns also were hit. 

 FedEx Corp., which reported a 3.5% decline in fiscal third-quarter profit on Wednesday and also lowered its profit target for the current quarter, was down $1.57 to $41.03. Airborne Inc. fell 36 cents to $9.56, also on the Big Board. 

 UPS said its business overseas remains relatively strong, with international export-parcel volume up more than 15% so far in the first quarter, compared with fourth-quarter average daily growth of 19%. But analysts predicted that trend will fizzle. "There is no way the world's economy escapes the U.S. economy," said Scott Flower of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. "I think Europe is two quarters behind us."

 The San Jose Mercury News will cease publication of its Sunday magazine after its April 8 issue, as part of an effort to trim costs without enacting staff layoffs. 

 According to an article in Friday's edition of the Mercury News, a staff memo from senior editors indicated that shuttering the magazine was one of a number of "trade-offs" the paper needed to make to avoid laying off members of the news staff. 

 The Mercury News is owned by San Jose-based Knight Ridder Inc. (KRI), the nation's second-largest newspaper publisher. Like many of its brethren, Knight Ridder is facing a decline in advertising-revenue growth in tandem with rising newsprint costs. Like other large newspaper publishers, Knight Ridder has issued a first-quarter profit warning. New York Times Co. (NYT), Tribune Co. (TRB), McClatchy Co. (MNI), E.W. Scripps Co. (SSP) and Dow Jones & Co. (DJ), publisher of this newswire and The Wall Street Journal, have all indicated over the last few weeks that they will miss analyst expectations for the first quarter. 

 On Monday, Jay Harris, the publisher of The Mercury News, indicated he would resign in protest of Knight Ridder's cost-cutting measures, which he said would damage his paper's ability to provide news coverage to readers. 

 Nine Mercury News employees are affected by the magazines's shut-down, according to the newspaper article. Those employees will be assigned to jobs elsewhere at the newspaper. 

 In the newspaper world, Sunday magazines have become a rare beast. Only a handful of major papers - including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Chicago Tribune - publish Sunday magazines for readers. The Mercury News magazine, known as "SV," first appeared on Sept. 7, 1969. It has run under a number of names, including "California Today," "Cal Today" and "West."

 Enodis Could Be Takeover Target After  Profit Warning -CFO

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K.-based Enodis (ENO) could now be vulnerable to a takeover, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Allner told Dow Jones Newswires Friday, after the food-services equipment maker said first-half operating profit would be dramatically lower than last year. 

 He said there is now "huge uncertainty" for the group's future, and Enodis needs "to batten down the hatches and make more cost cuts." 

 Analysts agreed, but conceded that the entire food-services equipment sector had come under more pressure. 

 Old Mutual Securities analyst David Larkam said he "wouldn't be surprised if one of the larger U.S. players comes in and decides to make a move for Enodis." 

 Investors, meanwhile, trampled the group's share price. At 1503 GMT, Enodis shares were down 54 pence, or 35%, at 101 pence. That's down from a late-1999 high of 355 pence. 

 Enodis said earlier Friday that first-half operating profit for its core food-equipment-making division would be about GBP32 million, or 38% lower than GBP51.6 million last year. The group - which supplies McDonald's and other food retailers with kitchen equipment - cited difficult market conditions, especially in U.S. and Australia, for the expected fall in profit. 

 Old Mutual's Larkam said the U.S. economic slowdown would continue to have an enormous effect on Enodis because 77% of its sales comes from the North American market. Allner said that North American restaurant chains have cut back significantly on their new store openings and refurbishment. 

 "This is their darkest hour," said Larkam. 

 He added that the next 12 months would be a difficult period for the group. However, once the economy begins to improve, companies such as McDonald's will increase spending on new and existing restaurants. 

 The situation is made more dire by resignation of the company's Chief Executive David Williams, also announced earlier Friday. 

 Allner said a search has begun for a new CEO but wouldn't be drawn on when a replacement would be announced. 

 For the moment, the group said it will embark on a cost-cutting program, which will include the reduction of discretionary spending, simplifying the corporate structure and an overhaul of the ailing food equipment division. 


The company has already closed a plant in Georgia and cut 400 jobs in
the U.S., with plans to reduce the headcount in its food equipment
division by 900 once all
cost reduction measures are implemented.   The company said it will cut
costs by GBP30 million a year, with GBP15 million saved this year.
However, Allner said in the interview that there could "radical stuff
to come," including further job cuts and additional plant closures,
which would lead to further cost-savings.

 UPDATE 1-Gannett sees Q1 earnings within analysts' range.

 NEW YORK, March 22 (Reuters) - Gannett Co. , owner of USA Today and 98 other newspapers, expects first-quarter results to be within the range of Wall Street's expectations, barring any significant drop in advertising in March, Chief Executive Douglas McCorkindale told analysts on Thursday. 

 McCorkindale expected first-quarter operating earnings in a range of 66 cents to 68 cents a share, he said in a speech to the Media & Entertainment Analysts of New York that was Webcast. Gannett reported a profit of 74 cents a share in the year-earlier period. 

 The Wall Street consensus estimate was 67 cents a share, as compiled by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Gannett shares were trading at $56.66, down 19 cents, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average was off 2.5 percent. Shares rebounded from as much as a 3.2 percent decline earlier in the session, but still well below the 52-week high of $73.94 reached a year ago. 

 Although McCorkindale acknowledged that the advertising environment in the first quarter has been "tough," the company is one of the few newspaper publishers not to issue a profit warning for the period. 

 The Tribune Co. , Knight Ridder Inc. , Dow Jones & Co. , New York Times Co. , E.W. Scripps and McClatchy Co. have all that warned softer advertising would hurt their first-quarter earnings. 

 McCorkindale said that classified advertising revenue for domestic community newspapers fell sharply in February and said he expected "another month of unfavorable results in March." 

 Gannett's USA Today will see lower ad revenues for the first five months of the year, Publisher Tom Curley said at the presentation, although the shortfall should be less severe in the second quarter than in the first. 

 "USA Today's core advertising business (excluding dot-com advertising) is running down less than 3 percent and is expected to turn positive in June," he said. 

 Newspaper publishers have all come under pressure as the general economic slowdown translates into less corporate spending on advertising. In the current quarter, publishers are also feeling the absence of advertising by dot-com companies, whose lavish spending boosted advertising revenues a year ago. 

 Gannett's broadcasting chief Cecil Walker said that first-quarter net revenue will be 9 percent to 10 percent below last year, led by declines in automotive and telecommunications spending and the absence of political advertising.

 UPDATE 6-Zurich Financial shares dive on gloomy results.

 (Wraps previous stories, updates with closing share price) 

 ZURICH, March 22 (Reuters) - Zurich Financial Services warned of another poor year on Thursday after dismal 2000 earnings and set multi-billion-dollar disposals to get Europe's sixth largest insurer back on track. 

 Chairman and Chief Executive Rolf Hueppi blamed poor financial markets, unexpected additions to reinsurance reserves, large bad weather claims and the cost of simplifying the group structure for a 5.5 percent dip in profits to $2.096 billion. 

 Shares slid to over 3-1/2 year lows, ending down 20.2 percent at 549 Swiss francs to make it the weakest performer amongst European insurers and depressing the FT E300 and DJ Stoxx insurance indices by some seven percent. 

 Hueppi saw no risk of the group becoming a takeover target after the share plunge. "We are well-positioned, we are a strong company which wants to grow very quickly and through acquisitions rather than the other way around," he said. 

 He said Zurich would continue to target premium income growth in 2001 and foresaw $4 billion in proceeds from various divestments and the demerger of non-core reinsurer Zurich Re to help get the group back on the profit growth path by 2002. 

 But earnings in 2001 would be squeezed by further costs of restructuring and investments in strategic alliances along the lines of recent pacts with Bank of America and Bank of Scotland and in "Web-enabling" the group, Hueppi said. 

 He said investment income this year would be hurt by the need to reinvest bonds at lower coupon rates, by dollar strength against the Swiss franc, the economic slowdown in the United States - a key market for Zurich - and weak financial markets. 

 NO PROFIT RECOVERY BEFORE 2002 

 Hueppi said there would be no return to the longer-term profit growth target of 10 to 15 percent until 2002, predicting that in an upbeat scenario, normalised net profit - Zurich's main profit measure - would reach $2.0 billion this year. 

 That would at best be little changed from 2000's $2.096 billion, down 5.5 percent on 1999 and slightly worse than the level indicated by Hueppi in a profit warning in February when he spoke of a decline in 2000 profits of less than five percent. 

 Financial analysts said Hueppi had once again wrongfooted the market with an overly optimistic prediction. 

 The latest blow followed confusion over the group's reserving policy after the February warning and earlier disappointment over a poor first half and turmoil then over the concept of "normalised net profit". 

 Normalised profit includes sustainable capital gains from investments and is Zurich's adopted profit measure, launched to smooth the impact of financial market volatility on earnings. 

 Analysts and fund managers say investor confidence in Zurich had been tarnished and Hueppi's credibility dented. 

 "It's just one more time where one was poorly informed. One is getting used to it," said a Swiss fund manager who asked not to be named. His group manages portfolios with Zurich stock. 

 He said that one way to restore confidence would be for Hueppi to go. "That would certainly do the share some good." 

 "The sentiment versus Zurich is more than bad and it will take a long time to build up new goodwill with investors and analysts," analyst Rene Locher at Bank Sarasin said, predicting a sell-off by Anglo-Saxon investors. 

 ANOTHER NEGATIVE REPORT FROM ZURICH 

 Analysts said the negative impact of the earnings report was reinforced by a re-assessment of the February profit warning. 

 Hueppi said then that costs totalling some $500 million in the form of weather-related damage claims, extra reinsurance reserves and outlays to streamline the organisation were one-off, signalling a profit recovery this year. 

 "We are in a growth period where reported earnings lag top-line growth," he said on Thursday, adding that the group's 10 to 15 percent profit growth target was a "long-term average, not something which we achieve year after year." 

 He said he would re-focus the group through the spin-off of Zurich Re, the world's eighth largest reinsurer, by year-end and the sale of non-strategic and underperforming assets. 

 Half of the $4 billion these transactions would raise would be used to reduce group debt to $3.8 billion from $5.8 billion. The group also planned to refinance debt at lower market rates. 

 Hueppi said the planned divestments had been agreed last April, but the implementation had been on hold as Zurich unwound its Anglo-Swiss dual holding company structure and unified its share structure, reacting to investor demands. 

 He set a drive to cut costs by up to 10 percent. The reduction of staff at Zurich headquarters by more than half should save $200 million by the end of 2002. Centralised buying of reinsurance cover should save a further $100 million.

 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - Europe's insurers lost their "safe haven" status on Thursday after dire results from Zurich Financial showed they could not shelter from the turbulence hitting world equity markets. 

 Swiss-based Zurich, the world's sixth largest insurance group, stunned investors with annual results that were worse than expected, despite a profit warning in February. The company then cautioned that prospects were no brighter for 2001. 

 Zurich's shares tumbled more than 17 percent, knocking the stuffing out of the DJ Stoxx insurance index , which dropped more than five percent to its lowest level since October 1999, making it the worst performing sector in Europe. 

 Some big European names took a pounding, including France's Axa and Germany's Allianz , down seven and four percent respectively. 

 But Zurich was the most severely punished, plunging 118 Swiss francs to 570, its lowest for more than three years. 

 "Zurich's underlying result was much worse than expected," said Trevor Moss, insurance analyst at SG Securities in London. "Our profit expectations are going to have to be dramatically reduced." 

 Zurich reported a 5.5 percent fall in net income to $2.1 billion, which compared with forecasts of about $2.2 billion, according to analysts. 

 The insurer, which owns U.S. insurance group Farmers as well as Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in Britain, had warned in February that one-off charges of some $500 million meant 2000 earnings would be less than five percent below the 1999 level of $2.218 billion. 

 DISAPPOINTING RESULTS 

 But analysts said the actual results were worse than that and were also flattered by a series of one-off gains. Once these were stripped out, the underlying position was pretty disappointing. 

 They said the results were particularly discouraging, given Zurich's exposure to the general insurance market, where premium rates are enjoying a cyclical upturn. 

 The company highlighted lower than expected investment income as another factor behind its cautious outlook in 2001, the result of the stock market downturn. 

 The shares had been trading on around two times embedded value (an industry measure for insurance company profitability taking account of long term business), but after today's fall were on around 1.4 times. 

 Zurich's woes sent a shiver through the sector, which until recently had been a solid performer in the midst of the tech wreck. 

 "Without a doubt it's affecting the other Europeans," said an insurance analyst at a U.S. brokerage. 

 The insurers were shaken last week when Prudential , Britain's number two insurance group, announced an all-share takeover of U.S. insurance company American General . 

 Prudential's shares fell 14 percent in response, as investors feared the company was diving into the U.S. market in a big way just as the economy was slowing down. 

 Analysts said Zurich had now added to the malaise in the sector. 

 "You've got a couple of weak valuations," said another analyst. "If you look at the other stocks, they are being dragged down towards the lowest common demoninators." 

 Prudential's shares, which had stabilised this week after the drubbing they received following the U.S. deal, were down nearly two percent at 736 pence. The fall in the Prudential's share price has wiped six billion dollars off the value of its bid, which is now worth $20.5 billion dollars. 

 Axa, which reported weaker than expected results last week, also suffered from a price target downgrade by UBS Warburg, to 125 euros from 150 euros. 

 The French insurer's shares were about seven percent lower at 113.9 euros.

 UPDATE 2-Invensys plunges after new  profit warning .

 LONDON, March 22 (Reuters) - British industrial automation and control devices group Invensys issued its second profit warning in six months on Thursday and said it would cut an extra 2,000 jobs as it battles a weakening in its key U.S. markets. 

 The news drove shares down 13 percent as investors fled the company, which makes industrial process automation systems as well as controls for a variety of applications including heating systems, domestic appliances and vehicles. 

 The profit warning was the latest in a series by European companies whose business relies on a healthy U.S. economy, including telecoms group Cable & Wireless Plc . 

 Invensys said operating profits before exceptional items in the second half of the year would be slightly lower than in the first due to weaker U.S. industrial and consumer confidence. 

 As a result, the company said it would step up a cost-cutting plan and shed 5,000 jobs by the end of the financial year - 2,000 more than originally planned. 

 Invensys stock dropped more than 10 percent at the opening of the London market and continued falling as some feared there could be even more bad news on the way. The shares were trading 14-3/4 pence down at 114-1/2 pence by 1045 GMT. 

 "This is a problem company and anyone who says it's not is in denial," said Ian Brown at Morley Fund Management, one of the biggest managers of UK equity funds. "There's no need to go anywhere near this company." 

 Invensys' share price halved in value last September when the company issued a profit warning that highlighted weak margins in its core business. 

 In November the company posted a five percent fall in first-half operating profits to 470 million pounds ($668 million) and an 84 percent drop in pre-tax profits to 46 million pounds. 

 The shares had slightly recovered, however, on the firm's upbeat comments and speculation it could be a takeover target. 

 But on Thursday, Invensys said the U.S. market had steadily deteriorated. "Both industrial and consumer confidence has steadily weakened in the United States since November. There is continued softness in residential construction, as well as in demand for appliance and climate controls." 

 A YEAR OF WOES 

 The profit warning issued in September by Invensys - which was formed in 1999 by the merger of conglomerate BTR and automation firm Siebe - gave investors the first indication that business was suffering due to a depressed U.S. housing sector, high energy costs and a strong dollar and pound. 

 In November, Chief Executive Allen Yurko said he expected that by cutting some 3,000 jobs and increasing prices across the board, profits would improve in the second half. 

 The company also said it would spin off its power divisions unit, which employs some 18,000 people in 30 countries and makes up about one quarter of the group's overall sales. 

 Plans to float a quarter of the group were welcomed, but investors worried that the move wouldn't be enough to compensate for troubles in the rest of the group - including a drag on profits created by the 643 million pound takeover last year of loss-making Dutch business software firm Baan. 

 But analysts said on Thursday they expected a delay in the float of the power systems business, which is now growing at a slower pace than expected. 

 "It depends on market conditions, but I think there is a 50/50 percent chance of the IPO," said one analyst who asked not to be named. "They may have to issue another profit warning." 

 CONTROLS MOST HURT 

 The unit most affected by the accelerated downturn in U.S. markets is Invensys' key control systems division because of its exposure to consumer-driven markets such as for washing machines and ovens as well as automobiles. 

 But Invensys did give some more positive news about its automation systems division which it said would improve in the second half, despite slowing U.S. demand. 

 Profitability at the software systems unit was also starting to recover from a difficult first half, it said, with Baan now trading profitably as costs had been reduced. 

 Some analysts also said they expected some recovery down the line. "It still looks exceedingly cheap," Lehman Brothers said in a research note, in which it cut its 2002 forecasts by 11 percent. 

 "Once we get past this confidence crisis, we expect some recovery."

 VisualSoft's shares plunge 16% on  profit warning .

 BANGALORE, India, March 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Indian software services and product firm VisualSoft Technologies Ltd slid 16 percent on Thursday after it warned of slower earnings growth in the current quarter. 

 It shares sank to a 21-month low of 308.15 rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange - the maximum permissible percentage change in a day. 

 VisualSoft's product sales are likely to fall 25 to 30 percent in January-March from the previous quarter because of declining IT spending by U.S. firms, a senior company official who did not wish to be named told Reuters. 

 VisualSoft derives about 65 percent of its revenue from North America while Europe contributes about 30 percent. 

 Indian computer education and software firm NIIT Ltd and software services Mastek Group previously issued profit warnings prompted by the U.S. economic slowdown. 

 "Its particularly the discretionary spending which has been hit most by lower IT budgets of U.S. companies," the VisualSoft official told Reuters by telephone from the company's headquarters in the southern city of Hyderabad. 

 VisualSoft's sale of tools and components which are used by software developers had been hit by a cut in IT spending, he said. 

 VisualSoft is among the few companies in India's booming software industry which derives its revenue equally from the sale of products and services. Most companies focus on services. 

 VisualSoft's technology products are targeted at the application service provider market and businesses that provide IT infrastructure including front office applications. 

 In a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday, VisualSoft said its profit and income for the fourth quarter will be impacted by a slowdown in demand for its products in the United States. 

 But it said it still expects revenue and profit to increase by more than 90 percent in the full year to March 31. 

 In the first nine months to December, Visualsoft's net profit increased to 461.07 million rupees from 193.28 million, or by 139 percent. 

 "Our revenues from IT services including R&D outsourcing is still showing strong growth," the company official said. 

 Sale of IT services are likely to account for the majority of the company's revenues in the current quarter due to a fall in product sales, he added.

 UPDATE 3-Zurich earnings disappoint, shares plunge.

 ZURICH, March 22 (Reuters) - Zurich Financial Services, Europe's sixth-largest insurance group, said on Thursday that profits fell by a disappointing 5.5 percent last year and there would be no growth in the current year. 

 Shares slid after the news, hitting fresh 2-1/2 year lows. 

 Chairman and Chief Executive Rolf Hueppi said normalised net profit - Zurich's main profit measure - slipped to $2.096 billion, adding that there would be no return to the longer-term profit growth target of 10 to 15 percent until 2002. 

 The 5.5 percent decline was worse than Zurich had projected in a surprise profit warning in February. It then said one-off factors totalling some $500 million meant earnings would be "less than five percent" below the 1999 level of $2.218 billion. 

 Normalised profit includes sustainable capital gains from investments and is Zurich's main profit measure, introduced to smoothe the impact of financial market volatility on earnings. As a rule, normalised profit is lower than unadjusted profit. 

 Unadjusted net profit fell by 28.7 percent to $2.33 billion, undercutting the average analysts estimate of $3.66 billion. 

 Shares in Zurich traded at times down by 10 percent, getting as low as 615 francs in early trade. The latest drop extended declines seen since February's profit warning which had shaken investor confidence in Zurich, and raised doubts about its ambitious growth strategy and Hueppi's leadership style. 

 NO PROFIT RECOVERY IN 2001 

 Hueppi said he expected normalised net profit in 2001 of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, adding that Zurich was taking measures to boost profitability including asset sales and the spin-off of insurance business Zurich Re. 

 "The 2000 results are indeed disappointing, but still represent a solid level, with a return on equity of 11 percent showing the earnings power of our group," Hueppi said. 

 "Our cautious outlook for 2001 includes factors such as lower expected investment income, a weak dollar; the cost of remedial action falls in 2001, but the benefits in the year after; investment in technology continues," he said. 

 "We are in a growth period where reported earnings lag top-line growth," he said, adding that the 10 to 15 percent profit growth target was a "long-term average, not something which we achieve year after year." 

 The "firm corrective action" involved a focusing of the group through the spin-off of Zurich Re and the sale of non-strategic and lower performing assets. "The value of all these transactions is up to $4 billion," Hueppi said. 

 Hueppi said the planned divestment programme did not include Zurich's holding in medium-sized Swiss insurer Baloise . Zurich controls almost 30 percent of Baloise. 

 A cost-cutting drive would result in expense savings of up to 10 percentage points, he added, citing the recently announced reorganisation of the Zurich headquarters involving reducing staffing by more than half as an example. 

 Zurich would be focusing its financial management and centralising purchasing, for instance of reinsurance cover. He said the group planned to reduce debt by $2 billion in 2001. 

 The dip in 2000 profit and the weak outlook for 2001 would not affect Zurich's plans to list its shares in the United States. "It is business as usual - we continue to intend to list," Hueppi said. 

 Earnings in 2000 were poor across the board, reflecting unexpected extra reserving for reinsurance business, claims for unusually severe weather in Europe and one-off costs for the streamlining of the organisation. 

 Net investment income and realised capital gains fell 9.9 percent to $8.49 billion. "That is a market condition, something we cannot influence," Hueppi said.

 Tribune Co sees Q1 shortfall on weak advertising.

 NEW YORK, March 21 (Reuters) - Tribune Co. , publisher of the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times newspapers, on Wednesday became the latest newspaper publisher to warn its first quarter earnings would fall short of expectations citing softer advertising spending. 

 Following similar warnings by media companies New York Times Co. , Dow Jones & Co. and Knight Ridder Inc. , the Tribune said it expected its first quarter earnings to be 18 cents to 20 cents a share, excluding items, compared with 32 cents a share in the year-earlier period. 

 The Wall Street consensus estimate was 25 cents a share, as compiled by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 February publishing revenues fell 5 percent from a year ago, broadcasting and entertainment revenues fell 8 percent, while television revenues fell 9 percent, factoring in the acquisition of Times Mirror, which occurred in June 2000. 

 "The company expects the current soft advertising trends to continue in the second quarter, but advertising revenues are expected to be stronger in the second half of the year, especially as comparisons ease," the company said in a statement." 

 The company, which owns several television stations and the Chicago Cubs baseball team reiterated its expectation to reach double-digit growth in earnings and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the full year. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call predict Tribune will earn $1.53 a share for full year 2001, up from $1.30 in 2000 - a 17.7 percent increase. 

 McClatchy Co. , which owns the Sacramento Bee and Fresno Bee in California and the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, also warned on Wednesday its earnings would be hurt by weaker advertising. Knight Ridder issued a similar warning earlier this week. 

 Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal; E.W. Scripps , which publishes the Cincinnati Post and the Denver Rocky Mountain News; and New York Times Co. all issued profit warnings this month citing the slump in the advertising market. 

 Gannett Co. , publisher of USA Today and 98 other daily newspapers, said last week it expected the first quarter would be difficult, but has thus far not issued any profit warning for the quarter. 

 Media companies, ranging from newspaper publishers to television and cable networks, have all felt pressure as the general economic slowdown translates into less corporate spending on advertising. 

 In the current quarter many media companies are also feeling the absence of advertising by dot-com companies, whose lavish spending boosted advertising revenues a year ago. 

 Tribune said it would defer several projects that will result in capital spending and investments being cut by $150 million. 

 For the February period, Tribune's retail advertising revenue fell 1 percent, national advertising fell 4 percent and classified advertising fell 12 percent.

 Powergen lit up the City today with a rise of 49 pence to 737 pence as it emerged that German utilities giant E.ON is poised to take a holding in the company rather than make a full bid. 

 Reports in the German Press claim a final decision by the board of E.ON will be made next week, but it is expected that it will offer a 30 percent premium above Powergen's current share price. Powergen emphasised that it was still in talks with the Germans about a possible offer, but warned: "There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in an offer being made." Talks began in January, but brokers say it is likely the Germans will decide against making a full bid which would run into anti-trust problems in the US. 

 Powergen now accrues a lot of its revenues from America and is looking to expand further there. E.ON may prefer to lend its support to Powergen, rather than control it. The rest of the market plunged through the 5500 support level as share prices tumbled to their lowest level since 29 October 1998. Another 235-point fall for the Dow Jones overnight in New York set the pace for the London market and left the FTSE 100 index down 147.5 at 5393.2. That stretches its fall on the week, so far, to 175 points, or 3 percent. 

 Among the hardest hit today was Energis down 231/2 pence at 256 pence, Celltech, off 83 pence at 1029 pence, and Nycomed 341/2 pence lower at 433 pence. 

 The market had to contend with another clutch of profit warnings. Foremost among these was blue-chip Invensys, down 163/4 pence at 1121/4 pence. This is the industrial controls group's second warning in six months. BPB Industries, down 341/2 pence at 2191/2 pence, also saw profits for the current year tumbling from UKpound 224 million to UKpound 160 million. The building products group puts the blame firmly on the downturn in trading in the US, where the economy has slowed considerably. Avon Rubber, down 35 pence at 136 pence, said profits in the first five months of the year from its US division have come in substantially below the previous year. 

 Former high-flyer Capital Radio also hit the markets with a warning, leaving it nursing a fall of 21212 pence at 665 pence. That compares with the peak last year at 1937 pence. 

 Publisher Emap fell 29 pence to 721 pence after denying it had been approached by US venture capitalist Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, which wanted to bid up to UKpound 600 million for its portfolio of magazine titles. Pearson was another publisher coming under the hammer with the price falling 106 pence to 1225 pence. Broker UBS Warburg has lowered its target price for the shares from 1650 pence to 1500 pence after downgrading its earnings estimates by 2 percent. 

 The broker has also cut its price target for Dimension Data, down 133/4 pence at 2891/4 pence, from 415 pence to 375 pence but is bullish about prospects for Scottish & Newcastle, 31/2 pence easier at 527 pence, and has raised its target price 50 pence to 550 pence. 

 Martha Lane Fox's hapless Lastminute.com clawed back some of yesterday's losses with a rise of 11/2 pence at 41 pence. The directors moved into the market yesterday, buying more shares in the hope of restoring confidence about the online retailer's future. 

 Chief executive Brent Hoberman bought 127,273 at 39.3 pence, or UKpound 50,000, lifting his total holding to 15.8 million, or 9.3 percent . Lane Fox spent UKpound 10,000 on 25,454, taking her holding to 10.2 million, or 5.9 percent and chairman Allan Leighton bought 127,273, bumping his total holding up to 197,273.

 Avnet Plans to Buy Kent for $600 Million in Stock

 Avnet Inc., one of the nation's biggest distributors of electronic components, has agreed to acquire Kent Electronics Corp. for about $600 million in stock, people close to the companies say. 

 Both boards have approved the transaction, and an announcement is expected today, these people say. 

 The deal comes at a time when electronic-component distributors are facing tough times as declining demand, canceled orders and an overall downturn in the technology market is squeezing the already-thin profit margins of these companies. Indeed, both Avnet, based in Phoenix, and Kent, Houston, are expected to tell investors today that their quarterly earnings will be below earlier forecasts. The weakness comes on the heels of a similar earnings warning this week by Avnet's biggest rival, Arrow Electronics Inc. 

 People familiar with the matter say the timing of the deal isn't related to current market conditions, and the two companies have for years had casual discussions, which picked up steam a few months ago. 

 Under terms of the deal, Avnet is offering 0.87 of its share for each share of Kent. Amid analyst worries of eroding profit in the electronic-component sector, shares of Avnet slipped 90 cents to $23.55 as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That values Kent at $20.49 a share, a 29% premium to Kent's 4 p.m. price of $15.90, up 90 cents, also on the Big Board. 

 Avnet, which had revenue of $9.2 billion in its last fiscal year, is hoping this deal will help in its corporatewide effort to sell products on a more specialized basis -- so that semiconductor products, for instance, are sold by one group while connectors are sold by another sales group. Kent has a big presence in the business of selling "passive" components, such as connectors and capacitors. Avnet's similar business line will be folded into Kent's operations and be run by Larry Olson, Kent's chief executive officer. Furthermore, Kent, which has $1 billion in annual revenue, also sells network equipment from Cisco Systems Inc. and other suppliers and sells consulting services to integrate that equipment. 

 One major attraction of the deal is that Kent has about $275 million in cash. This would help Avnet bolster its balance sheet, which has come under pressure from a debt-financed European acquisition. Furthermore, the two companies see significant cost savings. People close to the discussions say the transaction would be "neutral to mildly dilutive" in the first full quarter of operations, but the companies expect $60 million in annual cost savings, helping make the deal add to Avnet's earnings soon thereafter. 

 Meanwhile, both companies are expected to announce that earnings in the current quarter will be below analysts' current estimates. Avnet is expected to forecast profit of 60 cents to 65 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter ending March 31. Kent now expects per-share earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter, also ending March 31, will be 30 cents to 33 cents. 

 Merrill Lynch & Co. is advising Avnet, while Kent's financial adviser is Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston unit.

 Zurich Financial Shares Slump on Profit Drop; Firm Plans to Sell Assets

 ZURICH -- Zurich Financial Services AG shares plunged more than 16% after the group reported its full-year profit fell 5% and announced plans to sell some underperforming assets, including its reinsurance division, Zurich Re. 

 In afternoon trading, Zurich Financial shares were down 113 francs to 575 francs ($336.16). The stock has lost 42% of its value so far this year. 

 The Swiss financial group said its normalized net profit, its main profit figure, fell to $2.10 billion from $2.22 billion in 1999. The decline wasn't surprising after the group's profit warning in February, due to a reinsurance and weather-related extraordinary charge of $400 million. 

 Net profit according to international accounting standards tumbled 29% to $2.33 billion from $3.26 billion a year earlier. 

 The company also warned its profit would continue to slide in 2001. The group said net income, adjusted for cyclical trends, will fall further to between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion this year, "despite continued strong top line growth." 

 The group's operating profit for 2000 fell 39% to $3.17 billion from $5.18 billion in the previous year, while premium income rose 4% to $50.04 billion from $48.0 billion. Assets under management were flat at $440 billion, compared with 1999's $442 billion. 

 The group set an unchanged dividend of 17.15 francs. Zurich's reinsurance business increased premiums by 8% to $4.9 billion. The unit's net profit adjusted for cyclical trends stood at $210 million. 

 Chief Executive Rolf Hueppi declined to identify the assets the company has earmarked under the plan to divest noncore and underperforming nonstrategic businesses. But he said the group won't sell its stake in Swiss insurer Baloise Holding AG. 

 "We consider Baloise an investment," and hence it isn't part of the plan to divest noncore and underperforming businesses, Mr. Hueppi said. Zurich controls almost a third of Baloise through shares and options. 

 The sales will relate to businesses that "we believe are non-strategic to our future," as well as to underperforming activities, where Zurich doesn't have sufficient scale or doesn't expect to achieve its earnings target in the near term, Mr. Hueppi said. 

 He said the plan to sell the group's reinsurance activities was "a work in progress" and therefore he couldn't give details on when the sale would take place. Most of the group's reinsurance activities operate under the roof of Zurich Re. Proceeds from the planned spin-off of Zurich Re are included in the $4 billion Zurich expects to gain from its divestments. 

 Despite the decline in earnings and value of the group's share price this year, Mr. Hueppi said there won't be any changes in management. "It is my firm conviction that we have a very strong management," he said. 

 He added that 2001 will be another challenging year, and that he continues to target a long-term net profit growth rate between 10% and 15%. The group plans to reduce its debt by up to $2 billion. The reorganization of its headquarters will cut costs by $140 million this year and $200 million next year. It also expects to save a further $100 million within three years through a move to global procurement. 

 The group proposes to elect Armin Meyer, chairman of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Holding Inc., to the board of directors. Henry Bodmer and Clayton Yeutter don't stand for re-election after reaching an age limit. 

 Zurich also announced a strategic partnership with U.S. group Ulico Insurance, which offers insurance to labor unions with over 16 million members. 

 Mr. Hueppi said the group is still in the process of preparing a U.S. listing of its shares. 

 The group announced in November plans to begin restructuring and shifting its focus to New Economy businesses as profit waned and market conditions turned volatile. In September, the group reported an unexpected 24% drop in first-half net income after a substantial fall in realized capital gains from financial investments.

 Electronic-Parts Distributor Avnet to Buy Kent in $550 Million Stock Deal

 Avnet Inc., one of the nation's biggest distributors of electronic components, has agreed to acquire Kent Electronics Corp. in a stock transaction valued at about $550 million. 

 The companies, whose announcement Thursday confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal, said the deal includes about $50 million of cash on Kent's books in excess of assumed debt, the companies said. 

 The agreement comes at a time when electronic-component distributors are facing tough times as declining demand, canceled orders and an overall downturn in the technology market is squeezing the already-thin profit margins of these companies. 

 Indeed, both Avnet (AVT), based in Phoenix, and Kent (KNT), Houston, issued profit warnings Thursday for their upcoming quarters. The warnings follow a similar earnings warning this week by Avnet's biggest rival, Arrow Electronics Inc. 

 Avnet expects revenue for its third fiscal quarter, ending March 30, of about $3.2 billion, up 19% from the year-earlier period, but down about 6% from fiscal second-quarter levels. Avnet blamed a sharp decline in demand for electronic components in North America and Asia, and weaker computer-product sales for the drop in revenue since the second quarter. 

 Earnings for the quarter are now likely to be in the range of 60 cents to 65 cents, Avnet said. Wall Street expects Avnet to earn 73 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 Kent expects to report earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31 of 30 cents to 33 cents a diluted share, below the 35 cents analysts were expecting. Revenue will be $230 million to $240 million, up 4% to 8% from year-earlier levels, but basically flat from the fiscal third quarter, Kent said. 

 The timing of the acquisition isn't related to current market conditions, and the two companies have for years had casual discussions, which picked up steam a few months ago, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Under terms of the agreement, Avnet is offering 0.87 of its share for each share of Kent. Amid analyst worries of eroding profit in the electronic-component sector, shares of Avnet slipped 90 cents to $23.55 as of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That values Kent at $20.49 a share, a 29% premium to Kent's 4 p.m. Wednesday price of $15.90, up 90 cents, also on the Big Board. 

 Avnet, which had revenue of $9.2 billion in its last fiscal year, is hoping this deal will help in its corporatewide effort to sell products on a more specialized basis -- so that semiconductor products, for instance, are sold by one group while connectors are sold by another sales group. Kent has a big presence in the business of selling "passive" components, such as connectors and capacitors. Avnet's similar business line will be folded into Kent's operations and be run by Larry Olson, Kent's chief executive officer. 

 "By combining Kent's electronic components operation, which has annualized sales of over $500 million, with Avnet's Electronics Marketing group's domestic IP&E business, we will create the largest specialty components distributor of its kind in North America," Roy Vallee, Avnet's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a written statement. 

 This new $1.6 billion division will be headquartered in Phoenix, Mr. Vallee said. 

 Kent Datacomm, Kent's network integration equipment and services operation, will remain in Houston and become a new division within Avnet's Computer Marketing Group. After the Kent acquisition, Avnet Computer Marketing is expected to have annualized revenue of more than $3 billion. Mark Zerbe will continue as division president. 

 One major attraction of the deal is that Kent has about $275 million in cash. This would help Avnet bolster its balance sheet, which has come under pressure from a debt-financed European acquisition. 

 Furthermore, the two companies see significant cost savings. 

 Avnet expects the transaction to be "slightly dilutive" to earnings per share for the first one or two full quarters of combined operations, but said the combination will add to earnings after that. 

 The merger has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies, and is subject to approval by shareholders. The companies expect to close the deal within 90 days. 

 Merrill Lynch & Co. is advising Avnet, while Kent's financial adviser is Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston unit.

 Zurich FS Shrs Plunge 20% On Earnings, Strategy Worries

 ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- Zurich Financial Services (Z.ZFS) shares plunged Thursday morning, after its 2000 earnings, 2001 outlook and its strategic plan disappointed investors on nearly every front. 

 Zurich Financial reported normalized net profit of $2.1 billion for the year ending Dec. 31, down 5.5% from a year earlier. This was at the lower end of already diminished forecasts, following a profit-warning in February. Net profit according to International Accounting Standards fell 29% to $2.33 billion. 

 Zurich Financial expects earnings to fall further, predicting a normalized net profit between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion this year. 

 "Their outlook for the current year was particularly disappointing, I had expected a rebound in profit and now they predict a further decline," said Bertrand Maerkli, an analyst at Credit Suisse Private Banking. 

 Lower investment income, the strong dollar, the impact of a weaker U.S. economy and costs for "remedial" actions to swing back to earnings growth will all weigh on this year's earnings, Chairman and Chief Executive Rolf Hueppi said. 

 Zurich Financial shares dropped by over 20% early, an unusually extreme intraday decline for a Swiss blue chip, as investors showed their displeasure at subpar earnings and a strategy to divest non-core businesses, including reinsurance. 

 At 1023 GMT, Zurich was down CHF122, or 18%, at CHF566, amid heavy volume. The shares have lost 42% of their value - or nearly EUR23 billion - this year. Their current level is starting to raise the possibility that Zurich Financial could become a takeover target. 

 Zurich's market capital capitalization stands at around CHF47 billion at the current valuation, or roughly EUR31 billion. Germany's Allianz Holding AG (G.ALL), rumored to be eyeing Zurich Financial, has a market capitalization around EUR80.24 billion, according to Wednesday figures from Deutsche Boerse AG. France's Axa SA has a market cap of about EUR48.77 billion. 

 "Already there are rumors that Allianz is looking at them," said Credit Suisse's Maerkli. 

 But the chief dealer at a Swiss private bank cautioned that Allianz' name is always coming up when an insurance company is viewed as a takeover target. 

 More than the disappointing earnings report, investors were spooked by what was perceived as a rushed-out and possibly ill-advised strategy from Zurich Financial to spin off its reinsurance business and shed other non-performing units. They were also disappointed about Zurich's warning that profit will drop further this year. 

 "They don't seem to know what they are doing anymore," the chief dealer said. He said he'd like to see Hueppi, widely seen as singlehandedly steering the group's activities, step down. He has been criticized by some in the past for his dual role of board Chairman and CEO. 

 At a news conference, Hueppi termed the spin-off of the group's reinsurance activities "a work in progress," and said he couldn't give any more details yet. Most of the group's reinsurance activities are carried out by Zurich Re. 

 Hueppi also didn't identify the businesses the company has earmarked for divestment. 

 The sales will relate to businesses that, "we believe are non-strategic to our future," as well as to underperforming activities, where Zurich doesn't have enough scale or where it doesn't expect to achieve its earnings target within a short period of time, he said. 

 Proceeds from the planned spin-off of Zurich Re and other divestments will result in gains of up to $4 billion, he said. 

 Zurich Financial has embarked on program to "significantly" cut costs. It expects to save around $200 million annually from the staff cuts at its headquarters by 2002, and another $100 million with three years from implementing global procurement. 

 Additional savings should come from the centralization of it the placement of reinsurance. Zurich expects around $100 million a year. 

 The company also plans to use part of the expected gain of up to $4 billion from divestments to reduce debt up to $2 billion, which will reduce interest expenses.

 NORTHFIELD, Minn. -(Dow Jones)- Sheldahl Inc. (SHEL), facing slowing demand for its products from the automotive and electronics sectors, plans to cut its work force by 20%. 

 In addition to the 190-employee reduction, the company implemented a plan to reduce inventory and lower expenses across the board. "We are taking every action now to return the company to profitability," Sheldahl said in a statement Thursday. 

 Sheldahl, which currently employs more than 900 workers, said the layoffs will occur mostly at the Northfield, Minn., facilities and will affect both union and salaried staff. 

 In mid-December the company warned of weak sales for the first quarter ended Dec. 1, which were 18% below the prior-year levels. The early obsolescence of a communications program was  blamed for the disappointing results and is expected to hurt earnings at least until the fiscal third quarter. 

 The profit warning pushed the company's stock to the 52-week low price of $1.00 on Dec. 28. Sheldahl shares closed Thursday at $2.25, down 16 cents, on Nasdaq volume of 2,000 shares. Average daily volume is 51,616 shares. 

 Sheldahl, a maker of substrates, circuits and laminates,  recently merged with International Flex Technologies Inc.

 Enterprise - Oracle and Compaq suffer the slowdown.

 But users may find an upside in better deals. 

 Compaq and Oracle are the latest suppliers to suffer from the US economic slowdown, but there's a silver lining: customers can use vendors' problems as an opportunity to drive down prices. 

 Compaq last week issued a profit warning and announced a $150 million restructuring plan that will cut 5,000 jobs. Chief executive Michael Capellas said the actions were necessary to tighten supply chain management, and claimed they would 'position (Compaq) well in the mid and long term'. 

 First-quarter profits will be four per cent lower than in the same period last year, he added. 

 Compaq does not expect the UK to be hit hard by the job cuts. 'The UK and Ireland subsidiaries are not making large-scale redundancy plans,' said a Compaq spokeswoman. 'One area that may be affected is the manufacturing plant in Scotland.' 

 Oracle announced downbeat results for the third quarter, two weeks after warning profits would miss Wall Street expectations. Revenue grew by $300 million to $2.7 billion, and profit rose 16% to $583 million, compared with the same period last year. 

 Despite hopes that the company's application software business would increase by as much as 50%, its actual growth was 25%. Database sales stalled with a mere six per cent rise. 

 Chief executive Larry Ellison was unable to offer any hope of an immediate upturn in fortunes. 'The truth is, we don't know. We just don't know. Whatever the economy does, we'll do,' he said. 

 The outlook for Oracle's staff is equally uncertain. 'With the sole exception of research and development, Oracle should be reducing headcount in virtually every area,'said Ellison. 

 Phil Dawson, program director at analyst Meta Group, thinks all this is good news for UK firms as suppliers look to boost flagging US sales in other countries. 

 'Users are in a strong negotiating position. We've already seen price cuts from companies such as Hewlett-Packard,' he said. 'Companies should not defer IT projects or they will lose out,' he added. 

 SUMMARY 

 - Compaq's and Oracle's results reflect the US economic slowdown 

 - UK customers are in a strong position to negotiate price cuts

 The slowing US economy is continuing to take its toll on vendors as Compaq announced plans to slash 500 jobs, and Oracle expressed caution about its future business predictions. 

 Compaq's announcement that it would cut seven percent of its workforce came as it warned that its first-quarter earnings would barely be above those of the same quarter last year. 

 Meanwhile, Oracle met lowered expectations for its third-quarter results as earnings per share came in at a sixth lower than Wall Street's original estimates. 

 The company issued a profit warning earlier this month, which resulted in its stock falling by more than a fifth on the day of the announcement.

Procter hit by talk of further lay-offs - Procter & Gamble.

RUMOURS of a second round of large-scale lay-offs at Procter & Gamble, the consumer products group, hit the US company's share price yesterday.

P&G, which makes Tide laundry detergent, Pampers and Crest toothpaste, declined to comment on talk of a 10 per cent to 20 per cent reduction in its 110,000-strong workforce. Shares in the group slipped almost $2 to just under $64 in apprehension that another big restructuring was on the way.

Last month P&G issued a profit warning, suggesting that the economic crisis in Turkey, whose currency is in freefall, would reduce third-quarter earnings by 4 per cent. However, analysts were sceptical that the country, which accounts for 1 per cent of P&G's $40 billion global sales, could have such an impact on earnings for the year to June 2001.

P&G is halfway through a restructuring launched in 1999 under the banner "Organisation 2005". Like its UK rival, Unilever, the company has put its manufacturing structure to the knife and 15,000 jobs were to be cut over four years with the aim of reducing overheads by $1.2 billion annually by the end of the programme. A spokeswoman for P&G in Cincinatti said yesterday that 7,200 jobs had been cut.

However, P&G is clearly planning more upheaval. Steve Donovan, a senior P&G executive, is heading a task force launched a year after Organisation 2005 to seek more cuts in the cost base, which are likely to include further lay offs. "We are looking at cutting costs in any way possible," said the spokeswoman.

P&G's marketing skills have traditionally been the envy of its rivals, but the company's growth has been sluggish. "The problem is the competition is getting better," said David Lang, an analyst with Henderson Crosthwaite.

 LONDON, ENGLAND, 2001 MAR 22 (NB). Software maker Invensys PLC, best known for its Baan label, said today it will slash more than 5,000 jobs and that operating profit in the fiscal second half will be lower than in the first half of the year. 

 The company cited challenging market conditions as the cause, and specifically noted a worsening US economic environment. Invensys derives about half of its revenue in the US marketplace. 

 The firm issued a profit warning in September, stating it would cut as many as 3,000 jobs, or 2 percent to 3 percent of its total work force, mainly in Mexico and the US. The company further said that its Baan unit, acquired in August 2000 for $800 million, is slowly recovering from a disappointing first half, as a result of restructuring. 

 The firm said its automation systems unit has seen healthy sales growth and is expected to show improvement over the first half, while the power-systems operations will continue to grow moderately. 

 But, the bottom line prompted the company to state, "We now expect second-half operating profit before exceptionals to be marginally below the first half level." The statement continued, "Toward the end of our fiscal second quarter, we announced rigorous structuring and cost reduction programs, including significant cuts in headcount across all divisions. We have now expanded these programs in response to the present harsher conditions, with further emphasis on reducing factory and administration overheads. By fiscal year-end, we will have reduced headcount by over 5000, or 6 percent." 

 According to CEO Allen Yurko, "Like every company in our industry, we are watching the US economy closely. While at this point it is not possible to be sure of the duration of the current downturn, we are committed to minimizing the impact on our results through decisive and practical actions in the near-term. We remain confident of the long-term prospects for our businesses and will continue to invest in high-growth opportunities."

 Zurich FS CEO -2: Considers Baloise An Investment

 ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- Zurich Financial Services (Z.ZFS) Chief Executive Rolf Hueppi said Thursday the group's stake in Swiss insurer Baloise Holding AG (Z.BAL) isn't part of the its plan to divest businesses worth up to $4 billion. 

 "We consider Baloise an investment," and hence it isn't part of the plan to divest non-core and underperforming businesses, Hueppi said at a media conference. 

 Zurich controls almost a third of Baloise through shares and options. 

 Hueppi declined to identify the businesses the company has earmarked for divestment. 

 The sales will relate to businesses that "we believe are non-strategic to our future," as well as to underperforming activities, where Zurich doesn't have enough scale or where it doesn't expect to achieve its earnings target within a short period of time, he said. 

 He said the plan to spin-off the group's reinsurance activities was a "a work in progress" and therefore he couldn't give details on when the spin-off is planned. 

 Most of the group's reinsurance activities operate under the roof of Zurich Re. 

 Proceeds from the planned spin-off of Zurich Re are included in the $4 billion Zurich expects to gain from its divestments. 

 Earlier Thursday, Zurich reported a 5.5% decline in net profit to CHF$2.1 billion, which was at the lower range of diminished expectations, after a profit warning earlier this year. 

 Despite the decline in earnings and a drop of more than 30% in the group's share price this year, there won't be any management changes, Hueppi said. 

 "It is my firm conviction that we have a very strong management," he told the conference. 

 Separately, he said Zurich is still in the process of preparing a U.S. listing of its shares.

 Immunex Says Enbrel Phase III Study Results Positive 

 By Geeta Anand 
Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Immunex Corp. (IMNX) of Seattle suffered a blow Thursday to its hopes for doubling the market for its blockbuster drug, Enbrel, when it stopped its late-stage clinical trials in people who suffer from chronic heart failure. 

 The company, 41% owned by American Home Products Corp. (AHP) of Madison, N.J., said it stopped the trial on 2,000 patients after an independent data monitoring board of physicians and others reported that patients were not showing enough improvement. Analysts had predicted sales in excess of $1 billion for Enbrel in heart failure, if the treatment were approved in 2003, as the company had hoped. Enbrel, which was approved by regulators in 1998, already is the fastest biotech drug launch ever. Enbrel sells at a $750 million annual rate for treating rheumatoid arthritis. 

 Immunex also reported negative results with its asthma-drug candidate, Nuvance. The company said Nuvance showed no benefit in two phase-2 clinical trials of asthma patients not taking steroids. The company said it was still finishing a third phase-2 clinical trial already underway on asthma patients taking steroids, and it will announce those results in the third quarter. 

 Immunex also announced positive results for its late-stage clinical trial of Enbrel in patients with psoriatic arthritis, a smaller market compared to heart failure but still significant because there are no drugs on the market specifically for the disease. About 250,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, which can cause crippling of the bone and joints and crusty, discolored patches of skin. The company said it planned to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mid-year for expedited review in the hopes of winning marketing approval for psoriatic arthritis early next year. 

 Robin Shapiro, an Immunex spokeswoman, said the company would move immediately to push forward other promising drugs in development, including the cancer treatment EGF being jointly developed with Abgenix Inc. of Fremont, Calif. She said Immunex would also try to put two other promising drug candidates into clinical trial this year: TRAIL/Apo2 ligand for cancer, being developed with Genentech Inc. of South San Fransisco, and an IL-1 receptor type 2 for inflammatory diseases like osteoporosis. 

 "We want to double the number of molecules we bring into the clinic every year," she said. 

 Enbrel, which must be injected, is a natural human protein that shuts down the action of another protein that attacks joint tissue when overproduced, as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Some cardiologists  believed that the oversupply of the same protein, the tumor necrosis factor, was damaging heart muscle and so Enbrel could benefit people suffering from heart failure. 

 The company said it will continue to test Enbrel in other indications, including psoriasis. The company hopes to have phase 2 results in the second half of this year. 

 NORTHFIELD, Minn. (Dow Jones)--Sheldahl Inc. (SHEL), facing slowing demand for its products from the automotive and electronics sectors, plans to cut its work force by 20%. 

 In addition to the 190-employee reduction, the company implemented a plan to reduce inventory and lower expenses across the board. "We are taking every action now to return the company to profitability," Sheldahl said in a statement Thursday.

 Zurich to Exit Reinsurance Amid Bleak Earnings Picture.

 Zurich Financial Services said it would exit the reinsurance business as it posted lower earnings for 2000, citing reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter and declining capital gains resulting from turbulent equity markets. 

 Zurich said it planned to spin off Zurich Re into a separate, publicly traded reinsurer with worldwide operations, but analysts said a sale of the unit was likely. The company also said it would dispose of "other nonstrategic and/or underperforming businesses" with a market value of $4 billion. 

 The announcement came as Zurich posted a 28.7% drop in net income to $2.33 billion and forecast a further decline in earnings for this year. "Normalized" net income, smoothed for fluctuations in capital gains, fell 5.5% to $2.01 billion, and the company said this figure could drop further, to a range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, in 2001. It said the forecast accounts for lower investment income; the continued strength of the U.S. dollar; the weakening U.S. economy; costs associated with adjusting the group's focus and improving technology, and a lag in top-line growth translating into profits. 

 Total premium volume rose 4% to $50 billion, including a 16% jump in nonlife premiums and a 4% increase in life premiums in local currencies. Total assets under management fell slightly to $440 million, and third-party assets were down 1.7% to $259 billion, but the net inflow of funds more than doubled to $7 billion, Zurich said. 

 The results sent the company's shares plummeting 17.6% in Zurich March 22. The stock ended at 549 Swiss francs ($1 = 1.728 Swiss Francs) a share, down 139 francs from the previous close. 

 Zurich had issued a profit warning in February, citing $300 million of reserve strengthening for finite-risk reinsurance treaties in the London market and "unexpected adverse developments" in the United States, as well as $100 million of weather-related claims in Europe and the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter (BestWire, Feb. 9, 2001). 

 The nonlife business posted a 67% drop in net income to $460 million, affected by "higher nontechnical expenses," foreign exchange, technology costs and charges related to the unification of Zurich's share structure last year. The combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a percentage of premiums, improved 0.6 points to 105.5. 

 Normalized net income for the life business rose 14.5% to $1 billion, while net income in the asset management business rose 4% to $264 million on a 7% increase in fee income to $1.7 billion. The normalized net income for reinsurance rose to $201 million, despite the reserve strengthening, and gross written premiums were up 8% to $4.9 billion. 

 "These results did not meet our expectations, and 2001 will be another challenging year," said Rolf Hueppi, Zurich's chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement. "However, our return on equity remains favorable and the group's performance reflects the ongoing transformation process and its associated costs. Management is determined to improve the performance of the group and we continue to expect that Zurich can achieve its long-term earnings growth target of 10% to 15%." 

 In addition to spinning off Zurich Re and selling other operations, Zurich said it was implementing cost-cutting measures, includes annualized savings in the home office of $200 million by year-end 2002 and another $100 million within three years through global procurement. Centralized placing of reinsurance will save $100 million a year, and a planned $2 billion debt reduction will cut interest expenses, the company said. 

 Andrew Pitt, an analyst with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London, said Zurich's 2001 earnings outlook was well below previous consensus forecasts by analysts, and management hadn't adequately explained the shortfall. He said Zurich, having hit the market with another negative surprise, was now being squeezed by questions of management's credibility and where its earnings would come from in the future. The company is now "an extremely undervalued collection of franchised businesses," Pitt said. 

 As for Zurich Re, Pitt predicted that Zurich would sell the unit at a discount, despite its stated plans to spin off the operation. He said Zurich Re, with a heavy concentration of U.S. business, lacked the scale to make money and was "not a particularly high-quality business."

 Intel's profit warnings and postponement of capital expenditure programmes has drawn attention to the oversupply problems of the global semiconductor industry. But analysts suggest that one company in the field, National Semiconductor, may be the first to benefit from any rebound; whenever that may happen. 

 INTEL Corporation's profit warning recently didn't come as shock to astute observers on Wall Street. It may have whacked the valuations of dozens of other companies but the knock-on effect hasn't quite spilled over to the company under the microscope this week - National Semiconductors (NYSE: NSM). 

 National Semi, as it's called, actually bounced when much of Wall Street was reeling in the face of further dire prognostications from Cisco. The semiconductor company had announced the launch of a new thin-client system but this alone was hardly sufficient to explain away the stock's insulation from general events. Perhaps the market believed that National had had enough of a battering over the last 12 months, down to US $24.5 from a high of US $87 in March last year. 

 Whatever the explanation, National has been through the wars in recent times. The chip war that is taking place in the US has bitten National since last October when it became one of the first - if not the first - semiconductor operator to suffer from an inventory correction. This may prove to be a positive yet, some will argue. 

 "I think National Semi is one of the companies that sees a rebound first because they were one of the first to feel the inventory correction in October," was the opinion recently of Tore Svanberg, senior semiconductor analyst at Robertson Stephens. 

 Wall Street analysts haven't exactly covered themselves in glory over the last 12 months. Svanberg believes that the inventory problem will sort itself out by the summer and from the autumn onwards we could see a reversal of fortune for the semiconductor companies. 

 Such has been the rate of acceleration of problems for technology companies, however, that we have problems taking Svanberg's thesis as gospel. In the first quarter of 2001, a total of 440 companies out of 650 have lowered forecasts for the coming quarters. The situation is even more alarming in the technology sector - 103 downward revisions from 135 companies. 

 National Semi is one of those 103 companies. In fact it has issued warnings twice since the beginning of the year. Last week, the company actually beat forecasts by achieving earnings per share of 21c in Q3, a cent ahead of expectations. Everthing's relative, however. The company had earlier expected an eps total of 31 cents - before the first warning. 

 So it was something of a bitter pill to swallow when the company also announced last week that the final quarter of the year (May 2001) would be a terrible one. From a revised forecast of 24 cents, the company is now guiding a maximum of five cents in this quarter. 

 Judging by the reaction of the market on Monday, investors believe that this is as bad as it gets. Once a chip recovery is underway, National Semi will benefit more than most they believe. So what has the stock got going for it when you put all the bad news to one side? 

 Cash. At the end of Q2, National Semi had almost US $1bn cash in hand, much of this surplus coming when it sold off its underperforming PC microprocessor unit two years ago and parted with a stake in Fairchild Semiconductor. The result of the aggressive restructuring is a balance sheet to die for - National Semi's debt/equity ratio is 0.1 with buckets of cash to spare. The financial risk is almost negligible - what's at issue is the operating one. Namely, when will the markets for its product turn around? 

 It's a question that is all but impossible to answer - hence our caution. The massive decline in outlook in the present quarter is alarming. There is just too much uncertainty to predict with accuracy when the PC market - vital to National Semi - will rebound. 

 One quarter of National Semi's business comes from wireless products. It's an exciting area to be in, with attractive growth prospects. The company's Geode processor already features in the new AOL set-top boxes and in Internet devices made by 3COM. We are just a little nervous that even these markets may suffer in the short term as the US economy tries to sort itself out. 

 The biggest concern is the uncertainty over earnings next year. The range of eps expectations for 2002 is worryingly wide - from 67 cents up to US $2.24. Given the outlook for the last quarter of 2001, it is inconceivable that the higher figure will be reached. The new upper forecast appears to be US $1.77 - or the same as the company had hoped to achieve in 2001. 

 At US $24.5, National Semi would be working to a 2002 PE of 36 if the pessimists are correct. That is just too high a rating to support, even if you believe that things will return to normal in 2002/03. Consequently, we are just a little bit wary of National Semi at current levels. The stock would have to fall to about US $20 before we would be tempted.

Web site builder slashing its staff

CHICAGO - Xpedior Inc., a Web site maker whose shares have declined 98 percent in the past year, is cutting 300 jobs, or 42 percent of the company's staff, and said it may file for bankruptcy protection because sales are falling.

The company, which helps other companies build Internet sites for electronic commerce, has enough cash to last only through June 30, Chief Financial Officer Tom Werner said. Chicago-based Xpedior is considering selling all or part of the company and will file for bankruptcy if necessary, he said.

Xpedior is closing unprofitable offices in New York; Denver; Dallas; San Jose, Calif.; and Alexandria, Va., it said. Its Chicago and Bedford, N.H., offices will remain open. The company reduced its work force by 16 percent to 1,430 in September.

Circuit board maker issues profit warning

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - Top circuit board maker Jabil Circuit warned Tuesday of future profit shortfalls even as it reported record revenues that came weeks after it laid off part of its work force.

Jabil, which provides circuit boards and other equipment to computer giants such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems, said it had second-quarter net earnings of $41.3 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $33.9 million, or 18 cents a share the same time a year ago. It also reported reported $1.2 billion in revenues for the quarter that ended Feb. 28. That was up from $838 million during the same period last year.

But like other big technology companies that have downgraded forecasts, Jabil said several factors are leading it to reduce its profit outlook.

Nike confirms drop in quarterly profits

BEAVERTON, Ore. - Nike said Tuesday its third-quarter earnings fell by a third compared with last year, confirming estimates the athletic shoe maker released last month.

Nike earned $97.4 million, or 35 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Feb. 28, compared with $145 million, or 52 cents per share, during the same period last year.

Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting 53 cents a share for the third quarter. Revenues of $2.17 billion was nearly unchanged from 2000.

Coffee flows freely at Starbucks meeting

SEATTLE - Starbucks Corp. on Tuesday held its annual shareholder meeting celebrating the runaway success of its espresso empire, but activists picketed its use of genetically engineered ingredients.

Speaking to an audience of about 2,000 giddy shareholders pumped up on free lattes and frappuccinos, Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz announced a 2-for-1 stock split, the fourth in Starbucks' nine years as a public company.

Starbucks shares fell $1.06, or 2.4 percent, to $43.25 on Tuesday, following the broader market. But the stock has racked up a gain of 25 percent in the last year.

San Jose paper plans no newsroom layoffs

SAN FRANCISCO - The executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News lifted the threat of newsroom layoffs Tuesday, the day after the paper's chairman and publisher resigned over planned job cuts.

Standing on a chair, David Yarnold held up a sheaf of papers and told a newsroom full of employees, "This is the layoff list." He then ripped up the papers, reporters at the afternoon meeting said.

Yarnold told the staff the paper would trim the equivalent of 20 full-time employees, but through attrition, reductions in overtime and free-lance budgets, and other cost-cutting moves. He also said the paper will fold its San Francisco edition into another suburban edition.

Poll finds Americans cautious on spending

NEW YORK - American consumers are tending to be more cautious about their discretionary spending this year, according to a recent survey by financial services company American Express Co., with about half the respondents saying they would not spend more than in 2000.

At the same time, the average American household expects its fixed household expenses, which include items such as rent or mortgage, groceries, utilities and telephone service, to rise by about 13 percent this year.

 Zurichearnings to take backseat to outlook.

 ZURICH, March 21 (Reuters) - Zurich Financial Services is due to post 2000 earnings on Thursday, but the focus will be less on the numbers and more on what it will say to win back investor confidence after a surprise profit warning, analysts say. 

 Zurich, Europe's sixth-largest insurer, rattled investors in February by saying 2000 profit would not reach the so-called normalised 1999 level of $2.29 billion without giving details. 

 Normalised income viewed by Zurich as its main profit figure is profit smoothed for volatile income from investments. 

 Estimates based on a BARRA poll of analysts put unadjusted profit - distinct from normalised income - on average at $3.66 billion, above 1999's $3.26 billion on a non-normalised basis. 

 The forecast range is a wide $2.26 billion to $4.58 billion. 

 Its shares plunged in the wake of the profit warning and have remained under pressure since the group said unexpected extra reserves to strengthen its reinsurance business and cover severe claims tied to extreme weather conditions had eaten into profit. 

 The stock plunged to a year low of 659 Swiss francs on March 19 and was down one franc at 704 in mid-morning trade on Wednesday, leaving it with a loss so far this year of almost 28 percent, wiping out the 7.6 percent gain posted in 2000. 

 It has underperformed the SMI blue chip index by 21 percent. The pan-European FT E300 Insurance index, of which Zurich is part, shed some 17 percent this year. 

PROFIT WARNING ADDED TO DOUBTS 

 Analysts said the profit warning added to investor doubts about Zurich and the ambitious growth strategy promoted by chairman and chief executive Rolf Hueppi. 

 It compounded nervousness over the stock after Hueppi reduced expectations about 2000 earnings at the halfway stage by predicting a cautious 10 to 15 percent increase rather than a firm 15 percent rise posted as the medium-term target. 

 The news remained bad after Zurich posted an unexpected 24-percent drop in six-month net profit in September and the gloom deepened after the company said it had decided to halve staff at its Zurich headquarters at a cost of some 230 jobs. 

 Hueppi had already raised analysts' eyebrows by setting a giant $1 billion e-business drive until 2003 and targeting an ambitious threefold rise in its client base to 100 million, while doubling the number of products sold per customer. 

 "Basically, it will come down to building up trust again," said analyst Christoph Ritschard at Zuericher Kantonalbank (ZKB). 

 Stefan Schuermann at Pictet & Cie forecast normalised income at $2.16 billion, adding a key news element would be whether Zurich would consider the sale of its re-insurance business and its 29-percent stake in Swiss insurer Baloise. 

 He did not rule out changes in management, adding Hueppi's reputation after the profit warning had been "much tarnished". 

 HUEPPI UNDER PRESSURE 

 The surprise profit warning had left Hueppi struggling to explain to analysts why Zurich waited to deliver the bad tidings, why there had been no reinsurance cover for the large weather claims and what went wrong on the reisurance side? 

 Analyst Rene Locher at Bank Sarasin said he wanted more information on Zurich's e-strategy, especially after Swiss Bank Vontobel last week revealed huge losses tied to an e-banking project and removed three top managers. 

 The saga revived memories of a denial by Zurich of a Swiss media report saying it had spent some $240 million on various Internet investments which were not coming to fruition. 

 While recently announced banking and insurance services ventures with Bank of Scotland and Bank of America failed to lift the gloom, the deals were seen as first signs of progress in Zurich's plan to triple its client base. 

 Nevertheless, Hueppi's star has lost some of the sparkle which it gained after he engineered the takeovers of Scudder Kemper and the financial services arm of British American Tobacco, lifting the group onto the global plain. 

 Analysts, however, expected Hueppi to stay firmly in control with no obvious successor to take his place.

 UPDATE 1-Ericsson unions urge CEO ouster.

 (Wraps union, investor stories, adds CEO interview, share) 

 STOCKHOLM, March 21 (Reuters) - Trade union leaders at troubled Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson want CEO Kurt Hellstrom to quit, and major shareholders are meeting on Friday to plot strategy ahead of next week's annual meeting, Swedish newspapers said on Wednesday. 

 Hellstrom, together with board chairman Lars Ramqvist has come under renewed fire since the group made a profit warning last week, prompting a massive sell-off of its shares. He was quoted on Wednesday as saying the group was at work on measures to cut costs, but that no solution package was ready. 

 Business daily Dagens Industri (DI) quoted union bosses as saying top management was responsible for the turbulence triggered by steep losses for Ericsson's mobile phone division last year and the first-quarter profit warning. 

 Ericsson, the world's third biggest supplier of mobile phones and biggest maker of networks, is only one of many tech and telecom companies to warn on profits in recent weeks as signs of a U.S. economic slowdown become evident. 

 But it has been dogged for years by a failure to match the world handset leader Nokia's ability to bring attractive models to market rapidly and profitably. Ericsson's share price fell by one third last week but has recovered slightly since. 

 At 1020 GMT it was seven percent down at 58.5 crowns, underperforming European sector peers by 2.5 percent. 

 "Kurt Hellstrom should come to his senses. If a football team doesn't function, it is the coach who takes the responsibility. The same applies in this industry," Tommy Jahrl, leader of the SIF engineering union branch at Ericsson's Linkoping plant, told the paper. 

 In an open letter in tabloid Aftonbladet, members of another union at Linkoping, the metalworkers, called on the group to review the organisation structure, which it described as inefficient, and reconsider plans to outsource mobile handset production, which will hit the Linkoping plant. 

 "NO READY PLAN" 

 Hellstrom said in an interview with daily Dagens Nyheter that it was still unclear how many jobs would be affected by the measures being planned. 

 In mobile phones, Ericsson's restructuring was aimed at reducing fixed costs, and the division's revenues more than covered variable costs, he said. 

 "We don't have any ready package of solutions but we are analysing what needs to be done in the whole group," he said. 

 Ericsson's announcement in January that it would outsource mobile phone production to Singapore-based Flextronic International Ltd did not amount to a final agreement, Hellstrom said. 

 Various cooperation agreements with partners in the industry - such as deals giving Ericsson know-how about sound, pictures and transmission in exchange for its expertise in radio technology - were moving closer, he said but did not elaborate. 

 Tensions have flared on factory floors due to uncertainty about management's restructuring plans following a decision to outsource mobile phone production to Singapore-based Flextronic International Ltd. 

 Simultaneous reports of huge increases in remuneration packages paid to Hellstrom and board chairman Lars Ramqvist have fuelled anger among the company's workers and prompted criticism from Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson. 

 In a further sign of pressure on the group's top management, financial daily Finanstidningen reported that major institutional investors would meet on Friday to discuss strategy ahead of next week's annual meeting. 

 A call for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss changes on the company board may be an outcome of their talks, the paper said without revealing its sources. 

 Ericsson's ordinary annual general meeting will be held on March 28 and the AGM notice proposes that the entire board be re-elected.

 Despite  Profit Warning , Analysts Still Bullish On Deere

 CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Deere & Co. (DE) said Wednesday its fiscal second-quarter earnings would fall below year-earlier levels, but many on Wall Street nevertheless maintained a bullish stance on the company's long-term potential. 

 Deere, Moline, Ill., said the "continued caution on the part of customers" prompted production cuts in its major equipment operations, including a one-week closure of an Iowa tractor-manufacturing plant. 

 Several analysts, including Barry B. Bannister of Legg Mason in Baltimore, said the news was somewhat of a surprise. Though comparable sales problems have also been mounting at other manufacturing companies, issues at Deere weren't expected until the second half of 2001. 

 "It sort-of arrived a little bit early," he said. 

 Bannister on March 7 upgraded Deere to strong buy from market performance, and said Wednesday he still stands by that decision. 

 Analysts had expected the company to earn 96 cents a share for the period ended April 20, according to a poll conducted by Thomson Financial/First Call. Deere earned 87 cents a share during the fiscal second quarter last year. 

 Though he'll adjust his estimates to match Deere's new guidance, Bannister said most of the bad news has already been priced into the stock. He sees upside catalysts such as continued interest rate cuts and easier comparisons. 

 It's not expected to be a big year in terms of sales and earnings gains for Deere, Bannister said, but current trading levels make the stock well-positioned for solid growth in 2002. 

 Deere said it expects physical volume of sales, excluding acquisitions, to be flat for the second quarter and up 4% for the full year. The company previously had predicted increased of 5% and 6% for the respective periods. 

 Analyst Steve Volkmann of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York also stands by his March 12 upgrade of Deere shares to outperform from neutral. 

 Volkmann at the time noted that recent macroeconomic data, such as housing starts and construction spending, came in stronger than expected. Though consumer confidence has plunged over the past six months, it remains strong given historical standards. Industrial inventories are near all-time lows, he said. 

 "There's more momentum on the upside for a stock like Deere," Volkmann said. 

 Production will be slowed at Deere's commercial and consumer equipment unit, where the company said poor weather has had a negative impact on sales. 

 That's not much of a surprise because the company makes top-of-the-line equipment with generally higher price points, said analyst John Inch of Bear Stearns in New York. 

 Products in the division include lawn and garden tractors, golf equipment and hand-held power products. 

 "In a softening economy, those are usually the first things to go," Inch said. 

 Deere said a recent fire at an Iowa storage facility that damaged some of its grounds-care products also might eat into the division's short-term results. The business interruption and the products lost in the fire are covered by insurance, and any impact will be offset in future quarters, the company said. 

 Inch was among the first to decrease estimates on Deere Wednesday. He cut his second-quarter estimate to 60 cents a share from 85 cents, and full year to $2 a share from $2.25. Inch said future cuts would be likely. 

 Analyst David Bleustein of UBS Warburg in New York said that perhaps the biggest piece of news is what the company left out of its news release Wednesday: corn prices. 

 Bleustein said he expects farmers to plant less this summer due to continued high energy prices. As a result, the corn markets should see decreased supplies and increased prices, making an environment much more suitable for new equipment purchases next year, he said. 

 "We saw nothing in that release that concerns us for 2002," Bleustein said. 

 The production cuts fall in line with what other companies are facing and represent Deere's reaction to the tough market environment, said spokesman Greg Derrick. 

 "We're seeing the same stuff affecting everyone else," Derrick said. "It's what the economy is doing."

 ANAHEIM, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- New Focus Inc. (NUFO) Chief Executive Ken Westrick said he remains comfortable with the company's 2001 revenue forecast, despite a profit warning earlier this week from Corning Inc. (GLW), one of its largest customers. 

 In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires at the Optical Fiber Conference here, Westrick said New Focus has not changed its 2001 revenue estimate of between $170 million and $190 million. Earlier this month, New Focus lowered that estimate from previous projections of $240 million. 

 Additionally, the company said first quarter revenue will be between $38 million and $41 million, down from a previous estimate of $42 million. 

 "We are comfortable with our estimates," Westrick said. However, he said visibility into future quarters, "is less than it's ever been." 

 "It is certainly not what we are accustomed to," Westrick added. 

 "We have about $400 million in the bank," Westrick said, which could sustain the company through a lengthy economic downturn. "We're able to, in this time of transition, to pursue the products we want to." 

 He said the company has cut back on the number of products it will pursue, but will fully fund those it identifies as key products. 


New Focus makes active and passive fiber optic components as well as
photonic tools for commercial and research applications. On Monday,
Corning lowered its revenue and earnings estimates for 2001 as
telecommunications service providers reduce their spending plans. New
Focus also sells components to a number of optical systems makers.

 RESEARCH ALERT-Goldman cuts MONY to market perform.

 NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Tuesday said it cut MONY Group to market performer from market outperformer after the life insurer gave a first-quarter profit warning. 

 MONY Group said Monday it expected first-quarter earnings per share of 29 cents, reflecting lower revenues and earnings, and added that 2001 profits would be in the range of $2.00 to $2.25 per share. 

 Goldman said in a research note that it cut MONY's earnings estimates to $1.90 per share from $2.25 for 2001 due to the weak stock market's impact on variable annuity and mutual fund sales and asset values that produce fee income. 

 Assets under management that started the year at nearly $10 billion have fallen to $9 billion, and the insurer's venture capital portfolio was not expected to contribute to first-quarter income. 

 "MNY (MONY) has been viewed as a consolidation candidate because of its agency distribution, upscale market focus and excess capital," Goldman's note said. "But estimating if and when a transaction is likely is tricky." 

 MONY, which has repurchased 1.1 million shares of a 2.4 million share authorization, has not bought back additional stock since their fourth-quarter earnings announcement on Feb. 8, even though the share price has been below book value since early January. 

 "With an ROE (return-on-equity) of around 5 percent, and modest earnings prospects for the year, investor patience may be running thin," Goldman said. "We believe more substantive actions may have to be taken soon if the company ROE target of 10 percent ROE by 2003 is to be met." 

 Shares closed down $1.15 to $34.85 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Its 52-week high is $51.375.

 Singapore tech stocks seen volatile on poor outlook.

     SINGAPORE, March 20 (Reuters) - Profit warnings and job 

 cuts by some Singapore technology firms have scuttled hopes of 

 a second-half earnings recovery, setting the stage for their 

 share prices to remain volatile for several months. 

     Analysts and fund managers in Asia are now rooting for a 

 tech turnaround in early 2002 at best. 

     "The recovery in the earnings of some local tech companies 

 could be delayed until early next year as the U.S. economy, 

 which is the biggest buyer of tech products in the world, is 

 expected to rebound by year-end," said Ian Lui, a portfolio 

 manager with Allianz Asset Management Asia Pacific. 

 Shrinking global demand has taken its toll on Singapore 

 firms, with ST Assembly Test Services the latest to issue a 

profit warning and Creative Technology Ltd the first to slash 

 its workforce worldwide. 

 ST Assembly, which provides semiconductor testing and 

 packaging services, cut its first quarter 2001 revenue forecast 

 by 50 percent on Tuesday and warned of a loss of US$0.23 to 

 US$0.25 per American Depositary Share (ADS) in the period. 

 Creative said it would cut about 10 percent of its global 

 workforce and close a plant in Pennsylvania to rein in 

 expenses. 

 The computer peripherals maker will also take a one-time 

 restructuring charge of US$15 million to US$20 million and a 

 US$65 million write-down in its investment portfolio in the 

 third quarter. 

 Dharmo Soejanto, an analyst with Kim Eng Securities, said a 

 meaningful recovery in the sector was more likely in early 

 2002. 

     "The problem is that there's no catalyst for demand and 

 inventory is still at record levels," he said. 

     Shares of ST Assembly and Creative have underperformed the 

 broader Straits Times Index by about 39 percent and 48 percent 

 respectively over the last six months. 

     ST Assembly has slumped about 15 percent for the year, 

 while Creative has fallen about 13 percent since the start of 

 the year. (See table below for other stock performances) 

     NEUTRAL TO UNDERWEIGHT POSITION 

     With the grim outlook, analysts and fund managers do not 

 rule out further downside for Singapore tech stocks, with most 

 keeping a neutral to underweight position in the sector. 

     Chong Yoon Chou, an investment manager with Aberdeen Asset 

 Management Asia, noted that as most tech stocks still reflect 

 hopes of a V-shaped sector recovery by mid-year despite the 

 negative newsflow, the downside risk for share prices was high. 

 "The reality is that companies have no visibility in 

 orders, but investors are still buying tech stocks on hopes of 

 things returning to normal this year - and there's a high 

 chance of that not happening at all," said Chong, who intends 

 to remain underweight in the tech sector. 

 "We're still very cautious on the sector as there are 

 inadequate fundamentals to provide a firm support for current 

 share prices." 

 Michael Lim, a fund manager at Prudential Portfolio 

 Managers Asia, said he would keep a neutral weighting in Asian 

 tech shares, as any meaningful recovery for U.S. tech firms 

 would only take place in the first quarter of next year. 

 "If you are aggressively overweight in local tech stocks, I 

 would advise you to trim your exposure," he said. "If you are 

 underweight, you could do some bottom-fishing, although I would 

 be very cautious." 

     Lui at Allianz said he was adopting a wait-and-see 

 approach. 

     "We have zero weighting in Singapore contract manufacturers 

 and we're waiting for a good opportunity to buy. We think we 

 should also accumulate some semiconductor stocks in the current 

 downcycle," he said. 

 "But with the market mood so negative, and more earnings 

 downgrades likely in the coming months, share prices will be 

 very volatile - we will have to monitor the situation very 


closely." Company		    Share price since    Vs

 ADR REPORT-ADRs mixed awaiting Fed rate  cut .

 NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - Shares of European and Latin American companies traded in the United States rose on Tuesday in anticipation of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and on the naming of a new Economy Minister in Argentina who aims to slash $3 billion in spending. 

 Gains in European and Latin American shares boosted the Bank of New York index of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) 0.61 percent, but a 0.41 percent loss in the BONY index of leading Asian companies to 100.66 halted further gains. 

 In mid-afternoon trade, investors waited for the Fed to lower interest rates for the third time this year, a move that should ease borrowing costs in Latin America and could increase investment flows to the region as investors seek higher returns. The Fed was expected to cut interest rates either by half or three-quarters of a percentage point at about 2:15 p.m. (1715 GMT) 

 "The ADRs are following the markets in the United States" in anticipation of a rate cut by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, said Ray Fernandez, managing director of equity trading at BNP Paribas. 

 "The market will initially sell off, no matter what happens," Fernandez said. "The market already knows what Greenspan's going to say - he's used the same comments for the last two years. So, initially a sell-off, but then buyers will start appearing and everything will be okay." 

 The BONY index of leading Latin American companies rose 0.52 percent to 91.67 after Domingo Cavallo, who slayed hyperinflation in Argentina by pegging the peso to the dollar in 1991, was appointed the country's new Economy Minister early Tuesday. Cavallo, a well-known economist on Wall Street, immediately announced he would trim the budget deficit by $3 billion in 2001 and said he would spring no other policy surprises, including meddling with the foreign exchange. 

 Argentine markets rebounded on Tuesday, on hopes Cavallo can halt weeks of political turmoil, but Telecom Argentina , the country's largest telecommunications firm, extended recent losses, falling 0.37 percent to trade at $16.09, as traders doubted the company's valuation in the shaky telecommunications sector. 

 Argentine energy companies all gained, with the ADRs of oil company Perez Companc rising 2.04 percent to $15.50, gas shipper Transportadora de Gas del Sur gaining 2 percent to $7.03 and ADRs of Spanish-owned oil company YPF Repsol up 1.65 percent to $28.30. 

 In Brazil, shares of state-controlled oil company Petrobras gained, even though the company's biggest offshore oil rig sank after several explosions last week killed 10 people and left it crippled. The rig was responsible for 5 percent of the oil consumption in Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America. 

 "Everybody knew the rig would sink two days ago, and having been down three days in a row, now the stock's up," said John Gilette, international equities trader with Lazard Freres. "They've got a production problem, but the rig was insured and they're not out of pocket." 

 ADRs of Petrobras rose 0.8 percent to $26.11. 

 The BONY index of leading European companies rose 0.77 percent to 118.34 as German technology stocks shrugged off a profit warning from Dutch electronics powerhouse Philips and pushed the blue-chip DAX higher, fueled by improving sentiment after the U.S. Nasdaq rose 3.19 percent on Monday. 

 Having hit new 16-month lows on Monday, the blue-chip DAX , traders said the mood was positive but cautious as investors await the expected U.S. interest rate cut. 

 The recently listed ADRs of electronics firm Siemens AG gained 2.32 percent to trade at $105.80, and the receipts of Europe's largest software firm, SAP , rose 3.57 percent. 

 News from Philips that first quarter operating profit in its semiconductor division was expected to fall 10 percent had already been priced into the market, traders said. 

 Philips also said turnover at the chip division in the first quarter was expected to rise seven percent from last year. Philips ADRs fell 7 percent to trade at $28.25. 

 Also up in Europe were the ADRs of telecommunications leaders, after the chief executive of the world's No 1 handset maker, Nokia , commented on Tuesday that European Union telephone companies were in "good shape" despite having wildly overpaid for third generation mobile telephone licenses. 

 The comments of Jorma Ollila helped boost the mood in the shaky sector, where BNP Paribas' Fernandez said fund managers have recently been moving money out of one European telecom stock and into another. 

 "Investors are looking for something to grab on to, to stay invested in the sector," said Fernandez. 

 Nokia's ADRs were up 3.8 percent to $27.05, British Telecommunications Plc ADRs rose 5 percent to $22.50, and receipts of French telecoms equipment maker Alcatel was up 3.06 percent to $35.65. 

 Markets were closed in Japan, in observance of a local holiday. Trading will resume in Asia's largest market and the world's second largest economy on Wednesday. 

 ADRs of Japan's market bellwether Sony Corp rose x.x percent to $67.57.

 Adaptec to Slash 450 Jobs, or 20% of Work Force, and  Cut  Other Costs

 MILPITAS, Calif. -- Three weeks after issuing a fiscal fourth-quarter warning, Adaptec Inc. announced late Tuesday it will cut 450 jobs, or 20% of its work force, because of the slowing economy. 

 The maker of data-storage devices also said it plans to cut discretionary spending, such as marketing expenses, travel and contract services. Adaptec (ADPT) said the moves will result in annualized savings of $44 million. 

 The company expects to record a $10 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, which ends March 31, from the job cuts. Adaptec first revealed the planned charge earlier this month in its profitwarning. At the time, the company would only say it was restructuring, and didn't give specifics. 

 In its warning, Adaptec revised its fourth-quarter forecast to earnings of 10 cents to 15 cents a share on revenue 15% below the third quarter's $186.3 million. At that time, the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call was for earnings of 23 cents a share. Analysts now expect earnings of 12 cents a share. A year earlier, the company earned $53.9 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenue of $213.1 million.

 Northwest Air Says Cost-Cutting Plan Will Add $200 Million to Bottom Line

 MINNEAPOLIS -- Northwest Airlines Corp. announced a cost-cutting plan to add $200 million to its bottom line after the company last week warned that its first-quarter earnings would disappoint because of declining business travel. 

 Northwest (NWAC) said the plan includes reducing nonprofitable flying and the early retirement of three DC10-40 aircraft this fall; deferring advertising, management training and other discretionary spending; and cutting overall management payroll expense by 5%. 

 Northwest, St. Paul, Minn., said it plans to achieve the 5% management payroll expense deduction without company-wide layoffs. 

 The nation's fourth-largest airline also plans to defer officer and director merit salary increases until February 2002. 

 The company joined other major air carriers when it announced last Wednesday that it wouldn't meet first quarter earnings expectations, primarily because of the decline in corporate business travel resulting from the slowing economy. The company estimated it would lose $130 million to $150 million, or $1.55 to $1.80 a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call at the time was for a first-quarter loss of 59 cents a share. 

 Northwest is the latest of several airlines to lower its estimates for the first quarter. Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) last Tuesday warned that it anticipates a first-quarter loss instead of the profit that analysts had been expecting. The third-largest U.S. airline cited a weaker economy and pilot labor woes that are prompting passengers to avoid bookings. US Airways Group Inc. (U) also has issued a profit warning. 

 Northwest has seen its share of labor unrest as well. Contract talks broke off last Sunday with its mechanics' union, which earlier this month voted to authorize job actions against the company. But President Bush took emergency action and barred the 10,000 unionized workers from going on strike Monday. Mr. Bush, who has said that a strike could harm the economy, added that the mechanics must stay on the job for an additional 60 days. 

 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Northwest posted a net loss of $69 million, or 84 cents a share, but beat Wall Street expectations excluding one-time items. The company was hurt by adverse weather and higher fuel costs. But it said it was able to keep costs in check and benefited from strong revenue growth in its passenger and cargo businesses and from its marketing alliance with Continental Airlines. 

 Northwest's chief financial officer, Mickey Foret, has warned that costs will rise in 2001 because the company has no fuel hedges in place and is taking out seats to put more legroom into its first-class and business-class cabins

 ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Zurich Financial Services (Z.ZFS) Tuesday said its U.S. unit Farmers Insurance Group has entered a strategic partnership with Bank of America Corp. (BAC). 

 The joint venture aims to provide integrated financial services to more than 37 million households in the U.S., almost trebling Farmers's customer base, Zurich said. 

 Bank of America, the biggest U.S. retail bank, has 4,400 banking centres and 13,000 automated teller machines. Farmers Insurance has a network of 17,000 independent agents. 

 Zurich last week detailed a strategic partnership with the U.K.'s Bank of Scotland (U.BSC).

ZURICH (Dow Jones)--Swiss financial group Zurich Financial Services
(Z.ZFS) said so-called normalized net profit, the group's main profit
figure, fell to $2.10 billion compared with 1999's $2.22 billion.



The decline wasn't surprising after the group's profit warning in
February, due to a reinsurance and weather-related extraordinary charge
of $400 million.



Net profit according to international accounting standards decreased
to $2.33 billion compared with $3.26 billion.



The group said normalized net income will fall further to between $1.8
billion and $2.0 billion this year, "despite continued strong top line
growth".



Zurich announced a spin-off of its reinsurance operations and the
disposal of other non-strategic or underperforming activities with a
value of up to $4 billion.



The group's operating profit for 2000 fell to $3.17 billion from $5.18
billion, while premium income rose to $50.04 billion from $48.0 billion.
Assets under management were flat at $440 billion after 1999's $442
billion.



The group set an unchanged dividend of CHF17.15.

 Poor Heavy-Duty Truck Market Hurts ArvinMeritor 2Q

 DETROIT -(Dow Jones)- Given the recent turbulence in the auto industry, analysts say they weren't shocked by ArvinMeritor Inc.'s (ARM) profitwarning Tuesday. 

 "You can't have a high degree of confidence in any earnings estimate in the auto sector," said analyst Brett Hoselton of McDonald Investments Inc., adding that the company's new full-year target is "a crap shoot." 

 The Troy, Mich., auto parts supplier Tuesday said it expects second-quarter earnings of 40 cents to 45 cents a share, versus the company's previous estimate of 65 cents to 70 cents a share. ArvinMeritor also lowered its full-year estimate to $1.35 to $1.45 a share from its previous estimate of $2.00 to $2.30 a share. 

 ArvinMeritor's estimates fall below Thomson Financial/First Call consensus projections of 51 cents a share for the second quarter and $1.92 a share for the full year. They also fall far below last year's results of 87 cents a share for the second quarter and $3.56 a share for the full year. 

 The company is expected to report its second-quarter earnings April 25. 

 Hoselton said in light of market conditions, ArvinMeritor's previous earnings targets were too high. He gave an initial estimate of 52 cents a share for the second quarter. 

 Analysts say supplier profit warnings have become far more common as the heavy-duty truck and light vehicle markets have been on the decline. They also say parts suppliers have a rough road ahead because auto sales are expected to slip further later this year. 

 In the past several months, the heavy-duty truck market has deteriorated due to a surplus of new and used heavy trucks and a shortage of drivers, analysts say. And high energy costs and interest rates have caused a softening in the light vehicle market. As a result, auto makers have slashed production to get supply in sync with demand. 

 Lower vehicle output typically hurts parts makers' profitability because they get fewer orders for parts from the manufacturers that are their customers. 

 In a conference call Tuesday, Chief Executive Larry Yost said he expects production of Class 8 vehicles, or heavy-duty trucks, to fall 16% in fiscal 2001 to about 135,000 units, compared with a previously expected estimate of 160,000 units. Light vehicle production is expected to decline about 9% in North America and 2% in Europe, the company said. 

 Though the news of the earnings shortfall may not have surprised some analysts, Fahnestock & Co. auto analyst Richard Hilgert said the rate of deterioration in the heavy-duty truck market is an eye-opener. 

 "It took everyone by surprise," Hilgert said. "No one anticipated that the heavy-duty truck market was going to be down that much." 

 ArvinMeritor said it expects second-quarter sales to total about $1.8 billion, down 13% from the same period last year. Sales for the full year are expected to be about $6.6 billion, down 14% from a year ago, the company said. 

 ArvinMeritor shares lost $1.41, or 9.1%, Tuesday, closing at $14.14 on volume of 458,200. Average daily volume is 230,616 shares.

 Rohm & Haas CEO: 2001 Outlook Too 'Cloudy' To Predict

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Rohm & Haas Co. (ROH) Chief Executive Raj Gupta blamed a cloudy crystal ball for the company's lack of guidance for the remainder of the year. 

 "We are watching business trends very closely," Gupta said Tuesday in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. Semiconductor sales, housings starts, consumer spending and automobile sales are among the data the executive is keeping an eye on. 

 Earlier Tuesday, the Philadelphia specialty chemicals company issued a widely-anticipated profit warning for its first-quarter earnings. 

 Rohm & Haas now expects earnings to be between 27 cents and 29 cents a share. The earnings are below the first-quarter consensus estimate of 35 cents a share reported by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 The earnings are down sharply from record earnings of 61 cents a share a year ago, and are also lower than the 32 cents a share the company earned in the fourth-quarter 2000. 


   Slowing Economy Blamed



In issuing the first-quarter outlook, Gupta said the company's
performance reflects a slowing U.S. economy, high raw material costs,
and the negative impact of foreign exchange.



"We said earlier that we expected our first-quarter comparisons to be
ugly, and those expectations have been met," Gupta said in the press
release.



Rohm & Haas reported its plan to release its outlook last week at a
chemical conference sponsored by Merrill Lynch. Rohm & Haas said it does
not expect to see any improvement in its operating environment until
"mid-year or later."



After the conference, Merrill Lynch analyst John Roberts trimmed his
first-quarter estimate for the company to 30 cents a share from 35 cents
a share.



Judging from the tone of the conference, Rohm & Haas will not be alone
in issuing disappointing earnings, Roberts said.



In recent days, industrial gas producer Air Products & Chemicals Inc.
(APD) and self-adhesive products company Avery Dennison Corp. (AVY) have
also reported softening demand.



Engelhard Corp. (EC) may be among the few companies in the sector that
could report higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings, Roberts said.



Given the current industry conditions, Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst
Timothy Gerdeman said he is more concerned about the lack of guidance
from Rohm & Haas for the second-quarter and the rest of 2001.



The analyst lowered his 2001 estimate for the company to $1.50 a share
from $1.75, and reduced 2002 estimates to $1.75 from $2.10 a share.
Gerdeman also cut his 12-month price target for Rohm & Haas shares to
$26, which is roughly 21% below its current trading price.



After falling as low as $32.08 Tuesday, Rohm & Haas shares were
recently trading up 99 cents, or 2.9%, at $34.60. Gerdeman cited short
covering for the increase. Earlier, the stock was helped by expectations
of good news from the Federal Reserve, he said.



The Fed cut interest rates by a half a percentage point.



Gupta said other specialty chemical stocks were also trading higher
Tuesday. He believes much of the bad news in the sector is already
priced into the stocks, which he says are trading at a discounted price
levels.



As Rohm & Haas deals with the tough conditions in its markets, the
company's focus will be on cost management, CEO Gupta said.



The company has instituted tight cost controls wherever possible. At
the moment, these measures include a hiring freeze, but not large-scale
layoffs, Gupta said. Still, the executive did not rule out job cuts if
negative conditions persist.



"What is important here is that relative to our peers that we perform
better," he said.



Gupta added that the emphasis on cost management will not prevent the
company from investing in its core growth areas of electronics materials
and coatings.



Rohm & Haas' electronics materials division is expected to report
"very good sales growth, in the range of 10% above last year," the
company said. Although there are signs of softening demand for printed
wiring board, the company continues to see good demand for its
photoresists and chemical mechanical planarization technologies, which
are used to make a wide-range of semiconductor chips.



Rohm & Haas is in the process of adjusting its portfolio of
businesses, and recently agreed to sell its agricultural chemicals
business to Dow Chemical Co.'s (DOW) Dow AgroScience LLC unit for $1
billion.



The company expects to report its final results for the first quarter
on April 23.

 IBP Inc 4Q Loss 6c/Basic Share Vs Net 79c

IBP Inc. - Dakota Dunes, S.D.
   4th Quar Dec. 30:
                          2000               1999
Sales               $4,410,916,000     $4,135,925,000

  Net income                a (.06)               .79
Shr earns (diluted)
  Net income                b ....                .71



Figures in parentheses are losses.


 a. Includes $60.4 million pretax charge, or $41 million after taxes, related to goodwill impairment from its DFG Foods unit. Excluding the charge, income was $35 million, or 33 cents a diluted share. 

 b. Antidilutive. 

 IBP Inc. (IBP) said the Securities and Exchange Commission finished its review and closed the books on the accounting issues related to its DFG Foods unit. 

 An IBP investigation of the unit uncovered potential manipulation of financial records and product theft. It also revealed mismanagement by former DFG managers. 

 The company said it will use the results of the audit for any legal action needed to recover its losses. 

 The maker of beef, pork and related products said it expects DFG to be cash flow neutral in 2001. 

 IBP reiterated previous 2001 earnings guidance of $1.80 to $2.20 a share, which would beat analysts' estimates of $1.54 a share. 

 Despite constricted supplies and high prices for cattle in the first quarter, the company expects to see a turnaround in the late spring and summer. This will be coupled with improved income from its fresh meat operations and Foodbrands America unit. 

 IBP earned $220 million, or $2.03 a diluted share, before unusual items and charges, on sales of $16.95 illion. 

 Last week, the company termed an analyst's first quarter estimate of 12 cents a share "reasonable." IBP company didn't identify the analyst who made that projection. 

 IBP's outlook and financial report follows a second-quarter profitwarning made by acquisition target Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) before the opening bell. 

 On Jan. 1, Tyson agreed to acquire IBP for $3.2 billion, plus assumption of debt. Some investors and arbitrageurs have questioned the stability of that proposed transaction and believe food processor Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD), who lost out on its bid for IBP earlier this year, could re-emerge as a bidder. 

 Some of this concern stemmed from Tyson showing disappointment over IBP's revised first quarter estimates. 

 Earlier Tuesday, Tyson, which processes poultry, cut its second-quarter earnings estimates to at or near break-even. The company previously expected to earn 6 cents to 10 cents a share for the period. 

 In 2000, IBP's fresh meat operations reported a 5% drop in operating earnings, which fell to $433 million, from $454 million in 1999. Sales reached $13.7 billion, up from $12.6 billion in 1999. The fresh meat operations include beef carcass, beef processing, pork and other segments. 

 Live cattle prices grew by 7%, while hog prices climbed 30% in 2000. 

 IBP reported export sales dollars grew 15% for the year, while export volumes increased 8%. 

 The company's Foodbrands America unit, which produces prepared foods, reported operating losses of $50 million for the fourth quarter and $60 million for the year. This compares with operating earnings of $15 million for the year-ago fourth quarter and $102 million in 1999. 

 The Foodbrands unit's results included merger-related costs, additional bad debt expenses, and impairment charges collectively totaling $102 million. Excluding those costs, the unit reported operating income of $42 million for the year. 


   Year Dec. 30:
                           2000               1999
Sales              $16,949,608,000    $15,121,689,000
Net income           b 135,187,000      c 317,867,000
Shr earns (basic)
  Net income                b 1.25             c 3.26
Shr earns (diluted)
  Net income                b 1.24             c 2.96



Figures in parentheses are losses.



b. Includes loss totaling $44 million from bad debt loss,
merger-related expenses, cumulative effect of an acounting adjustment
and an extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt. Excluding those
items, income was $220 million or $2.03 a diluted share.



c. Includes a loss of $21.7 million in asset write-downs, offset by a
gain of $13.8 million from the reduction of income tax expense.
Excluding those items, income was $326 million, or $3.03 a diluted
share.

 German Stocks PM - German shares higher as U.S. rates  cut  seen.

 Mar 20, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - Frankfurt, March 20 (BridgeNews) -The DAX-30 continued in the black in early evening trade, with shares edging up as expectation of a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve builds. U.S. stocks opened higher today, with traders on Wall Street looking for the Federal Open Market Committee to lower rates by 50 basis points, though some optimists have been eyeing a 75 basis-point cut. An announcement is expected at about 2015 CET. At 1801 the DAX-30 was 2.2% higher at 5782.77 points. 


	    *			*			*



 German shares are up in ahead of the rates decision, and analysts say trade is operating at the moment under the motto, "buy the rumor, sell the fact." At 1708 CET, the DAX-30 index was up 1.7% to 5755.58 points. 

 TMT shares continued to shrug off the Philips profit warning today that first-quarter results will be hit by the U.S. slowdown, as well as a further weakening in the telecom and personal computer markets. The Dutch group said its semiconductors business, which was the driving force behind 2000 profits, will see first quarter operating profits fall 10% year-on-year. The group also warned its components and consumer electronics business will actually post an operating loss. 

 SAP AG took over as the main TMT gainer in evening trade, rising 7% to 137.00 euros. Epcos AG was up 7% to 66.54 euros on the back of a Financial Times Deutschland interview with the new CEO, Gerhard Pegam, who said the company will further cut costs. He also reiterated Epcos' 2001 forecast, which sees full-year sales increasing by 20%. Semiconductor company Infineon AG rose 4.5% to 40.70 euros. Siemens AG rose 3.6% to 117.06 euros. Deutsche Telekom AG edged up 4.6% to 26.48 euros. 

 Financials were mixed in early evening trade, with Deutsche Bank still the main riser. It was confirmed today that a unit of the bank, Morgan Grenfell Private Equity, has agreed to buy U.K. hospitality and leisure group Whitbread Holdings' pub and bars division for 1.63 billion sterling in cash and debt. Deutsche bank was 3.9% higher at 81.46 euros. 

 Bucking the trend, Deutsche Post AG spent the aftern.on in negative territory, after the EU Commission said it abused its dominant market position and directed the group to separate its business parcel services. However, the penalty was less severe than expected, when the EU Commission imposed a 24 million euro fine on the group, around 50% less than originally expected. Deutsche Post AG fell 3.8% to 21.06 euros. 

 In utilities, E.on AG was down 2.2% to 49.49 euros. Austrian energy supplier Verbund confirmed today that it is in talks with E.on AG, German energy company, with a view to merging with the German firm's hydroelectric power works. While German finance magazine Capital reported a deal has been struck between both companies, Verbund said negotiations are still ongoing and that it is holding talks with RWE AG and Spanish energy companies.

 ASML Issues Profit Warning

 ASM Lithography NV issued a profit warning, saying that weaker demand for lithography tools will hurt its 2001 results. But it also said it expects this negative trend to reverse next year. 

 The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker said shipments in 2001 won't exceed the 368 units, including 38 used and refurbished machines, sold in 2000. It had expected to run at full capacity of 400 to 440 machines. 

 However, ASML now expects sales of the systems for 2001 to fall between 10% and 25% as demand for semiconductor equipment has weakened substantially. This means the number of systems sold in 2001 should be between 276 and 331. 

 Chief Executive Doug Dunn said much will depend on ASML's fourth quarter. "The first quarter looked pretty weak and the orders are in for the second and third quarter, they look weak too," Mr. Dunn said during a conference call. He added that the low estimate of a 10% decline is based on an increase in the fourth quarter. 

 Mr. Dunn said the slowdown became apparent in January as customers began adjusting their capacity requirements.

 Intel Rolls Out Chip for Laptops 

 Intel Corp. is expected to introduce a microprocessor chip for laptop computers, its first mobile processor to operate at a speed of one gigahertz. 

 The Pentium III 1 GHz uses a technology called SpeedStep, which is designed to run faster when power saving isn't an issue and slow down the processor when the user wants to extend the time it runs on batteries. The Pentium III 1 GHz runs at 700 megahertz in the battery-optimized mode and will cost $722 (806 euros) when bought in lots of 1,000 units. 

 Computer makers including Dell Computer Corp., Gateway Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. are expected to start selling systems using the new chip today.

 NCR Sues Palm and Handspring 

 NCR Corp. filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Palm Inc. and Handspring Inc., alleging they violated its 13-year-old patents on hand-held computers. 

 NCR is best known for making automated-teller systems for banks and point-of-sales networks for retailers, but in a filing with the U.S. District Court in Delaware, the Dayton, Ohio, company said it had patented a hand-held computer with a docking station in 1987. It said Palm and Handspring have been violating its patents for years with the sale of their popular personal digital assistants. 

 Handspring officials said they would defend their products against NCR's patent-infringement claims. "Handspring believes this lawsuit is without merit," said Allen Bush, a Handspring spokesman, "We are working with Palm to defend it." 

 A Palm spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the company's lawyers haven't had a chance to review the lawsuit.

 Deutsche Telekom Wins Break 

 A German appeals court ruled that Deutsche Telekom AG won't be required to offer competing service providers flat-rate Internet access to its lines while the phone giant battles regulators over a decision to impose the flat-rate fee. 

 German government regulators late last year ordered Deutsche Telekom to give competing Internet service providers flat-rate access to its lines. Internet-service providers in Germany already offered flat-rate service but had to pay Deutsche Telekom by the minute for line use. Independent service providers said the per-minute system put them at a disadvantage against Deutsche Telekom's Internet subsidiary, T-Online International AG, which at the time offered its own flat-rate fee. Government-owned Deutsche Telekom has a virtual monopoly on the local phone connections people use to log on to the Internet.

 Yahoo! Chief Exercises Options 

 Yahoo! Inc. Chief Executive Timothy Koogle realized a gain of $11.4 million (12.7 million euros) by exercising options to buy 100,000 company shares in 2000, according to a definitive proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Mr. Koogle's annual salary rose to $310,000 in 2000 from $295,000 in 1999, and he was granted 500,000 options to purchase stock. The options will be valued at $18.9 million in 2010 if the company's shares appreciate at an annual rate of 5%, or $47.8 million if the company's shares rise at an annual rate of 10%.

 Infostrada's Price is Lowered 

 Enel SpA said that it has agreed on a 7.25 billion euros price to buy Italian fixed-line phone company Infostrada SpA from Vodafone PLC. Last year, there was an agreement on a $9.5 billion (10.6 billion euros) price, but the Italian energy company and Vodafone renegotiated the price after Italy's antitrust authority last month approved the acquisition only on the grounds that Enel sell some of its power-generation assets.  Confirming the deal, Vodafone said it had made 410 million euros from its hedging operation in the markets to partly protect against any price cut which had been triggered by the market-related terms of the initial deal.

 Sanofi to Sell Ela Medical Unit 

 Sanofi-Synthelabo SA is selling its cardiology medical devices unit Ela Medical to Italian group Snia SpA for 140 million euros, it said. Ela Medical, which manufactures cardiac pacemakers and electrocardiogram recording devices, is a 100% subsidiary of Sanofi-Synthelabo, a French pharmaceuticals group based in Paris. It posted revenue of 127 million euros in 2000. The French group previously had said it would put the unit up for sale. The deal has been submitted for approval by competition authorities, Sanofi said.

 Investors urge C&W to justify four bln stg cash pile. 

 By Sonya Dowsett

(c) 2001 Reuters Limited

 LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Institutional investors are urging UK-based telecoms company Cable and Wireless Plc to identify acquisition targets fast - or hand back some of its 4.0 billion pound ($5.72 billion) cash pile to shareholders. 

 "So far, Cable & Wireless have done broadly the right things, and bought businesses in which they see long-term returns," said Iain Brown of Morley Investment Managers, which holds over two percent of C&W's shares. 

 "However, if they don't see anything that gives a return, we would expect them to give us money back." 

 Chief Executive Graham Wallace, who stunned the market with a profit warning last week, has always maintained that shareholders would rather the company use its cash for acquisitions than give it back. 

 But following the warning - which sent shares in the corporate communciations and Internet company into a tailspin - some investors say the company has until the end of the autumn to outline its acquisition plan. 

 "We are still willing for them to look at targets," said one of C&W's top 10 institutional investors. "But if after six months they have not spent to achieve above cost-of-capital returns, we would look for some of our money back." 

 C&W declined to say whether it was considering a share buyback or special dividend. Nor would the company say whether it had its eye on any potential acquisitions. 

 "We are not making any comment," one spokesman said. 

 Under Wallace, C&W has streamlined its businesses and turned itself into a pure corporate data and Internet company, and raised cash by selling mobile assets around the globe including other businesses, such as a majority stake in Hong Kong Telecom. 

 MAKING CASH WORK 

 Analysts estimate that the four billion pounds of cash on C&W's accounts and its weighty portfolio of shares in other companies make up about 360 pence of its stock price - a cash pile could well attract predators. With the stock currently nudging 450 pence, its lowest level for over three years, the Internet giant has a job on its hands to convince investors that sitting on the stash for the indefinite future is a good idea. 

 "Any company with large amounts of cash has to put forward a compelling case that it can do more with the money than the shareholders," said David Mannings, head of UK equities at Foreign & Colonial, which holds 0.5 percent of C&W's stock, according to Thomson Financial data. 

 Industry experts agree that the two-month period until the company reports in May is too short a timescale for C&W to outline an acquisition plan. 

 "The profit warning was only last week," said Paul Sharma, telecoms analyst at U.S. investment bank JP Morgan Chase. "(Investors) need to give C&W time to work out a strategy." "In the end it is the client's money you are holding, not yours, and if you can't get a return, it is good discipline to give it back," noted another fund manager. 

 BUYBACK OR DIVIDEND? 

 The jury is out on whether shareholders would prefer a share buyback or a special dividend. 

 "One of the things management is least good at is valuing its own shares," said one top-ten fund manager. 

 If C&W fails to draw up a strong acquisition plan within the next six months, one top fund manager even advocates the breaking up of the company. 

 "We need to have a long, in-depth chat with management on growth projects they want to spend money on," he told Reuters. "If they don't have a clear plan, we would expect all our money back, and a winding up of the company." 

 C&W said last Tuesday that profits would fall short of analysts' expectations and it would cut 4,000 jobs over the next 12 months. The company blamed a collapse in prices in the United States and Japan. 

 Its shares tumbled from 700 pence to 550 after the warning and on Monday closed down 0.33 percent at 454-1/2P. 

 The stock has underperformed its sector in the UK by around 25 percent over the past year.

 HOUSTON, March 19 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse First Boston on Monday cut its outlook for 2001 and 2002 earnings from electrical product and toolmaker Cooper Industries , after the company cut its first-quarter estimates on Friday due to a slowdown in orders. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Michael Regan in a research note cut his 2001 earnings estimate to $3.25 per share from $4.10 per share, and lowered his 2002 outlook to $3.85 per share from $4.50 per share. 

 Houston-based Cooper lowered its first-quarter earnings projections on Friday and said it might cut almost 6 percent of its labor force because of fewer orders from electronics and telecommunications companies amid the economic slowdown. 

 The company said it would earn about 60 cents per share in the first quarter vs. earlier projections for 89 cents per share, the same profit posted a year ago. 

 Regan said the earnings warning was troubling because the company told investors it was comfortable with estimates only two weeks ago. The severity of a decline in operating profit in the electrical segment suggests a drastic shift in the cyclical nature of Cooper's business, Regan added. He maintained his hold rating on the company's shares.

 LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Marconi Plc and Bookham Plc hit fresh lows on Monday as a profit warning from Corning Inc. , the world's biggest maker of fiber-optic cable, delivered the latest blow to prospects for the sector. 

 Telecoms equipment maker Marconi - also undercut by lowered earnings estimates from analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston - traded 25-1/2 pence or 6.5 percent lower at 366-1/2p, among the biggest decliners in a flat FTSE 100 index. 

 The stock dropped as low as 662p, a level not seen since December 1998. 

 Bookham, a fibre optics specialist, lost 11p or 3.3 percent to 320p, after falling as low as 304p - its lowest since flotation last April. 

 Corning said it expects its 2001 pro forma profits to fall below Wall Street forecasts because of slowing spending by its customers. 

 Earlier CSFB said it cut earnings estimates for Marconi to reflect its belief that calendar 2001 was the most challenging period for the industry. 

 For the current year CSFB cut estimated earnings before interest and tax to 792 million pounds from 885 million pounds, while for the following year it cut to 1.01 billion pounds from 1.10 billion - though the investment bank retained a "buy" rating and a 700 pence price target on the stock.

 Analysts Issue Mixed Views On IBM, But Keep Buy Ratings

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Investors unsure of how International Business Machines Corp.'s (IBM) business is tracking may even get more confused. 

 Two analysts, one at Salomon Smith Barney and another from Bear Stearns & Co, have issued different opinions on the tech bellwether. Yet each kept his buy rating. 

 On Friday, IBM saw its stock drop after computer consulting firm Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) lowered its revenue and earnings outlook and announced job cuts. 

 Following the warning, Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Thomas Kraemer issued negative comments on Big Blue, adding to the pressure. Shares of IBM finished Friday down 5.7% to $90.10. 

 But Monday brought along more research reports to stir up the mix. 

 Salomon Smith Barney analyst John Jones reiterated his earnings per share estimates on Big Blue. 

 Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Neff cut his earnings forecast and slashed his price target to between $115 and $125 a share from $150 and $160 a share. 

 Jones, who has said IBM is the "IT industry's Gold Standard," wrote in Monday's research note that the recent sell-off in IBM's stock represents a buying opportunity. 

 He attributed the share decline Friday to CSC's warnings. But the issues surrounding CSC are "largely company specific," he noted. 

 CSC on Friday blamed the profit warning on waning demand by global commercial customer. Many investors read that to mean IBM will face the same woes. 

 But Jones, who has a $135 price target on IBM,  said Monday that "we believe IBM's business is sound." 

 Jones said he disagrees with Merrill Lynch's comments Friday that demand for IBM's mainframe and AS/400 is slowing. 

 "On mainframes, our contacts indicate IBM's UNIX and mainframe business are doing well, benefiting from solid upgrade cycles," he said. "On AS/400's we expect a reasonable year and believe out competitor simply sees a seasonal decline (which we've modeled for 1Q as down 24%.)" 

 Jones reiterated his full-year 2001 view of $5 a share and 2002 forecast for earnings of $5.70 a share. 

 In a report issued Monday, Bear Stearns analyst Neff lowered his full-year 2001 EPS to $4.50 a share from $5 to reflect concerns about increasing signs of global weakness in many of Big Blue's business segments. He initiated a full- year 2002 estimate of $5.30 a share, compared with a Thomson Financial consensus of $5.58. 

 According to Neff, there is weakness in PCs, servers, services and "just about anything else that IBM is involved in as well as signs of weakness in international markets which represents 58% of IBM's revenues." 

 Neff noted that nearly 90% of IBM's revenue, which comes from services, mainframe, PC's, Unix servers and microelectronics, are at positive inflection points that should carry it into the third quarter of 2001. 

 Nevertheless, the analyst said there is a good chance that IBM could guide down expectations when it reports earnings on April 16. 

 Both analysts seemed to agree on the stock's rating. Neff left his buy rating unchanged and Jones also maintained his buy rating. 

 Neff said investors should own IBM for its "deep and broad technology portfolio, global reach, business decisiveness and a relatively high degree of earnings predicability." 

 Jones said IBM is "unmatched in its ability to translate leading research capability into an array of broad, deep and technologically superior offerings." 

 Shares of IBM recently traded up 0.4%, or 40 cents, at $90.50 on volume of 5 million. Average daily volume is 9.5 million. 

 An IBM official said the company does not comment on analysts' reports.

 IN THE MONEY: Silicon Valley Group Stock Hits A Road Bump

 A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

 VANCOUVER, Wa. -(Dow Jones)- Investors who are confident that they have found a safe harbor from the storm in shares of Silicon Valley Group Inc. (SVGI) should check their anchor lines. 

 Shares of the semiconductor equipment company have outperformed every competitor in the industry since October when ASM Lithography Holding N.V. (ASML) of The Netherlands announced it would acquire Silicon Valley Group in an all stock transaction valued then at $1.6 billion. Holders of Silicon Valley Group will receive 1.286 shares of ASM for every share of Silicon Valley Group that they own. 

 But after a profit warning Friday by ASM Lithography, shares of both companies plunged. Shares of ASM were down 12% to $20.25 and Silicon Valley Group shares fell 10.7% to $25.63. Doug Dunn, chief executive of ASM, said sales in 2001 could fall between 10% and 25% and in an extreme environment, perhaps revenues could decline from 10% to 50%. 

 Executives of both companies say the merger is still in place, but the value of the deal for Silicon Valley Group investors is headed down. 

 The two companies make lithography equipment, wafer steppers and chemical vapor deposition machinery - which is to say they make semiconductor manufacturing systems key to the next generation of 300mm wafers. Shares of ASM have traded down 40% and shares of Silicon Valley Group have traded up 28% since news of the deal broke in late September. That is a stellar performance for Silicon Valley Group investors considering that in the same time the Nasdaq has fallen about 48%. 

 Some Congressmen feared the deal might put key U.S. technology in foreign hands. But industry watchers say the companies have worked diligently to address the concerns and have probably paved the way around critics on Capitol Hill. At most the company may have to divest a small unit that makes optics for satellites, which would have little impact on the fortunes of the combined companies in the future and many expect the deal to close by mid-year. 

 But since the transaction is an all-stock deal, the price Silicon Valley Group investors receive for their shares depends on the fortunes of ASM's core business supplying DRAM makers and chip foundries with steppers and supplies. The merged companies may have an advantage in the market for the next generation of chip making devices, but in the near term both will trade lower because ASM's core business is weakening. 

 In October, when the merger was announced, chief executives of the two firms crowed that the lithography equipment market that they both serve would grow 30% annually to reach $7.7 billion by 2002. More sober assessments today say it will probably be closer to $6 billion. 

 "We see a 5% to 10% decline for the market in 2001, but there is an increasing possibility that it could go down double digits," says Klaus Rinnen, chief semiconductor equipment analyst for Gartner Dataquest in San Jose. Just five months ago, the market research firm had projected 20% growth in 2001, he says, "so it is a dramatic switch." 

 It's worth remembering, Rinnen adds, that in the last slump in the semiconductor manufacturing cycle from 1996-98, the units shipped fell to 695 from the peak of the cycle at 1,321. "A 40% decline in units is not uncommon when we get to the trough of the cycle," he says. 

 Against this background, there will be growing pressure on ASM shares despite the rosy prospects for its merger with Silicon Valley Group. After Friday's sell off, ASM trades at 27 times earnings, slightly above the 25 times earnings for the sector. Along with the sales decline, Dunn said he expects gross margins to shrink to between 35% and 40%, down from last year's 42.9%. 

 Add up the numbers and it appears likely that ASM expects to earn about $800 million U.S. in gross profit on about $2 billion in sales this year. Assuming ASM Chief Executive Dunn can hold spending on research and development to 11% of sales, and selling and administrative costs to 8% of sales, ASM could still generate about $480 million in pretax profit, or about $260 million after taking out the hefty Dutch tax bite of 47%. The result is that ASM may only earn about 60 to 70 cents a share this year, down from the 91 cents a share analysts expected earlier this week. 

 Earnings in that range could carry the stock down to between $16 and $19 a share - and that's assuming it maintains a price/earnings ratio of 27. If that multiple drops, as many in the high-tech business have been doing recently, the stock price could suffer more. 

 For investors in Silicon Valley Group, it means the merger that at one time would have paid them $37 a share, may only pay $20 to $24 a share by the time it closes. 

 A spokesman for ASM declined comment, but Papken Der Torossian, chief executive of Silicon Valley Group says the analysis is an "erroneous theory." 

 "Silicon Valley Group is adding a significant customer and technology base to the company and the chances for ASM Lithography to reach its previous highs are even better than before" the merger, he says. 

 ASM will be the third largest maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment in the world with the lead in the new generation of 0.13 micron circuits. Demand for older generations of equipment "will be subject to substantial downturn," he says, a fact that is already priced into valuations of both companies. "But three years out the roadmap is still in place." 

 It's the detour over the next 12 months that might put investors on some rough roads.

 Teradyne, the Boston-based test equipment and interconnection specialist, has put out a profit warning, and says it does not know how long the `downturn' will last. 

 George Chamillard, chairman and CEO, said: "The current economic environment has dramatically reduced demand for our customers' products. They therefore need fewer products and services from us. This is resulting in new order delays, as well as rescheduling and cancellation of some of our backlog. 

 "Our sales and earnings for the March quarter will therefore be lower than expected. Instead of a reduction in sales of around 20% from Q4's $789m, Teradyne now expects to see a reduction of 35%." 

 Unlike the majority of companies reporting profit warnings and revenue forecast downgrades, which have generally said they expect sales to return to normal levels in the second half, Teradyne made no such claim. 

 It has started to cut 1400 temporary jobs, implemented a company-wide hiring scheme, and delayed some capital spending plans.

 Yellow Corp. Sees 1Q Net Below Expectations

 OVERLAND PARK, Kan. -(Dow Jones)- Yellow Corp. (YELL) expects to report first quarter earnings that are below expectations because of a slowing economy and severe winter weather. 

 A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of five analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 36 cents a share for the first quarter. 

 For the 2000 first quarter, the company earned $10.5 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $882 million. 

 In a press release Monday, the holding company for Yellow Freight Systems said industrial production will be flat compared with that of first quarter 2000. 

 The company had expected first quarter industrial production to grow about 3% from the 6.3% in the year-ago quarter. 

 "We will still be solidly profitable for the quarter," said Bill Zollars, Yellow Corp.'s chairman, chief executive and president. 

 Yellow Corp. also expects tonnage to be down about 10% from a year ago. 

 The company reported that severe winter weather in February and March hurt operations. 

 Despite the profit warning, the company plans to add about 50 sales account managers in 2001. 

 Yellow Corp. reported that pricing yields remain strong and said with a modest improvement in the economy, the company will be well positioned to continue steadily improving profitability. 

 A Yellow Corp. spokesman was not immediately available to comment on whether the company planned to cut jobs. 

 Yellow Corp. joins other freight companies that lowered earnings expectations in recent months. 

 On March 9, USFreightways Corp. (USFC) announced that first quarter earnings would fall "substantially below" Wall Street estimates and said it planned to cut jobs. Like Yellow Corp., USFreightways cited a sluggish economy and severe weather as reasons for the projected decrease. 

 Last month, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT) reported that first quarter figures would trail expectations due to slower demand. 

 Also in February, Swift Transportation Co. (SWFT) announced that its first-quarter earnings wouldn't meet expectations because of softer demand for hauling goods. 

 Shares of Yellow Corp. closed Friday at $17.06, down 94 cents, or 5.2%, on Nasdaq volume of 208,600 shares. Average daily volume is 244,816 shares. 

 The company's shares hit a 52-week high of $24.69 Feb. 2 and a 52-week low of $13.81 in late June.

 Compaq Cuts Forecast On Profit, Plans Layoffs --- PC Maker Will  Cut  About 7% of Work Force

 Compaq Computer Corp. slashed its profit projection for the first quarter and set out a broad restructuring under which it will cut 7% of its full-time work force and combine corporate and home personal-computer operations.   

 The world's largest PC maker said "continued weakness" in U.S. sales and growing price pressures in its server-computer operation would slice about $500 million from its sales projection and drop operating profit for the quarter ending March 31 to below the year-earlier level.   

 Compaq now projects operating profit of between $215 million and $250 million, or 12 cents to 14 cents a diluted share, compared with $281 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Compaq said sales would be between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, below the $9.51 billion of a year earlier.   

 The restructuring will eliminate 5,000 full-time jobs and as much as 15% of its 24,500 temporary positions, according to Chief Executive Michael D. Capellas. The jobs are part of a consolidation of its PC units and shuttering of unspecified manufacturing operations. The restructuring will result in a charge to earnings of between $125 million and $150 million in the quarter ending March 31. The company also expects a gain of $120 million from the sale of a minority stake in Road Runner LLC, a Herndon, Virginia, high-speed Internet service.   

 The earnings warning and restructuring follows similar moves at an array of technology titans, including Cisco Systems Inc., Motorola Corp. and Intel Corp.   

 Compaq had earlier projected operating profit of $375 million, or 21 cents a share.   

 Separately, Jeff Clarke, the head of finance for the company's sales operation, was named chief financial officer. Mr. Clarke, 39 years old, will succeed Jesse J. Greene Jr., who is becoming senior vice president of strategic planning. Mr. Greene, 56, joined the company a year ago.   

 The cuts should lower the Houston company's costs by $500 million to $600 million a year. Compaq wouldn't detail cost-cutting plans, but said they include consolidation of manufacturing operations and elimination of some marketing operations. It plans to carry out the job cuts in the next four to six weeks.   

 Analysts cheered the moves to lower costs in light of aggressive price cutting by rival Dell Computer Corp., of Round Rock, Texas. "The competitive landscape is brutally tough, and Compaq needs to get the costs out," said Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Fortuna. Eric Rothdeutsch of Robertson Stephens Inc. added: "It brings (Compaq's) operating structure closer in line with Dell."   

 In a conference call with investors, Mr. Capellas said, "overall server demand is softening" in the U.S., and prices are falling across its PC and server-computer markets. While revenue in Europe and Asia continues to expand, "we can't believe it'll be unaffected" by the U.S. downturn, he said. In North America, PC sales are off "a good 12%" from year-earlier levels, Mr. Capellas said. In particular, home-PC sales, which slumped last year, "will be off pretty dramatically" this quarter, he said. PC sales to small and medium businesses are falling sharply, he added.   

 Compaq will consolidate PC operations under Senior Vice President Michael J. Larson, who had overseen home-PC operations. Michael Pocock, vice president of its corporate PC unit, has left the company, it said.   

 In contrast to its stance two months ago, Compaq now will respond to sharp price-cutting, particularly by Dell. In February, Dell cut 1,700 full-time employees as part of a plan to use pricing pressure to grab market share in PCs and server computers.   

 "You'll see us become far more aggressive on overall pricing," Mr. Capellas said.   

 In the wake of the warning, Compaq declined to project revenue or profit for the full year. Previously, it forecast revenue would grow 6% to 8% over the $42.38 billion of last year, and said operating earnings would rise between 20% and 25% over the 98 cents a share of last year.   

 "At this point, we are doing the things we will need to make this fit. I'm not making a definitive call on when the market will return," Mr. Capellas said.

                     OFF THE MARK



The Call:


 SG Cowen Securities analyst Moshe Katri was apparently of two minds about Computer Sciences (CSC) this week. 

 After news broke March 9 that IBM (IBM) was offering buyouts to employees in its Global Services unit, Katri revisited the companies in his universe - information-technology consultants like Electronic Data Systems (EDS) and Computer Sciences. In a note issued March 12, he said that such companies had been put under pressure by the suggestion of a slowdown in IBM's services unit. Moreover, the poor economic environment was slowing business at even the most prestigious strategy consultants, which were responding by discounting prices. 

 Since the trend was bound to have an impact on Computer Sciences' consulting practice, which accounts for 36% of sales, Katri cut his fiscal 2002 earnings estimates from $3.31 a share to $3.18. The company's projections of 16.4% revenue growth for its consulting businesses in fiscal 2002, he wrote, were "too aggressive." 

 Nevertheless, Katri maintained his enthusiasm for Computer Sciences shares. In fact, despite his estimated cuts, he called the shares, then trading at $55, a good value. "We are still expecting CSC to grow earnings at double-digit rates," wrote Katri. And the stock, off 43% from its 52-week high, remained "attractive." Demand for consulting services in Europe and Asia was "very strong," he noted, and offered a safe haven from the "soft" U.S. market. Thus he reiterated his Buy rating and set an ambitious $75 price target. 

 The Reality: 

 On March 16, Computer Sciences issued a massive profit warning. The El Segundo, Calif.-based company said earnings for the fourth quarter ending March 30 would fall to between 35 and 37 cents a share - missing analysts' consensus estimate by 60%. On top of that, all is not well in Europe, where "deteriorating overall demand" has caused the company's woes to become "more widespread." This environment, combined with "recent adverse margin performance," had caused Computer Sciences to revise its guidance. Investors, sensing despair at the company, instantly compounded it, sending the stock price down 40% to $32.70 by day's end. Which leaves Katri's note looking, well, too aggressive.

 Nokia sticks to its earnings forecast.

 NOKIA has defied the market-wide slowdown in the global telecoms industry by becoming the sole major mobile phone maker not to issue a profits warning, sending its shares soaring 13 per cent. 

 The world's largest mobile phone maker stuck to its first-quarter profits forecast of flat year-on-year earnings per share of 0.19, after rivals Ericsson and Motorola jolted stock markets by trimming their expectations. 

 But Nokia admitted it was not immune to reduced global demand for mobile phones, announcing a reduction in its first-quarter sales growth forecast amid an economic slowdown in the United States. 

 Nokia's huge economies of scale and focus on the inexpensive segment of mobile phones - which accounts for two-thirds of total market sales - allowed the company to make profits on cheap phones, something rivals are failing to do. 

 "Despite the more difficult market conditions, we have been able to show good progress," said chief executive Jorma Ollila, after intense pressure from the market to clarify its earnings outlook amid rumours that it too was to issue a profit warning. 

 "We expect to see solid growth for the first quarter as a whole, with better than anticipated margins." Ollila added. 

 On Monday, arch-rival Ericsson, the world's third-largest mobile phone maker and leading mobile network producer, warned it would post a first-quarter loss of four to five billion Swedish crowns ($400-500 million). 

 Last month, Motorola, the second largest mobile phone maker, warned that a dramatic sales slowdown could lead to its first quarterly operating loss in 15 years. 

 It has also announced plans to slash 7,000 jobs from its handset division. 

 Nokia shares closed 13.2 per cent higher at 27.79 in Helsinki, still significantly off a June life-high of 65. On Wall Street Nokia was up 15 per cent. 

 Ollila said more difficult market conditions had prompted the company to cut its first-quarter sales growth forecast to about 20 per cent from an earlier estimate of 25 to 30 per cent. This meant Nokia was likely to post first-quarter sales of some 7.85 billion. 

 Nokia also cut its sales growth target in its key mobile phone division to 15-20 per cent from an earlier 25 per cent. 

 The group warned, however, that first quarter estimates were subject to market developments in the final weeks of this quarter. Nokia, like its competitors, has seen its share price tumble in the last 12 months amid fears of a US recession, slowing demand in the mobile phone market and a change in sentiment about the future for wireless telecommunications, especially as operators delay the introduction of new faster mobile services. 

 In January, the company said it expected first-half revenue growth in the upper range of 25-35 per cent. 

 At that time it also reiterated a revenue growth target of 25 to 35 per cent for 2001 through 2003, with "continuing high profitability". "I have a lot of optimism in the way our product portfolio will impact our revenue when we go towards the Christmas season and how the year 2002 shapes up when we will move towards the third generation, which will be the next evolutionary step," Ollila said. 

 Nokia said in January it expected handset operating margins to top 20 per cent by the last quarter of this year. 

 Nokia - which has the industry's highest handset operating margins - had been the last of the big cellphone makers to cut industry-wide mobile phone sales growth forecasts this year, down to 450-500 million units from 500-550 million. 

 Nokia said it had aggressively gained market share in the first quarter from its greater than 32 per cent share in 2000. 

 This would most likely have been done at the expense of nearest rivals Motorola and Ericsson, which have already said they were facing increased price pressure and competition.

 U.S. stocks slip, Street battles profit, rate woes.

 NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Stocks slumped in midday trading on Friday, pushing the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 to their lowest levels in more than two years, after a surprise rise in consumer sentiment cast doubt on a jumbo interest-rate cut to revitalize the nation's flagging economy. 

 "People are looking for ammunition for an aggressive Fed rate cut. It's not there," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets. 

 U.S. consumer sentiment edged up unexpectedly in March, after three months of sharp declines. The rise reined in market hopes for a steep 75-basis-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve at its policy-setting meeting on Tuesday. 

 Compaq Computer Corp., the world's No. 1 personal computer maker and Oracle Corp., the No. 2 software maker, added to the cautious mood by forecasting disappointing earnings in the economic downturn. 

 The technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index fell 21.93 points, or 1.13 percent, to 1,918.78, after dropping more than 3 percent earlier. The index hit an intraday low unseen since November 1998. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 51.61 points, or 0.51 percent, to 9,979.67. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 8.96 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,164.60, hitting its lowest level since mid-December 1998. 

 Wall Street has been severely bloodied this week as Japan's troubled banking sector, a sagging U.S. economy and soft corporate profits sparked a furious sell-off that pushed the Dow below 10,000 points for the first time since last October. 

 Triple witching - when contracts for stock index futures, stock index options and stock options all expire on the same day - could make the markets more volatile than usual on Friday. 

 The University of Michigan's closely watched preliminary consumer sentiment index, which gives an early read on the attitudes of consumers in the first weeks of the month, rose to 91.8 from 90.6 in February. Economists had expected the index to fall to 89.5. 

 "It's the good news/bad news scenario," said Peter Coolidge, managing director of equity trading at Brean Murray & Co. "We need this consumer confidence to start getting to a bottom in this economic slowdown, but the bad news is that in the short term it would make the Fed more likely to cut less than more." 

 Key inflation numbers before the opening bell had lifted hopes for a 75-basis-point cut. Wholesale prices barely rose in February, the government said in a report that signaled inflation was contained and could give Federal Reserve policy-makers comfort as they weigh rate cuts on Tuesday. 

 The Labor Department said February's Producer Price Index rose 0.1 percent, slightly above Wall Street's forecast for an unchanged reading after January's 1.1 percent jump. The core rate, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell 0.3 percent. Wall Street had expected an unchanged reading. 

 "The PPI is a friendly number, but the market is not weighing it too heavily because there are much bigger issues at work in the market," including warnings about earnings from corporations, said Tony Richards, managing director at Brinson Partners. 

 Compaq eked out a gain of 47 cents to $18.97 on the New York Stock Exchange after earlier weakness. The company warned its earnings would fall short of expectations amid a PC price war and a softening U.S. economy, and said it will cut about 5,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force, in a bid to slash costs. 

 Oracle slipped 5/16 to $14-3/8 on the Nasdaq. The company said it was too difficult to pin down a forecast in its key fourth quarter, but said earnings may be flat. 

 Computer Sciences Corp., the world's third-largest supplier of computer services, plunged $17.85 to $36.25 after warning that earnings would be only one-third of Wall Street hopes, as profit margins have eroded sharply. 

 Nuance Communications Inc. tumbled $7-3/4 to $9-3/4 after the speech-recognition software maker warned of disappointing first-quarter earnings in the economic slowdown. Rival SpeechWorks International Inc. dropped $3-13/16 to $8-1/2.

 NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Stocks slumped in late morning trading on Friday, pushing the Nasdaq market to its lowest level since November 1998, after a surprise rise in consumer sentiment reined in hopes for a jumbo interest-rate cut to invigorate the nation's soft economy. 

 "The fact that consumer confidence is up raises the question of how aggressive the Fed is going to be and that's what is hitting the markets," said Donald Berdine, chief investment officer at PNC Advisors. 

 U.S. consumer sentiment edged up unexpectedly in March, after three months of sharp declines. The rise damped investors' hopes for a steep 75-basis-point cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve at its policy-setting meeting on Tuesday. 

 Compaq Computer Corp., the world's No. 1 personal computer maker, and Oracle Corp., the No. 2 software maker, added to the sour mood by forecasting disappointing earnings in the economic downturn. Compaq slipped 25 cents to $18.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Oracle dipped 11/16 to $14 on the Nasdaq.

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 132.72 points, or 1.32 percent, to 9,898.56. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 16.86 points, or 1.44 percent, to 1,156.70, hitting its lowest level since mid-December 1998.

 U.S. stocks seen off to soft start, but key data looms.

 NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are expected to open flat to a touch lower on Friday as investors juggle hopes for a jumbo interest-rate cut to invigorate the nation's sputtering economy with dim growth outlooks from bellwethers Compaq Computer Corp. and Oracle Corp. . 

 "If everything remains as it is now then we will have basically a flat opening," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co., warning that economic data due before the opening bell could shift investor sentiment. "To a certain extent the market has discounted these profit warnings. After all, we have been selling stocks for 17 months now." 

 Compaq, the world's No. 1 personal computer maker, and Oracle, the world's No. 2 software maker, forecast disappointing quarterly earnings and pointed to the soft U.S. economy as the culprit. Compaq slid to $18 in pre-market trading from Thursday's close of $18.50, while Oracle dipped to $14 from its finish of $14-11/16 in the prior session. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark fed funds rate by at least half a point at Tuesday's policy-setting meeting from the current 5.50 percent to lift the economy. But many investors are hoping the central bank will slash rates by three-quarters of a point as consumer confidence spirals downward. 

 Wall Street is bracing for a rocky session. A slew of economic reports that may help shed light on the Fed's next move are set to be released on triple-witching Friday. Triple witching, when contracts for stock index futures, stock index options and stock options all expire on the same day, can make the markets more volatile than usual. 

 With more than an hour to go before the opening bell, Standard & Poor's 500 index futures for June edged down 0.70 points at 1,184.00. Nasdaq 100 index futures shed 7 points to 1,708, pointing to a modest decline of 0.4 percent at the open. The Dow Jones Industrial futures lost 30 points to 10,075. 

 Technology shares knocked Europe's bourses again on Friday, as investors weathered earnings warnings from both Europe and the U.S. - and the prospect of more to come. The pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300 was down 1.5 percent and the blue-chip DJ Stoxx 50 shed 1 percent. 

 But Tokyo stocks closed higher for a second straight day on Friday, led by strong rebounds in finance stocks on expectations of easier monetary policy and a speedier cleanup of banks' bad loan mess. The benchmark Nikkei average closed up 80.15 points or 0.66 percent at 12,232.98. 

 In what could be the most important economic report of Friday's session, the University of Michigan, due at 10 a.m EST (1500 GMT) is expected to show another drop in its consumer sentiment index for March after notching its steepest three-month decline since the last recession in the December-February period. A further drop in sentiment could bolster the case for steep rate cuts. 

 Economists in a Reuters poll expected, on average, that sentiment dropped to 89.5 from 90.6 in February, while individual forecasts for the index went as low as 85. 

 Analysts said the producer price index (PPI) for February, due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), which measures price inflation at the wholesale level, had the potential to hurt the market after a surprise 1.1 percent surge in January. 

 Economists expected the February PPI to be tame, however, unchanged from January's reading. Excluding food and energy prices, the PPI is also expected to be unchanged. 

 February housing starts, due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), are expected to fall to 1.607 million on an annualized basis, compared with 1.651 million in January. Building permits were forecast down to 1.587 million until from 1.724 million in January. 

 And in a separate report at 9:15 a.m EST (1415 GMT), the Fed is expected to show a 0.4 percent dip in February industrial production, compared with a 0.3 percent rise in the prior month. 

 In corporate news, Compaq warned after the close that its first-quarter earnings would fall short of expectations amid a PC price war and a softening U.S. economy, and said it will cut about 5,000 jobs, or 7 percent of its work force, in a bid to slash costs. 

 Oracle said the weakening economy hit database and application software sales in the last quarter, and that it expects the U.S. economy will continue to erode. The company said it was too difficult to pin down a forecast in its key fourth quarter, but said earnings may be flat. 

 Computer Sciences Corp. , the third-largest supplier of computer services, said on Friday before the open that its financial results would fall sharply below Wall Street hopes and that it planned to cut 700 to 900 jobs. 

 Publishing software developer Adobe Systems Inc. met its first-quarter profit target and said on Thursday after the close sales picked up in February, but it cut its sales forecast, cautioning U.S. economic weakness could spread abroad. 

 In other news, OPEC producers met on Friday to restrain exports for the second time this year and appeared ready to slice supplies at the top end of expectations. Insiders said mounting concerns about failing petroleum demand and this week's fall in oil prices meant the group might push through a cut at 1 million barrels daily or more - tougher action than had been anticipated. 

 Higher energy prices have capped consumer spending and eaten into corporate profits, adding further pressure to the stock market.

 Compaq Warns On Its Results, Plans Layoffs

 Corrections & Amplifications 

 AS PART OF A RESTRUCTURING at Compaq Computer Corp., Michael Pocock has been named vice president of corporate strategy. An article Friday about the company's warning on first-quarter results incorrectly said that Mr. Pocock, who has led Compaq's corporate PC business, left the company. (WSJ March 19, 2001) 

 Compaq Computer Corp. slashed its profit projection for the first quarter and set a broad restructuring under which it will cut 7% of its full-time work force and combine corporate and home personal-computer operations. 

 The world's largest PC maker said "continued weakness" in U.S. sales and growing price pressures in its server-computer operation would slice about $500 million from its sales projection and drop operating profit for the quarter ending March 31 to below the year-earlier level. 

 Compaq now projects operating profit of between $215 million and $250 million, or 12 cents to 14 cents a diluted share, compared with $281 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Compaq said sales would be between $9 billion and $9.2 billion, below the $9.51 billion of a year earlier. 

 The restructuring will eliminate 5,000 full-time jobs and as much as 15% of its 24,500 temporary positions, according to Chief Executive Michael D. Capellas. The jobs are part of a consolidation of its PC units and shuttering of unspecified manufacturing operations. The restructuring will result in a charge to earnings of between $125 million and $150 million in the quarter ending March 31. The company also expects a gain of $120 million from the sale of a minority stake in Road Runner LLC, a Herndon, Va., high-speed Internet service. 

 The earnings warning and restructuring follows similar moves at an array of technology titans, including Cisco Systems Inc., Motorola Corp. and Intel Corp. Compaq, which had projected operating profit of $375 million, or 21 cents a share, declined to provide a new outlook. 

 Compaq shares edged up to $18.89 in after-hours trading following the announcement. As of 4 p.m., the stock had risen 15 cents to $18.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

 Separately, Jeff Clarke, the head of finance for the company's sales operation, was named chief financial officer. Mr. Clarke, 39 years old, will succeed Jesse J. Greene Jr., who is becoming senior vice president of strategic planning. Mr. Greene, 56, joined the company a year ago. 

 The cuts should lower the Houston company's costs by $500 million to $600 million a year. Compaq wouldn't detail cost-cutting plans, but said they include consolidation of manufacturing operations and elimination of some marketing operations. It plans to carry out the job cuts in the next four to six weeks. 

 Analysts cheered the moves to lower costs in light of aggressive price cutting by rival Dell Computer Corp., Round Rock, Texas. "The competitive landscape is brutally tough, and Compaq needs to get the costs out," said Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Fortuna. Eric Rothdeutsch of Robertson Stephens Inc. added: "It brings [Compaq's] operating structure closer in line with Dell." 

 In a conference call with investors, Mr. Capellas said "overall server demand is softening" in the U.S., and prices are falling across its PC and server-computer markets. While revenue in Europe and Asia continues to expand, "we can't believe it'll be unaffected" by the U.S. downturn, he said. In North America, PC sales are off "a good 12%" from year-earlier levels, Mr. Capellas said. In particular, home-PC sales, which slumped last year, "will be off pretty dramatically" this quarter, he said. PC sales to small and medium businesses are falling off sharply, he added. 

 Compaq will consolidate PC operations under Senior Vice President Michael J. Larson, who had overseen home-PC operations. Michael Pocock, vice president of its corporate PC unit, has left the company, it said. 

 In contrast to its stance two months ago, Compaq will now respond to sharp price-cutting, particularly by Dell. In February, Dell cut 1,700 full-time employees as part of a plan to use pricing pressure to grab market share in PCs and server computers. 

 "You'll see us become far more aggressive on overall pricing," Mr. Capellas said. 

 In the wake of the warning, Compaq declined to project revenue or profit for the full year. Previously, it forecast revenue would grow 6% to 8% over the $42.38 billion of last year, and said operating earnings would rise between 20% and 25% over the 98 cents a share of last year. 

 "At this point, we are doing the things we will need to make this fit. I'm not making a definitive call on when the market will return," Mr. Capellas said.

 Smurfit shares fall on earnings warning.

 Shares in packaging group Jefferson Smurfit have fallen to their lowest level for nine months after the group's US associate, the 29.4 per cent-owned Smurfit Stone, warned that first-quarter earnings would be well below market expectations. 

 Market sources in Dublin were taken aback by the scale of the selling of Smurfit shares yesterday, as Smurfit Stone had recovered from initial selling on Wednesday after chief executive Mr Ray Curran gave the profits warning at the Morgan Stanley paper conference in New York. The profit warning was given 45 minutes before New York markets closed on Wednesday and provoked some initial selling, which saw Smurfit Stone shares fall about $1 (P1.1) to $12. But market relief that the profit warning was not due to weakness in product pricing but because of downtime led to a recovery before the Wednesday close. 

 That did not prevent the Dublin market yesterday being hit by a wave of selling of Smurfit shares. By the close, 5.2 million shares had traded as the stock closed down 15 cents on P1.82. "Some people seem to have simply lost patience with Smurfit and just dumped the stock," said one market source. He added that the selling had been overdone given the modest reaction on the New York market. Smurfit Stone shares traded marginally lower as the US market continued to react relatively benignly to the warning. At the Morgan Stanley conference, Mr Curran said corrugated demand had been sluggish from mid-December through February and, as a result, Smurfit Stone expected downtime in the first quarter would be higher than the 214,000 tonnes of downtime taken in the fourth quarter of 2000. 

 Significantly, Mr Curran added that, despite the poor demand, product pricing remained stable after the $15 a ton cut in containerboard prices in January. All of this meant that earnings in the first quarter would be significantly below the $0.15 a share consensus estimates, he said. Mr Curran's comments were reinforced yesterday by official figures, which showed that containerboard production in the US in January and February was down 10.6 per cent on the same period in 2000, while the operating rate in the industry was 86.4 per cent of capacity compared to 95.4 per cent in January-February 2000. In addition, box shipments fell 8.7 per cent in February, bringing the fall in shipments for the year to date to 3.4 per cent. 

 Despite the weakness in the US economy and the resulting fall in demands from industry for packaging, analysts are confident the new-found discipline in the industry will maintain prices close to the current $475 a ton for containerboard. The willingness of the US producers to take downtime and hold product inventories at the minimum level would be the key to maintaining product prices in the difficult months ahead, said one analyst. 

 Smurfit's Irish broker, Davy, which has been the most conservative in its earnings forecasts for the group, said it did not expect any major downgrading from its current 2001 forecast of 22.8 cents per share. Other analysts were less positive and ABN Amro has pulled its 2001 earnings forecast back to 20.4 cents. In Smurfit Stone's case, Lehman Brothers has slashed its 2001 earnings forecast from $0.45 to $0.25 per share and its 2002 forecast from $1.90 to $1.75 a share.

company.)

AMSTERDAM -(Dow Jones)- Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASM
Lithography NV (ASML) issued a profit warning Friday, saying that weaker
demand for lithography tools will hurt its 2001 results.


 But it also said it expects this negative trend to reverse next year. 

 It was the second time this week that a European semiconductor company has issued a warning. On Tuesday, Siemens AG (SI) said it won't meet sales and profit forecasts for fiscal 2001 because of weakness in its Infineon semiconductor unit. 

 ASML said shipments in 2001 won't exceed the 368 units, including 38 used and refurbished machines, sold in 2000. It had expected to run at full capacity of 400 to 440 machines. 

 However, ASML now expects sales of the systems in 2000 to fall somewhere between 10% and 25% as demand for semiconductor equipment has weakened substantially. This means the number of systems sold in 2001 should be between 276 and 331. 

 Chief Executive Doug Dunn said much will depend on ASML's fourth quarter. 

 "The first quarter looked pretty weak and the orders are in for the second and third quarter, they look weak too," Dunn said during a conference call. He added the low end of a 10% decrease is based on an uptick in the fourth quarter. 

 The group's gross margins should be between 35% to 40%, depending on the fourth quarter, from last year's 42.9%, excluding the sale of used and refurbished machines. 

 Dunn said the slowdown became apparent in January as customers began adjusting their capacity requirements. He said there is now a second wave of reductions, which became apparent in the past two weeks. 

 However, Dunn said he expects the negative trend to reverse "substantially" in 2002 as orders are deferred from this year and pushed forward. 

 ASML said the developments spurred it to put programs in place to control capital and discretionary spending. 

 To lower costs, ASML will also implement a hiring freeze in many areas and would only hire people on a "very limited basis in business critical areas." 

 But SNS Securities said ASML will have a tough time curtailing spending because it was planning for a 15% to 20% increase in production. 

 The warning didn't come as a surprise following the recent profit grumblings in the semiconductor sector, and many analysts had already adjusted expectations. But analyst Philip Scholte with Van der Hoop Effectenbank said the severity was a shock. 

 "This is a serious reduction," Scholte said. However, he added he will likely keep ASML at outperform after recently downgrading them from a buy. 

 "In the long-term, this is a great company, a core holding chip that is currently feeling the impact of a turning cycle," Scholte said. 

 ASML said it wouldn't cut in its R&D program as it expects the semiconductor market to show "substantial growth" in the coming years. 

 ASML makes lithography systems that are used top map out the circuitry of semiconductor chips. 

 ASML's shares plunged on Euronext Amsterdam. At 1510 GMT, they were at EUR23.00, down EUR3.20, or 12%. 

 In its wake was Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHG), with its cash cow semiconductor division. Philips was down EUR1.77, or 5.1%, to EUR332.90.

 AMSTERDAM (Dow Jones)--Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography NV (ASML) expects the current downward trend in the semiconductor sector to reverse "very substantially" in 2002, Chief Executive Doug Dunn said during a conference call Friday. 

 The trend caused ASML to issue a profit warning earlier Friday as it realized that demand is weakening. It warned that sales in 2001 could fall anywhere between 10% and 25%. 

 "It is a wide range and if all extremes are included it could also be a 10% to 50% range," Dunn said. 


"How much the decline will be will depend almost totally on the fourth
quarter," Dunn said adding that orders for the second and third quarters
are in and these quarters look "pretty weak."
- - 16/03/01 14-28G



An improvement in the fourth quarter could bring the drop in sales to
the lower end of the range, he said.



ASML had already said earnings per share and net profit would most
likely be below the levels posted in 2000 as a result of falling demand.



In 2000, earnings per share was EUR0.83, net profit was EUR347
million, and sales were EUR2.18 billion.



Gross margins in 2001 should be between 35% and 40%, chief financial
officer Peter Wennink said. In 2000, the gross margin was 42.9%,
excluding the sale of used and refurbished machines.

 AMSTERDAM -(Dow Jones)- Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography NV (ASML) issued a profit warning Friday, saying that weaker demand for lithography tools will hurt its 2001 results. 

 It is the second time this week that a European semiconductor company has issued a warning. On Tuesday, Siemens AG (SI) said it won't meet sales and profit forecasts for fiscal 2001 because of weakness in its Infineon semiconductor unit. 

 ASML said shipments in 2001 won't exceed the 368 units made in 2000. It had expected to run at full capacity of 400 to 440 machines. 

 "The most recent forecasts of semiconductor equipment requirements for this year indicate a decline compared with last year in the range of 10% to 25%," Chief Executive Doug Dunn said in a statement. 

 He declined to specify where in this range the impact would be on ASML, but analysts said as the world's second-largest company in its sector the effect on the company would likely be closer to low end. 

 "They have outperformed the market in the past," Julius Bear analyst Maarten Verbeek said. 

 Dunn said the slowdown became apparent in January as customers began adjusting their capacity requirements. And he said there is now a second wave of reductions. 

 ASML said the developments spurred it to put programs in place to control capital and discretionary spending. How much money it hopes to save isn't clear. However, more light might be shed on this during a conference call at 1400 GMT. 

 To lower costs, ASML will also implement a hiring freeze in many areas and would only hire people on a "very limited basis in business critical areas." It also hinted it might reduce staff, saying it would was "closely monitoring its personnel status." 

 But SNS Securities said ASML will have a tough time curtailing spending because it was planning for a 15% to 20% increase in production. 

 The warning didn't come as a surprise following the recent profit grumblings in the semiconductor sector, and many analysts had already adjusted expectations. But analyst Philip Scholte with Van der Hoop Effectenbank said the severity has a shock. 

 "This is a serious reduction," Scholte said. However, he added he will likely keep ASML at outperform after recently downgrading them from a buy. "In the long-term, this is a great company, a core holding chip that is currently feeling the impact of a turning cycle," Scholte said. 

 ASML said it wouldn't cut in its R&D program as it expects the semiconductor market to show "substantial growth" in the coming years. 

 ASML makes lithography systems that are used top map out the circuitry of semiconductor chips. 

 ASML's shares plunged on Euronext Amsterdam. At 1100 GMT, they were EUR23.25, down EUR2.85, or 11%. But the drop seems to be over. 

 In its wake was Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHG), with its cash cow semiconductor division. Philips had lost EUR1.52, or 4.4%, to EUR33.15.

 Borders Group To Slow Store Openings In 2001

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Borders Group Inc. (BGP) on Friday said it expects to post a fiscal first-quarter gain despite analysts' expectations of a 1 cent a share loss. 

 The company expects earnings of 1 cent a share for the period ending in April. 

 But the country's No. 2 bookseller said the second quarter will be "challenging" amid weak consumer spending, with earnings expected in the "low end" of a previously projected 1- to 2-cent range. 

 Earnings in the third quarter are expected to improve "by several cents." The outlook for the year is projected at $1.38 to $1.40 a share, which represents a growth rate of 15%. 

 The analyst consensus had pegged the company's fiscal 2002 outlook at $1.36 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 An agreement with Ingram Book Group this year will contribute 2 cents a share to earnings this year, and 4 cents a share to earnings in 2002, Borders said. 

 The pact will help Borders cut losses associated with book-and-music deliveries to customers of its on-line operation to 15 cents from 23 cents a share last year. But the alliance will result in a one-time charge of $15 million to $20 million for the first quarter. 

 The Ann Arbor, Mich., company, which operates Borders superstores, Borders.com and Waldenbooks, said it will "continue exploration of potential partnerships to help reduce losses in the direct-to-consumer portion of its on-line business." 

 Net income as a percentage of sales, recorded at 3% last year, is expected to improve this year at Borders through the new distribution efficiencies, as well as slowed growth and reduced spending. The company said it will reduce capital expenditures this year to $110 million from $141 million. 

 The company will only open 25 to 30 new Borders stores in the U.S. this year, a slower rate than last year, and five to seven international stores. The company, which currently operates 335 Borders stores, still expects to open about 200 new stores by 2005. 

 The company will also drastically reduce spending this year on its 869 Waldenbooks stores, which have been underperforming. As it renegotiates rents and scales back renovations at Waldenbooks, Borders will open only four to five new Waldenbooks locations, and close about 40. 

 "The trend of closing should soften a little as we move ahead, but not entirely," President and Chief Executive Greg Josefowicz told analysts during the conference call on fourth-quarter earnings. "We don't have very high performance expectations (for Waldenbooks), and hope to hold on on the (same-store) sales side." 

 The company expects to see same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be flat to -1% this year at Waldenbooks, compared to -2.9% last year. 

 Borders sees that shrinkage offset by 3% to 4% same-store sales growth at its superstores. 

 The company posted fourth-quarter results of $1.23 a share, excluding charges. That figure was in line with the year-earlier results, and beat expectations by one cent. But those expectations had been reduced after a January profit warning that cited slow holiday sales. 

 Charges were related to its All Wound Up toy business, a part of the Waldenbooks unit which it is shutting down. Including the charges, the company earned 64 cents in the fourth quarter. 

 While the company doesn't expect its dot-com operations to drive profitability this year, book sales are still seen strong, with strong momentum already seen in the first six weeks of the new year expected to continue. 

 Although price inflation in books is expected to continue at last year's rate, that shouldn't compromise sales figures, Chief Financial Officer Ed Wilhelm said. 

 In addition to overall improvements in same-store sales, the company expects selling, administrative and general expenses to improve in the second half of the year as expenses related to a lawsuit

 N.Y. Stocks Vanquished Again; DJIA Sinks 2%

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The carnage continued for market averages in Friday's trading session, turning a dismal week into a record-setting run of futility. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average absorbed a 207.87-point setback, falling 2.07% to 9823.41 and bringing its loss for the week to a total of 821.21 points. That eclipsed the 805.71 point-drop recorded in the week ending April 14 last year, and took over the top spot in the list of one-week point losses. 

 Once again, the steepest losses were suffered by the high-technology sector, where deteriorating profits continued to drag on prices. Shares of computer maker International Business Machines lost $5.46 to fall to $90.10, while Hewlett-Packard sank 2.60 to 28.10, after another PC manufacturer, Compaq Computer, served up a profit warning. Compaq shares lost 50 cents to 18. 

 The rest of technology suffered, as well, as the companies that supply parts and services to PC makers met with more setbacks. Shares of chip maker Micron Technology lost 1.25 to 40.05, while manufacturing service providers, such as Jabil Circuit, which shrank 1.70 to 19, and Solectron, which lost 1.19 to 20.10, and fell to a 52-week low, all got punished in the spillover. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index posted a decline of 49.72, falling 2.56%, to sink to 1890.99, its worst finish since Nov. 17, 1998. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 992 issues advancing, 2,056 declining and 227 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,543,558,930 shares, compared with 1,220,106,870 Thursday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 587.66, down 11.19. The average price per share fell 67 cents. 

 The shortcomings for the Dow weren't limited to the technology sector. A host of economically sensitive stocks withered, as investors continued to debate what action the Federal Reserve would take next week to stimulate the economy, after data released Friday indicated growth already has reignited. 

 "Inflationary pressures remain absent, and there is some evidence of the beginning of deflation pressure in the economy," Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, said in a report Friday. 

 Shares of United Technologies fell 4.32 to 71.43, while Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing lost 3.23 to 106.01, and Boeing tumbled 2.35 to 53.75. 

 Growth stocks, another group tied to economic conditions, also weakened in the session. Drug makers Merck, which fell 2.60 to 71.45, and Eli Lilly, which shed 1.30 to 74.44, declined, while DaimlerChrysler fell 1.34 to 45.52, and Home Depot moved down 94 cents to 42.26. 

 On the other hand, some consumer names, which generally don't have the same exposure to economic conditions, managed to persevere. Philip Morris gained 89 cents to 48.15, while Coca-Cola advanced 1 to 48.65, and Hershey Foods advanced 90 cents to 66.10. 

 However, the Dow industrial average sank to its lowest close in nearly two years; the last time it finished this low came March 31, 1999. 

 For the Nasdaq composite, its 7.88% decline for the week ranked as its 12th worst one-week percentage decline; the index fell a total of 161.79 points on the week. 

 Shares of Adobe managed to post a gain, rising 3.63 to 28.63 on Nasdaq. The San Jose, Calif., computer software developer reported fiscal first-quarter profits late Thursday that beat expectations, though it lowered its revenue projections for the current quarter. Analysts responded affirmatively to the results, with Credit Suisse First Boston raising its rating, saying that the risk/reward prospects are favorable. 

 Shares of database software developer Oracle lost 63 cents, falling to 14.06 on Nasdaq, and setting a 52-week low. The company reported disappointing results after the close of trading Thursday, and added that its current quarter could also come up short. 

 ASM Lithography fell 2.75 to 20.25 on Nasdaq. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker warned that weakness in the demand for its lithography tools will hurt its 2001 results. 

 Andrx gained 4.20 to 43.52 on Nasdaq. The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., pharmaceuticals maker, which fell 21% Thursday on worries about delays in the approval of its generic version of a popular ulcer drug, recovered on some upbeat comments from Merrill Lynch. The firm said the stock's price presumed a worst-case scenario for delay of the necessary approvals. 

 Williams-Sonoma fell 1.64 to 27.87. The San Francisco specialty retailer said Gary Friedman, its president and chief operating officer, resigned to pursue other opportunities.

 EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) _ Computer Sciences Corp. plans to cut 700 to 900 jobs, or about one per cent of its global workforce, and said it will miss earnings forecasts by a wide margin this quarter. 

 The company blamed reduced demand for traditional information technology consulting as the effects of a slowing economy continued to spread across the tech spectrum. CSC's stock price tumbled 39 per cent. 

 The company said the worldwide economic environment, as well as the demand for consulting and systems integration services, has deteriorated, part of a ripple effect that is hurting CSC customers first and trickling into other parts of the market. 

 It was the latest in a series of recent earnings warnings from technology concerns including Compaq Computer Corp., Oracle Corp. Gateway Inc. and Dell Computer Corp. 

 For its fourth quarter ending March 30, Computer Sciences said Friday it expects to earn 35 to 37 cents US a share on revenue growth of 11 to 13 per cent. 

 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected earnings of about 92 cents a share for the quarter. 

 For the fiscal year, the company said it expected revenue growth in the 13 per cent to 15 per cent range and earnings per share in the $2.50 to $2.60 range. 

 In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Computer Sciences shares were down $21.10 at $33. 

 The job cuts are part of a restructuring plan that will result in a fourth quarter charge of $100 million to $150 million, in addition to further charges associated with its acquisition of Mynd Corp. 

 Computer Sciences Corp., in operation since 1959, is one of the world's leading consulting and information technology services firms. It has more than 68,000 employees worldwide with revenue of $10.2 billion last year. 

 HL:Dutch technology company ASM Lithography issues profit warning

 AMSTERDAM (AP) _ Technology equipment maker ASM Lithography said Friday its profit this year will fall short of expectations on unexpectedly weak demand for its products, which are used to map the circuitry of semiconductor chips. 

 ASML did not give a precise earnings forecast, but said a slump in demand has led to overcapacity at production sites. 

 Its shares sank 12.2 per cent in trading in Amsterdam, leading the tech sector lower. 

 Chief executive Doug Dunn said recent forecasts are that semiconductor equipment demand will fall 10 to 25 per cent from a year ago. He said ASML's customers, the world's leading computer chip producers, had slowed their production in January. 

 ASML said it didn't plan to cut spending on research and development, but had already frozen hiring. Despite the poor short-term outlook, ASML said the market will show ``substantial growth'' in coming years. 

 HL:WebMD, Quintiles Transnational settle dispute over electronic health data 

 RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) _ Quintiles Transnational and WebMD are ending their legal battle over electronic health data. 

 WebMD, citing patient privacy concerns, in February reduced the amount and type of data it sent to Quintiles, which repackages the data from medical and pharmacy claims for sale to drug companies. 

 Durham-based Quintiles insisted that WebMD, based in Elmwood Park, N.J., is obligated to send the data under a deal made last year. 

 At a hearing, WebMD told Chief U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle that the parties had reached an agreement to settle the dispute. 

 WebMD lawyer Richard Ellis said the company's concerns over whether it was violating state privacy laws were allayed when Quintiles agreed to make patient information more anonymous, such as obscuring parts of individuals' zip codes and birthdates. 

 The hearing did not settle whether Quintiles would still seek damages against WebMD. But John Russell, Quintiles' general counsel, said the company was pleased with the outcome. 

 Quintiles, the world's largest provider of services to the pharmaceutical industry, packages WebMD's data about prescription, physician and hospital claims into information that customers such as drug companies can use to analyze trends in medical care. 

 Quintiles sold a subsidiary, the No.1 processor of health-care claims, to WebMD last year. As part of that deal, Quintiles retained access to the data.

US journalists fear jobs cull - Media.

Advertising is suffering the aftershock of the dot-com crash

American newspaper journalists are bracing themselves for the first newsroom layoffs in a generation as stocks plummet on Wall Street and advertisers keep their wallets clamped firmly shut.

The boom times of the late 1990s, when newspaper companies could hardly raise the price of advertising space fast enough to keep demand under control, are over. Editors are now stuck with record staffing levels and shrinking budgets. On some newspapers, such as the San Jose Mercury News in California, journalists are considering volunteering to take unpaid leave to save jobs.

While The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times have been documenting the spectacular fall of new economy titans such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com their advertising departments have been feeling the economic aftershock. One of the worst hit has been Dow Jones & Co, publisher of The Wall Street Journal. The Journal was in an ideal position to capitalise on last year's "dot-com boom". Fledgeling Silicon Valley companies were desperate to buy advertising space in the Journal to impress their investors and influence Wall Street's money managers. But when the bear market arrived and the dot-com ventures went under, the Journal's advertising revenues collapsed.

Unfortunately for Dow Jones - and other US newspaper companies - the Internet crash coincided with a hefty 20 per cent rise in the price of newsprint, bringing it to about $610 ( #415) per metric tonne. Newspaper executives fear that paper producers plan to add a further $50 this month.

As a result of falling revenues and rising costs, Dow Jones gave warning last week that its first-quarter profits could be as much as 70 per cent below expectations on Wall Street. The company said that it would raise newspaper cover prices and cut back staff to help to tackle the problem. The extent of the slowdown was demonstrated by the amount of advertising space sold by the Journal last month. This slumped by 32 per cent compared with a 42 per cent rise during the same period the previous year. Similarly bleak warnings have been issued on Wall Street by The New York Times Company, The Washington Post Company and Knight Ridder, publisher of the San Jose Mercury News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. But some good news has emerged over the past two weeks. Although The New York Times, which also publishes The Boston Globe, said that it would miss first-quarter profit targets, it said it remained confident of meeting its goal of 10 to 15 per cent profit growth for the year as a whole.

This may be better news for investors than journalists. Newspaper companies may be able to meet profit forecasts only by raising cover prices and cutting costs, which could mean job losses. Some smaller papers, such as Knight Ridder's The Beacon Journal in Akron, Ohio, are already doing just that. The paper is expected to lose ten or so of its 165 journalists, and it has abandoned its Sunday magazine.

In the US, job losses in the newspaper industry will come as an enormous culture shock. American newspapers pride themselves on producing worthy, well-sourced stories which try to avoid any kind of political bias. This is possible only with well-staffed newsrooms.

The New York Times has hinted strongly at job cuts, saying that expenses growth at its newspaper division during 2001 would be between zero and 2 per cent. Yet Wall Street analysts still believe mass layoffs are unlikely.

"There seem to be an inordinate number of newspaper journalists who have called me up on that very issue," says Leland Westerfield, a media analyst at UBS Warburg in New York. "Newspapers survive on the quality of their journalism and the relationship they have with their readers, so massive layoffs are highly unlikely. There are more likely to be limited payroll and expenses reductions."

Westerfield, like many media analysts, has a positive long-term outlook for companies such as The New York Times. He believes that the dot-com crash will destroy many of the newspaper's upstart competitors, bring classified advertising back to print media and concentrating corporate advertising spending on "old media" titles.

"Newspaper companies are prodigious cashflow producers, even in this weak advertising environment, so they remain highly profitable," says Westerfield. "By 2002, they will be in good shape as some of the weaker digital media companies fall off the radar screen."

Newspaper companies are already demonstrating their ability to ride out a slowdown of the US economy. Apart from Dow Jones, most newspaper companies have seen their advertising revenues remain "flat", rather than fall. In contrast, some US television stations have seen advertising revenues nosedive by 13 per cent, while some glossy magazines have suffered a 20 per cent slump.

All this has failed to reassure many journalists. The climate of fear was summed up by a letter written to Anthony Ridder, the chief executive of Knight Ridder, urging him "to stand up to irrational markets and redefine financial success". It was written by Mike Cassidy, a columnist on the San Jose Mercury News, in anticipation of job cuts.

Whether the likes of Cassidy are taken seriously or not will probably depend on how much further Wall Street falls over the next few weeks. Given the bloodbath on Wall Street earlier this week, hopes are not high.

 Foreign Sales Of Technology Are No Longer A U.S. Refuge

 SINGAPORE, March 15 -- American technology companies, whose recent earnings declines in the United States have been softened by strong sales abroad, now appear to be facing a slowdown overseas as well. 

 A slump in technology sales in Asia, coupled with signs that growth in Europe may also be ebbing, is raising concern among analysts that instead of insulating American technology industries from the domestic slowdown, foreign markets may worsen the trend this year. Together, Asia and Europe account for almost half of global sales in information technology, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm. 

 ''It looks like it's going to be a globally synchronized downturn,'' said Steven Milunovich, technology strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York. While analysts have been hoping for a strong industry bounce in the second half of the year, he said, ''I think if the rest of the world worsens, we're talking about a U-shaped recovery.'' 

 ''I think it means you can write off this year for earnings,'' he said. 

 In Asia, commonly one of the fastest-growing markets for technology products, strong demand last year for computers and other information technology took some of the edge off sharply slower sales at home. 

 But as slower growth in the United States weakens the demand for Asian exports, and as home-grown economic problems push Asian currencies lower, growth in Asian technology sales could edge below 10 percent this year, according to International Data, from more than 16 percent in 2000. The research firm said it expects to reduce its estimates further in coming weeks as reports accumulate on the effects of the slowdown in the United States. 

 ''The economic environment is worsening and consumers are becoming more conservative,'' said Junichi Saeki, a senior analyst at International Data's subsidiary in Japan, Asia's largest market for technology products. ''Corporate spending is declining.'' 

 What makes the overseas slowdown so remarkable is how suddenly it appears to have overtaken the industry. Just weeks ago, companies like Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems were citing robust sales in Asia and Europe as bright spots in otherwise gloomy financial results. 

 ''Sales growth for Oracle products in Europe and Asia-Pacific remained strong,'' said Oracle's chairman and chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, announcing on March 1 that profits would come in below forecasts. ''The problem is the U.S. economy.'' 

 A little more than a month ago, Cisco assured investors that sales overseas, which account for roughly half its revenue, remained strong. Then last Friday, Cisco's chief executive, John Chambers, said his company could see ''initial signs of a slowdown expanding to other parts of the world,'' in explaining why Cisco might eliminate as many as 5,000 full-time jobs -- 11 percent of the work force. 

 Also among signs that the United States is exporting its slowdown are the latest revenue figures from the dominant chip maker, Intel, which relies on Asia and Europe for more than 60 percent of its global sales. After a year of at least 25 percent quarterly growth, sales growth in Asia dropped back to 16 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. Intel's European sales fell almost 2 percent. 

 Some economists have warned for more than a year that Asia's export-driven economies would suffer from a slowdown in American demand for technology-related products. In January, Japan posted its first trade deficit in four years as exports to the United States and the rest of Asia slowed and the price of imported crude oil increased. 

 Nonetheless, many executives and analysts expressed hope that demand in Asia and Europe might weather a slowdown in the United States. Emboldened by resilient foreign demand last year, some of them predicted that economies overseas -- having largely missed out on the kind of boom that churned out new fortunes in America almost daily -- would be spared the bust. In addition, companies in Europe and Asia lagged behind their American competitors in adopting technologies to streamline their businesses, so demand for new equipment might remain strong, they thought. 

 Executives and others used similar logic to explain why Asian sales would not suffer when financial crisis erupted there in 1997. Asian companies, they argued, needed their equipment too much not to spend -- a view that turned out to be woefully wrong. Spending on technology was one of the first things that Asian companies cut, and revenue declined. 

 Not all high-technology executives ignored the risk of a ripple effect abroad this time. As she announced a 59 percent drop in quarterly profit last month, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, Carleton S. Fiorina, said her company was concerned that economic weakness in the United States could spread to areas dependent on exports like Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan. 

 Ms. Fiorina's worries now seem to be coming true. International Data expects growth in Taiwan to slip, and predicts the South Korean market will grow little more than 2 percent after swelling 47 percent last year. 

 Compounding South Korea's problems is a sharp decline in the value of its currency, the won. The won has dropped 13 percent against the dollar in the last six months, making imports from the United States that much more expensive for Korean customers. 

 All this would matter less if Asia, like the United States, were a big buyer of high-technology services. But hardware sales dominate the market, making Asian demand more vulnerable to turmoil in the foreign-exchange markets. Services can be priced in local currencies, but hardware typically carries a dollar price tag. 

 The biggest dent in Asian sales growth comes from Japan. Despite an economy with virtually flat growth for the last decade, Japan's market for information technology has boomed. Analysts credit a popular fascination with the Internet that has spurred sales of personal computers, especially more expensive laptops. Also aiding sales were deregulatory measures that pushed banks and manufacturers to overhaul some of their operations and embrace Western networking concepts like companywide raw-materials planning, customer relationship management and data mining. 

 As a result, Japanese companies and banks that once prided themselves on running huge, in-house networks have realized that they can import expertise and achieve savings by handing over the running of those operations to specialists like I.B.M. In the last year, I.B.M. has signed major contracts with companies including Daiwa Bank, NKK Steel, Nissan and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. 

 But this drive for competitiveness at some businesses is apparently insufficient to overcome the country's economic troubles. Double-digit growth in Japanese technology services declined to just over 4 percent last year, and the International Data Corporation estimates that growth will not be much better this year. 

 Sales of personal computers are slumping as the ardor of Japanese for the Internet cools and competition drives down PC prices. International Data predicts that the PC market there will grow slightly more than 7 percent this year, after growth of more than 25 percent in 2000. Not only has interest peaked in Internet access by personal computer, Mr. Saeki of International Data says, but competition from mobile phones able to download e-mail and surf the Web is eating into demand. 

 A similar lag is being played out less markedly in Europe. Unlike South Korea and Southeast Asia's export-dependent economies, Europe has enough internal trade and economic dynamism to insulate itself somewhat from the drop in American growth, economists say. 

 ''The trans-Atlantic umbilical cord is still pretty strong,'' said Paul Horne, a European equity market economist with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. ''But the American and European economies seem to be less correlated than in the past.'' 

 In large part, that is the result of the increasing cohesion of the European Union. Just 2.25 percent of the 15 European Union countries' combined gross national product is exported to the United States, Mr. Horne said, making the region less susceptible to the American slowdown. That compares with 16 percent of output sold within the European bloc, he said. 

 Nevertheless, growth in Europe is expected to slow. International Data forecasts that growth in information technology will dip to 11.1 percent this year, from 12.5 percent in 2000. And when telecommunications is included, the drop is expected to be sharper -- to 8.8 percent this year, from 10.6 percent in 2000. Martin Hingley, vice president for European systems at International Data in Britain, acknowledged that the estimate is optimistic, given the economic tides buffeting the Continent from across the Atlantic. He said his firm was in the process of lowering its forecasts for Europe. 

 The telecommunications industry accounts for roughly half of total spending on information technology in Europe, according to International Data. On Monday, the Swedish electronics producer LM Ericsson warned it would report a first-quarter loss, as demand slackened on both sides of the Atlantic. Nokia of Finland, the world's largest maker of mobile phones, had issued its own warning of a slowdown. Today, Nokia confirmed that first-quarter profit would be about the same as a year earlier, even though sales are falling short of expectations. 

 All this can be seen as more bad news for companies like Intel and Compaq that make chips and servers for mobile devices. 

 ''Any impact on demand for mobile phones impacts the suppliers,'' said Graham Palmer, a spokesman for Intel, one of the largest suppliers of flash memory devices for mobile devices. Mr. Palmer said the softening demand in the United States had spread to Europe and Asia. 

 And so, analysts say, companies looking for shelter abroad this year will have to look to China, Asia's second-largest market for technology products after Japan and its fastest-growing one. International Data expects sales growth in China to continue this year around 30 percent, providing a lone bright spot in the gathering Asian gloom. 

 Though China runs an enormous trade surplus with the United States, its economy is proportionately less dependent than others on such exports. At the same time, China is trying to overhaul its economy, make state-owned enterprises profitable and prepare private enterprise for the threat of foreign competition that entry into the World Trade Organization will bring. 

 That, say technology executives, means more computers and more networks. ''There is pent-up demand waiting to be capitalized on,'' said Muan Lim, Hewlett-Packard's vice president for technology financing, based in Hong Kong. China's companies, he said, ''need to compete, so they need to develop their I.T. systems.''

 Compaq to  Cut  5,000 Jobs; Profit Forecast Is Lowered

 DALLAS, March 15 -- The Compaq Computer Corporation said today that it would cut 5,000 jobs and predicted that first-quarter earnings per share would be about one-third lower than expectations. Analysts said the announcement further underscored how long it might take the technology sector to recover from the slowdown in consumer buying and corporate capital spending. 

 Compaq, a leading manufacturer of personal computers and servers, also said it would merge its commercial and consumer PC divisions and trim its marketing force. Combined with previously announced cost-cutting, the moves should save the Houston-based company $500 million to $600 million a year. 

 The cutbacks will not help first-quarter results, however, and the company now expects earnings of 12 to 14 cents a share, far lower than analysts' expectations of 18 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 Revenue for the quarter will be $9 billion to $9.2 billion, a 20 percent decline from the fourth quarter and less than the $9.6 billion the company predicted just two months ago. 

 The company today also named Jeff Clarke, 39, as chief financial officer. Mr. Clarke, who had been vice president for finance and strategy for Compaq Sales and Services, replaces Jesse J. Greene Jr., who becomes senior vice president for strategic planning. 

 Michael Capellas, Compaq's chief executive, blamed the weak United States economy, sliding consumer confidence and cutbacks in industry capital spending, and he said he ''remains concerned about future deterioration in global markets.'' 

 On the personal computer side, demand for desktop computers has slowed the most, but notebook demand has also weakened, company officials said. Mr. Capellas said the server business was suffering from slackening demand in sectors including telecommunications, autos and core manufacturing, as well as from very severe pricing pressure. Price-cutting, he said, is ''fierce, so it's time to get aggressive.'' 

 The layoffs, which will trim 7 percent of Compaq's work force, will come from the personal computer business and from within marketing and supply-chain divisions, which include manufacturing, distribution, inventory, procurement and order controls. Mr. Capellas said the company would make most cuts within six weeks, but he declined to say where, geographically, they would mostly occur. 

 Dan Niles, a semiconductor and personal computer analyst with Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, said the news, while not surprising, further emphasized how long it would take technology companies to regain their footing. 

 ''This isn't anywhere close to being over,'' Mr. Niles said, adding that ''it definitely looks like this is going to spread'' to foreign markets. ''This is going to be long and painful.'' 

 Mr. Niles said the industry's severe weakness would continue through the summer, and probably through the end of the year. ''I know everybody is hoping and praying that Alan Greenspan is going to save us, but it's just not going to happen,'' Mr. Niles said. ''There are just too many structural problems right now for an interest rate cut to turn that around.'' 

 In general, Mr. Niles said he was recommending that investors steer clear of technology, but he added that the computer hardware sector, with some valuations near a five-year low, is a more appealing place than some other sectors. He also said Compaq's lowered revenue forecast was not as bad as he thought it would be. For the year, Mr. Niles now expects earnings of 55 to 65 cents a share, compared with the $1.08 analysts had been predicting before today's news, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 With the announcement today by Compaq following a spate of similar warnings from other companies, investors seemed to take things in stride. Shares of Compaq closed at $18.50 up 15 cents, before the profitwarning. After a conference call with analysts, shares rose slightly in after-hours trading, before later settling back to $18.50.

 Financial Post: Canada 
 Fair disclosure - unfair turbulence: Material company information is spilling out a lot more abruptly than it used to, thanks to a new SEC rule

 On the surface, it seemed a rare display of frankness. Royal Bank of Canada announced earlier this month that it was "reviewing" the future status of its notorious pension investment arm, RT Capital Management Inc. No sale was imminent. In fact, the country's largest bank admitted it hadn't made any direct solicitations, let alone locked up a buyer. Yet an official statement was floated into the marketplace so investors could digest the information that the Royal Bank was pursuing a number of options involving its high-profile subsidiary. 

 "Everyone is being cautious," explained Graeme Harris, a spokesman for Royal Bank. "The proceeds of the sale of RT Capital are expected to be substantial and could impact the stock price. Therefore, we thought it prudent to disseminate the information fairly in the public domain." 

 Welcome to the brave new world of "fair disclosure," courtesy of tougher regulation initiated recently by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States. The new rule, which became effective last October, is attempting to tighten up the flow of information emanating from publicly traded companies into the marketplace. Basically, the regulation requires that all investors, big and small, get access to the same quality of information at the same time -- and it affects every stock that is listed on U.S. stock exchanges -- including those of Canadian companies. Hence, Royal Bank's rush to pump out a press release. 

 "There is no doubt that company practices have changed in terms of the way they disseminate information," explained a Canadian securities lawyer who advises many corporations and asked not to be named. "Company executives are clearly behaving differently and are much more careful about making sure that if they have something to say, it's said in a forum that is widely available." 

 Initially, the SEC regulation appears to have opened the floodgates as companies rush to issue corporate APBs at a record pace, giving average investors access to the kind of information their larger professional counterparts have always enjoyed. 

 But while small investors may be better informed, there is some debate about whether they are better off. Some observers say that this new wealth of information is abetting the unprecedented turbulence in North American stock markets -- and it's the unsophisticated little guys who are getting the roughest ride. 

 Consider the number of so-called pre-announcements issued by companies in the months following the implementation of the new SEC rule. In the last three months of last year, there were 1,477 total notices -- negative, positive and on-target -- posted by companies. During the previous quarter -- before the SEC rule took effect -- there were 690. And so far this year, 794 notices have been issued, a 69% increase from the equivalent time in the last quarter. 

 "The fair disclosure rule in the U.S. set everything off," explained a Bay Street lawyer who advises Canadian companies. "We have more disclosure than we've ever had because companies, especially the significant ones, are anxious to be seen to be adhering to the new rule." 

 The new disclosure rule appears to be precipitating a radical cultural change in the clubby business world of North America that has been defined by connections and privileged access to corporate insiders. 

 Observers say the U.S. securities watchdog is attempting to break up the the cozy cabal that has long existed between the executive suites of Corporate America and the analysts and brokerage houses on Wall Street. 

 Ten years ago, companies considered that their obligations of full disclosure simply required them to talk privately to a select group of industry analysts. Information was doled out to favoured researchers on a selective basis, allowing them to gain an informational edge -- and the ability to profit -- from having access to company insiders rather than from their own due diligence. In turn, analysts would advise their clients, mostly large institutional investors with the huge pools of money, who would take advantage of the early guidance. 

 According to the old hierarchy, individual investors were often the last to hear about news -- good or bad -- that could affect the price of a stock. 

 Regulators have long aruged that this selective disclosure had an adverse impact on the integrity of the markets because of its inherent unfairness to retail investors, who were well aware that other participants would exploit their informational advantage. 

 However, the stock market has changed dramatically in the past decade as growing numbers of individual investors -- mostly ageing Baby Boomers -- began participating through their mutual and pension funds. That coincided with unprecedented technological advances, especially the growth of the Internet, which has provided a wealth of timely information to millions of people without the filter of analysts and professional advisers. 

 "There has been a tremendous shift in the playing field," said Frank Switzer, a spokesman for the Ontario Securities Commission. "Unfortunately, you haven't seen a shift in the behaviour of companies in terms of supplying financial information." 

 After months of hearings and more than 6,000 submissions, the SEC devised Regulation FD to address that perceived failure. The rule, which stands for fair disclosure, requires all companies to issue important information to the public at the same time. "We believe that the practice of selective disclosure leads to a loss of investor confidence in our capital markets," the SEC said in its documents outlining the new policy. As a result, Regulation FD is designed to prevent material information from being used "as a commodity to be used to obtain preference with particular analysts or investors." 

 In Canada, provincial securities acts cover a range of disclosure policies and generally make it unlawful to give small groups of people information without telling the public at large. The Canadian rules tend to be more interpretive than in the United States. 

 For example, in Ontario, the securities laws regulating the country's largest capital market outline the boundaries of disclosure, but a national policy statement is expected to be released this spring by the OSC outlining best practices guidelines for companies in this increasingly sensitive area. 

 "I think there's a recognition that it's a different market than 10 years ago," said Mr. Switzer. "The U.S. regulation has helped contribute to the change in attitudes." 

 Little wonder. Many public Canadian companies trade in the United States and therefore are obliged to recognize the SEC disclosure rule. 

 Generally, disclosure has long been considered a grey area. Allegations of selective disclosure are not usually based on blatant statements, but are often low-key comments made by senior company executives that are open to interpretation. 

 According to securities lawyers who counsel companies on issues of corporate governance and disclosure, there has been a definite reduction in the number of one-on-one analyst meetings with executives since the arrival of the SEC rule five months ago. 

 "Clearly, people are behaving differently and there's no doubt that company practices have changed in terms of conference calls, Webcasts, posting CEO speeches on Web sites. All of that is evidence that there is more information available for everyone," said a New York securities lawyer who works with large companies on disclosure. "It's a very simple direction, if you have something to say, you have to say it in a way that's going to be accessible to everybody at the same time and make sure you are very careful not to be saying anything in small sessions." 

 Comments made by John Roth, chief executive of Nortel Networks Corp., drove that message home recently. During a Webcast hosted by RBC Dominion Securities on Feb. 12, Mr. Roth said: "We are seeing customers' access to capital tightening and so customers are reviewing their expenditures. It's a routine we haven't seen before; they are slowing down expenditures like we've never seen before." Mr. Roth also cautioned that he expected the downtrend to continue for at least six months. 

 The next day, Nortel closed a US$3-billion stock deal with JDS Uniphase Corp. and two days later, on Feb. 15, Nortel issued a stunning profit warning that drastically reduced its growth and earnings projections for 2001. At the same time, the company also announced it was slashing 10,000 jobs. The announcement shaved one-third off the value of Nortel's stock, which trades in Toronto and New York. 

 Within days, a number of class-action lawsuits were launched in Canada and the United States by retail investors alleging that Nortel, Mr. Roth and a number of its senior executives and directors misled investors with optimistic sales and earnings forecasts. 

 At the same time, the OSC began an investigation into the timing of Mr. Roth's comments to the group of analysts during the Webcast and Nortel's official earnings warnings a few days later. 

 "If you are going to appear before one of these and you have news in your pocket, you'd better let it be known," explained Larry Wachtel, a market anlayst at Prudential Securities in New York. 

 Lawyers and other professional advisers are mindful of the intense scrutiny given to disclosure by regulators and increasingly litigious investors. So much that the old relationship between the business community and analysts is now considered in the words of one executive, to be "dynamite" and best be avoided. 

 "The whole regulatory climate now is that you are better to be safe than sorry," explained a Bay Street securities lawyer who requested anonymity. "You don't want to be in a position to explain yourself after the fact." 

 Nonetheless, the regulatory chill may be contributing to the current chaos in the stock markets. 

 "The average investor was better off in the old world than they are in this new world, where everybody gets hit by the same bombshells," explained the Canadian securities lawyer. In the past, when information seeped out into the market gradually, investors could brace themselves, giving them time to discount negative information before it became a reality. In those circumstance, the theory goes, stock prices would begin to reflect information on a gradual basis, making reactions less dramatic and the markets less turbulent. 

 "The information stream arrives more abruptly than it did in the past and it means the reactions are more abrupt because there isn't a filtering process," said Mr. Wachtel."Until you get used to it, it's bad because everything becomes larger than life in terms of the markets moods. But once you get used to the pattern, it's a good thing because it means companies can't dodge around." 

 Others say the timing of the tighter disclosure rules coincided with a troubled technology sector and slower economic growth. 

 William Mackenzie, president of Toronto-based Fairvest Proxy Monitor Corp., corporate governance specialists, argues there is a "breaking in period" where people are learning to deliver information in a new way and investors are learning to deal with the acceleration of information. 

 "Maybe there's an overreaction to short-term information that's coming out that is causing all the volatitily and that's having a devastating effect on the stock prices in a market that has been grossly overvalued," Mr. Mackenzie said. "I think the market is going where it would go. The gyrations are different, they are steeper, but it is going in the direction it would eventually." 

 The securities lawyers concurred: "There's no doubt the new rule has moderated behaviour, but I think claims about the impact it has had are exaggerated because we are living in extraordinary times in the markets."

 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest seller of personal computers, issued a profit warning late yesterday and said it will fire 5,000 employees, or 7% of its workforce. 

 The cuts are designed to save Compaq up to US$600-million in a market where PC sales continue to decline, playing havoc with financial forecasts. 

 The Houston, Tex.-based PC maker warned it will miss first-quarter earnings estimates by as much as one-third. Profit should hit 12 cents to 14 cents a share, compared with analysts' expectations of 18 cents. 

 First-quarter sales will disappoint, dipping about 4% from a year earlier to between US$9-billion and US$9.2-billion. Analysts had forecast revenue of US$9.6-billion. 

 Compaq has replaced Jesse Greene, 54, its chief financial officer, with Jeff Clarke, 39, formerly vice-president of finance. Mr. Greene becomes senior vice-president of strategic planning. 

 Compaq blamed the layoffs and earnings shortfall on deteriorating market conditions, but said it is planning for the long-term. 

 "We see continued weakness in the U. S. economy, and resultant pricing pressures," said Michael Capellas, chairman and chief executive at Compaq. 

 "Clearly we are operating in a challenging environment. The result of the actions we are taking today, coupled with our strong array of new products and solutions, will enable significant improvements in our business model and position us well in the mid- and long-term." 

 In addition to tough market conditions, Compaq is facing an aggressive assault from rival Dell Computer Corp. 

 According to Gillian Munson, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Dell is poised to surpass Compaq as the world's top PC vendor as early as this quarter. 

 While Dell is cutting prices to build market share, Mr. Capellas, who took the reins at Compaq last summer, is leading his firm into new markets, such as the hand-held computer segment with Compaq's popular iPaq device. 

 Mr. Capellas received a salary of US$1.2-million last year, a bonus of US$3.8-million and US$24.4-million in restricted stock awards.

        WASHINGTON (FFBN)--Lacking any real positive news that would warrant
a turnaround Friday, investors once again sold off technology stocks.  The
FFBN Technology Index weakened 450.18, or 2.91%, to 14,994.03, with the PC
makers taking the heaviest hits.



        International Business Machines Corp. shares dropped 5.46, or 5.7%,
to 90.10.
        Compaq Computer Corp. shares fell 0.50, or 2.7%, to 18, after
announcing it will miss analysts' expectations for its first quarter.
Investors seemed unphased by the announcement, since most analysts had been
lowering their numbers on the company for the past few weeks.
        Elsewhere in the PC sector, shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. slumped
2.60, or 8.5%, to 28.10, and Intergraph Corp. fell off 0.72, or 7.3%, to
close at 9.09.  The FFBN Computer Index declined 182.94, or 5.06%, to
3435.45.
        Computer Sciences shares plunged 21.40, or 40%, to 32.70 after its
fourth quarter profit warning.  The company said it expects to earn 35 cents
to 37 cents a share before items on revenue growth of 11% to 13% for the
fourth quarter ending March 30.  A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of 12
analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 92 cents a share for the
quarter.
        Electronic Data Systems Corp. shares tumbled 3.25, or 5.56%, to
55.25, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the company in the wake of Computer
Sciences' announcement.  SunGard Data Systems Inc. shares gave up 4.57, or
8.6%, to 48.65.  All told the FFBN Programming & Information Services Index
sank 13.93, or 12.09%, to end at 101.30.
        The battered Internet sector continued to fall, as the FFBN Internet
Index lost 26.43, or 7.48%, to 327.19.  Art Technology Group Inc. shares
dropped 4 points, or 22%, to 14.00, and Akamai Technologies Inc. shares
dwindled 1.09, or 11.7%, to 8.22.  Yahoo! Inc. shares declined 1.44, or 9.6%,
to 13.56.
        The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 207.87 points, or 2.07% to
9823.41.  The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 49.72, or 2.56%, to 1890.99, its
worst finish since Nov. 17, 1998.  The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index slid
23.03, or 1.96%, to 1150.53.

Topping analysts' estimates by 5 cents a share, Adobe Systems reported first
quarter earnings of 33 cents a share, excluding items.  However, the company
lowered its second quarter revenue growth target to 15% from its previous
estimate of 25% revenue growth.

Artesyn Technologies Inc. lowered its first quarter expectation to a cash
loss of 5 cents to 10 cents a share, citing a significant drop in demand for
communications products.  A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of eight
analysts yielded a mean cash earnings estimate of 25 cents a share for the
first quarter. Cash earnings, as defined by Artesyn, excludes goodwill
amortization.
The company also projected first quarter revenue would decline about 10% from
the year ago. In January Artesyn predicted revenue growth of 10% to 15% for
the first half and about 20% for the second half. Revenue should improve in
the second half, Artesyn said, as shipments of new products begin.

Computer Sciences Corp. said it expects to earn 35 cents to 37 cents a share
before items on revenue growth of 11% to 13% for the fourth quarter ending
March 30.  A First Call survey of 12 analysts produced a mean earnings
estimate of 92 cents a share for the quarter.  Computer Sciences will record
a fourth quarter charge of $100 million to $150 million for restructuring
that includes costs associated with a staff reduction of about 700 to 900
employees.

        (This market wrap was originally published Friday evening.)
        WASHINGTON (FFBN)--Lacking any real positive news that would warrant
a turnaround Friday, investors once again sold off technology stocks.  The
FFBN Technology Index weakened 450.18, or 2.91%, to 14,994.03, with the PC
makers taking the heaviest hits.
        International Business Machines Corp. shares dropped 5.46, or 5.7%,
to 90.10.
        Compaq Computer Corp. shares fell 0.50, or 2.7%, to 18, after
announcing it will miss analysts' expectations for its first quarter.
Investors seemed unphased by the announcement, since most analysts had been
lowering their numbers on the company for the past few weeks.
        Elsewhere in the PC sector, shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. slumped
2.60, or 8.5%, to 28.10, and Intergraph Corp. fell off 0.72, or 7.3%, to
close at 9.09.  The FFBN Computer Index declined 182.94, or 5.06%, to
3435.45.
        Computer Sciences shares plunged 21.40, or 40%, to 32.70 after its
fourth quarter profit warning.  The company said it expects to earn 35 cents
to 37 cents a share before items on revenue growth of 11% to 13% for the
fourth quarter ending March 30.  A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of 12
analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 92 cents a share for the
quarter.
        Electronic Data Systems Corp. shares tumbled 3.25, or 5.56%, to
55.25, after Merrill Lynch downgraded the company in the wake of Computer
Sciences' announcement.  SunGard Data Systems Inc. shares gave up 4.57, or
8.6%, to 48.65.  All told the FFBN Programming & Information Services Index
sank 13.93, or 12.09%, to end at 101.30.
        The battered Internet sector continued to fall, as the FFBN Internet
Index lost 26.43, or 7.48%, to 327.19.  Art Technology Group Inc. shares
dropped 4 points, or 22%, to 14.00, and Akamai Technologies Inc. shares
dwindled 1.09, or 11.7%, to 8.22.  Yahoo! Inc. shares declined 1.44, or 9.6%,
to 13.56.
        The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 207.87 points, or 2.07% to
9823.41.  The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 49.72, or 2.56%, to 1890.99, its
worst finish since Nov. 17, 1998.  The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index slid
23.03, or 1.96%, to 1150.53.

 SAN FRANCISCO -- LookSmart Ltd. said it expects to meet its first-quarter sales and earnings guidance but said its financial chief is resigning. 

 The company said it expects to report a cash operating loss of 15 cents to 18 cents a share, or five cents to eight cents a share excluding charges. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call were expecting a first-quarter loss of 12 cents a share. 

 The Web-directory service also said Chief Financial Officer Ned Brody has resigned and will transfer his duties by March 31 to Martha Clark, who will be interim chief financial officer. Ms. Clark is vice president, finance and administration. 

 Earlier this year, following a profit warning, LookSmart (LOOK) cut about one-quarter of its staff and started exiting noncore businesses. 

 LookSmart said Friday that the recent restructuring reinforced its confidence in meeting cash operating profitability by the fourth quarter, leaving it in a "strong and stable" financial position. 

 The company said that it is still operating in a difficult market, but its listing and search advertising products are getting a healthy response from customers.

 Companies: Analysts  Cut  Profit Estimates For Compaq's First Quarter --- Firm Says It Hasn't Changed Outlook Despite Worries About U.S. Slowdown --- Server Sales and Margins Are Expected to Be Lower

 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   

 Wall Street analysts are paring their first-quarter earnings projections for Compaq Computer Corp., one of a few big technology companies that hasn't recently lowered its expectations.   

 Amid worries that the U.S. computer-spending slowdown has spread to Compaq's key markets, analysts appear to be embracing a consensus profit of about 17 U.S. cents (18.6 European cents) a diluted share, compared with a prior consensus of 20 cents a share, according to Charles R. Hill, research director at First Call/Thomson Financial. Current estimates range from a high of 22 cents to as low as 15 cents a share.   

 A Compaq spokesman said Tuesday that the company hadn't altered its outlook. In January, Chief Executive Michael D. Capellas said the Houston computer maker was expecting a profit of 21 cents a share on sales of $9.5 billion. A year ago, it earned 16 cents a diluted share on sales of $9.51 billion in the first quarter. Compaq is expected to release results April 24.   

 In January, Mr. Capellas pegged Compaq's outlook on continued gains in server computers and data-storage products as well as healthy international sales. Since then, server and storage rivals Sun Microsystems Inc. and EMC Corp. have lowered their forecasts, and chip maker Intel Corp. has sharply cut its outlook.   

 "Everything (Compaq is) in is under pressure," said Bear Stearns & Co. analyst Andrew J. Neff, who in late February pared his profit estimate for Compaq to 17 cents a share on revenue of $9.5 billion. Mr. Neff also sliced his full-year estimate to 75 cents a share from $1.15 and lowered his sales projection to $40.4 billion, down $5.2 billion from a prior estimate.   

 Since Mr. Neff lowered his outlook, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase's JP Morgan H&Q, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Robertson, Stephens Inc., Wit SoundView Corp. and Lehman Brothers have followed suit.   

 Mark Specker, an analyst at Wit SoundView, lowered his first-quarter Compaq estimate to 18 cents a share from 21 cents and cut his quarterly sales forecast to $9.25 billion from $9.6 billion. "The hard thing is knowing how far down is down," he said. Mr. Specker added that he believes European markets "slowed down appreciably in the month of February." He said that in light of Intel's warning of weaker server-computer sales, Compaq's server sales and margins would be lower than he forecast. "That's Compaq's principal source of profit," said Mr. Specker, noting that as companies pare spending on computers, they are more apt to trim servers.   

 He also lowered his estimate for the year to profit of $1.08 a share, compared with a prior estimate of $1.22 a share.

 PARIS, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers said on Thursday it had cut its price target for French insurer AXA to 127 euros from 150 euros and repeated a "market perform" rating. 

 The bank - which released the report after AXA's conference call with analysts on Wednesday - said AXA's reduction of 2001 earnings growth estimates from 10 percent two weeks ago to "positive" was "an implicit profit warning". 

 "We believe there will be a second profit warning likely within the first six months results unless markets recover," the bank said. 

 At 1042 GMT, AXA was down 2.51 percent at 124.3 euros while the CAC-40 index was down 0.02 percent. The stock underperformed the DJ Stoxx insurance, which was down 0.03 percent. 

 AXA said on Wednesday its 2000 net profit excluding one-off items was 2.261 billion euros, in line with expectations.

 Intel postpones Leixlip expansion to save E219m.

 Intel's move to postpone expansion at Leixlip, Co Kildare, is understood to be aimed at saving $200 million (E219 million) this year. 

 In the latest sign that slower growth in the US could have a serious impact in the Republic, the chip-maker yesterday said production at its Fab 24 plant would not begin until mid-2003, about nine months later than the target it cited last December. Intel and IDA Ireland, which moved to play down the development, both claimed this postponement was revealed by the company in early February. But both accepted the company issued no press release at that time. 

 Yesterday's move means about 1,400 construction workers will lose their jobs at Leixlip in the next two months, with most leaving the site by Easter. Intel's spokesman said he did not know how many of those workers would be laid off by its sub-contractors. He accepted layoffs were inevitable but suggested some construction workers would be re-deployed by their employers. The company said 50-100 would remain on the project, which it planned to accelerate again in 2002. "We have taken the opportunity to do this as we are well ahead of the construction schedule," said the company in a statement. 

 Its spokesman denied a suggestion that the company could be perceived as rewarding early completion of elements of the project with postponement of its next phase. "We're not trying to be arrogant but we have to be realistic," he said. "Many companies have taken far more drastic actions. We are clearly under pressure and, if it's not absolutely necessary to make that expenditure this year, we won't." 

 The development is understood to reduce Intel's expenditure on the project this year to $50 million from $250 million. An IDA Ireland spokesman claimed Intel's decision was the "logical conclusion" of renewed pressure on its business. In its latest profit warning last Friday, Intel said revenues in the first quarter of the year would be 25 per cent weaker than in the final three months of 2000. The company also signalled it wanted to cut 5,000 jobs from its 85,000 staff worldwide. 

 Its spokesman said this would have a "minor" impact at Leixlip, where Intel employs 3,500 and its sub-contractors employ 1,400. While overall employment patterns would not change, a "modest reduction" would be achieved by not replacing staff who leave the company. The turnover of staff in 2000 was 10 per cent, although Intel claims the figure could fall to 46 per cent this year. That suggests 210 positions might not be replaced. 

 The project management company leading the Fab 24 project, Jacob's Engineering, declined to comment. The principal contractors on the site include PJ Hegarty, Mercury Engineers, Afcon and HA O'Neill. Intel insisted it was "fully committed" to the new project, which will employ 1,000 more people. 

 A spokesman for the Tanaiste, Ms Harney, said she was in close contact with Intel on the project. She was satisfied Intel remained committed to the development of the new plant and to its recruitment target. The Fab 24 project was seen as a flagship development by IDA Ireland when it was sanctioned last June. 

 Then worth $1.5 billion and scheduled to begin operations this year, its completion target was postponed until the second half of 2002 last December. Intel's decision at that time to produce chips with 300mm silicon wafers instead of 200mm wafers increased the cost of its expansion to $2 billion, a move welcomed by IDA Ireland. Intel said yesterday that it had again upgraded the wafers, increasing its overall investment in the project to $2.2-$2.3 billion. Instead of using a process known as 0.13 micron in the chips, it would use 0.10. The new product would function twice as quickly as its current Pentium 4 chip, the spokesman claimed.

 Intel cuts back $2.2bn Leixlip expansion.

 Intel yesterday scaled back its $2.2 billion expansion at Leixlip, Co Kildare, to counter difficulties in its global markets. 

 About 1,400 construction workers will lose their jobs on the site of its Fab 24 project, in a development seen as the clearest indication yet that a slowdown in the US economy could have a serious impact in the Republic. Intel said it was committed to the project, which would be "accelerated" again next year. It is understood to be seeking savings of $200 million this year through the postponement. 

 Construction unions are expected to demand "comfort payments", firm dates for a resumption of work and guarantees that existing employees will be given first choice of jobs. Intel and its sub-contractors already employ 4,900 permanent staff at an operation ranking among the biggest investments by high-tech multinationals in the State. Its chips are used as standard technology by IT firms, so the company is seen as a proxy for the sector. 

 In a statement it said workers who resigned in the coming months would not be replaced. While this follows a profit warning last Friday that predicted 5,000 departures from its global workforce of 85,000, Intel claimed it still wanted to employ an additional 1,000 people at the new Dublin plant. Following yesterday's second postponement, that plant is not now expected to produce chips until mid-2003. Three months ago Intel pushed back its production target to the second half of 2002 from late 2001. 

 When the project was sanctioned last June, its spokesman said the implications of non-completion by late this year would be "unthinkable". However, falling demand for computer chips and fears of recession in the US have weakened its performance in a market damaged by depressed stock prices. The company's vice-president for communications, Mr Chuck Molloy, said "the current economic climate is a contributing factor" in the postponement. However, speaking from Intel's headquarters at Santa Clara, he said the delay was "normal". 

 Intel had four factories under construction and Ireland would be the first to use new 0.10 micron technology, Mr Molloy said. The company would not cut spending on new plant and equipment and previous plans to spend $7.5 billion to expand production and implement new technologies remained unchanged, he added. An IDA Ireland spokesman in San Jose said a delegation from the jobs agency would visit Intel in Santa Clara next week. It attributed the news to the general retrenchment in the technology sector. "Intel has been hit like everyone else," he said. 

 Intel's director of sales and marketing, Mr Sean Maloney, said telecommunications companies had cancelled large orders, reflecting a slowdown in the sale of mobile phones. He told analysts the US slowdown was spreading overseas, with order cancellations coming from all over.

 Artesyn Technologies Warns It Will Post Surprise 1st-Quarter Loss

 BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Artesyn Technologies Inc. warned it will post disappointing first-quarter and full-year results because of a significant drop in demand for its communications products. 

 Artesyn (ATSN), a provider of power supplies and converters for communications companies, said it expects to post a cash loss of five to 10 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for first-quarter earnings of 25 cents a share. Cash earnings, as defined by Artesyn, exclude goodwill amortization. 

 The company said cash earnings for the year-earlier first quarter were $11.1 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $159.6 million. 

 The company also projected that first-quarter revenue would decline about 10% from the year ago. 

 For the full year, the company said it currently expects cash earnings of 60 cents to 70 cents a share on projected revenue of $700 million to $725 million. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of $1.33 a share for the year. 

 Artesyn said its customers have responded to the U.S. economic slowdown by reducing manufacturing levels and rescheduling product deliveries. 

 The company expects the lower demand - which fell short particularly in the computing-storage and carrier-enterprise markets - to continue through the second quarter. 

 Revenue should improve in the second half, Artesyn said, as shipments of new products begin. 

 The revised outlook is considerably more cautious than the company's earlier guidance. In January, Artesyn predicted revenue growth of 10% to 15% for the first half and about 20% for the second half. 

 The mean estimate of analysts was reduced from $1.72 a share since Artesyn issued a profit warning in December. 

 The company's 2000 cash earnings were $1.25 a share on revenue of $690.1 million.

 Heinz Plans to Lay Off 1,900 Workers as It Retunes Tuna, Pet Food Segments

 PITTSBURGH -- Hurt by weak tuna prices and declining pet-food sales, H.J. Heinz Co. announced 1,900 layoffs, the bulk from the closure of its Puerto Rico tuna business, and said it will consolidate its North American pet-food operations. 

 The maker of Heinz ketchup and StarKist tuna also said Thursday that profit increased 58% in its fiscal third quarter, meeting lowered expectations. Earlier this month, Heinz said it would report earnings for its third and fourth quarters, and for its next fiscal year as well, that would be lower than analysts had forecast. The company cited low prices for tuna products and the high cost of energy as the main reasons for its warning. 

 Heinz's tuna operations in Puerto Rico will be closed at the end of April. In addition, the company will divest itself of eight fishing boats and related equipment. 

 The company also will move its North American canned pet-food operations to its existing manufacturing center in Bloomsburg, Pa., next month. Its Terminal Island, Calif., facility will cease pet-food production, and begin processing fish, labeling StarKist products and conducting research and development. The facility, which will retain around 200 workers, also will serve as a distribution site. 

 The restructuring plan, which also involves centralizing the company's supply chain in Europe, is expected to save Heinz (HNZ) around $25 million next year and $60 million a year beginning in fiscal 2004. Heinz anticipates taking a $300 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of the plan. 

 Bottom Line Grows 58% 

 For its fiscal third quarter ended Jan. 31, the company posted net income of $270.5 million, or 77 cents a diluted share, compared with $171.1 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 Both periods included one-time items. Excluding pretax costs of 14 cents a share to implement its Operation Excel plan, and a gain of 27 cents a share related to tax planning and new tax legislation in Italy, earnings in the latest period totaled $227.4 million, or 65 cents a diluted share. That matched a mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The year-earlier third quarter results included restructuring charges and pretax implementation costs of 15 cents a share. Without the items, earnings were $227.2 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 But while Heinz's bottom line improved in the latest period, sales slipped 1.1% to $2.27 billion from $2.29 billion a year earlier. Heinz attributed the decline to "the unfavorable impact of foreign currency" exchange rates. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell nearly 11% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 

 "With the particular exceptions of weakness in tuna pricing and the effect of currency, Heinz's underlying earnings were generally strong, fueled by rapid growth in our leading businesses, including Heinz ketchup, food-service products and Heinz Frozen Food," William R. Johnson, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a written statement. 

 Sales of ketchup, condiments and sauces rose more than 9% in North America, boosted by the popularity of the EZ Squirt brand of ketchup, and its food-service ketchup business. However, overall North American sales fell 2% to $1.01 billion, due mainly to lower tuna prices and lower volume for canned pet food. 

 Meanwhile, sales at the company's North American frozen-food business rose 13% to $256.5 million and volume increased 12% amid strong demand for Bagel Bites snacks, Smart Ones frozen entrees, and Boston Market homestyle meals.

 Nokia Shows 1Q Strength As Rivals Falter >NOK MOT

 STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Shares of Nokia Corp. (NOK) surged almost 13% Thursday after the Finnish phone giant said it expects to meet its earnings target for the first quarter despite slower than expected revenue growth. 

 The relatively confident statement from the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones suggested that it has been able to prosper at the expense of rivals such as Motorola Inc. (MOT) and Telefon AB LM Ericsson (ERICY), which have been forced to cut their own profit projections for the first quarter. 

 Nokia said deteriorating economic conditions, particularly in the U.S., would limit into its sales growth for the quarter and would slow growth in the global handset market for 2001. 

 But it said "better-than-anticipated margins" should allow it to post earnings per share of EUR0.19 for the first quarter, in line with guidance that it provided in January. 

 Nokia said it would discuss its expectations for the rest of the year in further detail when it releases first-quarter results April 20. 

 In light of the lower handset forecast and continuing economic uncertainty, "there's a possibility that the guidance will be lower concerning the second quarter," said Jussi Hyoty, an analyst with FIM Securities in Helsinki. "But the strength we see now is more important. Somehow, it looks like Nokia has really sailed through the difficult time." 

 By 1440 GMT, shares of Nokia were up almost 13% at EUR27.71 in Helsinki. Their rise helped pull up other European telecoms stocks. 

 Nokia Still Gaining Market Share 

 In its sales update, Nokia also said it believes it has widened its market-share advantage in mobile-phone sales after capturing 32% of the market in 2000. That figure is slightly higher than the 30.6% figure calculated by U.S. research firm Dataquest. 

 Mobile phone sales made up about 70% of Nokia's revenue last year. 

 "This highlights that there is still an enormous gap between Nokia and every other handset manufacturer," said Matthew Lewis, an analyst with Daiwa SBCM in London. 

 "Everyone else is in a position of weakness," Lewis said. "Nokia is not. They are managing to make headway in a falling market." 

 Nokia's statement comes only three days after Swedish rival Ericsson warned that it expected to lose as much as SEK5 billion in the first quarter, after earlier forecasting it would break even, because of slowdowns in both its network and phone units. 

 As for Motorola, it announced plans Tuesday to cut 7,000 more jobs in its handset and cellphones unit, while France's Alcatel SA (ALA) said it would idle a handset plant for two weeks because of weak demand for its phones. 

 Many market observers, suspecting that Nokia was vulnerable as well, had expected it to issue its own profit warning this week. 

 Instead, Nokia said Thursday it would manage to meet its earnings despite the slowing economy. It said it expects year-on-year quarterly sales growth of about 20%, rather than the 25% to 30% it forecast in January. That forecast was a revision from a December projection of 25% to 35% growth. 

 The company said it expects revenue in the mobile phone division to grow 15% to 20% from the first quarter of 2000, and said year-on-year growth in network sales would be 30% to 35% for the quarter, in line with prior guidance. 

 "We feel confident about our strengths and our performance during the early months of the year," said Nokia Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jorma Ollila in remarks accompanying the statement. He added that "more challenging times like these test your mettle as a company." 

 Analysts said Nokia's networks unit had been helped because it is not as exposed as Ericsson to the sluggish U.S. market, where many operators are postponing network expansions as the economy softens. 

 Still, "it is positive that the network business is showing a very nice profit growth," said ING Barings analyst Hendrik Zonnenberg. 

 Citing the economic conditions, Nokia said it now expects global handset sales for 2001 to be between 450 million and 500 million units. It had previously forecast a range of 500 million to 550 million units, saying sales near the bottom end were more likely. 

 Analysts said the revision was not a particular cause for concern, since Nokia had been expected to follow its rivals in lowering its forecast. 

 "Nokia is growing faster than the market, so the total (sales figure) ceases to be that important," Lewis said. 

 Nokia had warned in January that margins in the mobile-phone unit might fall in the first quarter as market growth slowed and it sought to gain further market share. 

 Thursday's statement, though, suggests Nokia has been able to build on its advantage without cutting its margins as much as some had suspected, analysts said.

 Old Econ Stks Headed For Downngrades As US,Japan Suffer 

 By Brian Truscott

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Blue-chip old economy stocks, resilient over the past year, will likely be hit by a raft of earnings downgrades over the next four quarters as a U.S. slowdown continues and Japan's economy deteriorates further. 

 Analysts fear a supply-side slowdown will lead to overcapacity woes, leaving companies without pricing power and central banks impotent to guide sentiment or demand via interest rate cuts. 

 "If the slowdown is supply-side rather than demand-side driven, then it is impossible to conceive how old economy companies can buck the trend," said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at Natwest Stockbrokers. 

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter strategist Ben Funnell said earnings estimates will have to come down, given that global gross domestic product has fallen to a level not seen since 1990. He said capital goods-makers, such as engineering and car companies, will be hard-pressed to make the 14% earnings growth consensus this year after 21% growth last year. 

 Earnings forecasts for the cyclical materials sector - including steel-makers, mining, chemicals and paper companies - will likely be cut from the current 7% consensus. And technology hardware and software companies, which have been battered in recent months, could still see earnings estimates plunge another 30%, he said. 

 Batstone said the situation will only be exacerbated if Japan tries to prop up its moribund economy with a competitive devaluation of the yen. 

 "That would further undermine pricing power for western corporate," he said. 

 If large multinationals such as Unilever (UL UN), Nestle S.A. (Z.NES), Cable & Wireless Communications PLC (CWZ), Germany's Henkel KGAA (U.HEN),Italy's Fiat S.P.A. (I.FIT), Sweden's Securitas A.B. (S.SEC) and the U.K.'s Corus Group PLC (CGA) are hit by a global downturn, there will surely be a knock-on effect further down the food chain, with smaller suppliers hit as inventories are reduced sharply. 

 That's "one reason why a slowdown can't be ignored," said one analyst. 

 J.P. Morgan has already downgraded C&W, following the group's profitwarning earlier this week. J.P. Morgan said the warning arose "primarily as a result of US and Japanese pricing pressures and carrier services problems." The investment house reduced its sum-of-parts valuation to 819 pence. C&W shares were down 20 pence at 458 pence at 1227 GMT. 

 Though some analysts noted there isn't a high degree of correlation between earnings estimate changes and share- price movement, there are concerns that a worsening credit cycle will push bond yields down - usually a signal that cyclicals will underperform the market. 

 Analysts said there could also be some winners, especially where corporates have embraced a "cash-is-king" philosophy or used sector consolidation to prop up or protect earnings. 

 "Cash-generation enables a corporate to ride out a slowdown. Companies in debt will struggle, because banks will change lending policies and investors will be less interested in buying corporate debt," said Batstone. 

 British American Tobacco PLC (BTI) is highly cash-generative, as is Groupe Danone (F.DON), which has actively been pushing down its debt burden. Analysts added such consumer products companies aren't as exposed to credit cycles. 

 Moreover, some mining companies, such as Rio Tinto PLC (RTP) and Anglo-American PLC (AAUK) will also see earnings grow 10% to 15% this year, primarily because of consolidation, analysts said. 

 Conversely, Unilever has been notoriously mum on forecasting revenue or earnings estimates for the coming year, and analysts believe the recent acquisition of BestFoods in the U.S. could leave the group exposed to a credit cycle, because its debt-to-equity ratio is now well over 100%. 

 "It's possible we won't see any top-line growth at Unilever this year," said one analyst. 

 WestLB Panmure analyst Henrik Lier said key capital goods makers such as car companies will be exposed to a credit cycle. Fiat, Renault S.A. (F.RNA), its Korean counterpart, Renault Samsung Motors (Q.RSG) and Volkswagen A.G.(G.VOW) are most exposed, while Renault also has a lot of exposure to the U.S. and Japan, via its Nissan tie-up. 

 "We see a lot of risk coming from the world car market," he said. 

 Traditional cyclicals, such as steel, paper and chemical companies will also be hit. Steel-makers' earnings are forecast to be down 40% year-on-year, according to one U.S. investment house, meaning a slowdown will hurt the likes of stainless steel maker Sandvik AB (S.SAN), Usinor S.A. (F.USN) and ThyssenKrupp AG (G.TKP). The Finish paper company Stora Ensoi Oyi (SEO) could also see downgrades in coming quarters, as could German chemical conglomerate, BASF AG (BF G.BAS), analysts said. 

 The coming market downturn could actually turn out to be worse than the slowdown precipitated by the Asian currency and banking crisis in 1997 and 1998. At that time, earnings and top-line growth, which had been set to rise by as much as 10% to 20%, ground to a virtual halt for most corporates. Only multinationals sitting on large cash reserves successfully weathered the three-year storm. 

 However, in the past three years, falling interest rates prompted many companies to switch from expensive equity into cheaper debt, and that now leaves them highly geared and exposed to the vagaries of the economic cycle. 

 Banks have also been guilty of this, which means the likes of HSBC Holdings PLC(HBC) and Standard Chartered PLC (U.STA) could be vulnerable, analysts said. Lehman Brothers said banks are well known for their balance sheet gearing and that banks in the Far East look most vulnerable to market concerns over a credit cycle.

 BOCA RATON, Fla. -(Dow Jones)- Artesyn Technologies Inc. (ATSN) lowered its first quarter expectation to a cash loss of 5 cents to 10 cents a share, citing a significant drop in demand for communications products. 

 A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of eight analysts yielded a mean cash earnings estimate of 25 cents a share for the first quarter. Cash earnings, as defined by Artesyn, excludes goodwill amortization. 

 In a press release Thursday, the provider of communications equipment and logistics services projected first quarter revenue would decline about 10% from the year ago. 

 Cash earnings for the year-ago first quarter were $11.1 million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $159.6 million. 

 Artesyn said its end-market customers have responded to an U.S. economic slowdown by reducing manufacturing levels and rescheduling product deliveries. 

 The company expects the lower demand - which fell short particularly in the computing-storage and carrier-enterprise markets - to continue through the second quarter. 

 Revenue should improve in the second half, Artesyn said, as shipments of new products begin. 

 The revised outlook is considerably more cautious than the company's earlier guidance. In January Artesyn predicted revenue growth of 10% to 15% for the first half and about 20% for the second half. 

 For the full year, the company currently expects cash earnings of 60 cents to 70 cents a share on projected revenue of $700 million to $725 million. 

 A Thomson Financial/First Call survey of nine analysts produced a mean cash earnings estimate of $1.33 a share for the year. 

 The consensus view was reduced from $1.72 a share since Artesyn issued a profit warning in December. 

 The company's 2000 cash earnings were $1.25 a share on revenue of $690.1 million.

 WSJ.COM WRAP: Heinz Plans To Lay Off 1,900 Workers

PITTSBURGH -(Dow Jones)- Hurt by weak tuna prices and declining
pet-food sales, H. J. Heinz Co. (HNZ) announced 1,900 layoffs, the bulk
from the closure of its Puerto Rico tuna business, and said it will
consolidate its North American pet-food operations.


 The maker of Heinz ketchup and StarKist tuna also said Thursday that profit increased 58% in its fiscal third quarter, meeting lowered expectations. Earlier this month, Heinz said it would report earnings for its third and fourth quarters, and for its next fiscal year as well, that would be lower than analysts had forecast. The company cited low prices for tuna products and the high cost of energy as the main reasons for its warning. 

 Heinz's tuna operations in Puerto Rico will be closed at the end of April. In addition, the company will divest itself of eight fishing boats and related equipment. 

 The company also will move its North American canned pet-food operations to its existing manufacturing center in Bloomsburg, Pa., next month. Its Terminal Island, Calif., facility will cease pet-food production, and begin processing fish, labeling StarKist products and conducting research and development. The facility, which will retain around 200 workers, also will serve as a distribution site. 

 The restructuring plan, which also involves centralizing the company's supply chain in Europe, is expected to save Heinz around $25 million next year and $60 million a year beginning in fiscal 2004. Heinz anticipates taking a $300 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as a result of the plan. 

 Bottom Line Grows 58% 

 For its fiscal third quarter, ended Jan. 31, the company posted net income of $270.5 million, or 77 cents a diluted share, compared with $171.1 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 Both periods included one-time items. Excluding pretax costs of 14 cents a share to implement its Operation Excel plan, and a gain of 27 cents a share related to tax planning and new tax legislation in Italy, earnings in the latest period totaled $227.4 million, or 65 cents a diluted share. That matched a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The third quarter of fiscal 2000 included restructuring charges and pretax implementation costs of 15 cents a share. Without the items, earnings were $227.2 million, or 63 cents a share. 

 But while Heinz's bottom line improved in the latest period, sales slipped 1.1% to $2.27 billion from $2.29 billion a year earlier. Heinz attributed the decline to "the unfavorable impact of foreign currency" exchange rates. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell nearly 11% due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. 

 "With the particular exceptions of weakness in tuna pricing and the effect of currency, Heinz's underlying earnings were generally strong, fueled by rapid growth in our leading businesses, including Heinz ketchup, food-service products and Heinz Frozen Food," William R. Johnson, the company's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a written statement. 

 Sales of ketchup, condiments and sauces rose more than 9% in North America, boosted by the popularity of the EZ Squirt brand of ketchup, and its food-service ketchup business. However, overall North American sales fell 2% to $1.01 billion, due mainly to lower tuna prices and lower volume for canned pet food. 

 Meanwhile, sales at the company's North American frozen-food business rose 13% to $256.5 million and volume increased 12% amid strong demand for Bagel Bites snacks, Smart Ones frozen entrees, and Boston Market home-style meals.

 UAL Expects Lower First Quarter Results

 HERNDON, Va. -(Dow Jones)- UAL Corp. (UAL) expects to "substantially" miss analysts' previous loss estimates of $2.82 a share, making it the fifth airline to post a profit warning this quarter. 

 Eleven analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call now expect the airline to report a loss of $2.93 cents a share for the first quarter, after updating their projections on Wednesday. 

 The company attributed the shortfall to an industry-wide softening of business travel demand and delays in settling labor contracts. 

 UAL also blamed its profit warning on a decrease in higher-yielding close-in bookings and weaker-than-expected first quarter revenue compared with a year ago. 

 The company earned $136 million, or 84 cents a diluted share, excluding charges, on revenue of $4.55 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, 2000. 

 Few airlines have escaped these industry woes. America West Holdings Corp. (AWA), the No. 9 airline, Trans World Airlines Inc. (TWAIQ), the failed carrier slated to be acquired by AMR Corp. (AMR), and Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK), the No. 10 airline, all expect to miss analysts' first quarter estimates. 

 Just this week, Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) and Northwest Airlines Corp (NWAC) warned they would miss analysts' first quarter estimates because of a drop in business travel demand. 

 Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, expects to miss analysts' loss estimates of 46 cents a share, and lose 70 cents to 90 cents a share in the quarter ending March 31. 

 Northwest expects to miss Wall Street loss projections of 59 cents a share on Wednesday, to post a loss of $130 million to $150 million, or $1.55 to $1.80 a diluted share, excluding items. 

 US Airways Group Inc. (U), which plans to merge with UAL's United Airlines pending egulatory approval, cited the economic slowdown, competition from low-cost carriers and continued high fuel costs. The airline expects to report first quarter results well below analysts previous estimates of $1.12 a share. 

 Shaky labor relations in the airline industry further cut into UAL's financial results. Like its competitors, UAL's United Airlines spent most of the quarter, if not the past year, attempting to settle contract disputes with its unions. 

 On Wednesday, the International Association of Machinists (IAM) broke off talks with United, citing issues related to  United's proposed acquisition of US Airways. United has been negotiating with the International Association of Machinists District 141M for almost a year. The mechanics' contract became amendable on July 12. 

 UAL's far reaching problems will extend into its 2001 results. The company now expects to report income below previous guidance levels, which assumes its acquisition of US Airways. 

 In early February, the airline expected to report breakeven earnings per share for fiscal 2001, while analysts currently expect the company to earn $1.78 a share for the year. 

 UAL earned $322 million, or $2.38 a share, excluding charges and other items, on revenue of $19.35 billion, in 2000. 

 To improve its financial performance, UAL will cut $200 million in costs. 

 Company officials weren't immediately available to comment on what those cost cuts will entail.

 Earnings Projections  Cut  for Compaq --- Analysts Expect Profit of About 17 Cents a Share --- Company Hasn't Altered Outlook

 Wall Street analysts are paring their first-quarter earnings projections for Compaq Computer Corp., one of a few big tech companies that hasn't recently lowered its expectations.   

 Amid worries that the U.S. computer-spending slowdown has spread to Compaq's key markets, analysts appear to be embracing a consensus profit of about 17 cents a diluted share, compared with a prior consensus of 20 cents a share, according to Charles R. Hill, research director at First Call/Thomson Financial. Current estimates range from a high of 22 cents to as low as 15 cents a share.   

 Tuesday, a Compaq spokesman said the company hadn't altered its outlook. In January, Chief Executive Michael D. Capellas said the Houston computer maker was expecting a profit of 21 cents a share on sales of $9.5 billion. A year ago, it earned 16 cents a diluted share on sales of $9.51 billion in the first quarter. Compaq is expected to release results on April 24.   

 In January, Mr. Capellas pegged Compaq's outlook on continued gains in server-computers and data-storage products as well as healthy international sales. Since then, server and storage rivals Sun Microsystems Inc. and EMC Corp. have lowered their forecasts, and chip maker Intel Corp. has sharply cut its outlook.   

 "Everything (Compaq is) in is under pressure," said Bear Stearns & Co. analyst Andrew J. Neff, who in late February pared his profit estimate for Compaq to 17 cents a share on revenue of $9.5 billion. Mr. Neff also sliced his full-year estimate to 75 cents a share from $1.15 and lowered his sales projection to $40.4 billion, down $5.2 billion from a prior estimate.   

 Since Mr. Neff lowered his outlook, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase's JP Morgan H&Q, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Robertson, Stephens Inc., Wit SoundView Corp. and Lehman Brothers have followed suit.   

 Mark Specker, analyst at Wit SoundView, lowered his first-quarter Compaq estimate to 18 cents a share from 21 cents and cut his quarterly sales forecast to $9.25 billion from $9.6 billion. "The hard thing is knowing how far down is down," he said. Mr. Specker added that he believes European markets "slowed down appreciably in the month of February." He said in light of Intel's warning of weaker server-computer sales, Compaq's server sales and margins would be lower than he forecast. "That's Compaq's principal source of profit," said Mr. Specker, noting that as firms pare spending on computers, they are more apt to trim servers.   

 He also lowered his estimate for the year to profit of $1.08 a share, compared with a prior estimate of $1.22 a share.

 ADR REPORT-U.S. bear markets growl, global ADRs sold off.

 NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Shares of non-U.S. companies traded in the United States were dragged down on Wednesday as growing alarm about the sluggish economy and Japanese banks sent the Dow Jones industrial average below the 10,000 mark for the first time since mid-October 2000. 

 The Bank of New York's index of leading American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) fell for the third straight day, dropping 3.53 percent to 110.80 in afternoon trade, led down by a 3.87 percent drop in the BONY index of leading Asian companies, as Wall Street's gloom spread around the globe. 

 Weak corporate profits and a steep decline in European markets sparked a fury of broad-based selling, and the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 325 points, or 3.15 percent, to 9,967. 

 "Everybody left last night thinking that European stocks were going to have a rally on the Nasdaq rise at the end of the day on Tuesday. Then, the Nasdaq futures dropped this morning, which soured the mood, and there was no follow-through buying at all," said Dominic Freud, international equities trader at SG Cowen. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 35.4 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 1,162.76, burying the broad market more deeply in bear territory. 

 Investors' nerves were further jangled after a major international rating agency expressed concern about the financial health of nearly a score of Japanese banks. 

 The U.S.-traded shares of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi fell to a new 52-week low of $8.42. In later trade, the shares stood at $8.45, down more than 11 percent, or $1.09. 

 U.S. President George W. Bush expressed concern on Wednesday over the sharp drop in stock prices but said he had "great faith" in the U.S. economy. 

 Still, the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index continued its decline, down 60.23 points, or 2.95 percent to 1954.26. 

 "The market would listen if (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan spoke," said Freud, "But right now, Bush doesn't have the credibility." 

 After showing greater resilience to recent Wall Street weakness on Tuesday, Asian tech stocks dived down again on Wednesday, with the biggest losses among the beleaguered computer chip makers, faced with fears of lessening demand for their products. 

 "In the past even if demand was marginal, it always grew, and you were able to model revenues on a combination of capacity and utilization," said one New York-based trader of Asian ADRs who declined to be named. 

 "This time around, you can't do that because there's a real threat that for the year demand will fall." 

 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. , the world's No. 2 chip foundry, fell 1.72 percent, extending steep losses on Monday, to trade at 19.46. 

 Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc. , the world's No 3 contract chip maker, fell 7.1 percent to trade at $27-13/16. 

 Shares of pan-Asian Internet media company Chinadotcom fell 11 percent to trade at $3, after the Hong Kong-based company forecast a 25 percent drop in first-quarter 2001 revenue from the fourth quarter 2000 due to softness in its core operations and other factors. 

 India was the only major Asian index on the upside as fund managers hunted for bargains, sending the ADRs of the country's second most valuable software firm, Infosys Technologies Ltd. , up 5.45 percent to $68-7/8. 

 European stocks were hammered to their lowest levels since the start of November 1999, and the BONY index of leading European companies fell 2.87 percent to 119.23. 

 Europe's tech and telecommunications sectors were still reeling from recent growth and profit warnings from Swedish mobile telephone maker Ericsson , British telecommunications company Cable & Wireless Plc , and German technology supplier Siemens AG . 

 Ericcson extended its losses, falling 8.06 percent to $6-3/16, and Siemens was down 3.54 percent to $105.81. 

 After falling 25 percent after a profit warning on Tuesday, Cable & Wireless fell a further 10.83 percent to $20.66. 

 The world's No. 1 handset maker and Ericsson's arch-rival, Finland's Nokia declined to comment on Wednesday on renewed market rumors that it would follow its peers and warn about first-quarter 2001 profits. Nokia's ADRs fell 3.63 percent to trade at $21.30 

 In Eastern Europe, Hungary's key index hit a one-year low, weighed down by shares in the country's leading telecommunications company, Magyar Tavkozlesi Vallalat Rt., or Matav, , whose ADRs fell 4.1 percent to $14.72, victim to the sector gloom across Western Europe, analysts said. 

 The BONY index of leading Latin American companies was down 0.94 percent to 93.84, showing the greatest resistance to the Wall Street gloom. 

 Despite a report to clients on Tuesday in which investment bank ABN Amro said the recent drop in Mexican media stocks provided a good entry point for investors, Mexico's largest broadcaster, Grupo Televisa , saw its ADRs fall 1.09 percent to $37.20. 

 The ADRs of its rival, No 2 broadcaster TV Azteca fall further, dropping 2.14 percent to $8.70.

 KPNQwestweighed down by Cable & Wireless.

     AMSTERDAM, March 14 (Reuters) - KPNQwest shares ranked among 

 the Amsterdam bourse's top percentage losers on Wednesday, 

 weighed down by a profit warning from British peer Cable & 

 Wireless , analysts said. 

     Shares of the pan-European data communications company, a 

 joint venture between Dutch KPN Telecom NV and U.S. carrier 

 Qwest Communications International Inc, fell five percent to 

 19.30 euros on relatively low trading volume. The main AEX index 

 lost 0.6 percent. 

     "It's the news flow from Cable & Wireless that's being 

 extrapolated to KPNQwest," a London-based analyst said. 

     C&L on Tuesday warned that its earnings growth would slow 

 due to lower prices for Internet connectivity in Japan and the 

 United States and said it would cut 4,000 jobs. 

     "KPNQwest shares didn't react as much as other stocks 

 yesterday," said another London-based analyst. Its competitors 

 include Colt and Energis. 

     Analysts dismissed speculation the shares were down on 

 expectations that KPN Telecom, in dire need for cash to cut its 

 21 billion euros ($19.1 billion) of debt, wants to sell its 

 stake in KPNQwest - talk that has swirled for some time now. 

 "Obviously KPN is in quite a desperate situation, but to 

 whom would they sell it?" a third London-based analyst said. 

 "There aren't many European contenders with a lot of cash 

 around, and why would Qwest want to raise its stake?" 

 Qwest's president of worldwide operations, Afshin Mohebbi, 

 on Tuesday reiterated KPN Telecom did not want to sell its stake 

 in KPNQwest. 

     "No one believes the denial," said one Amsterdam-based 

 trader. 

     KPNQwest is building a fibre-optic network that stretches 

 20,000 kilometres across Europe, providing business customers 

 with high-speed Internet access services, which it expects to 

 complete in the third quarter of 2001.

 UPDATE 1-ST slips into red, sheds early gain.

 PARIS, March 14 (Reuters) - Franco-Italian chip maker STMicroelectronics lost early gains and turned negative on Wednesday after Deutsche Bank cut its outlook for the sector, adding weight to a warning from ST overnight on earnings. 

 Having led a rebound in battered tech stocks in early trade, as the market judged its warning on the first quarter as no big surprise, ST reversed an early three percent gain and slipped 1.28 percent into the red to 34.60 euros at 1058 GMT. 

 The stock, which was still outperforming the Paris blue-chip CAC-40 and the DJ Stoxx tech index , has fallen from 38.80 euros on March 7 and 42.59 euros on January 1. 

 ST's turnaround followed a slump in Nasdaq futures and a price target cut from Deutsche Bank to 55 euros. 

 Deutsche Bank also cut its earnings forecast for ST by 20 percent for 2001 and by 17 percent for 2002 and warned of a "hard landing" for semiconductor firms amid dismal industry fundamentals. 

 Traders said ST shares had not been immediately bitten by the group's own warning that sales and earnings per share would fall below its January forecasts as this had already been factored in by the market. 

 "ST was the only one in its sector that hadn't issued a profit warning, and those of us at the market level had already reduced our forecasts," said Eric Burkel, an analyst at Global Equities. "They are lucky with the timing because last week it would have gone down very badly." 

 Late on Wednesday ST said it expected first-quarter revenues to be above the $1.7 billion of a year ago but below the $2 billion it forecast in January due to memory product gains being parried by a letdown in sales of digital consumer products. 

 ST also forecast earnings per diluted share to meet the current market consensus of 39 cents, six cents below its previous expectations. As a result ST said it had cut capital expenditure plans for 2001 to $1.9 billion from $2.5 billion. 

 The capital expenditure cuts were well received by the market but hurt Dutch ASM Lithography , a supplier of chipmaking equipment to ST, whose shares subsequently fell over three percent. 

 "Although ST may be delaying the installment of equipment it still plans to ramp up capacity and generally it's preferential to save cash at this stage rather than just pushing ahead with investments just for the sake of it," said a London analyst. 

 He said the quarterly revisions were minimal and the full year was a forgivable $1.55 below targets and unlikely to upset year-on-year growth. 

 Traders were also heartened as ST said it still expected gross margins in the range of 44-45 percent and said sales growth should outpace the industry average in the first quarter. 

 "What reassures market is their forecast of unchanged gross margin for the first quarter, though I doubt they will be able to meet that target," said a Paris trader. 

 KBC Securities said ST's warning was no surprise and that it saw the semiconductor sector continuing to underperform.

 NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - The following stories were reported in the electronic version of The Wall Street Journal Wednesday: 

 *The Fed is expected to cut its key federal-funds rate by at least half a percentage point when it meets on Tuesday, a move meant to fuel an economic rebound in the second half. 

 *Stocks rebounded, but the rally erased only a part of Monday's sharp losses. The Nasdaq climbed 4.8 percent to 2014.80, the S&P 500 gained 1.5 percent and the industrial average ended up 0.8 percent. 

 *Schering-Plough is under investigation for its marketing practices. Prosecutors are focusing on whether the firm caused "unlawful inflation" of government reimbursements for certain drugs. 

 *Delta warned that it expects a first-quarter loss instead of the profit analysts had forecast. The airline blamed the economic slowdown and labour woes. 

 *Bristol-Myers Squibb was handed a defeat when a judge ruled that Mylan must be allowed to sell a generic version of Bristol's BuSpar anxiety drug.

 WRAPUP 1-U.S. transportation stocks suffer.

 NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Transportation stocks fell across the board on Tuesday, as a warning from Delta Airlines dragged on the troubled airline industry and broader economic fears put the brakes on the railroad sector. 

 Delta scaled back its forecast for the first quarter by much more than investors had expected, hitting other airlines as analysts predicted they also would be hit by slowing business travel, labor disputes and higher fuel costs. 

 Railroad stocks, which until now had been resilient to this year's market decline, caught some of the pessimism on fears that the U.S. economy will take longer to bounce back than previously thought. 

 The Dow Jones transportation average fell 3.2 percent to 2,769.74 points. All but two of its components were lower. 

 The Standard & Poors Airlines index fell almost 1.9 percent to 584.54 points, while the Standard & Poors Railroads index fell almost 4.1 percent to 549.89 points. 

 The airline and railroad declines follow bad news for the trucking industry on Friday, when regional freight carrier USFreightways issued a profit warning and said freight demand would continue to be soft throughout the month. 

 AIRLINES HIT 

 Delta shares fell $1.64, or 3.81 percent, to $41.46, after the No. 3 U.S. airline said it expects to post a first-quarter loss of $85 million to $110 million, or 70 cents to 90 cents a share, instead of the 46 cents profit analysts were expecting. 

 The airline said a weakening economy and the threat of a pilot strike had kept travelers away. Market watchers said the size of Delta's revision showed how the slowing economy has bled life from business travel as companies cut travel. 

 Northwest Airlines Corp. slipped $1-1/16, or almost 4.9 percent, to $20-11/16; AMR Corp. , which owns American Airlines, fell 51 cents, or almost 1.5 percent, to $34.30; and United Airlines parent UAL Corp. shed $1.64, or almost 4.3 percent, to $36.72. US Airways Group. fell $1.10, or 3.3 percent, to $32.20. 

 Delta's warning comes two weeks after U.S. Airways Group, the No. 6 U.S. airline, said it expects to post a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss due to slow business bookings and intense competition in East Coast markets. 

 Sam Buttrick, an airline analyst with UBS Warburg, said in a research note on Tuesday that the next profit warnings will likely come from Northwest and UAL. 

 "Delta's revenue shortfall is too large to be explained by company-specific factors, such as weather, completion factors, or the possibility of a 30-day cooling-off period with its pilots," Buttrick said. 

 RAILROADS 

 Railroad stocks were hit after the government reported U.S. retail sales fell in February for the first time since November 2000, prompting fears that slowing the economy may not bounce back in the second half of the year. 

 CSX fell $2.30, or almost 7 percent, to $30.87; Union Pacific dropped $1.15, or almost 2.1 percent, to $55.00; Norfolk Southern fell $0.99, or 5.7 percent, to $16.35; and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. slid $1.12, or 3.78 percent, to $28.48. 

 Still, even with Tuesday's declines, railroad stocks retained gains on the year to date. 

 But those gains may also have prompted selling, investors said, as shareholders decided to take cash off the table rather than risk a prolonged economic downturn. 

 "In a broader market sell-off people sell their winners," said Tim Ghriskey, who manages $138 billion in assets for Dreyfus Corp. 

 Of the 20 companies in the Dow Jones transportation index, the only gains came from shipper FedEx Corp. , up $0.10 at $42, and USFreightways Corp. , up 21/64 at $29-9/16. 

 USFreightways shares were down sharply on Friday after it said it has cut spending and reduced its workforce. Separately, DaimlerChrysler AG's truck maker, Freightliner, was reported on Friday to be preparing a costly program to sell thousands of new and used trucks piling up on dealers' lots.

 City - C&W and Motorola axe 11,000 worldwide.

 and Andrew Cave 

 CABLE & Wireless, the communications group, and Motorola, the mobile handsets-to-chipmaker, are to axe a total of 11,000 jobs worldwide. 

 Cable & Wireless shares tumbled 20pc after the group said 4,000 jobs would go after being hit by falling prices in the United States and Japan, with 2,700 of the redundancies being in Britain. 

 Graham Wallace, chief executive, said in a trading statement the cuts would come as the company reduced to five its 47 network operation centres over the next two years, and outsourced back office processes. 

 The shares fell 138 to 545p, their lowest since October 1998, despite a spokesman denying the trading statement amounted to a profit warning. 

 "It is a simple observation that any company with business in the US will be affected by the slowdown," he said. 

 He declined to say where the axe would fall but confirmed that some UK jobs will be lost. 

 Mr Wallace blamed "severe price reductions" in the US and other sectors of the company's markets and warned that reorganisation costs totalling #950m would be taken in the year to the end of March. 

 C&W said revenues across most of its global business had grown during the second half. However, in the US, certain market prices for internet connectivity were down by up to 50pc, while in Japan international voice prices had fallen 40pc in 10 months. 

 Mr Wallace said: "Our response is to reduce costs aggressively, focus our resources on higher-margin revenue and accelerate the deployment of value-added services, such as managed web and application hosting." 

 He said Cable & Wireless was "still strongly placed" thanks to its financial strength and focus on markets. 

 He expects full-year, earnings per share of 14p to 16p, before exceptional items and goodwill. This compares with an analyst consensus of 17.3p. 

 Motorola's decision to cut 7,000 jobs in its mobile phone division comes on top of 5,000 redundancies in Ireland and the US, which the group announced in December. Including its semiconductor division, Motorola has now cut its 147,000-strong workforce by 18,000 since the end of last year. 

 Motorola said it was also considering cutting 700 jobs at its Swindon plant. Senior vice-president Leif Soderberg said: "The market for the coming year is shaping up to be smaller than most of us anticipated. 

 "There is a harsher market outlook that's affecting all of the wireless industry." 

 We have to size the business to be competitive."

 Northwest Airlines Warns That Its Loss Will Be Wider Than Analysts Expected

 WASHINGTON -- Northwest Airlines said it loss for the first quarter will be much larger than expected, due mainly to a decline in business travel. 

 The nation's fourth-largest airline forecast a loss of $130 million to $150 million, or between $1.55 a share and $1.80 a share, according to a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Wall Street had been expecting the carrier to record a loss of 59 cents a diluted share, according to a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Northwest (NWAC), St. Paul, Minn., said that January revenue met its expectations, and domestic revenue per available seat mile was up 11.2%. 

 But the carrier said it remains cautious, "as we expect to see continued softness in our mix of business travelers, which would have an adverse impact on yields and revenue." 

 Northwest is only the latest of several airlines to lower its estimates for the first quarter. Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) on Tuesday warned that it anticipates a first-quarter loss instead of the profit that analysts had been expecting. The third-largest U.S. airline cited a weaker economy and pilot labor woes that are prompting passengers to avoid bookings. US Airways Group Inc. (U) also has issued a profitwarning. 

 Northwest has seen its share of labor unrest, too. Contract talks broke off Sunday night with its mechanics' union, which earlier this month voted to authorize job actions late Sunday against the company. But President Bush took emergency action and barred the 10,000 unionized workers from going on strike Monday. Mr. Bush, who has said that a strike could harm the economy, added that the mechanics must stay on the job for an additional 60 days. 

 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Northwest posted a net loss of $69 million, or 84 cents a share, but beat Wall Street expectations excluding one-time items. The company was hurt by adverse weather and more-costly fuel. But it said it was able to keep costs in check and benefited from strong revenue growth in its passenger and cargo businesses and from its marketing alliance with Continental Airlines. 

 Northwest's chief financial officer, Mickey Foret, has warned that costs will rise in 2001 because the company has no fuel hedges in place and is taking out seats to put more legroom into its first-class and business-class cabins

 McDonald's Lowers Earnings Outlook, Citing Concerns Over Mad-Cow Disease

 OAK BROOK, Ill. -- McDonald's Corp. cut its earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year, citing a drop in sales amid persistent consumer concerns about tainted European beef. 

 The fast-food chain said global systemwide sales for the first two months of the first quarter came to $6.2 billion, up 4% on a constant-currency basis, but essentially flat on a reported basis. The figures on a constant-currency basis exclude the effects of foreign-currency translation. 

 Sales were hurt by worries about the mad-cow issue in Europe, continuing weak economic conditions in certain markets, and difficult comparisons against a strong quarter a year earlier, the company said. Weaker foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen, affected reported sales. 

 As a result, McDonald's (MCD) said annual earnings per share, in constant currencies, could be four to five cents lower than previously estimated, primarily because of "ongoing business challenges in Europe." Analysts are expecting earnings of $1.60 a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 However, the company later said there are "early signs" that consumer confidence is recovering, adding there is "no evidence in our business" that U.S. customers are shying away from eating hamburgers because of health concerns in Europe. 

 Still, McDonald's lowered earnings outlook prompted analysts at Bear Stearns & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney to cut their earnings estimates for this year and next. 

 As of 4 p.m. EST on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of McDonald's fell 25 cents to $27.55. 

 For the first quarter, the fast-food chain now expects earnings of 29 cents to 30 cents on a reported basis and 30 cents to 31 cents on a constant-currencies basis. Analysts are looking for earnings of 32 cents a share. 

 "We anticipated difficult world-wide comparisons in the first quarter due to strong marketing programs last year and the extra day in 2000 due to leap year," Jack M. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a written statement. "However, the effect of consumer concerns regarding the European beef supply has persisted longer than we expected, despite the fact that McDonald's overall safety and quality standards lead the industry and provide the benchmark for safe food around the world." 

 In Europe, constant-currency sales growth was flat for January and February. At the same time, sales in the U.S. grew 4%. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 2%, while Latin America sales rose 9%. 

 Tuesday, McDonald's, the restaurant industry's largest buyer of beef, addressed the growing concerns about mad-cow disease, saying it will watch its beef supply more carefully to ensure compliance with federal standards for the feeding of cattle. 

 Mad-cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is a fatal brain-wasting ailment of cattle. Scores of European consumers are believed to have contracted a similar type of disease by eating contaminated beef. So far, neither mad-cow disease nor the human equivalent have been detected in the U.S. 

 Mr. Greenberg said the company is taking steps to improve financial performance and expects to return to double-digit earnings per share growth for the remainder of the year. 

 To that end, McDonald's said it is adding more items on the menu in European restaurants, including a pork version of its popular Big Mac burger. It is also trying to assure European consumers that its food is safe, reviewing budgets for opportunities to cut costs, and reducing 2001 capital expenditures in certain emerging markets. 

 The profit warning by McDonald's follows a series of estimate reductions over the past couple of months by analysts who cited many of the same concerns the company listed Wednesday. 

 In late February, Chief Financial Officer Michael Conley warned that the mad-cow scare had "tempered" results, but he added that the impact seemed confined to a few countries. At the time, he gave no figures to indicate the significance of the effect on sales.

 Siemens Seen Safe From Regulatory Backlash After Warning

 BERLIN -(Dow Jones)- Siemens AG'S (SI) profit warning this week close on the heels of its U.S. stock market listing didn't win any friends in the investment community, but it looks unlikely to run afoul with German or U.S. securities regulators. 

 Some investors were outraged after the engineering and telecommunications equipment maker warned Tuesday - one day after its shares were introduced in the U.S. - that it wouldn't reach sales and profit goals because of problems at chip maker Infineon Technologies AG, in which Siemens owns a 71% stake. 

 But the timing of such statements aren't subject to regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a spokesman said. 

 "If there are fraudulent statements, there is potential for SEC action," said the SEC spokesman, who declined to comment on Siemens specifically. 

 Peter Gottal, a spokesman for Siemens in Munich, said the company's actions conformed to SEC regulations. 

 In Germany, listed companies are required to issue statements on corporate developments that might affect their shares. The statements must be issued via an official electronic release - a so-called ad hoc statement. 

 Regina Noessner, a spokeswoman for the German stock market regulator, said that only after observing share performance over a period of time can it be determined whether a statement affected the share price and should have been reported via an ad hoc release. 

 Meanwhile, Germany's main shareholder protection group, the Schutzgemeinschaft der Kleinaktionaere, said there was nothing it could do against the company. 

 "We can't do anything. It's very difficult to prove (that they knew of the problems in advance)," spokeswoman Reinhild Keitel said. 

 In response to the bad news, Siemens shares fell by more than 2% Tuesday. The decline continued Wednesday, when Siemens shares dropped EUR4.06, or 3.5%, to EUR113.69 in Frankfurt amid a decline of around 2.7% in the wider market. 

 The profit warning has also caused a number of analysts to lower earnings per share expectations on the stock. Merck Finck dropped its 2001 EPS estimate to EUR5 from EUR6, while M.M. Warburg said it plans to follow suit and is concerned that the company won't reach the 2000 EPS level of EUR4.46. One broker characterized the move as "really stupid." 

 Siemens called the timing of the profit warning a "coincidence," saying it felt obliged to make a statement about its performance after Swedish rival Telefon AB LM Ericsson (ERICY) issued a profit warning Monday. 

 "Normally, we would have made the statement in our quarterly report, but after Ericsson's warning we felt compelled to give an update on our performance," Siemens' Gottal said. 

 Siemens is due to issue its quarterly report April 26. 

 But there are concerns that the company intentionally delayed the statement, with rumors of a profit warning circulating through equity markets a week ahead of time. 

 Company Claims Ad Hoc Release Not Needed 

 Under German law, failure to issue an ad hoc statement is punishable with fines of up to DEM3 million. Six companies were fined in 2000 for failing to properly issue ad hoc releases. 

 Siemens statement Tuesday - that it wouldn't be able to meet its goal of sales growth of at least 10% and better profit growth this year - didn't need to be an ad hoc release because of its contents, Gottal said. 

 The company stuck to its target, but said it would meet this target excluding Infineon, which had been included in the original expectations. The company last made this statement at its general shareholders meeting Feb. 22. 

 For Infineon, there is no official profit expectations, so it wasn't a profit warning, and therefore, there was no need for an ad hoc release, Gottal said. 

 A spokeswoman at the German regulatory authority, Bundesaufsichtsamt fuer den Wertpapierhandel, declined to comment specifically on Siemens. 

 Despite the likely lack of regulatory backlash, private legal action is a possibility for investors claiming damages - but the law protecting shareholder rights is less favorable in the U.S. than in Germany, said Bernd Jochem, a lawyer specializing in shareholder rights with Munich law firm Rotter Rechtsanwaelte. 

 Jochem is involved in putting together a class-action suit in the U.S. against German software company Intershop Communications AG (ISHP). 

 But he said that as Siemens only has a stock listing and no headquarters in the U.S., a legal case in the U.S. would be more difficult.

 WSJ.COM: Tech Stocks Retreat As Profit Worries Dominate

 WSJ.com 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Technology stocks tumbled Wednesday as the Nasdaq again slid below the 2000 mark in dicey trading marked by worries that the U.S. is headed toward a full-blown recession and will take the global economy along with it. 

 In midafternoon trading, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 49.60 to 1966.10. The Dow Jones Internet Index lost 2.80 to 79.20, and Morgan Stanley's high-tech 35 index shed 13 to 559.20. 

 Tuesday, the Nasdaq climbed 4.8% to close above the psychologically important 2000 mark after a painful drop Monday amid a gloomy outlook for corporate earnings in the face of a once-roaring U.S. economy that's stuck in neutral. The sharp reversal of fortunes among technology companies, and dot-coms in particular, has investors scrambling for any safe haven to ride out the storm. 

 "Our thesis continues to be that we are in a bear tech market that will see intermittent failing rallies," Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Milunovich said in a Wednesday research note. "Tech is now oversold, in our view, as it was in mid-December and early-January," but he added that "A rally is possible." 

 Investors remained jittery ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next Tuesday, in which it is expected to cut the key federal-funds rate at least a half a percentage point. But market watchers remain divided over whether the move will be enough to ignite a turnaround, with some analysts saying the rate cut has already been priced into stocks. 

 Milunovich doesn't see fundamental improvement until the fourth quarter, when corporate earnings should enjoy an easier year-earlier comparison and manufacturers should have cleared out inventory stockpiles. "We doubt the stocks will move sustainably higher before then." 


                  Japanese Slump



Somber news from Japan also fueled Wednesday's selloff. The Japanese
stock market hit 16-year lows recently, and the Japanese finance
minister has acknowledged the threat of deflation, leading some analysts
to venture that the impact will spread to Europe, which has remained
stable as the world's two biggest economies struggle.



Tech bellwethers led Tuesday's partial Nasdaq recovery, but those
issues pulled back Wednesday amid more servings of dour news across the
tech sector. Oracle, Microsoft, Intel, Sun Microsystems and
International Business Machines all traded lower.



Oracle fell 88 cents to $16.06, Microsoft shed 56 cents to $53.63,
Intel lost 63 cents to $38.75 and Sun Micro slid 63 cents to $18.50, all
on Nasdaq. IBM shed $2.64 to $95.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.



Compaq Computer added 42 cents to $18.80 on the Big Board after
slipping in early trading. Wall Street analysts have trimmed their
expectations for Compaq's first-quarter earnings even though the No. 1
maker of personal computers hasn't issued a profit warning. Analysts now
expect first-quarter earnings of about 17 cents a diluted share instead
of 20 cents, saying Compaq's server sales will probably come in lower
than expected and Europe, a big market for Compaq, also is showing
weakness. Intel in its revenue warning last week said that server sales
had slowed, impacting sales of its computer chips.



               Dell and Gateway Trade Higher



PC makers Dell Computer and Gateway also traded higher. Dell added 38
cents to $24.31 and Gateway added 19 cents to $16.09, both on Nasdaq.



The battered online advertising sector came under further scrutiny
from Internet analyst Henry Blodget at Merrill Lynch, who said that most
online advertising company estimates are "still too high and will likely
need to be cut." Blodget cited CNET Networks, Terra Lycos, iVillage,
ValueClick, plus the online operations of most media companies. The
analyst sees the online ad market declining 25% in 2001.



CNET was up six cents to $9.06, Terra Lycos was down 50 cents to
$11.38, iVillage was off three cents to 88 cents and ValueClick shed six
cents to $3.75, all on the Nasdaq Stock Market.



Blodget noted that AOL Time Warner represented "about 38% of the total
online ad market in 2000 and will continue to gain share in 2001." He
expects the Internet-media giant to show a 30% rise in advertising
revenue in 2001, plus "an amazing 45% market share in 2001."



AOL Time Warner was down 58 cents to $40.08 on the New York Stock
Exchange.



Yahoo! shed 75 cents to $15.31 on Nasdaq. The Web portal said that its
head of sales will leave in May. The announcement comes a week after
Yahoo issued its first-ever earnings warning and said it would launch of
a search for a new chief executive.



Telecommunications remains a sore spot, with stocks of both equipment
makers and service providers floundering.



Nextel Communications tumbled $5.94, or 29%, to $14.50 on Nasdaq after
the wireless concern warned of a first-quarter shortfall amid slowing
business purchases, corporate downsizing and higher costs.



Nortel Networks lost 68 cents to $15.80 on the Big Board. The
telecommunications-equipment maker said that its chief operating
officer, Clarence J. Chandran, is taking a medical leave of absence of
six to 12 months. John Roth, president and chief executive, will take
over Chandran's day-to-day responsibilities while he is on leave.



Lucent Technologies fell 24 cents to $11.01 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The leading maker of telecommunications gear said it is
pursuing strategic alternatives for its optical-fiber business,
including a possible sale or joint venture, confirming weeks of
speculation.



Ericsson continued its slide, seeing its American depositary receipts
shed $1.16 to $6.13. The telecom-gear maker is suffering fallout from
its Monday warning that sales of its wireless network equipment are
slowing.



A bright spot among telecom stocks was No. 2 long-distance company
WorldCom, which added $1.31 to $16.50 on Nasdaq. Chief Executive Bernard
Ebbers maintained the company's fiscal 2001 guidance and said that
business in the first quarter is doing "extremely well." The
telecommunications company also unveiled new managed Web-hosting
services.



Elsewhere, Comverse Technology tumbled $6 to $64 on Nasdaq. The
developer of communications software and systems late Tuesday reported
better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings but suffered ratings
downgrades from Goldman Sachs.



Franco-Italian chip maker STMicroelectronics fell 55 cents to $32.70
on the Big Board. STMicro late Tuesday warned that first-quarter
earnings will miss the company's internal expectations but will be in
line with Wall Street's mean estimate of 39 cents a share. The company
said some customers, especially in the U.S., have canceled or postponed
their orders.



EPresence lost 44 cents to $6.75 on Nasdaq. The provider of e-business
and Internet services adjusted its first-quarter outlook, citing tighter
market conditions and the purchase of a 10% stake in an Australian
e-commerce company.

 Northwest Air 1Q Warning Signals Waning Business Demand

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- In the latest sign weaker business demand for air travel is taking a toll on the airline industry, Northwest Airlines Corp. (NWAC) Wednesday became the nation's fourth major carrier to issue a first-quarter warning. 

 More airlines are expected to warn investors of earnings or revenue shortfalls in the weeks to come, leaving no more than two or three carriers in black for the quarter. 

 Citing a decline in high-yield business travel, Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, said in a letter to investors and analysts it could lose three times more money than had been anticipated in the quarter. 

 The Minneapolis/St. Paul carrier expects to lose $130 million to $150 million, or $1.55 a diluted share to $1.80 a diluted share, excluding items. Analysts had expected a loss of 59 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Financial/First Call. 

 Despite the scope of the anticipated loss, the news didn't come as a great surprise to analysts given the mounting signs of softening demand for corporate travel. 

 "What else is new?" asked Julius Maldutis, analyst at CIBC World Markets Corp. in New York. 

 US Airways Group Inc. (U) said this month its first-quarter results will be "well below" the then-consensus estimate of a loss of $1.12 a share, and Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) said Tuesday it expects to lose between 70 cents and 90 cents a diluted share instead of a profit that analysts had expected. 

 Both carriers cited the softening business traffic, among other things. Analysts now expect US Airways and Delta, the No. 6 and No. 3 U.S. carriers, to lose $1.60 a share and 50 cents a share, respectively, according to Thomson Financial. 

 "I think we're going to see other carriers basically also indicate that the softening in business traffic is what's causing the fundamental problem," Maldutis predicted. 

 The analyst said next warnings will come "probably" from AMR Corp. (AMR) and UAL Corp. (UAL), parents of the nation's No. 2 and No. 1 carriers. 

 AMR, which owns American Airlines, is expected to earn 34 cents a share in the quarter, while UAL, parent of United Airlines, is expected to lose $2.82 a share, according to Thomson Financial. 

 Northwest shares recently traded down $1.38, or 6.7%, at $19.31 on volume of 356,600, compared with the daily average turnover of about 848,000 shares. 

 The American Stock Exchange Airline Index was down 3.94 points, or 2.8%, at 139.57. 

 UBS Warburg LLC analyst Samuel Buttrick, who Tuesday predicted Northwest would soon issue a profit warning, wrote: "It's probably United's turn next." 

 Citing higher labor costs and fuel prices, UAL has said it would post a loss in the first quarter. It expects to roughly break-even in 2001 if it completes its pending acquisition of US Airways. 

 "It is increasingly evident that the corporate slowdown in February and ... March is severe - and certainly taking most carriers by surprise with its swiftness and severity," Buttrick wrote. 

 "I think there's two or three airlines that are going to be profitable this quarter," said Helane Becker, analyst at Buckingham Research Group in New York. "We think the underlying (business) demand actually started to weaken in December." 

 Besides AMR, Continental Airlines Inc. (CAL) and Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), the No. 5 and No. 7 carriers, are expected to remain in the black. They are seen earning 26 cents a share and 17 cents a share, respectively. 

 Continental said last week its first-quarter revenue will be lowered by $10 million to $15 million because of the recent winter storm in the northeast region. 

 Becker suggested analyst estimates on AMR will likely be slashed, but said the carrier may "eke out a profit" at the end because "they are a beneficiary of the booking-away at Delta." 

 Delta, like many other airlines, is locked in contentious contract talks, and some customers are staying away from the carrier because of fears of a potential pilot strike. 

 Among other beneficiary of the customer avoidance of Delta, AirTran Holdings Inc. (AAI), its main competitor in  Atlanta, said Tuesday it's comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates of seven cents a diluted share for the first quarter.

 WSJ.COM WRAP:Northwest Air Sees Loss Wider Than Expected

 A WSJ.com News Roundup 

 WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Northwest Airlines Corp. (NWAC) said its loss for the first quarter will be much larger than expected, due mainly to a decline in business travel. 

 The nation's fourth-largest airline forecast a loss of $130 million to $150 million, or between $1.55 a share and $1.80 a share, according to a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 Wall Street had been expecting the carrier to record a loss of 59 cents a diluted share, according to a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Northwest, St. Paul, Minn., said that January revenue met its expectations, and domestic revenue per available seat mile was up 11.2%. 

 But the carrier said it remains cautious, "as we expect to see continued softness in our mix of business travelers, which would have an adverse impact on yields and revenue." 

 Northwest is only the latest of several airlines to lower its estimates for the first quarter. Delta Air Lines on Tuesday warned that it anticipates a first-quarter loss instead of the profit that analysts had been expecting. The third-largest U.S. airline cited a weaker economy and pilot labor woes that are prompting passengers to avoid bookings. US Airways Group also has issued a profit warning. 

 Northwest has seen its share of labor unrest, too. Contract talks broke off Sunday night with its mechanics' union, which earlier this month voted to authorize job actions late Sunday against the company. But President Bush took emergency action and barred the 10,000 unionized workers from going on strike Monday. Mr. Bush, who has said that a strike could harm the economy, added that the mechanics must stay on the job for an additional 60 days. 

 In the fourth quarter of 2000, Northwest posted a net loss of $69 million, or 84 cents a share, but beat Wall Street expectations excluding one-time items. The company was hurt by adverse weather and more-costly fuel. But it said it was able to keep costs in check and benefited from strong revenue growth in its passenger and cargo businesses and from its marketing alliance with Continental Airlines. 

 Northwest's chief financial officer, Mickey Foret, has warned that costs will rise in 2001 because the company has no fuel hedges in place and is taking out seats to put more legroom into its first-class and business-class cabins.

 Motorola Sets A Further  Cut  Of 7,000 Jobs

 CHICAGO, March 13 -- Motorola, the mobile phone maker, said today that it would eliminate 7,000 more jobs as it tries to strengthen its cellular phone unit amid an industrywide slowdown in sales. 

 The company, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said the job cuts -- equivalent to 5 percent of the work force -- would increase the reductions in its cellular phone operations this year to 12,000, or 36 percent of the unit's employees at the end of last year. 

 Its announcement followed a warning on Monday by a rival, LM Ericsson, that it expected a first-quarter loss of perhaps $500 million, instead of breaking even as it forecast in January. Motorola issued its own profit warning last month. 

 Motorola employs 140,000 people worldwide in all its businesses and ranks behind Nokia in cellular phone production. It said it would complete the job cuts in the next two quarters and take an unspecified charge against first-  and second-quarter results. 

 A statement by Mike S. Zafirovski, the company's president for personal communications, said: ''Unfortunately, this was a necessary next step for us to achieve renewal and stay competitive in today's dramatic business environment, particularly given the current slowdown in the economy. We anticipate growth, but at a slower pace. We must continue to adapt our overall cost structure, work force and production levels to a more competitive business model.'' 

 Today, Motorola's shares, trading ex dividend, rose 24 cents, to $15.20. In the last year, the shares have performed well below the broad market, falling from a 52-week closing high of $59. 

 The company said it was looking at a number of ''promising opportunities'' to improve its financial results in the second half of the year, including new strategic alliances, customer agreements and products. 

 A Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst, Brian Modoff, called the job cuts unsurprising and said Motorola must get new products out faster, adding: ''They need to reduce their overall expenses. We're not forecasting profitability in handsets this year.'' 

 The cellular phone unit's senior vice president for strategy, Leif Soderberg, declined to predict profitability. ''The overall economic climate is changing pretty rapidly,'' he said. ''A lot of people have been caught by surprise as to how fast that has changed, particularly in some of the technology sectors.'' 

 Projected cellular phone sales for 2001 industrywide have fallen sharply -- from a forecast of 500 million to 600 million earlier this year, to Motorola's below-500-million warning last month, to an estimate today, supported by Siemens, below 450 million. That would be a relatively modest 10 percent increase over the 410 million sold last year. 

 ''Handset growth is slowing worse than expectations,'' said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus. ''Therefore, you're going to see things like job cuts in the sector that's primarily a marketing and manufacturing business, where high talent is not as precious. Likely, we'll see more of this.''

 Analysts  Cut  Profit Estimates for Compaq; Firm Says It Hasn't Changed Its Outlook

 Wall Street analysts are paring their first-quarter earnings projections for Compaq Computer Corp., one of a few big tech companies that has not recently lowered its expectations.   

 Amid worries that the U.S. computer-spending slowdown has spread to Compaq's key markets, analysts appear to be embracing a consensus profit of about 17 cents a diluted share, compared with a prior consensus of 20 cents a share, according to Charles R. Hill, research director at First Call/Thomson Financial. Current estimates range from a high of 22 cents to as low as 15 cents a share.   

 Yesterday, a Compaq spokesman said the company hadn't altered its outlook. In January, Chief Executive Michael D. Capellas said the Houston computer maker was expecting a profit of 21 cents a share on sales of $9.5 billion. A year ago, it earned 16 cents a diluted share on sales of $9.51 billion in the first quarter. Compaq is expected to release results for on April 24.   

 In January, Mr. Capellas pegged Compaq's outlook on continued gains in server-computers and data-storage products as well as healthy international sales. Since then, server and storage rivals Sun Microsystems Inc. and EMC Corp. have lowered their forecasts, and chip maker Intel Corp. has sharply cut its outlook.   

 "Everything [Compaq is] in is under pressure," said Bear Stearns & Co. analyst Andrew J. Neff, who in late February pared his profit estimate for Compaq to 17 cents a share on revenue of $9.5 billion. Mr. Neff also sliced his full-year estimate to 75 cents a share from $1.15 and lowered his sales projection to $40.4 billion, down $5.2 billion from a prior estimate.   

 Since Mr. Neff lowered his outlook, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase's JP Morgan H&Q, Salomon Smith Barney Inc., Robertson, Stephens Inc., Wit SoundView Corp. and Lehman Brothers have followed suit.   

 Mark Specker, analyst at Wit SoundView, lowered his first-quarter Compaq estimate to 18 cents a share from 21 cents and cut his quarterly sales forecast to $9.25 billion from $9.6 billion. "The hard thing is knowing how far down is down," he said. Mr. Specker added that he believes European markets "slowed down appreciably in the month of February." He said that in light of Intel's warning of weaker server-computer sales, Compaq's server sales and margins would be lower than he forecast. "That's Compaq's principal source of profit," said Mr. Specker, noting that as firms pare spending on computers, they are more apt to trim servers.   

 He also lowered his estimate for the year to profit of $1.08 a share, compared with a prior estimate of $1.22 a share.   

 In 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Compaq was up 43 cents to $18.38. Its 52-week high is $35.

 12,000 victims of downturn.

 Falling revenues force Cable & Wireless and Motorola to cut jobs 

 Jane Martinson in New York 

 Two of the world's biggest telecommunications companies yesterday announced a total of almost 12,000 job cuts as the economic downturn continued to bite on both sides of the Atlantic. 

 Cable & Wireless is axing 4,000 of the 18,000 staff employed in its global division over the next 12 months, the company said as it issued a profit warning that took analysts and investors by surprise. 

 Two thirds of the division's workforce are employed in Britain, although it also has operations in Europe, Japan and the US. 

 Meanwhile Motorola, the world's second largest telecoms manufacturer, plans to reduce its staff by 7,700. This brings the total cut by the US company to more than 12,000 in the past three months. 

 Up to 700 jobs could go at Motorola's network base station plant in Swindon, Wiltshire. On top of that, the company wants to cut 7,000 jobs worldwide from its personal communications business. 

 These signs of economic distress come as global stock markets struggled to rise above two-year lows yesterday. Britain's main FTSE 100 index fell 105.8 points to a 27-month low of 5,720.7. Earlier the Nikkei 225 index had fallen 351.7 points to 11,819.7. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also lower in early trading. 

 There was some limited relief for the technology driven Nasdaq composite index after four straight days of decline. The index gained just over 1% to 1,948.60 by noon yesterday, after falling below 2,000 for the first time in more than two years on Monday. 

 The sharp declines in American shares have prompted a fall in consumer confidence in the US and a drop in retail sales, which is further hurting corporate profits. 

 Motorola and Cable & Wireless blamed the cost cutting programme on economic slowdown in the US. 

 Mike Zafirovski, the president of Motorola's personal communications sector, said: `Unfortunately, this was a necessary next step for us to achieve renewal and stay competitive in today's dramatic business environment, particularly given the current slowdown in the economy.' 

 Shares in C&W fell more than 20% after the company, which is one of the world's five biggest carriers of internet traffic, said that revenues were falling in both the US and Japan. The company blamed a 50% decline in prices for internet connectivity in the US over the past year as well as a drop in prices in Japan. Graham Wallace, the chief executive of Cable & Wireless, said: `Our response is to reduce costs aggressively, focus our resources on higher margin revenue and accelerate the deployment of value added services, such as managed web and application hosting.' 

 C&W is to take an exceptional charge of #500m for the year to pay for its `continued transformation' and the establishment of C&W Global. A further exceptional charge of #450m is expected to be taken this year due network and software upgrade costs. 

 Shares of Motorola rose to $15.01 after the announcement, well below a 52-week high of $57.11 reached last March. The telecoms sector, which was expected to expand exponentially on the back of the increase in internet traffic, has been hit hard by the latest downturn. 

 There was also bad news in continental Europe yesterday when Siemens, the German manufacturing concern, issued a profits warning a day after it celebrated achieving a listing on the US stock market.

 There was blood all over the high-tech sector yesterday as job losses, profits warnings and more dot.com disasters dominated the world's stock markets. 

 Cable & Wireless is to cut 4,000 jobs from its global division. The operation employs two-thirds of its 18,000 strong workforce in the UK. 

 A spokesman for C&W said the cuts were likely to be in proportion to where the job numbers were around the world. 

 The global business's main UK bases are in London, Birmingham, Warrington, Bracknell and Bletchley, near Milton Keynes. 

 Shares in Cable & Wireless closed down 138p at 545p, bringing its market value down by almost #3.9 billion to #15.25 billion. 

 Computer services company Synstar said it was making 70 of its UK staff redundant as part of an #8.5 million restructuring move. 

 The firm is cutting 140 jobs from its European workforce and half of these cuts will affect staff, mostly middle management, based at its offices in Bracknell, Bristol, Birmingham and at Livingston, Scotland. 

 The company said delays in signing contracts with a number of clients across Europe last year would mean full-year profits would come in 'below consensus market expectations' of #8.5 million, and possibly as low as #4.25 million before the restructuring charge is taken into account. 

 The shares closed down 81/4p to 371/1p. 

 Motorola, the world's No 2 mobile phone maker, said it would cut 7,000 jobs, or five per cent of its workforce. 

 A possible 700 job losses could be at the main UK base in Swindon, which is responsible for the production of network base stations. 

 Motorola, which issued its own profit warning last month, said the job cuts raised the total in its cell-phone operations, or personal communications sector, so far this year to 12,000, or 36 per cent of the unit's total employees at the end of last year. Motorola employs 140,000 people globally. 

 German electronics and engineering group Siemens became the latest European blue chip technology giant to send shivers through the market with a cut in its earnings outlook. 

 Shares in the company slumped by up to five per cent after it acknowledged it would not meet earlier targets. 

 E-district.net, which sacked its chief executive last month pending an investigation, said yesterday that auditors and forensic accountants had found that its registered users and revenues had been substantially overstated. 

 E-district, which runs the LeisureDistrict.net website and interactive TV channel, last month sacked chief executive Steven Laitman, suspended its shares and called in external advisers to look into financial irregularities. 

 It said yesterday that the investigators, from Cap Gemini Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers Forensic Service, found that advertising income was overstated by more than #1 million in the first half of last year. 

 The company said the fraud squad had been alerted. 

 E-district started proceedings against Mr Laitman for damages last month and his assets were frozen. He is contesting the matter. 

 E-district floated a year ago at the height of Internet fever, with a market capitalisation of more than #100 million. 

 And Internet consultancy Razorfish said it was poised to make more job cuts - just weeks after shedding 20 per cent of its workforce worldwide. 

 About 150 staff at Razorfish's London office will discover their fate this week.

 ANALYSIS-Global equity bloodbath puts world on recession alert. 

 By Alister Bull, European Economics Correspondent

 BRUSSELS, March 13 (Reuters) - Recent steep stock market losses in the world's three largest economies risk unseating already sluggish global growth as consumers and companies tighten belts after seeing trillions dollars of paper gains evaporate. 

 Paper profits burned off by the punctured tech-stock bubble rebound on the real economy because consumers spend less after seeing their wealth decline and companies pay more for raising capital. 

 Private consumption, investment and net exports are the essential ingredients of a country's gross domestic product and confidence is the thread that links them together. 

 No surprise then that central bankers have gone on recession alert since its abrupt decline in the U.S. and with Japan facing zero growth, the U.S. praying for a swift 'V' shaped recovery and Europe fearing for its exports. 

 Although most financial institutions have slashed their forecasts for global growth for this year, there remains an outside chance that the world economy may tip into recession and contract for two consecutive quarters. 

 The Paris-based Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development releases its new forecast on May 3. Its chief economist Ignazio Visco said on March 1 he was leaning towards a cut in U.S. 2001 growth estimates to two percent from 3.5 percent. 

 "There is a risk however that equity markets continue to fall, triggering even steeper declines in business and consumer confidence," Visco said. 

 "Such declines in confidence might in turn effect consumption and investment spending for a more protracted period, generating a more negative effect on domestic demand and larger spillover effect to the rest of the world," he added. 

 U.S. RETAIL SALES DECLINE

 An unexpected decline in U.S. retail sales in February, reported on Tuesday, highlighted the impact that falling consumer confidence is already having. 

 The OECD has warned that steep falls in equity markets could inflict serious damage on confidence and business investment and is currently adjusting its global growth forecast. 

 Since March 1, the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq index has dropped around 10 percent, Japan's Nikkei is down seven percent and on Tuesday Germany's Dax fell to a one year low below the psychological 6,000 level. 

 "What's happening is probably the final nail in the coffin of the new economy story," said economist Andrew Scott at the London Business School. 

 "There needs to be a big reassessment of outlooks because consumers in the U.S. borrowed heavily on the basis of perceived capital gains and this could hit spending heavily." 

 This possibility may lead the OECD to trim its forecast for U.S. 2001 growth to between 1.5 and 2.0 percent, a European monetary source said. 

 This would be similar to the International Monetary Fund's recent downward revision to 1.7 percent from 3.2 percent and contrasts with 2.0-2.5 percent forecast from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

 EUROZONE STRENGTH 

 "The stock market in the U.S. is one of the biggest question marks hanging over the global economy," said economist Fabio Scacciavillani at Goldman Sachs in London. 

 But an important support is being provided by the relative strength of the eurozone economy and the continued belief that stock market losses there have so far been a correction of past buoyancy. 

 The European Commission estimates that a 20 percent decline in U.S. stock prices would shrink U.S. GDP by 1.4 percent in the first year and 0.7 percent in the second, provided that there was no monetary policy easing to counteract the fallout. 

 In Europe, the same scale of decline would knock 1.1 percentage points off euro zone GDP in year one and 0.5 percent in year two. 

 This is because equities are estimated to make up only five percent of net household wealth in the 12-nation currency bloc, compared with 25 percent in the U.S. and 12 percent in Britain. 

 A sustained reaction in monetary policy would mute the damage and the Federal Reserve has already cut rates by one percentage point to support growth. 

 The European Central Bank has stressed the huge difference between the U.S. and the eurozone which ECB President Wim Duisenberg told the European parliament last week would limit any macro-economic fallout in the continent. 

 Judging the damage done to corporate confidence is harder. The ECB, stressing that the eurozone is well able to resist the U.S. slowdown, says European companies are less dependent on equity financing than their American counterparts. 

 Economists are less certain and point to the damage already done to European technology suppliers such as Sweden's Ericsson , whose profit warning on Monday led to a steep drop in its share price which in turn undermined equity markets. 

 "Clearly, when telecom companies were 'ponying up' vast sums for third generation cellphone licences last year they were doing so because stock market valuations encouraged their action," said economist Julian Callow at CSFB. 

 "This has changed dramatically and is having a direct impact on suppliers like Ericsson," he said.

 RESEARCH ALERT-UBS Warburg cuts Scripps.

 NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - UBS Warburg cut its earnings estimate for E.W. Scripps Co. on Tuesday, a day after the newspaper publisher said its earnings would fall short of expectations because of a softer-than-expected advertising market. 

 The publisher, whose holdings include the Cincinnati Post and the Denver Rocky Mountain News, saw its shares decline 7.48 percent, or $4.69, to $58.00 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 UBS analyst Leland Westerfield cut his first-quarter earnings estimate to 30 cents a share from 47 cents a share and its full-year 2001 estimate to $2.28 a share from $2.45. 

 The company on Monday said it expected first-quarter earnings before one-time charges to be 30 to 35 cents a share, compared with the company's expectations of 35 to 45 cents announced in late January, when it reported fourth-quarter results. 

 The Wall Street consensus estimate was 39 cents a share, as compiled by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. In the first quarter of last year, Scripps' earnings were 45 cents a share before charges. 

 Scripps expects full-year earnings to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50 a share before charges, compared with $2.20 in the year-earlier period. In January, the company said it expected earnings of $2.45 to $2.65 a share. The First Call estimate was $2.45 a share. 

 The warning came after profit warnings last week by Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. and the New York Times Co. on the back of a slump in the advertising market. Knight Ridder Inc. warned of softer profits late last month.

 UPDATE 5-Motorola to  cut  7,000 jobs at cell-phone unit.

 (Updates with closing stock price in in paragraph 7, rewrites paragraphs 1, 3 and 17.) 

 CHICAGO, March 13 (Reuters) - Motorola Inc., the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker, said on Tuesday it will cut another 7,000 jobs as it struggles to strengthen its cell-phone unit amid an industry-wide slowdown in sales. 

 Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola said the job cuts - 5 percent of its work force - raise the total in its cell-phone operations this year to 12,000, or 36 percent of the unit's total employees at the end of last year. 

 The company's announcement follows a warning on Monday by rival Ericsson that it expects to post a first-quarter loss of up to $500 million, instead of breaking even. Motorola issued its own profit warning last month, 

 Motorola, which employs 140,000 people worldwide and ranks behind Finland's Nokia in cell-phone production, said it will complete the job cuts in the next two quarters and take an unspecified charge against first-and second-quarter results. 

 "Unfortunately, this was a necessary next step for us to achieve renewal and stay competitive in today's dramatic business environment, particularly given the current slowdown in the economy," Motorola Personal Communications Sector President Mike Zafirovski said in a statement. 

 "We anticipate growth, but at a slower pace," he said. "We must continue to adapt our overall cost structure, work force and production levels to a more competitive business model." 

 Motorola's shares closed up 2.4 percent, or 36 cents, at $15.36 in New York Stock Exchange trade. Over the past year, Motorola has underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by about 70 percent and has fallen from a 52-week high of $59.02. 

 EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES 

 Motorola said it was looking at a number of "promising opportunities" to improve second-half performance, including new strategic alliances, customer agreements and products. 

 The cuts were not surprising, and Motorola still needs to get new products out faster, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Brian Modoff said. "Clearly, they need to reduce their overall expenses," he said. "We're not forecasting profitability in handsets this year." 

 Leis Soderberg, the cell-phone unit's senior vice president in charge of strategy, declined to say whether the unit will be profitable. 

 "The overall economic climate is changing pretty rapidly," he told Reuters following the announcement. "A lot of people have been caught by surprise as to how fast that has changed, particularly in some of the technology sectors." 

 The cell-phone industry faced the "triple whammy" in the first quarter of lower customer spending, high inventories and skittishness about the U.S. economy, he said. 

 Projected global cell-phone sales for the industry in 2001 have slowed drastically, from a forecast of 500 million to 600 million earlier this year to Motorola's recent below-500 million warning last month to Tuesday's sub-450 million rate supported by Siemens. That would be only a 10 percent increase over the 410 million sold last year. 

 "Clearly handset growth is slowing worse than expectations," said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at mutual fund company Dreyfus Corp. "Therefore, you're going to see things like job cuts in the sector that's primarily a marketing and manufacturing business, where high talent is not as precious. Likely, we'll see more of this." 

 When asked whether the cell-phone unit would lay off more workers, Soderberg said Motorola would do whatever it must to remain competitive. 

 Analysts said Motorola and Ericsson also have been hurt by Nokia's aggressive push to gain market share by cutting cell-phone prices, something it has done while still making a profit. Low-cost cell phones, which Motorola and Ericsson have not been as successful with, account for about two-thirds of the market. 

 On Monday, Ericsson, the No. 3 maker of cell phones, said it expected a pretax loss of 4 billion to 5 billion Swedish kroner ($400 million to $500 million) in the first quarter. 

 Ericsson also said year-on-year sales in the quarter would be flat or slightly lower instead of rising 15 percent as previously expected and that sales of cell phones would be "considerably lower than in the first quarter of last year." 

 The Swedish company said seasonally low first-quarter sales were accentuated by low replacement demand, reduced operator subsidies, high inventory levels in the distribution chain and continued price pressure due to excess vendor capacity. 

 Ericsson said in January it was pulling out of making its own cell phones and shedding thousands of jobs. 

 NOKIA HAS NOT CUT GUIDANCE 

 Nokia remains the only major cell phone maker not to cut first-quarter forecasts. Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday the company only has 48 hours to do so, but wouldn't say how it arrived at that time-frame. Nokia declined to comment. 

 Motorola's job cuts were not surprising, said Jane Zweig of Washington-based industry consultant Shosteck Group, given the recent layoffs by such high-tech powerhouses as Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks. 

 "All these companies' earnings are a problem, revenues are a problem," she said. "They've got to be lean and mean. And after laying off and getting more lean and mean, there's still no guarantee these companies will be be what they could be." 

 Motorola said on Feb. 23 a dramatic sales slowdown could lead to its first quarterly operating loss in 15 years. If the slowdown persisted, it said, it would report the loss when it releases first-quarter results in early April. 

 The company said on Tuesday it took several steps in the last two quarters to strengthen its cell-phone unit, including naming new leaders, cutting the product portfolio and number of suppliers, closing plants and outsourcing jobs. 

 However, J.P. Morgan Chase analyst Ed Snyder said the company can't build its phones profitably enough, and it could announce more job cuts, possibly in the semiconductor unit, in the next two to three months.

 By Ben Klayman 

 CHICAGO, March 13 (Reuters) - Motorola Inc., the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker, said on Tuesday it will cut another 7,000 jobs as it struggles to strengthen its cell-phone unit amid a slowdown in sales that recently led rival Ericsson to issue a profit warning. 

 Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola, which issued its own profit warning last month, said the job cuts - 5 percent of its work force - raise the total in its cell-phone operations this year to 12,000, or 36 percent of the unit's total employees at the end of last year. 

 The company, which employs 140,000 people worldwide and ranks behind Finland's Nokia in cell-phone production, said it will complete the job cuts in the next two quarters and take an unspecified charge against first-and second-quarter results. 

 "Unfortunately, this was a necessary next step for us to achieve renewal and stay competitive in today's dramatic business environment, particularly given the current slowdown in the economy," Motorola Personal Communications Sector President Mike Zafirovski said in a statement. 

 "We anticipate growth, but at a slower pace," he said. "We must continue to adapt our overall cost structure, work force and production levels to a more competitive business model." 

 Motorola's shares were up 4 cents at $15.04 in New York Stock Exchange trade. Over the past year, Motorola has underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by about 70 percent and has fallen from a 52-week high of $59.02. 

 EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES 

 Motorola said it was looking at a number of "promising opportunities" to improve second-half performance, including new strategic alliances, customer agreements and products. 

 The cuts were not surprising, and Motorola still needs to get new products out faster, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Brian Modoff said. "Clearly, they need to reduce their overall expenses," he said. "We're not forecasting profitability in handsets this year." 

 Leis Soderberg, the cell-phone unit's senior vice president in charge of strategy, declined to say whether the unit will be profitable. 

 "The overall economic climate is changing pretty rapidly," he told Reuters following the announcement. "A lot of people have been caught by surprise as to how fast that has changed, particularly in some of the technology sectors." 

 The cell-phone industry faced the "triple whammy" in the first quarter of lower customer spending, high inventories and skittishness about the U.S. economy, he said. 

 Projected global cell-phone sales for the industry in 2001 have slowed drastically, from a forecast of 500 million to 600 million earlier this year to Motorola's recent below-500 million warning last month to Tuesday's sub-450 million rate supported by Siemens. That would be only a 10 percent increase over the 410 million sold last year. 

 "Clearly handset growth is slowing worse than expectations," said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at mutual fund company Dreyfus Corp. "Therefore, you're going to see things like job cuts in the sector that's primarily a marketing and manufacturing business, where high talent is not as precious. Likely, we'll see more of this." 

 When asked whether the cell-phone unit would lay off more workers, Soderberg said Motorola would do whatever it must to remain competitive. 

 Analysts said Motorola and Ericsson also have been hurt by Nokia's aggressive push to gain market share by cutting cell-phone prices, something it has done while still making a profit. Low-cost cell phones, which Motorola and Ericsson have not been as successful with, account for about two-thirds of the market. 

 On Monday, Ericsson, the No. 3 maker of cell phones, said it expected a pretax loss of 4 billion to 5 billion Swedish kroner ($400 million to $500 million) in the first quarter instead of a result close to break-even.

 Crown Cork ratings slashed by S&P after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Crown Cork & Seal Co.'s credit and debt ratings were slashed Tuesday by Standard & Poor's, one day after the world's leading consumer packaging product supplier surprised analysts by saying it will post a loss of about 50 cents per share this year. 

 The rating agency cut its senior unsecured debt ratings for Philadelphia-based Crown Cork and related entities three notches to "B," its fifth highest junk grade, from "BB," and its corporate credit rating for Crown Cork to "BB-minus" from "BB." Its rating outlook is negative. 

 S&P said the corporate credit cut reflects Crown Cork's "diminished business risk profile, its worse-than-anticipated operating performance and the adverse effects of higher interest costs" from the company's agreement to extend a $2.5 billion credit line at higher rates. It cut its senior debt rating because the debt is junior to the secured bank debt. 

 Analysts expected Crown Cork to post a profit in 2001 of 87 cents per share. Its shares closed Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $5, up 20 cents, but down 24 percent from the $6.62 Friday close. 

 Last year, Crown Cork, which also faces asbestos-related litigation, saw its ratings fall to junk status. Another rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, rates its senior unsecured debt "Ba2," roughly four notches higher than S&P's new rating.

 UPDATE 3-Club Med nosedives after  profit warning .

 PARIS, March 13 (Reuters) - French leisure group Club Mediterranee sliced 18 percent off its share price on Tuesday when it retracted its double-digit sales and profit growth forecast for 2001. 

 The warning, delivered just two months after the company forecast growth at a double-digit clip, sent Club Med stock into a tail-spin. The shares plunged 18.53 percent to end at a new low of 83.10 euros after being halted limit-down on the Paris bourse. 

 It also follows a previous warning in September, when Club Med signaled danger to profits from euro weakness and a surplus of tickets bought for its tour operator Jet Tours. 

 "It's not surprising given the environment in the sector," said one Paris-based fund manager in reference to Tuesday's move by the group that invented fun-in-the-sun holiday villages. 

 "The retraction (of their forecast) has cost them a good chunk of their share price - it's a highly operationally geared business and a stock that has a history of decimating shareholder value," one analyst said. 

 Another said she was weighing revising her recommendation on the stock down to neutral. "Their medium term strategy is good but in the short term there is little good news to expect in a less rosy context," she added. 

 Club Med Chairman Philippe Bourguignon told shareholders at the group's annual meeting on Tuesday that the first half of the group's 2000/01 fiscal year, that began in November, was proving disappointing. 

 He still forecast growth for the full year but said the pace would be slower than predicted. 

 "We said we were expecting double-digit growth but today we cannot confirm double-digit growth, even if we are still confirming growth in revenues and profits," Bourguignon said. 

 "Over the first half, in effect, sales volumes will likely be below our expectations. Steps are going to be and have already been taken to limit cost expansion and to set up a plan to increase the dynamism of our business over the summer," he added, forecasting a pick-up in the second half of the year. 

 TOUGHER COMPETITION 

 "We are expecting the second half to make up for all or part of the lag during the first half," Bourguignon said. 

 Earlier on Tuesday Club Med announced a 9.3 percent rise in first-quarter turnover to 394.5 million euros but said second-quarter sales growth would be slower. 

 Bourguignon said Club Med's performance in Japan over the first half of this year was disappointing, capacity to expand was limited in Europe despite a good snow season, while the introduction of a sales tax had punished business in Australia. 

 Its villages in Israel were hurt by the region's political problems while Senegal and the Ivory Coast also encountered difficulties. North America too proved disappointing. 

 "Everywhere on the North American market we increased our revenues and registered significant growth even if it was weaker than we had thought," Bourguignon said. 

 Club Med received the lion's share of its 1.9 billion euro turnover in 1999/00 from Europe and Africa, which brought in 1.354 billion euros. 

 North and South America, the group's second biggest client region in terms of turnover, was responsible for 303 million euros, while another 232 million euros came from Asia. 

 One analyst said it would be difficult for Club Med to cut costs further given tougher competition. 

 The selloff that followed Tuesday's news made Club Med the day's biggest loser on the Dow Jones Eurostoxx cyclical goods index, turning its 3.0 percent outperformance againt the index into a 4.0 percent underperformance since January 2000. 

 Club Med was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of about 30 times before the warning. That has slipped to about 25 times after it, a level some analysts still considered too high.

 NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Shares of European companies traded in the United States saw little relief on Tuesday from steep losses in the previous session, when U.S. market fears over corporate earnings and a weak economy drove most high-tech firms lower. 

 "The bulk of the damage in the U.S. market occurred after Europe closed, so arguably we're now feeling the full brunt today," said Chase JPMorgan's Jim Cirenza, vice-president of equity sales. 

 "If volatility is your friend, today you're in love." 

 The Bank of New York's index of leading American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) extended Monday's fall, dropping 0.73 percent to 114.04, led down by a 0.98 percent drop in the BONY index of leading European companies to 121.90. 

 The Nasdaq Composite index rose 50.19 points, or 2.62 percent, but stayed below 2,000 in afternoon trade, near its lowest level since December 1998, hit by a recent string of profit and growth warnings from high-tech giants such as Intel , Cisco , and Ericsson . 

 The Nasdaq is now down more than 60 percent from its March 10, 2000 record high of 5,048.62, and the Dow Jones industrial average , after its fifth-worst point drop on Monday, continued down, losing 94.21 points, or 0.92 percent, to 10224.65, after mobile phone leader Motorola warned it will cut 7,000 jobs and take charges. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 7.41 points, or 0.63 percent, at 1,173.08, after its sixth-largest point drop in the previous session. The index plunged 20 percent from last year's high, which fulfilled Wall Street's definition of a bear market. 

 Europe's tech and telecommunications sectors were still dealing with the fallout of a Monday growth warning from Swedish mobile telephone maker Ericsson when, on Tuesday, Britain's telecommunications company Cable & Wireless unleashed an unexpected profit warning, laying blame on the slowed U.S. and Japanese economies. 

 ADRs of Cable & Wireless lost 21 percent to trade at $23.70, while Ericsson's ADR recovered 1.49 percent to trade at $6-3/8, after losing 25 percent of its value on Monday. 

 Cirenza added that the euro's fall from near 94 on Friday to 91.30 "doesn't help and translates badly into an ADR price." 

 Siemens AG , one of Europe's chief technology suppliers, said on Tuesday that its global mobile phone output this year could fall below 450 million units, less than the company had expected. 

 On its second day of trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Siemens ADRs fell 2.36 percent or $107.40. 

 "Yesterday wasn't exactly the day you would be jumping in to buy something techie," said Cirenza. "Bottom line, roll the clock back 12 months and it would have been different." 

 Asian high tech companies showed the greatest resilience and ability to bounce back from Monday's gloom, with the the BONY index of leading Asian firms paring its losses the most, down a mere 0.18 percent to 100.04. 

 Asian contract computer chip makers rose in traders' anticipation of a rebound in chip prices, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. , the world's No. 2 chip foundry, rising 6.33 percent after steep losses on Monday, to trade at 19.16. 

 Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc. rose 8.26 percent, or 2-1/4, to trade at 29-1/2. 

 Shares of Hong Kong-based pan-Asian Internet holding company Chinadotcom Corp. was up 12.77 percent ahead of posting its 2000 results on Wednesday, despite analysts expectations that the company will show little improvement over last year's results. 

 On the downside in Asia, the world's 10th-largest paper concern, Asia Pulp & Paper was down 5.6 to 17 cents, after the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday said it was reviewing the continued listing of the ADR since it had failed to meet the exchange's $1 minimum share price over a 30 trading day average. 

 The BONY index of leading Latin American firms was down 0.42 percent to 94.35.

 UPDATE 3-Siemens signals growing worry over chip market.

 NEW YORK/FRANKFURT, March 13 (Reuters) - German electronics and engineering group Siemens AG on Tuesday became the latest European blue chip technology giant to send shivers through the market with a cut in its earnings outlook. 

 Shares in the company slumped by up to five percent after it acknowledged it would not meet earlier targets because of semiconductor unit Infineon, set to suffer due to the global drop in demand for memory chips. 

 In December the Munich-based group forecast double-digit growth in orders and sales and even faster growth in earnings for its current year ending September 30. 

 But in a statement issued a day after listing its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, Siemens said the target would only be reached if Infineon was not included in the results. 

 "As is well known, prospects in the semiconductor industry have changed significantly in recent months, as can be seen in the most recent market estimates by analysts," the company said in a statement. 

 Siemens Chief Financial Officer Heinz Joachim Neubuerger said the recent spate of bad news from mobile handset makers would affect the communications segment, where Infineon has been looking to expand. 

 "If business at Ericsson, Nokia and Alcatel is having difficulties, it's clear that this will have effect on the component suppliers," he told reporters. 

 But Siemens statement appeared to have raised eyebrows at Infineon, whose Chief Executive Officer Ulrich Schumacher told Reuters in an interview the company was not going to cut its outlook. 

 "It's not coming from us," he said, referring to the parent company's announcement. "I was surprised when I read it." 

 Spot prices for DRAM dynamic random access memory chips used in personal computers have fallen from over $9 last summer to slightly over $2. 

 But Schumacher said he saw a clear pick-up in demand in two to three months even as he admitted that the company could make a second quarter loss. 

 U.S. GLOOM 

 The Siemens statement came after virtually every major semiconductor maker in the U.S. warned investors they would be hit by a severe and rapid slowdown in the chip industry and weakening U.S. economic growth. 

 European chip makers have been more upbeat but analysts have increasingly scaled back their forecasts for the year as pressure has grown in areas such as fixed line communications, which were previously considered safe. 

 Analysts said Siemens' message was not as bad as recent warnings from some U.S. blue chips, saying a poor outlook for memory chips had been priced in. 

 "It's positive that they have stuck to their forecasts in their core areas, but it's obviously less good that they have taken Infineon out of it," WestLB Panmure analyst Klaus Repges said. 

 "But it's hardly a surprise given the fall in DRAM prices we have seen." 

 Siemens' share price recouped some losses to be 1.96 percent down at 117.65 euros. Infineon shares shrugged off parent troubles, as traders said bad news for the sector had already been priced in. 

 Schumacher's upbeat remarks helped the share extend gains to trade four percent up at 38.20 euros and propped Siemens' stock as well. 

 "SOME UNCERTAINTIES" 

 The apparent discrepancy between Infineon and its parent seemed to stem from caution on the part of Siemens Chief Executive Heinrich von Pierer not to be caught later in the cycle with more bad news from the chip industry, analysts said. 

 Von Pierer told reporters there were "some uncertainties" about earnings developments at Infineon just as he said there were positive developments in power generation, automation and medical technology - other key business areas. 

 In Siemens' last business year, Infineon accounted for earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 1.67 billion euros ($1.56 billion), about one third of the group total of 5.17 billion euros. 

 Siemens, whose operations range from mobile phones to medical equipment and power stations, reiterated that it faced a mixed market environment, with weak demand for mobile telephones but booming demand in energy production. 

 Von Pierer also confirmed a darkening outlook for the mobile handset sector after Swedish rival Ericsson issued a profit warning on Monday. He said global handset sales could be less than 450 million units this year, below earlier expectations. 

 But Von Pierer said Ericsson's warning had been a surprise. "Its extent was surprising as well," he said. 

 Industry leader Nokia has not cut its first-quarter forecasts, but Deutsche Bank said in a note on Tuesday it was under growing pressure to do so soon if it needed to. ($1=1.071 Euro).

 UPDATE 2-Motorola to  cut  7,000 jobs in slowing environment.

 LIBERTYVILLE, Ill., March 13 (Reuters) - Motorola Inc., the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker, on Tuesday said it will cut 7,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its work force, as it struggles to strengthen its cell-phone unit in a slowing sales environment that recently led rival Ericssonto issue a profit warning. 

 In another sign of the cell-phone industry's woes, the Schaumburg, Ill.-based technology giant, which ranks behind Finland's Nokia in cell-phone output, said it will complete the job cuts in the next two quarters and take a charge against first-and second-quarter results. 

 Motorola's shares were up less than 1 percent, or 5 cents, at $15.05 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Over the past year, the stock has underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by about 70 percent. 

 Motorola, which issued its own profit warning last month, said the job cuts raise the total in its cell-phone operations, or personal communications sector, so far this year to 12,000, or 36 percent of the unit's total employees at the end of last year. Motorola employs 140,000 people globally. 

 "Unfortunately, this was a necessary next step for us to achieve renewal and stay competitive in today's dramatic business environment, particularly given the current slowdown in the economy," Mike Zafirovski, president of Motorola Personal Communications Sector, said in a statement. 

 "We anticipate growth, but at a slower pace," he added. "We must continue to adapt our overall cost structure, work force and production levels to a more competitive business model." 

 Motorola also said it is looking at a number of "promising opportunities" to improve second-half performance, including new strategic alliances, new customer agreements and new products. 

 Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Brian Modoff said the cuts were not surprising and Motorola still needs to get new products out faster. 

 "They're obviously trying to get back to profitability," he said. "Clearly, they need to reduce their overall expenses. We're not forecasting profitability in handsets this year." 

 On Monday, Ericsson, the No. 3 maker of cell phones and the leading network infrastructure supplier, said it expected a pretax loss of 4 billion to 5 billion Swedish kroner ($400 million to $500 million) in the first quarter instead of a result close to break-even. 

 It also said year-on-year sales in the quarter would be flat or slightly lower instead of rising 15 percent as previously expected and that sales of cell phones would be "considerably lower than in the first quarter of last year." 

 Ericsson said seasonally low first-quarter sales were accentuated by low replacement demand, reduced operator subsidies, high inventory levels in the distribution chain and continued price pressure due to excess vendor capacity. 

 Nokia remains the only major mobile phone maker not to cut its first-quarter forecasts and Deutsche Bank has said it only has 48 hours to do so if it needs to. "The discrepancy between Nokia's guidance and the market is growing," Deutsche Bank said in a research note. 

 Jane Zweig, chief executive of Washington-based industry consultant Shosteck Group, said Motorola's news was not surprising given the recent layoffs by such hi-tech powerhouses as Cisco Systems Inc. and Nortel Networks. 

 "All these companies' earnings are a problem, revenues are a problem," she said. "They've got to be lean and mean. And after laying off and getting more lean and mean, there's still no guarantee these companies will be be what they could be." 

 "It's depressing news though," Zweig added. "These were market leaders. But the whole industry was caught up in so much hype and frenzy that reality was bound to set in." 

 Motorola said on Feb. 23 that a dramatic sales slowdown could lead to its first quarterly operating loss in 15 years, and raised fears of a recession. It said, if the slowdown persisted, it would report the loss when it releases first-quarter results in early April. 

 The company said on Tuesday it has taken several steps in the last two quarters to make its cell-phone unit more competitive, including naming new leaders, cutting the number of products in the portfolio, reducing the number of suppliers, closing plants and outsourcing jobs. 

 Zafirovski said the unit increased its share of global shipments by about one percentage point to 14.4 percent for the first time in a number of years between the third and fourth quarters of 2000.

 UPDATE 4-C&W warns on profits as prices tumble.

 By Richard Baum, UK telecoms correspondent 

 LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Telecoms group Cable & Wireless Plc issued a profit warning on Tuesday, citing tumbling prices in the United States and Japan, in a statement that angered the market and wiped 20 percent off its share price. 

 Only minutes after assuring investors it did not have any bad news up its sleeve, C&W said its profits would fall short of forecasts this year and said it would cut 4,000 jobs over the next 12 months - the latest dose of gloom from a telecom giant. 

 C&W, which operates the third-largest global network for Internet services, said it expected to earn 14-16 pence a share in the year ending this month. Analysts had been forecasting 17 pence on average. 

 Its shares dropped 20 percent to close at a two-and-a-half-year low of 545 pence. 

 Analysts were surprised by the speed at which C&W's markets had slumped. 

 "It's concerning that the trading environment seems to have deteriorated so fast in terms of revenue and margins," said Karen Robertson, telecoms fund manager for Standard Life Investments, one of C&W's largest shareholders. 

 C&W GLOBAL TO MISS REVENUE GROWTH FORECAST 

 C&W said its core Global division, created this financial year following the sale of its Hong Kong business, would miss its forecast for 15 percent revenue growth, achieving only 12 percent. 

 It also said it would take exceptional charges of 950 million pounds ($1.38 billion) relating to reorganisation costs and outdated technology. 

 C&W blamed the profits warning on falling prices for companies that carry telecoms traffic for other operators. 

 "Certain sectors of Cable & Wireless Global's market are experiencing severe price reductions," Chief Executive Graham Wallace said in a statement. 

 In the United States, prices for Internet connectivity have reduced by up to 50 percent a year, while in Japan, international voice prices have declined by 40 percent in the last 10 months. 

 It said its profit margins were under pressure in all markets and that Global's gross margins in the second half of the current year would be around 39 percent. 

 The 4,000 job cuts will come as C&W reduces to five its 47 network operation centres over the next two years and outsources back office processes. 

 The cuts coincided with the loss of 7,000 jobs at Motorola Inc, the second largest mobile phone maker, also announced on Tuesday. 

 Asked before the trading statement if C&W planned to give an update on the impact of the U.S. economic slowdown on the group, spokesman Peter Eustace told Reuters: "There are no plans to make a pre-announcement." 

 "The whole thing is extraordinary," said one dealer. "I guess they felt they had to say something but it has been very badly handled."

 NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse First Boston on Tuesday said analyst Tim Long cut his earnings view for Ericsson , a day after the Swedish telecommunications equipment maker issued a first-quarter profit warning. 

 Long reduced his first-quarter estimate to a loss of 4 cents a share from break-even, citing in part his belief that the company is losing share to Nokia Corp. in its handset business segment. He said he does not expect Ericsson's handset business to return to profitability before the second half of 2002. 

 Long also sliced his 2001 earnings view by more than half, to 8 cents from 21 cents a share. 

 On Monday, Ericsson, the world's third-largest mobile phone maker, said it expected a pre-tax loss of 4-5 billion Swedish kroner ($400-500 million) in the first quarter instead of results close to break-even. 

 Ericsson's shares were trading at $5-7/8 in pre-opening activity, below theie 52-week low of $6-3/16, after closing at $6-9/32 on Monday on the Nasdaq. The stock's high for the year is $25-13/16.

 LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Shares in Cable & Wireless Plc fell on Tuesday, after the company said it would suffer from the U.S. economic slowdown. 

 Spokesman Peter Eustace said it was "inevitable" that the UK-based Internet services company would be hurt by its exposure to the United States. 

 He said he was repeating comments by Chief Executive Graham Wallace, reported by Reuters on March 6, that C&W had seen no easing in pricing pressure in the U.S. and would materially cut spending in fiscal 2002. 

 One dealer said Eustace's remark constituted "a slight profit warning". 

 The stock was down 6.7 percent at 637 pence after tumbling as low as 619p, its weakest since October 1999.

 Nokia has 48 hrs to warn on Q1 profits - Deutsche.

 HELSINKI, March 23 (Reuters) - Finland's Nokia , the only remaining big mobile phone maker not to cut first-quarter earnings forecasts, has 48 hours to do so if it needs to, Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday. 

 "The discrepancy between Nokia's guidance and the market is growing," Deutsche said in a research note. "If Nokia is not going to meet the market's current first-quarter 2001 estimates, results will have to be pre-released in the next 48 hours." 

 Deutsche - which has a "buy" rating on Nokia - declined to comment on how it arrived at the 48-hour figure. Nokia declined to comment on the report. 

 Analysts said the bank's time frame was based on Nokia already having most of its earnings data some two weeks before the end of the quarter, and with Ericsson's profit-warning on Monday they said there was no reason to hold back bad news. 

 Pressure is growing on Nokia, the world's largest mobile phone maker, to clarify Q1 earnings forecasts after rival Ericsson on Monday warned to expect a pre-tax loss for the quarter of four to five billion Swedish crowns ($402-502 million) instead of a result close to break-even. 

 This makes Ericsson the second of the big three mobile phone makers - U.S. Motorola Inc being the other - to warn for a second time on its January-March results. 

 On January 30 Nokia said it expected earnings per share to be flat year on year at 0.19 euros ($0.177) because of deteriorating market conditions - including the U.S. economy - and its drive to gain market share in mobile phones. 

 "It is hard to believe that Nokia is able to resist all of the pressures that are being exerted by worsening economic conditions," Deutsche Bank said in the research note. 

 Nokia's stock was 4.5 percent higher at 24.45 euros at 1110 GMT, outperforming Ericsson, which was off 5.5 percent at 60.50 crowns after a 21-percent beating on Monday. The Dow Jones European Tech Index was up 1.2 percent. 

 NOKIA'S Q1 TOO CLOSE TO CALL 

 Fund managers have been increasingly sceptical that Nokia - which prides itself with giving accurate forecasts - will meet guidance as the environment has worsened in recent weeks. 

 One after another technology companies have warned that a slowing U.S. economy was hurting demand. Mobile phone makers Ericsson, Motorola, and Alcatel have said the appetite for new handsets had deteriorated in the U.S. and Europe. 

 But analysts and fund managers agreed Nokia was still best placed to weather the storm with its mix of handsets, brand strength and ability to make a profit on inexpensive models - the market's biggest sellers - through economies of scale. 

 "There was little new in the Ericsson profit warning relating to handset volumes, price pressure and inventory overhang," Deutsche Bank said. 

 "Is Nokia setting the prices and the others taking the pain? It is our view that Nokia is responsible for much of the deterioration in ASP (average selling price of phones) dynamics that have impacted the second tier handset manufacturers." 

 Many in the market questioned whether this would be enough for Nokia to achieve flat EPS for this quarter, but some still had faith in Nokia's ability to deliver on its promise. 

 "I still think that if Nokia had something to warn about they would already have done so," said analyst Petri Korpineva at Finland's brokerage Evli, which has a "buy" rating on Nokia. 

 He said Nokia's forecast of flat Q1 EPS was already a huge downgrade from the 0.25 euros in Q4 2000 and took into account worsening market conditions.

 My briefcase is getting heavy again. It must be time for a little bit about a lot of things: 

 -- Time flies when the Nasdaq is getting crushed. Just a year ago last week, the Nasdaq hit its all-time high. At this writing, it's down roughly 60 percent since then. Thank your lucky stars for any pre-crash profit-taking, diversification and patience. 

 In the wake of Intel Corp.'s profit warning Thursday, talk of a quick bounce in the tech-heavy Nasdaq increasingly sounds like little more than wishful thinking. The betting here is that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at least half of a percentage point next week in an effort to bolster business and consumer confidence. Anything less could have investors running for the exits. 

 Unless you haven't noticed, cash has been king for quite a while now. 

 -- The bankruptcy court bidding war last week between American Airlines and financier Carl Icahn for Trans World Airlines offered a fairly twisted endorsement of market forces. 

 The motives of Icahn, whose looting of TWA in the late 1980s and early 1990s sent the venerable airline down the now thrice-trod path to bankruptcy court, were pretty obvious. He was far more interested in preserving his discount ticket sales agreement, which contributed to the woes of the airline in the marketplace, than saving TWA as an independent carrier. But there's no doubt that Icahn's strategy benefited creditors -- including himself. 

 The threat of Icahn owning TWA again also inspired some of the more colorful quotes in recent months from his former employees. TWA spokesman Mark Abels noted that Icahn's group was "putting aside $30 million for training costs to replace all the TWA people who vomit and walk out if Icahn takes over." 

 -- Let me see here. In 1993, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics jilted Kansas City for Tulsa, Okla. Attendance at its showcase basketball tournament quickly plummeted. 

 Then the NAIA offered to move wherever they could cut the fattest hog. Forty-one cities responded. 

 Last week, Olathe won with an offer worth more than $100,000 for each and every one of the NAIA's 23 office employees. Moreover, scheduling problems mean there's no assurance at this point that the NAIA will be able to stage its basketball tournament here any time soon. 

 Healing old civic wounds is one thing. But don't expect the pulse of the regional economy to quicken much with this deal. Devotees of irony will also note that the carpetbagging NAIA plans to build a "Character Center" at its new Olathe headquarters. 

 -- Kansas City Auditor Mark Funkhouser probably didn't make any more friends in the development lobby with his latest review of the city's budget. 

 Funkhouser noted that the diversion of would-be city revenue for tax increment financing projects has grown from $1.1 million in 1995 to $28.2 million in the proposed fiscal 2002 budget. By 2004, that figure is estimated to grow to $45.5 million. 

 At current growth rates, that means it won't be too many years before Kansas City will be diverting more revenue to support specific TIF projects than it will have to spend to provide basic services to the city as a whole. It's a little something to ponder the next time you hit a pothole in an unTIFed neighborhood. 

 -- Word that the owners of Ward Parkway Center are trying to lure Target into the former Montgomery Ward space was greeted favorably in our household last week. It's a seemingly perfect fit for one of many malls that are struggling to remold themselves in a tough retailing climate. 

 Then we fretted about the fate of The Dime Store, which recently extended its lease in Brookside. As major retailers such as Costco, Home Depot and Target finally recognize the market opportunities in our older urban areas, the crushing competitive pressures on neighborhood shops will only increase. 

 We decided to take the kids to The Dime Store. 

 -- Beginning in early April, members of The Kansas City Star's business desk will be heard daily during evening drive time on KPHN 1190 AM radio. 

 "The Kansas City Star Business Hour," from 5 to 6 p.m., will be hosted by KPHN business editor Scott Simon and will feature the newspaper's business desk writers and editors discussing financial events of the day. 

 The joint venture between the Star's business desk and KPHN, which focuses its programming on business and stock market news, is just one of several multimedia convergence ventures that will occur in coming months. 

 Over time, our reportorial efforts will increasingly be delivered via a wide variety of media, ranging from the newspaper to the Internet, radio and television. This experimental joint venture with KPHN is one small, but exciting, step down that road.

 Ericsson Pft Warning Highlights Rivals' Vulnerability

 STOCKHOLM (Dow Jones)--Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson's (ERICY) warning Monday on slowing sales for its wireless network equipment highlights more than ever the vulnerability of its European rivals - although they may not need to press the panic button yet. 

 Ericsson said late Monday that its sales for the first quarter would be flat or down from the first quarter of 2000, adding that it expects a pretax loss for the quarter of as much as SEK5 billion. 

 The company had previously said it expected to break even during the quarter, with a 15% increase in sales. 

 The Swedish giant, the world's largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, traced much of the sluggishness to the U.S., where it said slowing subscriber growth and economic uncertainty had led network operators to postpone capital spending. 

 That fact bodes well for European competitors such as Alcatel SA (ALA), Siemens AG (SI), Nokia Corp. (NOK) Philips Electronics NV (PHP) and Marconi PLC (MONI), whose mobile-network sales are focused outside the American market. 

 "It was the U.S. that was the main driver," said Matthew Lewis, an analyst for Daiwa SBCM in London. "I got the impression that there is a slowdown in Europe, but that it wasn't disastrous." 

 Analysts said most of Ericsson's European rivals have another advantage: A broader product mix that should allow them to absorb a slowdown in network spending without taking a big hit on the bottom line. 

 About 55% of Ericsson's revenues come from sales of wireless network products. Siemens, for instance, derives only about 5.7% of its revenue from wireless networks. That was little comfort Tuesday, however, as the German company warned that the profit outlook is uncertain at its semiconductor unit, Infineon Technologies AG (IFX). 

 Not all the news this week has been grim. British Telecommunications PLC (BTY) said Monday that Marconi would get an $800 million contract to upgrade its network in the U.K. The company had previously said it planned to divide the contract between Marconi and Nortel Networks Corp (NT). 

 The contract and Marconi's low level of vendor financing suggest the British company is well-positioned to capitalize on its installed base in Europe, said a fund manager in London who requested anonymity. 

 U.S. Slowdown Could Spread To Europe 

 Still, Ericsson's rivals can't dismiss its warning. Ericsson said that network spending has slowed in Europe, too - a trend that presumably could accelerate if the economic sluggishness in the U.S. continues to spill over. Most are also involved in handset sales, where Ericsson's outlook was even grimmer than on networks. 

 And, despite their varied portfolios, companies such as Alcatel will be vulnerable if, as expected, the slowdown reaches reach other segments of the telecommunications sector, such as broadband access and optical networks, which make up a big chunk of its revenues. 

 About 13% of Ericsson's total sales last year were in North America, the second-fastest growing region for the company. As for Alcatel, 23% of its revenues come from the U.S., although a large proportion of that figure comes from digital subscriber lines and optics, not wireless networks. 

 Deutsche Bank on Tuesday cut its 2001 forecasts for Nokia, saying it now expects network revenue growth to be 28% rather than 32% and margins to be 15% rather than 17%. The net effect, the bank said, would be a 4.5% decline in expected earnings per share, to EUR0.86 from EUR0.90. The bank said Nokia is vulnerable to the slowdown in European network spending. 

 Nokia has declined to comment on Ericsson's warning. But many now expect that the Finnish giant, which controls more than 30% of the global handset market, may follow with its own profit warning, perhaps as early as this week. 

 Some observers believe Philips may soon issue an earnings warning of its own. The company hasn't issued a specific earnings forecast for 2000. Company officials couldn't be reached Tuesday. 

 Ericsson executives refused this week to predict when the market may turn up. They said they wouldn't provide guidance until the company's first-quarter results April 20. They also refused to provide a breakdown between the handset unit and the networks unit on the expected revenue shortfall in the first quarter. 

 Daiwa's Lewis said operators are postponing spending on new base stations and other measures to increase network capacity, rather than on massive contracts for new networks or system upgrades. 

 Johan Broestrom, an analyst with Hagstroemer & Qviberg in Stockholm, said Ericsson's warning on the network side is more meaningful for American competitors such as Nortel and Motorola Inc. (MOT). 

 He said neither has similarly cautioned about a network slowdown. That suggests that Ericsson's problems in the U.S. may include a loss of market share to those competitors, Broestrom said. 

 Johan Carlstroem, an analyst with Handelsbanken in Stockholm, estimated that about 40% of Ericsson's loss will be a result of slowing network sales, with the balance due to handset losses. Handelsbanken cut its 2001 earnings per share estimate to SEK0.66 from SEK2. 

 Ericsson shares, which lost more than 20% Monday, fell further Tuesday. Around 1550 GMT in the shares were at SEK61, down 4.7% from Monday's close.

 Axa Set For Pft Rise But Mkt Downturn Worries Persist

 PARIS -(Dow Jones)- Investors in Axa SA (AXA), one the world's largest insurance group, can expect their fair share of good news when the group releases its latest earnings report Wednesday, but another increase in profits won't mask worries about worsening market conditions. 

 The French insurer should see profits for 2000 up again - to around EUR2.3 billion for last year, from just over EUR2 billion in 1999. Revenue growth has been solid across the board. And managers have won plaudits for their move last year to sell its U.S. investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) to Credit Suisse at a time when conditions in investment banking were beginning to turn nasty. 

 But analysts say there are clear signs 2001 could be more difficult. Stock markets round the world are under pressure. The U.S. is in the midst of an economic downturn. Turning a profit in Japan is no mean feat either in current circumstances. Only in Europe is the outlook still reasonably bright. 

 What's more, sentiment in the insurance sector as a whole is rather gloomy after Zurich Financial Services, the parent company of Swiss reinsurer Zurich Re, issued a profit warning last month and embarked on a program to cut back on staff. 

 "Everything depends on what they say about targets going forward," said Stephen Dias, analyst at Goldman Sachs in London. "2001 will be difficult because of what's happening in the markets. 

 "The U.S. is a particular risk both from the point of view of the economy and the dollar. The other area that could come in as a risk is the Japanese business." 

 Even capital gains from sales of stakes in other companies - often used by insurers to smooth out periodic troughs in earnings - could prove tricky in the current climate. 

 Come Wednesday, many analysts will be looking keenly at Axa's unrealized gains as a clear measure of the health of the group's share portfolio. 

 Despite the promise of stormier weather ahead, Axa looks to be in pretty good shape. Analysts don't seem overly worried about the impact of a downturn in the U.S. economy. Revenue figures for last year, released in February, showed strong across-the-board growth, with both life insurance and property and casualty insurance posting solid gains in turnover. 

 "As long as the markets remain unchanged, then net earnings should grow by 10% this year," said Michael Huttner, insurance sector analyst at J.P. Morgan. "That's not brilliant, but it's not bad". 

 Strategically, Axa has a foothold in Japan, a key market, with its purchase of Nippon Dentai Life Insurance Company. 

 The Japanese unit racked up a deficit of Y74 billion in the six months to end September but Axa has already made clear that losses will have no impact on its 2000 accounts. 

 Analysts said getting rid of DLJ - and using the money to buy up shares it didn't already own in U.S. arm Axa Financial - was also a smart move, reducing exposure to volatile financial markets and shoring up control of an important subsidiary. 

 "They do have very good management," said an analyst, who requested anonymity. "They sold DLJ just before all the problems we now know we have in investment banking." 

 In itself, an increase in earnings for last year probably won't be enough to lift Axa shares when they resume trading Thursday. At 0910 GMT Tuesday, the stock was at EUR130.40, unchanged from Monday's close. 

 Market players are likely to pay more attention to what Henri de Castries, Axa's urbane chairman, says about this year than the numbers he presents from last year. 

 To get the group's shares back on the rise, de Castries will have to convince the market things aren't as somber as they appear.

 Motorola PCS Unit To  Cut  7,000 Jobs

 LIBERTYVILLE, Ill. -(Dow Jones)- Motorola Inc. 's (MOT) Personal Communications Sector, or PCS, unit is cutting about 7,000 additional positions in an effort to reduce costs in the wireless handset business. 

 The cuts bring the total number of jobs eliminated from the PCS unit to 12,000 since December. 

 In a press release Tuesday, the company said the reductions will affect all aspects and geographies of the business and are expected to be completed in the next two quarters. 

 Motorola will record an unspecified charge from ther move against first quarter and second quarter earnings, reflected as a special item. 

 Motorola expects growth at the PCS unit, but at a slower pace. It intends to adapt the overall cost structure, workforce and production levels to a more competitive business model. 

 Motorola said it is leveraging a number of opportunities that are intended to improve the performance of PCS in the second half of 2001. 

 Additional information wasn't immediately available. 

 On Jan. 12, Motorola said it expected first quarter sales and operating margins at its PCS unit to weaken. 

 In January, The Wall Street Journal reported that Motorola is placing much of its hope on a slew of new phones and devices that it plans to introduce in the middle of this year, but the company has misjudged the cellphone market before. In 2000, it put significant resources into developing phones that let users access the Web, though consumers largely ignored them for cheaper, more basic phones. 

 A Motolola spokesman said in order to improve performance of the segment in the second half the company is reducing the complexity and scope of its product portfolio, as part of an ongoing program. The company is confident of its data-enabled handset position in Europe. 

 The personal communications sector unit had about 33,000 total employees, before the planned 12,000 job reduction. 

 The company wouldn't comment on the size of the related charge to be taken in the first and second quarter. 

 On Jan. 12, Motorola said it expected first quarter sales and operating margins at its PCS unit to weaken. 

 The spokesman said Tuesday's move is the result of further weakening since January in those areas and the overall "near-term outlook." 

 The spokesman also cited inventory buildup in Europe and the U.S. as hurting the first quarter. 

 When asked of possible additional job cuts coming to the unit, the spokesman said nothing is planned, but the company will monitor the situation and act accordingly. 

 Motorola's work force reduction follows Monday's profit warning by Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson. Ericcson had expected to break even in the the first quarter, but warned Monday that it now expects to incur a pretax loss of SEK4 billion to SEK5 billion, which translates to $410 million to $513 million. 

 In the first quarter of 2000, Ericsson reported a pretax profit of 6.1 billion kronor. 

 On Jan. 30, Finnish mobile phone company Nokia Corp. (NOK) warned that growth may be slower than expected in the first quarter. 

 The warnings were mostly prompted by the effect of a slowing global economy on technology companies. In recent weeks, other tech firms, like Intel Corp. (INTC) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) have also issued gloomy announcements, ranging from job cuts to lower revenue expectations. 

 Motorola's New York Stock Exchange listed shares recently traded at $15, up 4 cents, compared to a 52-week high of $52.09 exactly a year ago. The shares hit a 52-week low on Monday at $14.85.

 Japan's stock market closed today at its lowest level in 16 years following the plunge in US markets yesterday.  The Nikkei led other Asian markets lower along with European markets.  Wall Street was reacting to more bad news about technology earnings.  The NASDAQ Composite Index is down more than 60 percent since its high last March. Other major indexes also fell sharply.  NPR's Jim Zarroli reports that the confidence and optimism that pervaded the market 18 months ago has given way to anxious uncertainty.

 Each time it seems technology stock prices can't get any lower, they drop down some more.  Yesterday's sell-off took place after Cisco Systems, which makes computer networking equipment, issued a profitwarning, becoming the latest in a long string of technology giants to do so. 

 Not only did the company announce layoffs, it also said weak US demand for its products could spread overseas.  That happened on Friday. Over the weekend, there was more bad news about Japan's stagnant economy and that only sapped investor confidence more, says Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed. 

 Mr. HANK HERRMANN (Waddell & Reed):  The Japanese have substantial investments in the equity and bond markets in the United States. If their financial condition continues to deteriorate, there's a chance that they may bring money back to Japan which would put additional pressure on our market. 

 ZARROLI:  Yesterday the Swedish mobile phone maker Ericsson said it would lose money this quarter.  All this bad news sent stock prices falling and the trickle of stock selling became a flood as the day wore on. Some 320 stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange hit new lows.  Blue chip stocks, such as General Electric, Disney and Microsoft, were all down considerably.  By the end of the day, both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index were down more than 4 percent each.  The S&P has now fallen almost 25 percent and is unescapably in bear market territory.  Herrmann says what happened yesterday is part of a steady erosion of confidence in the market as investors come to grips with the fact that prices may not rebound as quickly as they used to. 

 Mr. HERRMANN:  The sentiment now is pretty darn negative.  I think that the psychology has been deteriorating for a while but behavior didn't follow psychology.  But here, at this point in time, people are starting to behave in line with the way they're feeling, which is pretty grumpy. 

 ZARROLI:  And for now, it seems nothing has succeeded in restoring confidence to the market, not even the Federal Reserve.  The Fed cut rates twice last January touching off a market rally.  But the rally didn't last; in part, because a third rate cut that was widely expected to be announced in February failed to materialize, according to Eugene Peroni, managing director of Nuveen Investments. 

 Mr. EUGENE PERONI (Nuveen Investments):  The Fed has not yet acted a third time to reduce rates and many are watching to see if they'll do that and by how much they will lower rates.  The fact that the Fed did not act ahead of the March 20th meeting put buyers on hold and that's, I think, what the market is most struck by here now. 

 ZARROLI:  The Fed is again expected to cut rates at its meeting next week, but it's not clear whether the cut will be big enough to ease investor fears.  As the disappointing earnings' statements from companies such as Intel and Dell pile up, the seemingly endless confidence that investors once had in the markets has taken a hit.  Even if stocks stop falling, investors may be a lot more reluctant to rush back into the market than they once were.  And that means it could be some time before prices really start to rise again.

 UPDATE 1-Gilat stock craters after earnings warning.

 (Recasts, updates stock price, adds details, analyst comments) 

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Israeli communications firm Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. on Monday said its earnings this year and next would be far short of what Wall Street expected because of the economic slowdown, sending its stock into a tailspin that erased nearly half its value. 

 Shares of Gilat, whose businesses include earth-to-space communications stations and satellite Internet access, dropped $15-1/4, or more than 48 percent, to $16-7/16 on Nasdaq, where it was the No. 2 percentage loser in mid-afternoon trading. 

 Shares of General Electric Co. , which owns 20 percent of Gilat, were also down $2.61 to $41.20 on the New York Stock Exchange, a decline of nearly 6 percent. 

 Before the start of trading, Gilat reported fourth-quarter 2000 earnings that were roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. But it warned that earnings for 2001 and 2002 would miss earlier targets by a wide margin, blaming its new, less optimistic outlook on reduced and delayed orders. 

 The Petah Tikva, Israel-based company now expects to earn $25 million, or $1 per share, in 2001, and $50 million, or $2 per share, in 2002. Analysts on average had expected $2.43 per share in 2001 and $3.57 in 2002, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Fourth quarter 2000 earnings, excluding charges, totaled $19.4 million excluding one-time charges, or 82 cents a share, down from $23 million, or $1 per share, a year earlier. 

 Analysts polled by First Call had expected fourth-quarter earnings of 83 cents a share. 

 Including charges related to acquisitions and the write-down of investments in other companies, the company reported a net loss of $10.2 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with a loss of $15.8 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. 

 Goldman Sachs analyst Elan Zivotofsky, who on Monday cut his rating of Gilat to market performer from the recommended list, said: "The earnings for the fourth quarter were in line, but management's guidance for 2001 was significantly below expectations." 

 Gilat Chairman and Chief Executive Yoel Gat said in a statement that reduced and delayed orders caused the revised outlook. 

 Gilat's Spacenet subsidiary, based in McLean, Va., provides two-way satellite-based communications. 

 The profit warning came days after its StarBand joint venture with Microsoft Corp. and EchoStar Communications Corp. , which provides satellite Internet access, withdrew its initial public offering. StarBand pulled the offering on Friday, citing "changed circumstances in the securities markets."

 TORONTO, March 12 (Reuters) - Toronto stocks plunged 150 points, succumbing to negative sentiment at the open on Monday, with technology stocks reacting to last week's profit warnings and bank stocks falling as investors size up loan portfolios. 

 "Stocks are taking a kick in the teeth," said Joe Ismail, an analyst at Maison Placements Canada Inc. 

 But he added that the selloff, coming mainly from the tech-heavy industrial products sector, may peter out during the day, giving way to some bargain-hunting. 

 "I would not be surprised if we can cut the losses halfway through. It's too late to sell, in my opinion. Where the hell were they when the market was at 11,000? It doesn't make sense to me," he added. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index dropped 150 points or 1.85 percent to 7984.89. Volume was above average with 17.8 shares traded, worth C$314 million. 

 The Nasdaq was hobbled, down 68.34 points or 3.3 percent at 1984.64. The Dow Jones industrial average was also pummeled, down 204.15 points, or 1.9 percent soon after the market opened. 

 In Toronto, the profit-warning-weary technology sector, dragged the industrial products sector down 5 percent. 

 Nortel Networks Corp. led the way, after British Telecommunications Plc said it had decided not to split an $880.9 million network upgrade contract between Nortel and Marconi Plc and use Marconi alone. 

 Nortel shares were off C$2.14 to C$25.55. 

 Sierra Wireless Inc. shares were down C$3.89 to C$39.51 despite announcing it had teamed up with the wireless arm of Canada's second-largest telephone company Telus Corp. to co-develop a high-speed mobile modem for use in hand-held devices and laptop computers. 

 Canadian banking stocks, also continued to lose ground as investors shift their focus from last year's record profits to loan portfolios exposed to troubled parts of a sagging U.S. economy. 

 The Bank of Nova Scotia was off 57 Canadian cents to C$40.52 and Toronto-Dominion Bank , slipped 39 Canadian cents to C$41.63. 

 The gold and precious minerals group was up 2.64 percent after ending on a strong note last week. 

 Spot gold prices were slightly up at about $272.20 per ounce in New York trading as investors continue to flock to companies in the sector as a safe haven against a deteriorating U.S. economy.

 TORONTO, March 12 (Reuters) - Toronto stocks were seen succumbing to negative sentiment at the open on Monday with technology stocks reacting to last week's profit warnings and bank stocks falling as investors size up loan portfolios. 

 "We are going to be under some heavy selling pressure at the open. Hopefully we get an ugly start followed by some bargain hunting mid-morning," said Katherine Beattie, an analyst with Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto. 

 On Friday, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index closed 92.12 points, or 1.12 percent, lower at 8135.51 with most of the damage coming from the profit-warning-weary technology sector. 

 Toronto equities fared better than their U.S. counterparts, which adds fuel to the fire that they will have a soggy start to the week as they play catch-up, said Beattie. 

 Technology stocks could be led lower by Nortel Networks Corp. after British Telecommunications Plc said it had decided not to split an $880.9 million network upgrade contract between Nortel and Marconi Plc and use Marconi alone. 

 Sierra Wireless Inc. could be a tad stronger after it said it had teamed up with the wireless arm of Canada's second-largest telephone company Telus Corp. to co-develop a high-speed mobile modem for use in hand-held devices and laptop computers. 

 Shares of Canadian banking stocks, including Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank , could continue to lose ground as investors shift their focus from last year's record profit to loan portfolios exposed to troubled parts of a sagging U.S. economy. 

 And gold stocks could lose some of last week's luster as gold bullion dipped slightly in London trading to a fixed price of $270.50 an ounce. Investors have been flocking to companies in the sector as a safe haven against a deteriorating U.S. economy. 

 Meanwhile, shares of United Dominion Industries Ltd. were expected to surge at the open after SPX Corp. said it would pay $1.83 billion for the diversified manufacturer, or about $25 a share. United closed at $19.50 in New York and C$29.77 a share in Toronto on Friday. 

 Investors will be paying close attention to U.S. economic statistics due out this week to determine whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will find reason to lower interest rates after a much expected 50 basis point cut on March 20, said Beattie. 

 Retail sales figures for February, due out on Tuesday, will show whether U.S. consumer spending is slowing, and the Producer Price Index will indicate whether manufacturers are facing any inflation for their raw materials.

 Hitachi Likely To Issue Pft-Warning; Tough Times Ahead

 TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- The global meltdown in the information technology industry is hitting all the big Japanese names. 

 The latest Japanese company in the sector likely to issue a profitwarning is Hitachi Ltd. (HIT or 6501), analysts say, following a series of other Japanese high-tech companies who have cut their profit outlooks recently. 

 According to analysts forecasts, Hitachi is expected to fall short of its projection of Y125 billion net profit by about Y10 billion to Y25 billion and its group operating profit forecast for Y335 billion by around Y25 billion to Y55 billion. 

 Hitachi's profit warning, if it comes, would follow similar cuts to estimates by its rivals - NEC Corp. (NIPNY or 6701), Toshiba Corp. (J.TOS or 6502), and Fujitsu Ltd. (J.FUT or 6702). 

 Universally cutting into Japanese electronics giants' bottom-lines are steep falls in both prices and shipments for semiconductors, liquid crystal displays, and other electronics devices on the back of a deteriorated market climate worldwide since late last year for such key products as personal computers and mobile phone handsets. 

 This will likely keep weighing on the sector's Japanese companies at least in the first half of next fiscal year, analysts say. 


       No Recovery For Chip Demand Until Summer



Only last week Intel Corp. (INTC) of U.S. warned that its
first-quarter revenue would fall short of its most recent forecast,
marking the third consecutive quarter of missed expectations, as
weakness in the personal-computer sector spread into the networking,
communications, and server-computer markets.



Now the biggest question the whole technology industry is asking is
how long this unfavorable market situation - inventory adjustment at all
levels in the sector - will last.



Speaking at a press briefing earlier this month, Fujitsu executive
vice president Takashi Takaya said he expects inventory adjustments
among clients to continue at least until June.



In January, the impact of the slowdown in the global IT market began
hitting Fujitsu's operations, with clients' requesting postponement of
delivery of orders, Takaya said.



"In February, the situation deteriorated with some clients starting to
ask for order cancellations," he added.



Takaya declined to give an indication of Fujitsu's profit outlook for
next fiscal year starting April because the company "is right in the
middle of evaluating carefully whether that situation will last any
longer."



Toshiba corporate senior executive vice president Kiyoaki Shimagami
said in early February, "through December to January, each level of
manufacturing seems to have entered production adjustment stages - from
set makers to device makers."



"We consider the January-March quarter the period for inventory
adjustment, said Shimagami, adding that, "this situation is expected to
continue through the April-June quarter."



In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Mitsubishi Electric Corp.'s
(J.MBE or 6503) corporate vice president and head of semiconductor
business Koichi Nagasawa said earlier this month, "I expect PC-related
chip demand to start recovering in June or July this year after
completion of inventory adjustment."



However, orders for PC-related semiconductors - dynamic random access
memories (DRAMs) and chips used in storage devices - are unlikely to be
as brisk as last year, as PC shipments in the U.S., the biggest market,
are projected to be almost flat in 2001, Mitsubishi Electric's Nagasawa
said.



Meanwhile, Nomura Securities analyst Noboru Ishihara said, "the time
to buy (Japanese) chip-related shares may be around this summer, with
prices hitting bottom."



The analyst's scenario is that the supply-demand gap in the
semiconductor market will worsen through to the October-December period
of this year, following hefty capital investment last year to boost
production capacity.

 Global markets face rough Monday after Nasdaq carnage.

 LONDON, March 11 (Reuters) - Global financial markets face a rocky opening when trading resumes on Monday after fears over corporate profits and diminished hopes for a cut in interest rates set off a Wall Street rout on Friday. 

 The high-tech Nasdaq dropped 5.35 percent while the S&P 500 fell 2.48 percent, stung by fresh signs that corporate profits were being damaged by a slowing economy and as jobs data dimmed hopes for steep interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. 

 Stocks in Asia and Europe will be under pressure and government bonds should benefit as investors pull money out of shares with currency markets likely to be volatile, analysts said on Sunday. 

 "There is absolutely no doubt that a selloff in the Nasdaq has negative implications in Asia and will compound problems for European markets," said Gerard Lyons head of treasury research at Standard Chartered Bank in London. 

 "The Fed may not be able to rescue the market this time." 

 Complicating matters was political uncertainty in Japan, where Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori late on Saturday indicated he would bring forward an election for the party presidency but sent no clear signal as to when and how he would be replaced. 

 The Japanese yen is seen vulnerable both to the death agonies of Mori's career as prime minister and to data to be released later on Sunday which is likely to confirm the world's second largest economy is contracting. 

 Analysts in Tokyo said they saw the Nikkei languishing around the 12,000 point level despite a new economic support package unveiled on Friday. 

 "High-tech stocks are likely to take a beating after such a steep fall in the Nasdaq," said Hidenori Karaki of Tokyo Mitsubishi Personal Securities. 

 DOUBLE BLOW FOR STOCKS 

 Wall Street was rocked by a combination of bad corporate news - a profit warning from tech heavyweight Intel and job cuts by Cisco - and resilient employment data indicating that the Fed may not be able to ease by as much as some investors hoped. 

 The Nasdaq is down nearly 60 percent since its March 10 record high a year ago. 

 "As long as New York continues to go down, we will see further pressure in Europe as well," said Paul Horne, European equity market economist at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. 

 Shares in Europe fell moderately on Friday, with the pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300 index closing 1.2 percent lower. 

 Friday's much stronger-than-expected U.S. February payrolls growth numbers dashed hopes of a 75-basis-point rate cut by the Fed on March 20, adding to the gloom as tech companies with high debts are among the key beneficiaries from lower rates. 

 U.S. Treasuries fell in response but losses were limited by a flow of frightened money from stock markets. 

 Analysts said that bonds in Europe, where there are few who expect imminent cuts in interest rates, should do well on Monday as equities sag. 

 "They should do well," said Kirit Shah, chief market strategist at Sanwa International in London, who said he thought it likely that the Fed would cut rates but was not betting on a U.S. recession. 

 The dollar fared fairly well against the euro despite equity market mayhem with some traders saying the greenback was supported by interest rate expectations. 

 "This is the $64 million question - why is the dollar not falling?" Shah said. 

 Shah said the stubbornly high price of oil, which is denominated in dollars, was helping to keep demand for the currency high. 

 Key oil producers Saudi Arabia and Mexico on Sunday held talks as OPEC tried to rally support for its widely expected supply cuts.

 Intel to axe 5,000 jobs as revenue slumps.

 US AND European stock markets pushed the panic button as Intel's shares tumbled more than 12 per cent yesterday, after it issued a profits warning and said it would axe jobs. 

 The shares slump came as the world's largest chip company announced its first-quarter revenue would fall 25 per cent from fourth-quarter levels and said it would slash 5,000 jobs. 

 The news has further fuelled the economic slowdown which has already sent the PC market into a tailspin and offers proof that it is now spreading to the communications sector. Intel refused to comment yesterday on the announcement, which added its bleak outlook just a day after internet media titan Yahoo!'s profit warning, poking holes in the theory that the US market had bottomed out. 

 Predictably, US stock futures plunged in yesterday's morning trade in the midst of Intel's announcement and a surprisingly strong US employment report. 

 By mid-morning stocks hovered near the day's lows as the chill through Wall Street highlighted the plight of the technology sector which has sent the NASDAQ market down 59 per cent in the last 12 months since its high of more than 5,000 on 10 March, 2000. 

 The pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300 was down 1.2 per cent on the news and the DJ Stoxx 50 down 0.9 per cent. 

 Intel said the job cuts will come primarily through attrition in the next nine months as it struggles to adjust to the slower sales climate caused by the continued lack of consumer confidence in the US. 

 Intel had previously announced its intention to trim its staff on 20 February. The company said it had 88,000 employees at the end of the last quarter and currently has about 90,000. 

 In January, the firm forecast a drop of 15 per cent in revenue, but the figure has now been increased to a 25 per cent decline in the first three months of the year. The semiconductor manufacturer said it blamed the demise on the decline in PC demand which it said is now spreading to the networking, communications and server computers. 

 Speaking late on Thursday, Intel said: "The economic slowdown affecting personal computer demand has continued and spread to the networking, communications and server sectors." 

 The company said the 5,000 jobs would be lost over the next nine months, primarily through not replacing staff who leave or retire. 

 Together with other cost-cutting measures the lay off programme is expected to help the company cut overheads by 15 per cent this quarter. 

 But the company's gross margin percentage is now revised down to 51 per cent from the previously estimated 58 per cent. 

 The firm's fourth-quarter results managed to narrowly beat already lowered expectations. 

 The company said its fourth quarter sales rose 6 per cent to $8.70 billion from $8.21 billion a year ago. 

 Dan Scovel, a semiconductor analyst at Needham & Co said: "The magnitude of the change, given the size of this company, does still cause us pause. It still is a pretty significant hit." 

 Following the news, Prudential cut its rating on the stock to "hold" from "accumulate," saying the environment may get worse before it gets worse. Lehman Bros lowered its fiscal year 2001 EPS estimates on Intel. 

 Santa Clara, California-based Intel also said its research and development spending was also being cut to US$4.2 billion down from previous plans of $4.3 billion. Gross margins are expected to contract seven points to 51 per cent.

 UK shares were dealt a double blow from across the Atlantic yesterday as a profit warning from chip maker Intel and stronger-than-expected US earnings figures sent markets sharply lower. 

 The Footsie 100 Index never got going after Intel's latest shock warning on semiconductor demand and this week's new economy mini-revival was stopped in its tracks. The techMARK 100 tumbled 77.93 points to 2308.74 while the Footsie 100 Index retreated 85.9 points to 5917.3. 

 Chip designer ARM was the biggest blue-chip casualty with a 37.5p fall to 331dp, while telecoms equipment group Marconi reversed 29p to 481p. Mid-caps Bookham Technology and Arc International were also hard hit, down 49p at 444p and 14p at 174.5 respectively. 

 Broker Teather and Greenwood has lowered its earnings forecasts for Marconi for 2002 and 2003 by 9.8 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. It argued Marconi would find it difficult to avoid being sucked down with its US rivals which are suffering the effects of economic slowdown. 

 The knock-on effect spread throughout the technology and telecoms sector, where computer services giants Logica, down 113p at 1440p, and CMG, off 57p at 790p, were joined on the downward slide by software groups Sage, down 18.75p at 298p, and Misys, 25.5p lower at 591.5p. 

 Fallen software giant Autonomy, whose rapid market decline has led to its demotion from the main index, fell 45p to 1309p despite announcing supply contracts with three telecoms companies. 

 Telecoms were back on the reverse charge led by Cable and Wireless, down 51p at 701.5p after being removed from broker ABN Amro's pan-European focus list, Colt Telecom, down 64p at 1224p, Energis, 29p lower at 430p, and BT, down 33p at 555p. Drugs company Shire Pharmaceuticals, up 51p to 1171p, provided a shot in the arm following a buy recommendation from Lehman Brothers. The company's shares have been poorly recently because of arbitrage selling linked to its takeover of the Canadian group Biochem. 

 The pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors were healthier across the board with gains for AstraZeneca, up 60p to 3120p, GlaxoSmithKline, 23p higher at 1866p, and Nycomed Amersham, up 4p at 519p. 

 Hotels-to-betting group Hilton anticipated more punters having a flutter as a result of the abolition of existing betting duty announced in the Budget. 

 Broker Credit Suisse, which has a buy rating on the stock, said it expected major bookmakers such as Hilton's and the Ladbrokes chain to achieve a net benefit of 20 per cent of betting shop earnings as a result of the switch to a gross profits tax of 15 per cent. 

 Tobacco stocks puffed higher after the Budget meant lower than expected duty increases. Imperial Tobacco firmed 4p to 733p, Gallaher was up 8p to 477p and BAT added 14p to 576p as investors sought more defensive havens. 

 Tour operator Airtours was up 20p to 290p, while First Choice rose 5.5p at 154.5p, after broker UBS Warburg increased its prices targets for both companies and gave them strong buy recommendations. 

 Chrysalis Group added 16.5p to 320p after its MXR consortium won another digital radio licence for the North West of England. 

 Transport group Arriva travelled 9.75p ahead to 294.75p as UBS Warburg upped its recommendation from hold to buy and raised its price target from 270p to 300p. 

 Scoot.com's downward spiral continued with a 3.5p fall to 34.5p. The online directory has recently sought to scupper talk of an equity issue, while speculation about a possible bid has also been played down. 

 Investors lost their appetite for Belgo Group, down bp at 3p, after the restaurant group warned trading in a number of its outlets had been hit by increased competition in London.

Intel  profit warning  chips big chunk out of market; Tech stocks deal Dow, Nasdaq triple-digit losses

An unexpected earnings warning from Intel Corp. -- the second surprise from a bellwether technology company in as many days -- sent the stock market plunging Friday as investors struggled to read the mixed signals coming from Wall Street.

Intel lowered its sales forecast in the face of slower demand for personal computers and networking equipment, and said it would cut 5,000 jobs. It joins a list of blue-chip tech companies that have delivered bad news to Wall Street in recent weeks.

Stocks took another hit when a government report showed the jobless rate remained steady and more jobs were created than expected in February. For investors, it was a signal that the economy might not be slowing enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when it meets March 20. The markets had been anticipating a cut of one-half percentage point.

"The market is direction-less, people are groping for a theme, and it's very vulnerable to these isolated events. So it can be up 200 points one day, down 200 the next. It's just reacting on emotion right now," said Michael A. Roth, principal of Stark Investments LP in Mequon.

Intel, Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. led the Nasdaq Composite Index down 115.95, or 5.4%, to 2052.78, its biggest loss since Jan. 5. The index, down for a sixth-straight week, has dropped 59% from its record a year ago.

The Dow skidded 213.63, or 2%, to 10,644.62, ending its five-day winning streak. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index dived 31.32, to 1233.42.

Also contributing to the market's slide, Cisco Systems, the world's No. 1 maker of networking equipment, said Friday it would cut up to 5,000 workers -- about 11% of its full-time work force. Cisco, which is planning to cut 3,000 of the company's temporary and contract workers, cited the worsening economy as a primary reason for its cutbacks.

The drumbeat of bad news began Wednesday when Yahoo! disclosed that Tim Koogle, its visionary chief executive, will resign and that it would miss first-quarter and full-year sales targets and break even at best. Shares in the Internet portal company, which declined 92% in the past 12 months, fell $3.89, to $17.00, on Thursday.

Other big tech stocks, including Sun Microsystems Inc., 3Com Corp. and JDS Uniphase Corp., have issued earnings warnings in recent weeks.

"This is just an unwinding of the hot sector. Tech is over-owned, over-built and Wall Street has over-invested in it. It's just going to take a while to work off," said John J. O'Hare II, vice president at Geneva Capital Management Ltd. in Milwaukee and portfolio manager for the Principal Preservation Managed Growth Portfolio.

But it's still painful to watch for many investors, who thought the tech stock surge earlier in the week signaled a rise from the bottom. Even analysts had been saying the market had taken into account all the bad news, Roth said.

"Then when a couple bellwethers come in with dramatic news -- it was a real shock to the system," he said.

And a shock to tech investors, many of whom have been watching their stock prices drop since last spring.

For them, it may be too late to sell their highest quality tech stocks.

Still, Roth said no one can be certain where the bottom is, and the peaks probably won't be as high when those stocks finally rebound.

"The evidence is we just came off one of the greatest bubbles of all time in tech and Internet stocks. While some of these stocks may recover, it's unlikely they're going to go back to some of the stratospheric levels they were at the height of the market," he said.

O'Hare believes investors who own lower quality tech issues may still want to sell.

"Historically, when bubbles burst most of the low quality stocks never come back," O'Hare said.

Tough year forecast

Down the road, companies that rely on extremely high levels of capital investment are in for a "hunker-down" year, said Thomas J. Pence, manager of the Strong Enterprise Fund.

He's worried about the impact of lower corporate capital expenditures on companies in the enterprise software and telecommunications equipment sectors, for example, and says it could keep such stocks from rallying.

O'Hare agrees, saying he expects some rallies in tech that won't hold.

"I still think the S&P 500 will be up by year-end; it just won't be driven by tech stocks," he said.

Roth doesn't see a significant upswing until the end of the year or even 2002. O'Hare is slightly more optimistic.

This is the first major economic slowdown we have entered in 30 years where there's no inflation problem and the Federal government is running a surplus, said O'Hare, who says the troubles in technology are masking some of the positives.

"In the second half of the year, people will start to look at the benefits of tax cuts and lower interest rates; they're just going to buy stocks that aren't tech stocks," O'Hare said.

Roth says he thinks the best stock pickers will be rewarded.

"The problem now for people is that it's a market where you have to really pick winners, not a market where you can buy things and they go up. And picking winners is hard work," he said.

Consequently, the magic bullet is diversification, as far as Michael R. Bostler, senior consultant at Alpha Investment Consulting Group LLC in Milwaukee, is concerned.

 Stocks in the United States buckled yesterday on more bad earnings news. 

 The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 115.95 points, or 5.4%, to close at 2052.78. It was the worst one-day drop since a 6.2% slide nine weeks ago, and the lowest close since mid-December, 1998. In the last hour of trading, the Nasdaq came within 42 points of breaking below the 2000 level. The last time the Nasdaq closed below 2000 was Dec. 14, 1998. 

 News of Intel Corp.'s slumping sales and fears the U.S. Federal Reserve may not aggressively cut interest rates in light of surprising strength in the labour market slammed the stock market. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, fell 213.63 points, or 2.0%, to close at 10,644.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 31.32, or 2.5%, to 1233.42. 

 For the week, the Dow gained 178.31 points or 1.7%, the S&P 500 fell 0.76 points and the Nasdaq lost 64.85 points or 3.1%. 

 Intel (INTC/NASDAQ) dropped US$31 3/16, or 11.5%, to US$29 7/16, after saying its first-quarter revenue would slump as much as 25%. The technology heavyweight said it would reduce its workforce by 5,000. 

 Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO/NASDAQ), the biggest maker of networking equipment, fell US$2 3/16 to US$20 5/8 and was the most-active stock with more than 159 million shares traded. Microsoft, Corp. (MSFT/NASDAQ), the No. 1 software maker, lost US$2 9/16 to US$561 1/16. 

 Drug shares rose as investors looked for companies whose profits will hold up best in a slowing economy. Pfizer Inc. (PFE/NYSE) gained US45 cents to US$42.45, Merck & Co. (MRK/NYSE) climbed US90 cents to US$75.69 and Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co. (BMY/NYSE) advanced $1.29 to $63.20. 

 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 1.09 billion shares, compared with 1.12 billion on Thursday. 

 --- 

 Toronto stocks ended the week with a down day as investors were dismayed by the release of stronger than expected U.S. employment data and Thursday's profit warning from Intel. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index fell 92.12 points, or 1.1%, to 8135.51. The S&P/TSE 60 index closed down 5.96 points, or 1.2%, to 474.70. 

 For the week the TSE 300 gained 128.66 points or 1.6%, while the S&P/TSE 60 added 7.22 points or 1.5%. 

 All but four of the TSE's 14 stock groups traded lower yesterday. The industrial products group fell 2.0%, with networking firm Nortel Networks Corp. (NT/TSE) ending down 41 cents to $27.69, accounting for 15% of the TSE 300's decline. 

 In other tech stocks, fibre-optics equipment company JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDU/TSE) fell $2.70 to $41.30, wireless Internet device maker Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM/TSE) dropped $3.90 to $62.40 and electronics manufacturing services company Celestica Inc. (CLS/TSE) lost $6.45 to $68.05. 

 The metals and minerals group fell 2.3% as Alcan Aluminium Ltd. dropped $1.92 to $59.50 and Inco Ltd. (N/TSE) lost 44 cents to $28.65. 

 The banking group fell 1.0%. In the group, Royal Bank of Canada (RY/TSE) dropped 80 cents to $47.65, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM/TSE) fell 79 cents to $50.45 and Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS/TSE) dropped 68 cents to $41.22. 

 Volume on the TSE was 148.5 million shares, compared with 192.0 million on Thursday. 

 The Canadian Venture Exchange index rose 14.39 points, or 0.5%, to 3134.50 -- a gain on the week of 43.13 points or 1.4%.

 A Texas day trader was convicted of stock fraud today for posting a phony profit warning for Lucent Technologies Inc. on an Internet message board. After 4 hours of deliberations, a federal jury in New York convicted day trader Fred Moldofsky of stock fraud. Moldofsky faces up to 10 years in prison on securities fraud charges for spreading false information on a Yahoo! Inc. message board last year, in which he announced a quarterly earnings shortfall for Lucent. Prosecutors say the Houston man's posting was made to look like a PRNewswire press release, using language copied from a real warning by Lucent two months earlier. Moldofsky's lawyers argued that he posted the phony warning because he believed Lucent executives were lying about earnings expectations, and that he never intended to deceive investors. Moldofsky made no money from his scheme and traded no shares after his posting. Stock in the world's largest phone- equipment maker fell 3.6 percent after Moldofsky posted the warning 20 times, late on March 22 and on March 23. Shares in the Murray Hill, N.J., company jumped after Lucent discovered the announcement and alerted investors. 

 . . . . INDICATORS . . . . 

 Mortgage rates around the country edged down this week, with 30- year mortgages dipping below the 7 percent mark once again. The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 6.97 percent, down from 7.03 percent last week, according to a nationwide survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. The last time 30-year mortgages averaged under 7 percent was the week ending Feb. 9 when they stood at 6.98 percent. A year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 8.23 percent and were rising. Rates hit a five- year high of 8.64 percent in mid-May of last year. Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, declined to 6.52 percent last week, down from 6.58 percent the previous week. A year ago, 15- year mortgages averaged 7.81 percent. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 6.29 percent, compared with 6.39 percent the week before. Last year, one- year ARMs averaged 6.68 percent. 

 New claims for state unemployment insurance fell last week but still hovered at a level suggesting that employers' demand for workers has eased. The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial applications for jobless benefits declined by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 370,000 for the week ending March 3. The week before, claims shot up by 41,000, according to revised figures. That was a bigger increase than the government previously estimated. The decline last week left claims at their lowest level since Feb. 17. However, the more stable four-week moving average of jobless claims, which smoothes out week-to-week volatility, rose last week to 355,250. That was the highest level since the beginning of the year. 

 . . . . DEALS . . . . 

 J.C. Penney Co. Inc. on Thursday agreed to sell its direct marketing and life insurance businesses to Dutch insurer Aegon NV for $1.3 billion in cash. The sale of J.C. Penney Direct Marketing Services Inc. and J.C. Penney Life Insurance will allow the Plano, Texas company to focus on its retail stores, chief executive Allen Questrom said. Aegon and Penney also announced a 15-year strategic alliance to offer financial products and membership services to Penney's 12 million customers. As part of the alliance, Penney will get cash payments from Aegon over the next 15 years worth about $300 million. Penney closed 45 stores last year and announced in January that it would close another 47 stores and catalog centers and cut about 5,500 jobs. Aegon, one of the largest foreign insurers in the United States, hopes to complete the deal in the second quarter. It purchased Transamerica for nearly $10 billion in 1999, making it one of the world's 10 top life insurers.

 Toronto stocks close down as economic jitters return.

 TORONTO, March 9 (Reuters) - The Toronto Stock Exchange closed down on Friday as investors scrambled out of tech issues after another profit warning in that sector and new jobs data confirmed Canada would not escape the effects of a U.S.-led economic slowdown. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index finished the week down 92.12 points, or 1.12 percent, at 8135.51. The blue-chip S&P/TSE 60 index ended down 5.96 points, or 1.24 percent, at 474.70. 

 TSE 300 volume was 148.1 million shares traded worth C$2.6 billion. Market momentum was weak as 574 issues closed down, 499 advanced and 233 were unchanged. 

 All but four of the TSE 300's 14 subindexes were down in general weakness, traders said. 

 The industrial products sector, home to Canada's major tech stocks, closed down 110.26 points, or 1.99 percent, at 5428.90 after computer chip maker Intel Corp. warned its first-quarter earnings would fall short of estimates because of slowing computer sales in the United States. 

 But analysts said the broader economic issues were mostly at play in Friday's market as mounting layoffs could drag the services industry down and damage consumer confidence. 

 "If there was a glimmer of hope that Canada's markets would emerge from the grips of the U.S economic slowdown unscathed, it was probably quashed with the release of this morning's unemployment figures," a paper published by TD Economics said. 

 It said Canadian employment numbers actually fell 23,500 positions in February, much worse than market expectations of a gain of 10,000 jobs. 

 South of the border stocks also succumbed to the U.S. economic slowdown and a key U.S. jobs report which diminished hopes the Federal Reserve would make a sizable cut in interest rates when policy makers meet next on March 20. 

 The U.S. jobs market grew at a larger than anticipated 135,000 in February after gaining 224,000 in January. 

 The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 115.95 points, or 5.35 percent, to 2,052.78 at the close. It hit an intra-day low unseen since mid-December 1998. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial average ended down 213.63 points, or 1.97 percent, at 10,644.62.

 Techs thump eurostocks as Intel, data spark sell-off.

 LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - European stock markets dropped on Friday, felled again by tech issues as a warning from chip giant Intel was compounded by strong U.S. jobs data that cast a shadow over hopes for a near-term recovery on bourses. 

 The pan-European FTSE Eurotop 300 closed down 1.2 percent and the DJ Stoxx 50 lost 0.83 percent. 

 Alcatel and Ericsson were among the usual blue-chip suspects knocking 4.8 percent off the technology index as the sentiment-setting Nasdaq index fell 5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 200 points. 

 The European tech sector has lost around 10 percent from a peak of 593 on the technology index, touched during a mini-rally earlier this week, and is a whopping 56 percent below its March 2000 high. 

 Investors' hopes for a major interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve - seen as a lifeline to ailing markets - were dashed after February U.S. employment report showed the economy created 135,000 new jobs outside the farm sector last month. That was well above Wall Street expectations for a gain of 62,000. 

 "The conclusion appears to be that the economy is better off, and 75 basis points on the 20th of March is out the window," said Paul Horne, European equity market economist with Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, referring to the chances of the Fed cutting interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at its March 20 meeting. 

 "The market is still expecting 50 basis points. If retail sales in February were good, markets are likely to start worrying about only a 25 basis point cut," he added. 

 CHIPS DOWN, AIXTRON BUCKS TREND 

 European chip stocks fell sharply after world market leader Intel warned overnight of a sharp slowdown in first-quarter sales growth and growing pressure on margins. The key Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 6.5 percent. 

 In its third consecutive sales warning, Intel said first-quarter sales would fall as much as 25 percent from the previous quarter as an economic slowdown spread beyond personal computers to networking communications and server components. 

 Earnings-per-share were likely to be decimated by lower margins, analysts said. 

 Among Europe's chip-related stocks, Germany's Infineon slid 5.22 percent, Britain's ARM Holdings fell 10.2 percent, French-Italian STMicroelectronics shed 5.6 percent, and Dutch ASM Lithography was down 3.3 percent. 

 Shares in Germany's Aixtron shrugged off the sector gloom, rising 9.3 percent after full-year results beat analysts' expectations and the firm said it was not concerned about orders for custom-made products being canceled. 

 HOLES IN THEORY 

 Intel's bleak outlook, which came a day after Internet media titan Yahoo's profit warning, poked holes in the much-discussed theory that markets had bottomed. 

 Three top Wall Street strategists have recently advised clients to buy stocks, with the latest call from Goldman Sachs' Abby Joseph Cohen fuelling a three-day tech rally. 

 Some fund managers said the bullish calls were premature. 

 "It's too early," said Chris Woods, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors in London, which globally manages more than $100 billion in funds. 

 "We have not got the bad news out of the way yet, but I do think that some time toward the third quarter the market will start to anticipate a proper pulling out of the slowdown." 

 In another sign of how tech firms in particular are struggling with the sluggish economy and slack demand, computer networking giant Cisco told Reuters it plans to cut its work force by 5 percent to tackle a downturn in business. 

 Back in Europe, Alcatel dropped 6 percent as brokers cut earnings estimates and target prices based on the firm's warning that its mobile handset business was diminishing. 

 Other active stocks included German e-business consultancy Orbis AG, which hit an all-time low and closed down 14.4 percent after 2000 earnings fell short of targets and the firm lowered its 2001 sales forecast. 

 Italian publisher and Internet group Seat Pagine Gialle dropped 6.7 percent to close at 1.42 euros, a new 12-month low. 

 AIR LIQUIDE 

 Industrial gases group Air Liquide joined chip makers on the decliners' list, shedding 5.9 percent after would-be acquirer Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux said it had ended merger talks. 

 The French utilities firm Suez saw its stock climb 2.9 percent. Many investors thought the discussions with Air Liquide made little sense. 

 In keeping with a familiar pattern, defensives such as pharmaceuticals, insurers and energy all gained ground, led by AstraZeneca, up 1.96 percent. 

 In the same sector, Shire Pharmaceuticals bounced 4.5 percent from recent losses amid arbitrage pressure ahead of its merger with Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc. 

 The health-care index was up 0.5 percent overall, as heavyweight GlaxoSmithKline also put on 1.25 percent. 

 Other winners included France's Vivendi Environment, which added 3.7 percent after targeting annual sales growth of 10 percent and releasing 2000 net income gains. 

 Shares in Vivendi Universal nosed up 0.7 percent after the group reported 2000 operating profit up 40 percent at 2.57 billion euros and promised to deliver on its goal to boost earnings as a result of its trans-Atlantic megamerger.

 All but four of the TSE 300's 14 subindexes were down. 

 The industrial products sector, home to Canada's major tech stocks, closed down 110.26 points, or 1.99 percent, at 5428.90 after computer chip maker Intel Corp. warned its first-quarter earnings would fall short of estimates because of slowing computer sales in the United States. 

 In that sector heavyweight Nortel Networks closed off 41 Canadian cents at C$27.69, Celestica Inc was down C$6.49 at C$68.05, Research In Motion slipped C$3.90 to C$62.40, and Ballard Power Systems dropped C$6.43 to C$61.42. 

 Analysts said broader economic issues were mostly at play in Friday's market as mounting layoffs could drag the services industry down and damage consumer confidence. 

 Analysts said with Canada's economic picture no longer looking much better than that of the United States, the pressure will be on Ottawa to chop interest rates aggressively to stimulate the economy. 

 "If there was a glimmer of hope that Canada's markets would emerge from the grips of the U.S economic slowdown unscathed, it was probably quashed with the release of this morning's unemployment figures," a paper published by TD Economics said. 

 Canadian employment numbers actually fell by 23,500 positions in February, much worse than market expectations of a gain of 10,000 jobs. 

 South of the border, stocks also succumbed to the U.S. economic slowdown and a key U.S. jobs report that diminished hopes the Federal Reserve would make more than a half percentage-point cut in interest rates when policy makers meet next on March 20. 

 The U.S. jobs market grew at a larger than anticipated 135,000 in February after gaining 224,000 in January. 

 The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 115.95 points, or 5.35 percent, to 2,052.78 at the close. It hit an intra-day low unseen since mid-December 1998. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial average ended down 213.63 points, or 1.97 percent, at 10,644.62. 

 Earlier in the day investors swarmed to the safe haven of gold and precious minerals stocks, as spot gold hit a two-month high, closing at $271.50 in London. New York gold also rallied to $271.50 an ounce, the highest since Jan. 8. 

 Trading in Canadian gold miners was brisk. Barrick Gold was the third most traded stock on the TSE by volume, ending down 90 Canadian cents at C$25.85 on volume of 35.6 million shares, while Placer Dome slid 55 Canadian cents to C$15.30 on volume of 34.8 million. 

 Shares in Chieftain International were hoisted C$2.25 to C$44.25 at the close, a day after the mid-sized oil and gas producer said it was searching for a merger partner or buyer to attract more attention from the investment community. 

 In other corporate news, JDS Uniphase Corp. , the world's No. 1 supplier of fiber-optic components for telecom networks, said it will continue to buy and invest in companies to fuel growth despite slumping sales. 

 Its shares closed down C$2.70 at C$41.30 in Toronto. 

 It said it will buy a 5.1 percent stake in Finland's Okmetic for about $8.4 million in cash. JDS has also struck a long-term contract to buy Okmetic silicon wafers.

 Mexican stocks fall 1.26 pct on Nasdaq rout.

 MEXICO CITY, March 9 (Reuters) - Mexican stocks moved 1.26 percent lower amid cautious trade on Friday, dragged down by a sell-off on the Nasdaq after technology bellwether Intel issued another profit warning, traders said. 

 "Trading is very cautious and investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude," said a local trader. 

 Mexico's benchmark IPC index of 36 leading stocks fell 80.18 points, to 6,280.89. 

 The Nasdaq composite index, which strongly influences the local market, shed 4.18 percent to 2,079 on Intel's profit warning and employment data that dampened investor hopes for another cut in U.S. interest rates. 

 After the market closed on Thursday Intel, the No. 1 computer chip maker, warned for a third quarter in a row that its first-quarter earnings would not meet Wall Street estimates due to slowing U.S. personal computer sales. 

 Elsewhere, the U.S. Labor Department said the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2 percent in February, matching economists' forecasts, but the number of workers hired was larger than expected, suggesting the U.S. economy is not as troubled as some fear. 

 The U.S. Federal Reserve meets on March 20 to decide on monetary policy. Some investors fear the latest jobs report will make the Fed less aggressive in cutting rates. 

 The United States is the destination of nearly 90 percent of Mexico's exports, and a marked slowdown in the U.S. economy hurts its southern neighbor. 

 In local market action, shares of Mexico's leading media and telecom stocks, which often reflect tech sector movement on Wall Street, were among the top losers. 

 Shares of telecommunications giant Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex) fell 1.58 percent to 16.22 pesos, while its New York-listed ADRs fell 49 cents, or 1.44 percent, to $33.61. 

 Shares of Latin America's leading wireless operator, America Movil, recently spun off from Telmex, shed 1.16 percent to 8.54 pesos. Its ADRs fell 15 cents, or 0.84 percent, to $17.77. 

 Shares of Mexico's largest broadcaster Grupo Televisa shed 1.49 percent to 19.78 pesos, and its ADRs fell 50 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $41.02. 

 Shares of Televisa rival TV Azteca shed 1.19 percent to 5.79 pesos, while its ADRs fell 10 cents, or 1.04 percent, to $9.55. 

 In the currency market, the benchmark 48-hour peso contract weakened 3.2 centavos to 9.6700/9.6820 per dollar on the Nasdaq's weakness.

 U.S. Treasury yields fall in London before payrolls.

 LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell in London on Friday ahead of a key report which is expected to show a weakening U.S. job market, reinforcing the view for an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. 

 Analysts said weakness in technology stocks after a third profit warning from global chip leader Intel could also give fixed income markets a boost. 

 "You could get a double whammy of good news for bonds in terms of weaker stocks and a weaker payrolls number," said Adam Chester, senior economist at Halifax Group Treasury in London. 

 "If we get a weak jobs report, that will confirm market expectations of a 50 basis points rate cut on March 20." 

 By 1050 GMT, the benchmark 10-year note was priced at 100-28 to yield 4.89 percent, down 2.0 basis points from New York on Thursday. Two-year notes were at 100-13 and yielding 4.40 percent, down 3.8 basis points. 

 The long bond was at 101-08 and yielding 5.29 percent, compared with 5.31 percent in New York. 

 The benchmark June T-note future was up 6/64 at 106-03 and the T-bond future was up 6/32 at 105-26. 

 Economists polled by Reuters on average forecast the payrolls report would show an increase of 62,000 jobs in February, compared with 268,000 the previous month. 

 The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at the 4.2 percent level it rose to in January. Average hourly earnings are forecast to rise by 0.3 percent in February after an unchanged reading the previous month. 

 Analysts at HypoVereinsbank said the T-note future could rally past resistance at 106-11 after a weak employment report. 

 "Payrolls data may surprise slightly on the downside on the back of a continued increase in jobless claims and a rather bearish picture drawn by the Fed's Beige Book," they said in a research note. 

 First-time jobless claims on Thursday came in far higher than forecast at 370,000 for the week ended March 3 and the Beige Book on Wednesday showed the economy grew at a "sluggish to modest" pace at the start of 2001. 

 But with the market firmly expecting a half-point cut by the Fed in 10 days, some traders said it would take a surprisingly weak jobs report to trigger a significant rally in bonds. 

 "If it's a really weak number, some people think the Fed might even ease today," said one London trader. 

 Chester at Halifax said investors were still trading off rate sentiment in the U.S. and a weak number would lead people to focus on just how much easing the Fed needs to do this year. 

 "It's really going to be the big thing today, and obviously what equity markets are doing," he said, adding bad news for the economy on Friday could spell good news for rates and bonds. 

 Intel's warning of disappointing revenues came after the Nasdaq closed down 2.48 percent on Thursday, sending the futures contract on the tech-heavy index down 40 points by 1050 GMT. 

 T-notes were steady to German Bunds, with the 10-year yield spread at 25 basis points. The 10-year dollar swap sread stood at 89 basis points compared with 91.75 at the Chicago close.

 (updates price, fund manager quote and earnings downgrade in paras 2,5,6,10,11) 

 NEW DELHI, March 9 (Reuters) - Shares of computer education and software services firm NIIT plunged 16 percent to a 28-month low, and have now plummeted 32 percent since the company issued a profit warning late Wednesday. 

 NIIT's shares were down 16 percent to 842.90 rupees, a 28-month low, the share briefly bounced to 860 rupee levels, but fell back again. 

 At 11:15 a.m.(0545 GMT), NIIT was trading at 851.10, still down 15.18 percent. The 30-issue benchmark index was 3.04 percent down at that point. 

 "The share continues to fall because of the earnings warning. Also the sentiment in the market is weak. That too is affecting the share price," said a dealer with a Bombay-based brokerage. 

 "It's a crisis of confidence," the dealer added. 

 A fund manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity said: "It looks difficult for any sort of contrarian buying to emerge on NIIT at the moment. Nobody wants to be the first one." 

 "Technically, NIIT still looks weaker. Contrarian buyers are likely to emerge in the 600-700 rupees range," the fund manager said. 

 Late Wednesday, NIIT issued am earnings warning, saying two U.S. clients were merging and it had put on hold new projects. 

 The company said its was also facing start delays in other projects. 

 Company chairman Rajendra Pawar subsequently told Reuters that he now expected revenue for the current January-March quarter to be $7 million less than previously forecast. That is equivalent to almost 11 percent of the company's total revenue in the past October-December quarter. 

 The sentiment on the stock was further hit as a number of research houses issued price target downgrades based on the earnings warning. 

 DBS Securities and UBS Warburg cut their earnings forecasts for NIIT after its announcement while Salomon Smith Barney said it was reviewing the firm's earnings estimates. 

 UBS downgraded NIIT's rating to reduce from hold and DBS cut it to neutral from overweight. UBS also lowered NIIT's 12-month price target to 1,200 from 1,900 while Goldman reduced the fair value on the firm to 1,300 rupees from 1,750.

 UPDATE 1-China portals take a beating despite market potential.

 HONG KONG, March 9 (Reuters) - Shares in China's three leading Web portals have fallen to all-time lows after a second profit warning from Web giant Yahoo, underscoring the bleak near-term outlook for the Chinese firms despite strong growth in the number of mainland Internet users. 

 Netease.com Inc and Sina.com ended down 19.35 percent and 18.57 percent, respectively, on Nasdaq on Thursday while the third contender for the top portal in China, Sohu.com , fell 6.25 percent to US$0.94. 

 Stocks that dwell under $1 for an extended time are subject to review by Nasdaq officials for possible de-listing. 

 Analysts in Hong Kong said the Chinese firms were taking a direct hit from Yahoo's gloomy news. 

 None of the portals' shares changed hands in after-hours trading, according to Instinet electronic brokerage. 

 "Obviously it has to do with Yahoo. What's being called into question in investors' minds is the portal business model," said Matt Adams, Internet analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. 

 Yahoo fell 15.52 percent to an all-time low of US$17.69 after it said first-quarter results would fall short of already lowered expectations, and that Timothy Koogle would step down as chief executive, but will remain chairman. 

 Yahoo singled out a deteriorating climate in online ad sales, which was also noted by the three Chinese portals when they gave gloomy outlooks this year while reporting fourth quarter results. 

 Netease CEO King Lai said last week that the firm's revenues would fall to US$2.5-2.7 million in the first quarter from $3.18 million in the last quarter of 2000, citing slackening ad sales. 

 Ads are a key revenue driver for the business-to-consumer firms in China, which have yet to report any profits. 

 BIG MARKET, SMALL REVENUES 

 Joe Sweeney, Internet analyst at Gartner Group, said that even though China will have the largest number of Internet users in the world in a few years - the market is expected to grow 79 percent this year to nearly 23 million users - it is plagued by regulatory uncertainty and low-yielding revenue. 

 "How much money will be able to be accessed in that market, and how the political environment will work with being able to tap that market is highly questionable at this time," Sweeney said. 

 Merrill Lynch recently cut their forecast for total online ads spending in China to US$80 million from $120 million in 2001. 

 Analysts agree a shakeup among Chinese portals is imminent. 

 Lycos Asia, a unit of Internet giant Terra Lycos SA, said on Thursday it will buy the Hong Kong-based Chinese Web portal MyRice.com - though it declined to give a price. 

 Netease has hired Goldman Sachs to help it find a buyer. 

 Heavy share losses should make Chinese portals attractive targets for outsiders seeking toeholds in the country's fast growing market, but some analysts noted most potential predators have been wounded by the market's slide as well. 

 A major acquisition in China could be delayed after the dismal turn in the dotcom sector on Thursday, CSFB's Adams said. 

 With weakened share prices, top foreign portals could now be less equipped to buy Chinese firms as Internet deals often use shares as payment, he said. U.S. and European Web giants may also be waiting for the market valuation of the listed China portals to fall further. 

 "The foreign portals actually benefit from allowing the China portals to really hang on the vine," Adams said. 

 Chinadotcom , on the other hand, has said it is shopping for Internet businesses. 

 The firm boasts a US$487 million war chest thanks to an initial public offering at the height of the Internet craze in 1999. However, it has not been immune to the latest selloff. Its shares on Nasdaq fell 21.88 percent to US$3.13. 

 It has predicted little or no revenue growth in the first quarter versus the last quarter of 2000. It has yet to announce full-year 2000 results, which had been expected in mid-February.

 UPDATE 2-AnnTaylor issues  profit warning  as Q4 profits tumble. 

 By Monica Summers 
884 words

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - AnnTaylor Stores Corp. , which earlier on Thursday warned that earnings for the first half of 2001 would fall short of expectations, said later that its fourth-quarter net income fell 68 percent as it struggled against heavy discounting on its spring merchandise. 

 The New York-based retailer, which earlier this year saw its President and Chief Operating Officer Patricia DeRosa leave the company, also said it has found a replacement for one of the positions she vacated. Chief Financial Officer Barry Erdos has been appointed to succeed DeRosa as COO. 

 James Smith will succeed Erdos as chief financial officer. 

 In was no secret that AnnTaylor, which operates AnnTaylor and AnnTaylor Loft stores, had been struggling with its current product offering for some time, first working with a holiday season selection that was too fancy for its target clientele and also with spring merchandise that failed to hit as well. 

 And now that the company is working to get those items off the shelves using heavy markdowns, it is also bracing for the negative affects those discounts are going to have on its earnings and gross margins for the first two quarters of 2001. 

 "Getting through spring appears to me to be an issue of damage control," said Richard Jaffe, retail analyst with UBS PaineWebber. 

 "They recognized they have the wrong product in the stores (and) the issue has been addressed on the most senior levels," Jaffe said, referring to DeRosa's departure. 

 "But they can't change what's in the pipeline for the next several months," he added. "Now it's just managing through product that's perhaps too contemporary for its customer." 

 MERCHANDISE STRUGGLES LEAD TO EARNINGS SHORTFALL 

 As a result of these issues, AnnTaylor said it expects earnings per share of 33 cents to 37 cents for its fiscal first quarter and 28 cents to 32 cents for the second quarter - well below the 44 cents and 40 cents, respectively, analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had on average been expecting. 

 The retailer also said same-store sales will decline in the low-single digits for the first half of the year. 

 Despite the shortfalls, however, shares of AnnTaylor managed to rise almost 7 percent, or about $1.73, to close at $27.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's 52-week range is $18.25 to $44.88. 

 Shares have fallen 40 percent in the past six months. 

 But today's rise in stock price, as well as the rise of several other specialty retailers, could be a signal that investors are beginning to believe that the worst of retail is over and that things can only get better from here on out. 

 "I can't easily explain the behavior of the stock market day to day," Jaffe said. "Is it a rotation issue? Is it relief that things weren't worse in February?" 

 "The stocks have sold off in the past several days, so maybe now having seen them trade down people are seeing things weren't that bad and buying them back up a little bit here," Jaffe said. "It could be that simple." 

 FOURTH QUARTER SHOWS SIGNS OF STRAIN 

 After the market closed on Thursday, the company said its net income for the quarter ended Feb. 3, fell to $5.1 million, or 18 cents a share, from $15.9 million, or 50 cents as share, in the year-ago quarter. 

 Wall Street analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected a profit of 18 cents a share for the quarter. 

 Per-share results included the deduction of goodwill amortization of 8 cents a share for both the 2000 and 1999 fourth quarters, the company said. After the nonrecurring charge, net income was $3.8 million, or 13 cents a share, in the latest quarter. 

 Sales for the quarter rose 15.7 percent to $343.6 million from $297.1 million in the year-ago quarter, while sales at stores open at least one year fell 4.3 percent for the quarter compared with a rise of 2.3 percent a year ago. 

 AND FOR OUR NEXT PRESENTATION... 

 Despite the shortfalls, Chairman and Chief Executive J. Patrick Spainhour said the company is more confident about its fall product assortment, and that he expects same-store sales growth for the season in the low to mid-single digits. 

 February same-store sales fell 6.1 percent. 

 In addition, the company said it is comfortable with an earnings projection of $2.24 to $2.28 per share for its current fiscal year, well above the First Call estimate of $2.19. 

 "Our styling will be as good as it has been based upon the trends that we see in the marketplace," Spainhour said in a conference call. "But we're smarter in terms of the inventory management and in terms of the merchandising and how it should flow into the stores than we were last year." 

 AnnTaylor, which operates 478 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, said it plans to open two AnnTaylor stores and 10 AnnTaylor Loft stores and to expand or relocate four existing AnnTaylor stores in the first quarter.

 Intel Corp. warned Thursday that its previous forecast of a 15 percent drop in sales for the first quarter was too optimistic, and it, too, will be forced to cut jobs. 

 Intel said it now expects first-quarter revenue to be 25 percent lower than in the fourth quarter. It plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs, or about 5.7 percent of its work force, primarily through attrition. 

 Intel said the impact in Austin, where it employs 500 people,will be "very minimal." 

 The company will continue its selective hiring of technical workers, but "if people leave, we will have to look at whether we fill the positions," said spokeswoman Jeanne Forbis. 

 The company's attrition program is expected to last for nine months. Intel already had said it would slow the construction of a new design facility in downtown Austin as part of a previous cost-cutting measure. 

 The fallout from Thursday's announcement extends beyond Intel, signaling more pain ahead for a computer industry that's already hurting. 

 While the first quarter is typically weak for Intel and its peers, the dropoff in revenue between the fourth and first quarters usually is in the low single digits. Intel did not say how much earnings would be affected. It reports full results April 17. 

 Many expect other tech companies, especially in the personal-computer market that gets more than 80 percent of its processors from Intel, to follow suit. 

 "I expect we'll see more (warnings) -- absolutely," said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 

 Intel's profit warning signals a much deeper funk for technology demand, spreading from PCs to other markets. 

 "This slowdown in demand for PCs has continued and has spread through nearly all sectors of our business and through all geographies," said Sean Maloney, director of Intel's sales and marketing group. 

 Kumar added: "In the past Intel has had some kind of buffering from non-PC divisions. Twenty percent of their business was flash memory, and 75 percent of that was the cell phone market. That market has imploded as well." As layoffs rippled across the technology industry, Intel has tried to find ways to reduce costs without cutting jobs. Last week, the company vowed to continue to invest in research. 

 "You never save your way out of a recession," Chief Executive Craig Barrett has said repeatedly . 

 But on Thursday, Intel said it couldn't grow its way out of the current slowdown, either.

 KC WHEAT FUTURES CLOSE HIGHER: Kansas City wheat futures closed higher Thursday after the government lowered its projections for ending stocks of wheat. Chicago wheat futures finished mixed, while corn was higher and soybeans mostly lower. 

 Kansas City Value Line stock index futures and Isdex Internet stock index futures fell. 

 The U.S. Department of Agriculture projected 2000-01 U.S. wheat ending stocks at 834 million bushels, down from the previous estimate of 839 million bushels. 

 Corn futures were boosted by better-than-expected exports. The Agriculture Department said that for the week that ended March 1, net export sales of corn were 875,900 metric tons, above estimates of 500,000 to 850,000 metric tons. 

 Soybeans rose after a government forecast in Brazil pegged that country's soybean production at a smaller-than-expected 34.8 million metric tons. Brazil and the United States are the world's top soybean producers. 

 However, production from Argentina was raised to 25 million metric tons from the previous estimate of 24 million metric tons. 

 The Kansas City Value Line and Isdex finished lower as traders squared positions ahead of today's government report on employment. 

 "Everyone's got their eye on that," said Kansas City trader Paul Dow. 

 The number could show the economy is slowing more than expected and could prompt an interest rate cut before the Federal Reserve's meeting later this month. 

 Meanwhile, a profit warning from Yahoo hung over the technology sector, with investors putting their money into safer stocks. 

 "The tech sector is not the place to be," Dow said.

 Irish Govt Admits US Slowdown Impacting On Irish Economy

 DUBLIN -(Dow Jones)- The Irish government has admitted for the first time that the slowdown in the U.S. high-tech sector is beginning to be felt on this side of the Atlantic. 

 Late Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney acknowledged that the downturn in the U.S. will have consequences for the so-called Celtic Tiger economy, one that has been largely built on foreign direct investment by U.S. multinationals. 

 "There's no doubt it's having an impact," Harney said after an Internet conference in Virginia. "In some sectors there's a slowdown. We're not getting the level of investment we got 18 months ago to two years ago," she said. 

 Harney's comments come on the heels of a profit warning from Intel(INTC), Ireland's second largest U.S. employer, which said its first-quarter sales will be 25% below the previous quarter. Intel employs 4,500 people in Ireland. 

 While Intel said it's looking to cut 5,000 jobs worldwide, it isn't immediately known how many, if any, of those will be in Ireland. Phone calls to Intel Friday weren't returned. 

 "Mary Harney is 100% correct," said Jim Power, economist at pension fund managers Friends First. "She's right to be concerned, despite those who argue that Ireland is immune to the U.S. There's a huge level of service sector employment behind our IT sector." 

 Intel already said in December it's postponing plans for a EUR2.15 billion expansion of its wafer-making plant in Leixlip, outside Dublin. 

 Power said any U.S. economic weakness would have a "huge" impact on consumer and business confidence in Ireland. "If the U.S. economy were to go into a prolonged downturn, it'd be naive for any Irish politician to ignore this," he said. 

 Power also reckons that the U.S. economy is slowing rapidly, and particularly in the high-tech sector "where we've such a dependence." He expects cost-cutting and job-shedding. "Ireland is certainly at risk," he said. 

 Still, some economists point to the fact that Ireland's IT sector, which employs 110,000 people, is relatively small, citing any future sharp rise in interest rates and taxes as more of a threat. 

 "The IT sector isn't huge," said Eunan King, economist at NCB Stockbrokers. "People who say (a U.S. downturn) will impact on the economy aren't looking at the size of the sector. It's a fast growing one from a small base, accounting for just 7% of the labor market." 

 King says that while U.S. multinationals import a lot of their raw materials, they also export a lot of their profits. According to him, U.S. high-tech investment "was important in getting the growth story going in the economy. But any one factor like IT isn't enough to derail the economy."

 USFreightways 1Q Warning Signals More Trucker Woes

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The first quarter profit warning from USFreightways Corp. (USFC) could be one of many earnings shortfalls emerging from the nation's struggling trucking companies. 

 Analysts said an economic slowdown, higher costs and volatile weather likely will drive more truckers to issue first quarter profit warnings. 

 "It's going to be a tough quarter for everyone," said Donald Broughton, transportation analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 

 While some trucking companies are weathering the downturn better than others, "even those companies are struggling to make the number," Broughton said. 

 Dan Moore, analyst at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark., said: "The recent downturn in the economy has clearly had an impact on the utilization of trucking companies' assets. That will be born out in the first quarter earnings." 

 "We'll likely see more negative announcements" from companies that like USFreightways consolidate several customers' shipments in one truck, Moore predicted. 

 USFreightways, Rosemont, Ill., said Friday that first quarter earnings will fall "substantially below" Wall Street estimates. 

 Analysts expected the company to earn 66 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The carrier cited the economic slowdown and severe weather, and said it plans "significant" job cuts. 

 Shares of USFreightways recently were down $4.19, or 12.2%, to $30 on volume of 1.4 million, far outstripping the average daily volume of 280,000. 

 USFreightways' warning also sent shares of other trucking companies lower. J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT) stock was recently down 6%, while Yellow Corp. (YELL) fell 3.2%. 

 J.B. Hunt, of Lowell, Ark., said last month its first-quarter results would trail expectations due to slower demand. Swift Transportation Co. (SWFT) of Phoenix also said last month that its first-quarter profit would fall short of expectations because of softer demand for hauling goods. 

 Unlike USFreightways, Swift and J.B. Hunt are "truckload" carriers that devote an entire truck to one shipper's freight. 

 The trucking industry, which hauls more than 80% of the value of tangible goods in the economy, is mired in a slump that took hold more than a year ago and intensified in the fourth quarter of last year. 

 Truck tonnage, a measure of the volume of goods shipped by trucking companies, declined for 14 consecutive months through December 2000 before rebounding slightly in January, the latest month for which data are available. 

 Despite the rebound, trucking volumes are still "fairly weak," said Bob Costello, chief economist at American Trucking Associations, an industry group. 

 "Until the manufacturing sector shows a sustained rebound, trucking companies...should expect weaker volumes," Costello said. 

 Conditions could improve by the second half of the year if the proposed tax cut takes effect, diesel-fuel prices fall and the Federal Reserve continues to boost money supply aggressively, said A.G. Edwards' Broughton. 

 "Longer-term, we remain optimistic about industry fundamentals," said Stephens' Moore, who rates truckload carriers overweight and "less-than-truckload" carriers, such as USFreightways, hold to underweight.

NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones industrials surged to their best close in three weeks Thursday as investors nervous about the economy added to their holdings of food, energy and other stocks perceived as low-risk.

Technology issues fell, reflecting persistent doubts about when the sector's earnings will improve. A profit warning from bellwether Yahoo! added to the pessimism.

``I think people are still being more conservative and you really have to show earnings in this market to attract new money,'' said Robert Harrington, head of listed equity trading at UBS Warburg. ``Technology just isn't doing that right now.''

The Dow closed up 128.65 at 10,858.25, its highest close since Feb. 15 and its fifth straight positive session up.

Broader indexes were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index slid 55.10 to 2,168.82, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.87 to 1,264.76.

The session ended a three-day winning streak for the major stock indexes. Analysts blamed Yahoo's announcement and the absence of any good news to distract investors from the reality that the economy and market remain weak.

Yahoo fell $3.31 to $17.69, a 16 percent decline, extending a loss that began late Wednesday when the Internet company said earnings would be weaker than expected and that it was looking for a new chief executive.

``There's a big hangover from Yahoo's news. We also had a strong Nasdaq for three days, so some of this is profit-taking,'' said John Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence Investment Associates.

Indeed, other technology companies struggled to move forward.

The Dow's advance was limited by losses in IBM, which fell $1.08 to $106.47, and Microsoft, down $1.44 at $59.25.

But manufacturing and energy-related stocks easily offset the losses. ExxonMobil rose $1.64 to $85.85, while 3M, benefiting from a positive research note by Merrill Lynch, was up $4.26 at $117.19. Coca-Cola rose 97 cents to $51.40.

The market's cautious mood might also indicate anxiety about the government's employment report due out today.

``I wouldn't be surprised to see a weak report, and the market is starting to anticipate that, '' said Forelli, the Independence Investment manager. ``The only good news we have to look forward to is (Federal Reserve Chairman) Alan Greenspan cutting rates, and that's still more than a week away.''

The Fed is expected to lower interest rates for the third time this year at its March 20 meeting.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 8 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.11 billion shares.

 Yahoo! brings only despair a year after Nasdaq peak.

 Yahoo!, the world's leading internet portal, demonstrated a grim sense of timing when it announced that chief executive Tim Koogle was stepping down late on Wednesday. 

 Exactly one year ago today, the Nasdaq index on which Yahoo! is listed reached its peak of 5,048.2 points, when it was worth $6.45 trillion ( #4.4 trillion). The statement from Yahoo!, together with a warning that profits this quarter would be far lower than expected, combined to make this an anniversary investors would prefer to forget. In the past 12 months the Nasdaq index has more than halved in the wake of the dot.com bubble bursting and a series of profit warnings from a host of large technology firms. Yesterday it had fallen a further 60 points to 2,163 by the time London closed. 

 The announcement from Yahoo! dragged shares across the whole internet and related sectors down yet again. T-Online, Europe's largest internet service provider owned by Deutsche Telekom fell by nearly 6% to 11.80 ( #7.50), close to its all-time low. At its peak in May last year, T-Online was trading at 48 a share. 

 Spain's Terra Lycos was 10% lower, and France's Wanadoo, which owns Freeserve, was 7% softer. 

 Stock in Yahoo! was ravaged in heavy trading, falling almost 20% to $16 during the early afternoon. `The best dot.com can't make it, and that's troubling for the entire internet economy," one trader said. 

 The Yahoo! warning said revenues during the current quarter would be $170m-$180m, against forecasts of $232m. Yahoo! had been regarded as one of the internet's biggest financial success sto ries, with revenue nearly doubling last year to #1.1bn. 

 But analysts have begun to question the very fundamentals of the Yahoo! model which relies heavily on advertising for revenues - some 90% of its total last year. The softening of the advertising market, par ticularly in the US, could hardly have come at a worse time for an industry still stumbling towards maturity. 

 Yahoo!, along with other US internet portals, relied heavily on advertising from other dot.coms and has found itself in a vicious circle. Its European peers at least are less dependent. Merrill Lynch predicts that online advertising will grow by about 25% in Europe this year, compared with a flat performance in the US. 

 The US also has further to fall. Estimates suggest that between $600m-$900m was spent on online advertising in Europe last year compared with $2bn in the US third quarter alone. 

 Silicon Valley-based online technology news provider CNET Networks, communications equipment maker Tellabs and TIBCO Software all contributed to the despair yesterday with their own profit warnings. 

 Not even the endorsement of one of the pioneers of the internet can see off the gloom. Loudcloud, the internet infrastructure firm co-founded by former Netscape executive Marc Andreessen, cut its offer price and raised the number of shares on offer in its imminent flotation. 

 Yahoo! has now begun the search for a replacement for Mr Koogle, who will remain with the company as chairman. Last month, Fabiola Arredondo, chief executive of Yahoo! Europe also quit to purse `private business interests'. 

 A chief executive, however, may not be the only new member of the Yahoo! board as rumours continued to circulate that the company may fall prey to a potential takeover or at least forge an alliance with a traditional media firm with some traditional media assets. Yahoo!'s market capitalisation was less than $9bn last night, down from more than $100bn at its height. 

 News Corporation, Disney, Viacom and Vivendi Universal have all been named. If a deal were done, it would be a similar combination of content and internet access as the AOL Time Warner model. AOL Time Warner with its broad spread of businesses maintained yesterday that it still expected to see revenues growth of 12% to 15% this year.

 Yahoo! spells out problems.

Profit warning sends shivers through the internet sector 

 THE mere fact that Yahoo! is capable of issuing a profits warning was one of the main reasons for yesterday's sharp intake of breath throughout the global internet community. 

 Very few pure internet players have been able to eke a living out of the medium. Those in or 

 bordering on the black have, for the most part, done so through big alliances with content-rich partners and parent companies. 

 Yahoo!, which is really the only major independent internet media company around, asked on Wednesday for trading in its shares to be suspended. After the US markets had closed for the day, it announced that revenues for the first-quarter of this year would be about 25% lower than previously expected, while 

 profits would be non-existent. 

 Even worse, Yahoo! said 

 rapidly deteriorating market 

 conditions meant it would be happy to break even for the whole of 2001. In one swoop, it wiped existing earnings forecasts from 36 cents per share to zero. 

 The news immediately cast a grim shadow over the entire 

 sector, as Yahoo!'s problems are certain to affect everyone else in the industry. Accepted wisdom is that if companies like Yahoo! 

 cannot make money out of the internet, then nobody can. 

 The difficulties lie in the squelchy-soft market for internet advertising. Despite desperate efforts to develop alternate 

 revenue streams, Yahoo! depends on banners and other types of ads for some 80% of turnover. 

 It is the technology fall-out that has taken this swath out of Yahoo!'s main source of online advertising sales, as dot.coms have folded like peasants amid a plague. 

 While Yahoo! is trying to entice old economy companies into spending more on the web, many established businesses are wary, particularly amid the 

 economic slow-down in the US. 

 US analysts unanimously declared yesterday that all of Yahoo!'s competitors would be feeling the same squeeze. Like Yahoo!, they also depend upon advertising for the majority of their revenues. 

 AOL's internet service now boasts a world-wide membership of 28 million people, but with an estimated 96% of all internet advertising space going unsold, it still seems certain to suffer. 

 Industry observers will keep a keen eye on the severity of any impact, as AOL has one of the longest-running records for 

 profitability in this industry. Its year-end accounts first went into the black in 1992. 

 Online technology news provider CNET, another of the most prosperous, cut its first-quarter revenue estimates to between $75m and $80m, 

 compared to $86m to $92m previously. Losses for the quarter will be between $5m and $12m. 

 Germany's T-Online saw 1999 profits of some #11m slide into a loss of nearly #80m after the company made the financially disastrous decision to move into flat-rate access. 

 It is now expected to return to profitability, after saying last week that it would withdraw from flat-rate pricing. However, about half of T-Online's advertising revenues still come directly from parent company, Deutsche Telekom, which owns 82% of the business.

 Mar 09, 2001 (FWN Select via COMTEX) - TOP STORIES: 

 US stocks drop on open 

 New York, March 9 (BridgeNews) - U.S. stocks fell on the open, following February employment data that showed an unexpected surge in non-farm payroll jobs. Intel Corp. (INTC), a Dow component, fell 9% following a revenue warning late Thursday. Among S&P groups, retail led gainers while computer networking led on the downside. The Dow declined 97 to 10,761, and the Nasdaq fell 58 to 2111. ( Story .1300 ) 

 US Treasuries near unchanged on February jobs data 

 New York, March 9 (BridgeNews) - U.S. Treasuries were hovering near unchanged, after giving up earlier gains on stronger-than-expected February jobs data. The data left participants still expecting a 50-basis-point rate cut from the Fed at its meeting later this month, but diminished talk for more aggressive Fed easing. The 30-year bond was recently up 2/32, yielding 5.299%. ( Story .302 ) 

 Dollar gains slightly after strong jobs data 

 New York, March 9 (BridgeNews) - After selling off against the yen overnight, the dollar rallied slightly this morning following the February jobs data. The data doesn't change expectations that the Fed will ease interest rates at the March 20 FOMC meeting, but nothing more than a 50-bp cut is expected. In early trade, the dollar was trading at 119.47 yen. ( Story .901 ) 

 Europe stocks slump after Intel profit warning

 London, March 9 (BridgeNews) - Major equity markets in Europe continued to slide around Europe's midday, after a profit warning from Intel Corp. compounded the negative effect of Yahoo!'s earlier warning on technology shares. Unexpectedly weak U.K. manufacturing figures didn't help either. Early in Europe's afternoon, FTSE Eurotop 100 Index was down 20.19 points, or 0.62%, at 3247.46. ( Story .1165 ) 

 Short-dated German government bonds struggle 

 London, March 9 (BridgeNews) - Surprisingly strong German industrial production numbers caused short-dated German government bonds, or Bunds, to underperform, while the longer-dated bonds made ducent gains. However, the UK government bond, or Gilt, market saw the opposite trend, with the short end benefiting from weak U.K. manufacturing data. The 30-year Bund yield was recently yielding 5.24%, while the yield on 2-year paper was flat at 4.37%. ( Story .337 ) 

 OF INTEREST: 

 Japan bonds dive at the close 

 Tokyo, March 9 (BridgeNews) - June 10-year yen bond futures fell sharply in the last minutes of trade. The slide was accelerated by the stock market's late afternoon lift, traders said. June futures closed at 138.82 yen, down 0.43. ( Story .100 ) 

 Japan stocks end down 0.2% 

 Tokyo, March 9 (BridgeNews) - The Nikkei ended lower in dull trade, with high-technology and Internet stocks pressured by worries over earnings following a profit warning from Intel Corp. overnight. Meanwhile, gains in export-oriented shares and domestic demand-related issues limited the market's slide. The Nikkei fell 22.66 points, or 0.2%, to 12,627.90. ( Story .1105 )

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- It was one heck of coincidence Friday morning when at least five analysts cut their estimates on mobile handset maker Motorola Inc. (MOT) - especially considering that neither the company nor any of its competitors issued news warranting such action. 

 In fact, the earnings and revenue revisions only came after company representatives recently made a series of calls to analysts whose estimates were not in line with the company's previous guidance, several analysts told Dow Jones Newswires. 

 "They wanted to be sure that what we had was not out of whack with the numbers they had (previously) given," said one analyst, who asked not to be named. "Given that their guidance was somewhat vague, there was a wide disparity of opinions." 

 Because the company only reiterated guidance - which amounted to pointedly rereading the February first quarter profit-warning statement in phone calls to analysts - no analysts contacted by Dow Jones Newswires believed the company had violated fair disclosure regulations. 

 Regulation FD, for Fair Disclosure, was adopted last summer by the SEC as part of an effort to level the playing field for all investors. Under the much debated rule, which went into effect on Oct. 23, companies can't disclose material non-public information to select audiences, such as fund managers or analysts. The SEC wasn't immediately available for comment about the Motorola situation. 

 Analysts said it was obvious the company was concerned about those who had projected the company would breakeven in the first quarter or  post a loss of less than five cents a share. 

 On Thursday, Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Tim Long lowered his first quarter and 2001 earnings estimates, citing discussions with management and  checks throughout the industry. 

 On Friday, analysts with ABN-AMRO and UBS Warburg also lowered their estimates on the company, while Merrill Lynch lowered estimates and its long-term rating on the stock to accumulate from buy. 

 Several analysts told Dow Jones that representatives with Motorola's investor relations recently contacted them and reiterated the guidance the company gave Feb. 23. 

 Motorola officials would not comment on whether they had specifically called analysts, but did say investor relations representatives routinely talk to analysts. 

 "We have not issued any new information since the release we put out Feb. 23," said Motorola spokesman George Grimsrud. "Normally, our investor relations people do talk with analysts." 

 In February, Motorola announced that it would miss its earlier guidance of  12 cents a share in earnings on revenue of $8.8 billion in the first quarter. At the time, the company said it would likely report its first quarterly loss in 16 years as sales of semiconductors and mobile phones slumped. 

 Given the wide disparity in revised analysts' estimates issued Friday, it is clear company officials were not any more specific in the calls than they were in February. For instance, ABN-AMRO now estimates Motorola will lose 5 cents a share in the first quarter and report full-year earnings per share of 22 cents, which is 23 cents below their prior estimate. Credit Suisse First Boston expects Motorola will lose 7 cents a share in the first quarter and earn 11 cents for the full year, down from 20 cents a share. 

 Ed Snyder, telecommunications equipment analyst with J.P. Morgan, said the disparity in estimates shows the uncertainty surrounding the company's February earnings and revenue guidance. 

 "The company gave such general guidance that it leaves a very big window," he said. "The natural consequence is that there is a big spread initially, and eventually we coalesce around one number. But it takes a while." 

 Snyder, who expects Motorola to lose 6 cents a share in the first quarter on revenue of $7.7 billion, has not lowered his estimates since the company's warning. He expects the company to earn 11 cents a share on revenue of $36.4 billion for full-year 2001. 

 "(Analysts) got all these follow-up calls because all of them didn't get the original message," he said. 

 However, analysts said it was obvious the company was concerned about those who had projected the company would breakeven in the first quarter or  post a loss of less than five cents a share. 

 Snyder said very little has changed in the wireless market since Motorola warned two weeks ago. 

 He does believe the company has less visibility than handset market leader Nokia Corp. (NOK) and is likely losing market share to the company. The lack of visibility, Snyder said, would explain the vague nature of Motorola's guidance. 

 Meanwhile, even though trading in shares of Motorola was heavy relative to its peers, the company's stock price had weathered the earnings and revenue revisions quite well. 

 Motorola recently traded down 1.7%, or 26 cents, to $15.98 with volume at 10.5 million compared to the daily average of 14.8 million. The stock hit a 52-week low of $14.88 earlier this month. 

 How companies handle readjusting analysts' estimates if they are off the mark is one of the troublesome issues that Regulation, FD raises, and one with no bright line answer. The agency has made it clear that privately spooning earnings guidance to analysts is forbidden. Whether a situation would draw scrutiny from SEC enforcers is likely to depend on the specific context and how far the company goes in bringing outlying analysts in line, securities lawyers say. 

 Before FD went into effect, many companies routinely called analysts to update earnings trends and other matters. 

 A lawyer who helps companies keep out of harm's way in their corporate disclosures said that he raised a similar-sounding hypothetical with SEC staff at a recent conference. They indicated that such communications may be a problem if corporate executives are calling analysts and guiding them higher or lower through "code," said Stanley Keller, an attorney at Palmer and Dodge, a Boston law firm. 

 "That's the issue, is it code or is it what I'll call 'permissible repeating about what's already out there?' It gets into never-never land" he said. 

 On one hand, the Motorola scenario sounds "okay," because the information is already out there, he said. To stay on the safe side, however, he would advise a client that "it may be getting too close to the line of being code." 

 Back in November after the rule debuted, the SEC's head of enforcement, Richard Walker, made clear that non-verbal communication between companies and analysts wouldn't pass muster with the agency, noting language in the FD release that said selective disclosure of earnings information can't come in the form of "indirect guidance, the meaning of which is apparent though implied." 


"Providing a wink or nod, or a coded response calculated to convey
indirectly information that cannot be disclosed directly is no different
- and no more or less legal - than telling an analyst point-blank, 'our
earnings will be down 10% this quarter," Walker warned at the time.

 NEW YORK -- Stock prices are in a broad-based retreat on Wall Street. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average is down 195.70 at 10662.55. Decliners on the New York Stock Exchange hold a nearly three-to-one lead over advancers. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index has lost 98.85 at 2069.88. 

 And the Standard-and Poor's 500 Stock Index is down 29.26 at 1235.48. 

 Trading on the New York Stock Exchange during the first two hours totaled 420 (m) million shares. 

 Volume on the Nasdaq Market came to 750 (m) million shares. 

 Investors are selling off technology stocks following yesterday's profit warning from Intel. 

 Today's declines are effectively erasing much of the advance made by the market during gains earlier this week. 

 The market has also been hurt by the Labor Department's report that the economy created more jobs than anticipated last month. 

 The data might take some of the pressure off the Federal Reserve to aggressively cut interest rates this year. 

 But some worry that could lengthen the period for the economy to return to a satisfactory rate of growth.

 REPEAT-Nokia sales slowdown would signal telecom trouble.

 CHICAGO, March 7 (Reuters) - Rumors of a possible profit warning by Nokia , the world's largest cell-phone maker - if true - would signal a dismal year for the entire telecommunications industry, analysts and portfolio managers said Wednesday. 

 While the Finnish company declined to address rumors it might revise its profit forecasts down further - following similar moves recently by other technology giants including No. 2 cell phone maker Motorola Inc. - just the possibility raised concern things could get worse in the already battered telecommunications sector. 

 "Of course, things can get worse," said Alan Loewenstein, portfolio co-manager of the John Hancock Technology Fund. "This is more of a lackluster year. 

 "Everybody's going to bring down their (profit) targets, whether it's Procter & Gamble or Kodak or McDonald's or any technology company," he added. 

 Any slowdown at Nokia would follow what rivals at Motorola, Sweden's Ericsson or Korea's Samsung Electronics as well as electronics maker and Nokia supplier Texas Instruments Inc. , have reported. 

 Shares in Nokia edged down 0.2 percent, or 5 cents, to $25.45 in early-afternoon trading, but over the past year have outperformed Motorola by about 59 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. In Europe, Nokia bounced back on Wednesday to close off 2.8 percent after initially declining about 7 percent. 

 Despite fears of a slowdown at Nokia, U.S. stock markets rose on Wednesday after Goldman Sachs Chief Investment Strategist Abby Joseph Cohen told clients to raise their weightings in stocks. 

 LEHMAN CUTS NOKIA RATING 

 Lehman Brothers on Wednesday cut its rating on Nokia to market perform from buy, pointing to recent comments by Samsung that Nokia was aggressively cutting cell-phone prices and that industry inventories were higher than expected. 

 Lehman also said Texas Instruments cited slackening industry cell-phone sales for the first quarter. Lehman lowered its share price target for Nokia and cut its earnings per share forecast for 2001 and 2002. 

 However, Wit SoundView analyst Matthew Hoffman said Nokia began cutting prices on its cell phones, or handsets, in January and has reduced its inventories as a result. 

 A profit warning by Nokia, which analysts and portfolio managers wouldn't rule out, would reflect the telecom industry's continued weakness. 

 "Nokia could give a profit warning but we're now at the beginning of March so if one was coming it should have come by now," said analyst Petri Korpineva at Finland's largest brokerage Evli Securities, which has a buy rating on Nokia. 

 But he said Nokia may miss slightly its flat year-on-year per-share forecast for the first quarter. 

 Analysts and brokers said market conditions had worsened since Nokia last gave its guidance on Jan. 30 in connection with its fourth-quarter earnings report. 

 In January, Nokia forecast first-quarter sales growth of around 25 to 35 percent, and the same level for the full year, both with continued high profitability. About 70 percent of its sales come from handsets, with most of the rest from networks. 

 MOTOROLA ALREADY WARNED 

 Last month, Motorola warned a dramatic sales slowdown could lead to its first quarterly operating loss in 15 years. The Schaumburg, Ill.-based company had warned in January that first-quarter results would suffer from a slowdown in cell phone and semiconductor sales. Motorola officials weren't available to comment on Wednesday. 

 Ericsson, the world's No. 3 cell phone maker, also has said 2001 will be challenging. 

 "Things can always get worse," U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Samuel May said. "The outlook on handsets is still a little muddied." 

 The telecom industry isn't the only sector seeing slowing growth as other high-profile technology firms have been ratcheting down expectations recently. 

 Communications chip maker Broadcom Corp. on Tuesday revised its first-quarter outlook downward, citing the "sharp downturn" in the U.S. economy that has caused a slowdown in customer orders. 

 Fiber-optic powerhouse JDS Uniphase Corp. pointed to similar reasons on Tuesday after it lowered its third-and fourth-quarter forecasts. 

 Despite the possible warning, most analysts and brokers consider Nokia a good long-term buy despite probable short-term volatility. 

 "A company like Nokia is really positioning itself so well to dominate its industry," said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager with mutual fund company Dreyfus Corp. "We'll probably look back at these (price) levels a couple years from now and say they were bargains."

 LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. shares edged higher in European trade on Thursday as investors shrugged off the latest batch of technology firm warnings and focused on recent positive comment from strategists. 

 Index futures pointed to a firmer opening on Wall Street. March Nasdaq contracts were up 29.5 points at 2,018.0 by 1155 GMT. March futures in the Standard & Poor's 500 index were trading up a modest 3.0 points at 1,268.4. 

 An upbeat recommendation from Abby Joseph Cohen, influential Goldman Sachs' chief investment strategist, offered support. She joined Merrill Lynch's David Bowers and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Jay Pelosky in advising clients to buy U.S. stocks. 

 "The outlook is cautiously optimistic, basically due to comments from the likes of Abby Cohen," one dealer said. 

 Financial bookmaker Cantor Index forecast that the Dow Jones industrial average would open up 20 points and predicted a 15-point rise for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite. 

 The main trading focus was on Yahoo! Inc. in the wake of a profit warning from the Internet media company. It said 2001 earnings would probably fall well below already reduced estimates, while longtime Chief Executive Tim Koogle would step down from that post. 

 Yahoo! was trading at $18-1/4 on the Instinet electronic brokerage system, down slightly from its after-hours trading levels and compared with about $21 before its shares were halted in New York for news pending. 

 On the data front, the big focus for the market will be Friday's key non-farm payrolls figures, which will be crucial in determining how much the Fed will cut interest rates at its next meeting on March 20. 

 "We are likely to see some consolidation, with the non-farm payrolls data a concern. If that is negative, it will reinforce the view that everything in the garden is not rosy," the dealer said. 

 Elsewhere in European trade, top computer chipmaker Intel Corp. climbed to $33-1/4, after rising $1-7/16 in the regular session to $32-15/16 despite saying it does not expect chip demand to recover quickly. 

 Leading network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. was trading at $24-3/8, compared with a close of $24. 

 On Wall Street, stocks rose for a third consecutive day on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 138 points or 1.3 percent to 10,729.6. The Nasdaq Composite added 19 points or 0.9 percent to 2,223.92. 

 Aside from Yahoo!, selective downward pressure was likely to be exerted on tech stocks after Tellabs Inc. and TIBCO Software Inc. ) warned the slowing economy and reduced spending on technology would hurt financial results. 

 The Labor Department releases first-time claims for jobless benefits for the week ended March 3 at 1330 GMT. Economists in a Reuters survey on average forecast a total of 359,000 new filings compared to 372,000 in the previous week.

 LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened in London on Thursday, with yields falling at the short end as market expectations solidified that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by half a point this month. 

 The Fed's Beige Book on Wednesday showed the economy grew at a "sluggish to modest pace" in the first months of 2001, helping to cement expectations the central bank will lower the cost of money on March 20 to stimulate the economy. 

 At 1143 GMT, the benchmark 10-year note was priced at 100-23 to yield 4.91 percent, compared with 100-24 in New York. Two-year notes were at 100-13 and yielding 4.41 percent, down 2.1 basis points from New York. 

 The long bond was at 100-26 and yielding 5.32 percent, compared with 100-30 in New York. 

 The June T-note future was up 2/32 at 105-28 and the T-bond future was up 1/32 at 105-15. 

 Yields fell to close to two-year lows set last week on Wednesday after the Beige Book was released. 

 "It's a reflection of what is expected from the Fed, even though the market is already discounting a lot," said Steve Barrow, strategist at Bear Stearns in London. 

 He added the Bank of England could surprise markets on Thursday and cut rates, helping short maturities rally globally especially after Australia and Canada's monetary policy easing earlier this week. 

 The Bank of England announces its decision at 1200 GMT, but the vast majority of economists polled by Reuters are not expecting a change in interest rates. 

 Analysts said with a lack of data on Thursday and following France Telecom's $16.4 billion bond offering, the market would be looking at stocks and wait for Friday's U.S. jobs report. 

 Charles Quigley, a bond salesman at Chase, said a profit warning from Yahoo! on Wednesday was a reminder that technology stocks would continue to struggle. 

 "The market looks pretty well supported.. the charts look good and it's probably worth continuing to buy dips." 

 After the tech-rich Nasdaq index closed 0.88 percent higher on Wednesday, the future was pointing to a positive open, up 26 points . 

 Thursday's only economic release will be weekly measure of first time claims for unemployment insurance, but those figures will be overshadowed by the employment report a day later which is expected to show a sharp slowing in job growth. 

 Fed Bank of Dallas President Robert McTeer said on Wednesday the rise in weekly jobless claims likely points to an uptick in the unemployment rate, which currently stands at 4.2 percent. 

 Fed officials making public comments on Thursday include Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William McDonough and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Michael Moskow. 

 T-notes were outperforming Bunds, with the 10-year yield spread narrowing two basis points to 25. The 10-year dollar swap sread stood at 90 basis points compared with 91-1/4 at the Chicago close.

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Shares of systems integrator TIBCO Software Inc. fell nearly 9 percent on Thursday, a day after the company warned first-quarter revenues and earnings would fall markedly short of Wall Street's expectations, prompting analysts to cut ratings and forecasts. 

 Most analysts said the shortfall was due to an overall technology spending slowdown in the United States, but they said TIBCO's business strategy and execution are good. 

 In Nasdaq trading, TIBCO stock slipped 31/32, or 8.91 percent, to $9-29/32, not far from its 52-week low of $9-1/2. It year high is $147. 

 TIBCO joined software giant Oracle Corp. and a host of other companies that have revised their outlook after recognizing a slowdown of information technology spending by U.S. companies would affect them. TIBCO, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is majority owned by Reuters Group Plc, the global news and information company. 

 After the close of the market's regular session on Wednesday, TIBCO said first-quarter revenues would fall well below estimates - between $80 million and $84 million, compared with the previously expected $97.4 million - and operating earnings break even. 

 SG Cowen analyst Rehan Syed lowered the rating on TIBCO to "neutral" from "buy". 

 First Union Securities analyst Jason Maynard cut TIBCO to a "market perform" rating and sees the company's first-quarter earnings per share to be about 2 cents. That's down from his previous estimate of 7 cents a share, which is also the consensus of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks research. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston analyst John Rizzuto maintained a "buy" rating on the stock, but revised revenue estimates for the year downward to $340 million from $455 million. 

 Goldman Sachs analyst Anne Meisner maintained a "market outperformer" rating, but lowered the fiscal 2001 revenue estimates to $350 million, down from the previous $430 million and cut her estimate for the company's fiscal-year 2001 earnings to 13 cents from 30 cents a share. 

 UBS Warburg analyst Jordan Klein also maintained the firm's "buy" rating, but cut fiscal first-quarter earnings per share estimates to 3 cents a share, down from the 7 cents a share. 

 "Although near-term uncertainty remains, we believe that TIBCO remains the leader in its space and that its valuation may be nearing a trough," Klein wrote in a research note to clients.

 UPDATE 2-National Semi profits lower, issues warning.

 (Adds analyst comments, updates stock price, byline, previous Santa Clara) 

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Diversified microchip maker National Semiconductor Corp. on Thursday posted sharply lower fiscal third-quarter earnings, and warned that its fourth-quarter profits would fall well short of forecasts amid a weak semiconductor market. 

 National Semiconductor said excluding one-time items its profit fell to $48.9 million, or 27 cents per share, for the quarter that ended Feb. 25, compared with a profit of $99.8 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. 

 Analysts were on average forecasting 20 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial estimates, an estimate that had already been trimmed following an earlier profit warning. 

 Revenues fell to $475.6 million from $548.9 million. 

 National Semiconductor, based in Santa Clara, Calif., joins virtually every other U.S.-based chipmaker in warning that a severe and rapid downturn in the chip industry, spurred by a weakening U.S. economy, would hurt profits through at least the first half of 2001. 

 "The outlook is not a surprise considering what's going on out there - most semiconductor companies have already preannounced," said Robertson Stephens analyst Tore Svanberg. "It's a given now that the first half of the year is going to be tough for semiconductor companies." 

 National Semiconductor stock bounced back 41 cents to close at $25.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier slipping as low as $23.80. The shares have plunged 70 percent from their record of $85.94 reached March 9, 2000. 

 EARLIER PROFIT WARNING

 On Feb. 1, National Semi said spending cutbacks by its customers would lead it to post third-quarter profits of 20 cents to 22 cents per share - well below the then-First Call consensus of 31 cents a share. 

 Including a pretax charge of $12.1 million, National Semi posted net income of $39.2 million, or 21 cents per share, in the latest quarter. That compared with net income of $327.8 million, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier, including net gains of $228 million. 

 For the fourth quarter, National Semi said it expected sales to decline by as much as 10 percent from the third quarter, and said gross margins might decline about 5 percentage points, due to lower factory utilization. National said its third-quarter gross margins were 49 percent. 

 This could result in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 3 cents to 5 cents a share, National Semi said. 

 Analysts have been expecting the company to post fourth-quarter earnings per share of 23 cents and sales of $490 million, according to First Call. 

 NAT SEMI ONE OF FIRST TO SEE A TURNAROUND? 

 "We will continue to focus on profitability and critical investments during this period of slower demand and inventory corrections in the wireless handset and PC markets," National Semi Chief Executive Brian Halla said in a statement. 

 "Although we saw bookings and turns orders improve in February, we are still maintaining a cautious outlook," Halla added. Turns orders are orders requested for delivery in the same quarter. 

 The company said third-quarter worldwide bookings fell 30 percent from the second quarter of fiscal 2001, and 38 percent from last year's third quarter. After three months of sequential declines through January, bookings grew in February, the company said. 

 Halla said that despite the forecast fourth-quarter sales decline, the company expected total fiscal year 2001 sales to marginally exceed last year's revenues of $2.1 billion. 

 "I think National Semi is one of the companies that sees a rebound first because they were one of the first to feel the inventory correction in October and November," Svanberg said. "We're not out of the woods yet but I'm encouraged to see certain areas of improvement because it really tells me that things are not getting worse."

 UPDATE 2-CNET cuts Q1 rev outlook, blames customer cutbacks.

 (New throughout, adds background, analysts' comments, updates stock prices. Adds byline.) 

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Online technology news provider CNET Networks Inc. on Thursday cut its first-quarter revenue outlook, blaming the expected shortfall on customers' spending cutbacks. 

 Analysts said CNET's warning, along with a gloomy outlook from Internet media company Yahoo! Inc., raised the prospect that battered dot-com stocks could crumple even further. 

 Internet shares are "going to demonstrate the axiom that you can go down 10 percent forever," said Arthur Newman, an analyst with ABN AMRO. 

 Joining a lengthening parade of technology companies that have warned about their results, CNET said in a statement that revenues for the quarter would be between $75 million and $80 million. Its previous forecast was $86 million to $92 million. 

 The San Francisco-based company said it expected a first-quarter loss of between $5 million and $12 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) terms. 

 Its previous estimate had been for EBITDA between nil and $5 million. 

 Extending losses, CNET shares were down $1-13/32, or 13 percent, to $9-5/32 amid a sell-off in the technology sector. The shares hit a 12-month low of $9 before firming, and are off a year's high of $75. 

 Many major technology companies have said in recent weeks that they would cut marketing and advertising budgets because of slower expected sales, Chairman and Chief Executive Shelby Bonnie said. 

 "We believe this spending slowdown is a short-term condition," he said. 

 CNET, the No. 7 global Internet network which ended 2000 with about $300 million in cash and cash equivalents, gets much of its revenues from advertising. Its Web sites include its flagship CNET.com, a provider of news on Internet technology and trends, and buyers guide CNET Computers.com. 

 CNET's revision came on the heels of a profit warning on Wednesday from Internet media company Yahoo Inc. Yahoo also said its longtime Chief Executive Jeff Koogle was stepping down, but would remain chairman. 

 Yahoo was down $4-1/8, or 20 percent, at $16-13/16. It hit a session low of $16-3/16, a level not seen since late 1998. The shares are well off a 52-week high of $205-5/8. 

 Analysts said the CNET warning was not a surprise because of the Yahoo! announcement and a slowing U.S. economy. They added that other Internet media or advertising companies could be coming out with similar warnings. 

 "I think people are trying to figure out if these first-quarter results are the bottom" for CNET, said Rob Martin, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey in Arlington, Va. 

 "The answer is, possibly no." 

 The Dow Jones Internet index .DJINET) fell 5 percent to 89.64 points, just off a 12-month low.

 TEL AVIV, March 8 (Reuters) - Israeli stocks fell in thin trading on Thursday as a decline in Nasdaq futures and fears over Palestinian suicide bombings during the Jewish holiday of Purim this weekend pressured the market, dealers said. 

 Blue-chips, particularly in companies listed in both Tel Aviv and New York and holding companies that own stakes in firms that trade in New York, led the market lower. 

 Activity was very light as Purim begins Thursday at sundown and some trading desks were thinly staffed. 

 But as Ariel Sharon took office as prime minister, dealers said some players recall that there had been a number of bombings in Israel on Purim in previous years. 

 "People are afraid of a terrorist bombing over the weekend," said a trader at the IBI brokerage. 

 Sharon took control of Israel on Thursday pledging peace with the Palestinians provided they renounce violence. 

 The market largely shrugged off the swearing in of a new government and held modest losses for most of the day. 

 Traders said the market would normally have followed gains in the Nasdaq, which ended 0.9 percent higher on Wednesday. But a profit warning from Internet media company Yahoo Inc after the market closed weighed a bit on Israeli stocks. 

 With less than two hours left in the day, Nasdaq futures reversed a 1.1 percent gain, and along with bombing fears, Tel Aviv shares dropped. 

 The blue-chip Tel Aviv 25 index ended 1.4 percent lower at 447.08 points, while the broader TA-100 index slipped 1.1 percent to 434.85 for its second straight decline. 

 Turnover was very low at 139 million shekels compared with the volume of 189.2 million shekels seen on Wednesday. 

 Israel's technology TelTech index slumped 1.4 percent. 

 Teva Pharmaceutical Industries shares fell 2.6 percent, while Matav Cable Systems Media also slid 2.6 percent to close arbitrage gaps with their Nasdaq-traded shares. 

 Among holding companies, Clal Industries dropped 4.4 percent, Israel Corp declined 3.3 percent and Koor Industries dipped 1.0 percent. 

 Defence contractor Elbit Systems was one the few gainers, rising 2.0 percent - on top of Wednesday's 4.0 percent rise - in the wake of solid fourth-quarter results from earlier in the week. 

 Meanwhile, the market was mostly unfazed by Silvan Shalom taking over as finance minister. 

 In his first comments on the economy, Shalom said he was confident the 2001 budget would be passed by the end of March, as required by law. But he noted he would seek to make minor changes in its composition after the budget's approval.

 UPDATE 2-CNET cuts Q1 rev outlook, blames customer cutbacks.

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Online technology news provider CNET Networks Inc. on Thursday cut its first-quarter revenue outlook, blaming the expected shortfall on customers' spending cutbacks. 

 Analysts said CNET's warning, along with a gloomy outlook from Internet media company Yahoo! Inc., raised the prospect that battered dot-com stocks could crumple even further. 

 Internet shares are "going to demonstrate the axiom that you can go down 10 percent forever," said Arthur Newman, an analyst with ABN AMRO. 

 Joining a lengthening parade of technology companies that have warned about their results, CNET said in a statement that revenues for the quarter would be between $75 million and $80 million. Its previous forecast was $86 million to $92 million. 

 The San Francisco-based company said it expected a first-quarter loss of between $5 million and $12 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) terms. 

 Its previous estimate had been for EBITDA between nil and $5 million. 

 Extending losses, CNET shares were down $1-13/32, or 13 percent, to $9-5/32 amid a sell-off in the technology sector. The shares hit a 12-month low of $9 before firming, and are off a year's high of $75. 

 Many major technology companies have said in recent weeks that they would cut marketing and advertising budgets because of slower expected sales, Chairman and Chief Executive Shelby Bonnie said. 

 "We believe this spending slowdown is a short-term condition," he said. 

 CNET, the No. 7 global Internet network which ended 2000 with about $300 million in cash and cash equivalents, gets much of its revenues from advertising. Its Web sites include its flagship CNET.com, a provider of news on Internet technology and trends, and buyers guide CNET Computers.com. 

 CNET's revision came on the heels of a profit warning on Wednesday from Internet media company Yahoo Inc. Yahoo also said its longtime Chief Executive Jeff Koogle was stepping down, but would remain chairman. 

 Yahoo was down $4-1/8, or 20 percent, at $16-13/16. It hit a session low of $16-3/16, a level not seen since late 1998. The shares are well off a 52-week high of $205-5/8. 

 Analysts said the CNET warning was not a surprise because of the Yahoo! announcement and a slowing U.S. economy. They added that other Internet media or advertising companies could be coming out with similar warnings. 

 "I think people are trying to figure out if these first-quarter results are the bottom" for CNET, said Rob Martin, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey in Arlington, Va. 

 "The answer is, possibly no." 

 The Dow Jones Internet index fell 5 percent to 89.64 points, just off a 12-month low.

 UPDATE 2-AnnTaylor issues  profit warning  as Feb. sales fall.

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Women's apparel retailer AnnTaylor Stores Inc. on Thursday said February same-store sales fell 6.1 percent, and warned that earnings for the first half of the year will fall short of expectations due to heavy discounting on its spring merchandise. 

 The New York-based operator of AnnTaylor and AnnTaylor Loft stores said it has been struggling with its product assortment for some time, noting that its spring merchandise was perhaps too "fashion-forward" for its target clientele. 

 "Getting through spring appears to me to be an issue of damage control," said Richard Jaffe, retail analyst with UBS PaineWebber. 

 "They recognized they have the wrong product in the stores (and) the issue has been addressed on the most senior levels," Jaffe said, referring to the departure of President and Chief Operating Officer Patricia DeRosa in January. 

 "But they can't change what's in the pipeline for the next several months," he added. "Now it's just managing through product that's perhaps too contemporary for its customer." 

 AnnTaylor is expected to report financial results for its fourth-quarter ended Feb. 3 after the market closes today. 

 As a result of these issues, AnnTaylor said it now expects earnings per share of 33 cents to 37 cents for its fiscal first quarter and 28 cents to 32 cents for the second quarter - well below the 44 cents and 40 cents, respectively, analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had on average been expecting. 

 The retailer also said same-store sales will decline in the low-single digits for the first half of the year. 

 Despite the shortfalls, however, shares of AnnTaylor rose 4 percent by midday, trading up $1.05 at $27.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's 52-week range is $18.25 to $44.88. 

 Shares have fallen 40 percent in the past six months. 

 But today's rise in stock price, as well as the rise of several other specialty retailers, could be a signal that investors are beginning to believe that the worst of retail is over and that things can only get better from here on out. 

 "I can't easily explain the behavior of the stock market day to day," Jaffe said. "Is it a rotation issue? Is it relief that things weren't worse in February?" 

 "The stocks have sold off in the past several days, so maybe now having seen them trade down people are seeing things weren't that bad and buying them back up a little bit here," Jaffe said. "It could be that simple." 

 Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour did say, however, that the company is more confident about its fall product assortment, and that he expects same-store sales growth for the season in the low to mid-single digits. 

 In addition, the company said it is comfortable with an earnings projection of $2.24 to $2.28 per share for its current fiscal year, well above the First Call estimate of $2.19. 

 UBS PaineWebber's Jaffe said in order to work through its merchandise issues the company must time promotions and markdowns carefully while at the same time maximizing its gross margins in what is already a tough retail climate. 

 "Between economic concerns, a skittish consumer and the wintry weather it's a challenging retail environment," Jaffe said. "AnnTaylor is compounding that issue with a challenging merchandise assortment." 

 Total sales for the four weeks ended March 3 rose 9.7 percent to $73.8 million from $67.2 million a year ago. Comparable sales fell 9.9 percent at AnnTaylor stores. 

 At AnnTaylor Loft, however, same-store sales were up 12.2 percent. 

 Along with the departure of DeRosa, the company is working through several significant management changes, saying it is actively recruiting presidential candidates for each of its AnnTaylor and AnnTaylor Loft divisions. 

 Earlier this week, it named Dan Mulhern as senior vice president of AnnTaylor Stores. Filling Mulhern's previous position as senior vice president of AnnTaylor Loft was Michele Patton, formerly of AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. Studio Stores. 

 Both Mulhern and Patton will report to Melissa LaBau, executive vice president of retail operations for the company. 

 AnnTaylor, which operates 478 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, said it plans to open two AnnTaylor stores and 10 AnnTaylor Loft stores and to expand or relocate four existing AnnTaylor stores in the first quarter.

 AFTER THE BELL-Intel drops, weighs on high-techs.

 NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Intel Corp. shares slumped in after-hours trading on Thursday after the world's No. 1 maker of computer chips warned of disappointing revenues and staff reductions in the sluggish economy. 

 "Obviously, it's going to set the stage for some early morning weakness tomorrow," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Co. "Semiconductor stocks are the lead sled dogs for the Nasdaq." 

 During Thursday's regular trading session, the technology-dominated Nasdaq Composite Index dropped after a profit warning from Internet media company Yahoo! Inc. spooked investors with further evidence the economic slowdown was hurting formerly fast-growing tech companies. 

 Intel added to the technology fears, dropping to $30-3/4 in extended hours from its regular Nasdaq close of $33-1/4. Its stock ranked as the most heavily traded on the Nasdaq in after-hours with more than 4.6 million shares changing hands. 

 The company said first-quarter revenue would fall about 25 percent below fourth-quarter levels as the economic slowdown dampened personal computer demand and spread to the networking, communications and server sectors. The company said it would reduce staff by about 5,000 people over the next 9 months. 

 "They're going to go down," said Robertson Stephens PC and chip analyst Dan Niles of chip stocks Friday. "You can try to ignore the bad news all you want. The bottom line is it's getting worse and there's no end in sight." 

 Other high-tech shares slipped in after-hours trading after Intel offered its disappointing outlook. Cisco Systems Inc. , the world's No. 1 maker of gear that powers the Internet, dipped to $22-5/16 from its close of $22-13/16 during the regular session. Business software maker Oracle Corp. fell to $17-5/16 after closing at $17-1/2. Software giant Microsoft Corp. fell to $58 after ending at $59-1/4 during the regular session. 

 "(Intel) is just indicative that most companies have not been able to get their arms around what this economic slowdown means to their companies," Barthel said. "As they find out they are going to continue to guide lower. We are probably in for this type of commentary for the next few months." 

 Intersil Holding Corp. , which makes products for wireless computer networks, fell to $18-9/16 in extended hours after closing at $19-3/4 on the Nasdaq. The company warned its revenue and earnings for the first quarter of 2001 will be lower than expected due to slowing demand across the semiconductor industry. 

 RF Micro Devices Inc. , a maker of radio frequency products, slipped to $11-5/8 in after-hours trading after closing at $13-3/8 on the Nasdaq during the regular session. The company said earnings and revenues would be lower-than-expected due in part to slowing demand in the wireless market. 

 But TranSwitch Corp. , which makes semiconductors used in high-speed communication networks, rose to $20-1/4 in after-hours trade from its close of $19-1/4. The company cut its first-quarter revenue and profit outlook due to increased weakness in the North American telecommunications systems market.

 Drug Maker Allergan Is Largest Publicly Traded Firm in Orange County, Calif.

 Broadcom Corp., an Irvine chip maker that symbolized Orange County's "New Economy" promise and ranked as the county's largest publicly traded company for more than two years, fell from its top spot Wednesday. 

 Chronic pessimism about tech shares in general -- and a Tuesday evening profit warning from Broadcom -- pushed the total value of its outstanding shares below that of Allergan Inc., an Irvine-based specialty drug maker. 

 The rise of Allergan and the decline of Broadcom in the local rankings reflect a wider phenomenon on Wall Street, where investors have been moving out of once high-flying tech stocks and into more old-fashioned issues, including health care, for some time now. 

 "You're seeing rotation," said Robert Williams, who runs the Irvine office of Edward Jones brokerage. "Pharmaceuticals and health care in general are getting a lot of attention. People are starting to focus on fundamentals, and what's more fundamental than demographics and the aging of the baby boomers?" 

 Allergan's rise also marks a return to prominence of Orange County's health-care sector, which has long been a key component of the local economy but found itself overshadowed in recent years by flashy tech start-ups. 

 "Biotechnology and medical appliances have always been a sizeable segment locally," said Anil Puri, who watches the local economy from California State University, Fullerton. "But now they're getting the recognition. Construction, tourism and high tech have been the three pillars of the economy. But within high tech, we have depth and diversity, as indicated by Allergan and others." 

 Broadcom, which was worth more than $50 billion during the headiest days of the tech bull market, ended Wednesday's session with a market value of $9.47 billion, its shares trading at a new 52-week low of $40.25. The losses allowed Allergan to slip into the No. 1 spot, with a market cap of $10.02 billion. 

 Given Broadcom's short but impressive operating history, it's probably premature to count the company out. Broadcom's stock price is volatile enough that it could edge Allergan out of No. 1 as soon as today. 

 Even so, it seems unlikely that Broadcom will be back at the dizzying heights it reached in August, when its shares fetched as much as $274.75, because the market's mood toward the sector has changed dramatically. 

 Stock prices that were acceptable this time last year are now out of the question, and some investors believe the sector has further to fall. 

 "I think on a broad base, technology is still expensive," said Kurt A. Stabel, chief investment officer at Street Asset Management in Corona del Mar. 

 The unwillingness of investors to bid technology shares back up to the dizzying levels they reached last spring could pose challenges for Broadcom, which has distinguished itself by compensating employees with relatively small base salaries -- but big grants of stock options. 

 It also could pose some questions for the local economy. Over the past few years, Broadcom's employees have not only kept local luxury homebuilders and car dealers happy, they've become major benefactors for local charities. The company's co-founder, Henry Samueli, has given tens of millions of dollars to a host of organizations ranging from the University of California, Irvine, to Opera Pacific to the Ocean Institute. 

 But Puri said he doubts Broadcom's woes will have much of a lasting effect on the county's economy. 

 "It won't lead to anything other than a temporary slowdown in high-end product sales in the county," Puri said. "There may be some negative impacts, but Broadcom is in a business that's going to grow over time. They're in the right business. They're an innovative company. They're well-managed. They are going to do well." 

 Henry Nicholas, Broadcom's president and chief executive, told investors at a stock conference in Laguna Niguel on Tuesday night that even with the deflating effect of market declines on employee stock options, the company has seen "less than 1 percent total (employee) turnover since its inception." 

 Broadcom spokesman Bill Blanning said Wednesday that the company continues to review its compensation policies. "Are we concerned by current circumstances?" he said. "Yes. But we're confident that the combination of Broadcom's compelling work environment and future equity growth will allow us to keep our retention rate high." 

 Local Broadcom investors like Susan Mathews of Aliso Viejo continued to express confidence in the company. "I just don't see them going anywhere but up." 

 But Mathews said her patience may not be shared by all the company's employees. 

 "Obviously, if they have a major brain drain, they're going to have to rethink their compensation package."

 Intel Lowers 1Q Outlook

 SANTA CLARA, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Intel Corp. (INTC) lowered guidance for its first quarter and said it will reduce headcount by about 5,000 people over the next nine months, primarily through attrition. 

 In a press release Thursday, Intel said first quarter revenue will be down about 25% from fourth quarter revenue of $8.7 billion. 

 The company had previously said that first quarter revenue would be down 15%. 

 A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 21 analysts produced a first quarter earnings estimate of 21 cents, with revenue predicted to be about $7.4 billion. 

 Intel trails a long line of semiconductor companies that are providing grim financial forecasts and implementing cost reduction plans. Several makers posted profit warnings today, which followed an onslaught of competitors warning about trouble in the PC industry on Tuesday. 

 Intel was joined by ON Semiconductor Corp. (ONNN), Transwitch Corp. (TXCC), RF Micro Devices Inc. (RFMD), Actel Corp. and Intersil Holding Corp. (ISIL), which lowered their expectations or cited an industry slowdown for their expected lackluster financial performances. 

 Intel blames its lowered guidance on the economic slowdown in the personal computer demand, which infiltrated the networking, communications and server sectors. 

 On Monday, the company cut the prices on some of its processors by as much as 19%. Intel last cut its prices in late January when it got more aggressive in pushing prices down to try to spur demand for personal computers. 

 Shares of Intel were recently quoted in after-hours trading on Island ECN at $30.69, below the regular session close of $33.25. 

 The lowered revenue estimates also dragged down Intel's gross margins projection to 51% for the first quarter. The company previously expected to post 58% gross margins for the period. 

 Intel plans to report costs of $465 million for amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles in the first quarter, which is about $10 million above previous estimates. Also, the semiconductor company expects first quarter gains of $180 million from investments and interest and other income, assuming no net gains from the sale of equity investments, 

 As expected, Intel will lower its first quarter expenses, which excludes in-process research and development. Expenses will drop by about 15%, compared with fourth quarter expenses of $2.4 billion. Previously, they were slated to remain flat sequentially. 

 The company earned $3.07 billion, or 88 cents a diluted share, excluding charges, on revenue of $8.02 billion, in the first quarter ended April 1, 2000. 

 For the first quater ended April 1, 2000, Intel earned 36 cents a share, adjusted to reflect the company's May two-for-one stock split. 

 The latest planned head-count reductions will reduce Intel's 80,000 employee workforce by 6%. In late February, the company said it will defer raises for senior managers until at least October, and all other employees will get only half of their scheduled raises in April. The other half will be reviewed in October. 

 The reduced staffing followed announcements last month that Intel planned to stop new construction of office buildings and to cut back on hiring. 

 Looking at 2001, Intel expects to report costs of $1.9 billion from goodwill amortization. The company plans to spend $4.2 billion in research and development for the year, which is lower than previous estimates of $4.3 billion. 

 For that period, capital spending will reach $7.5 billion. 

 Tax rates are projected at 30.3% for 2001, excluding acquisition-related costs. 

 A First Call/Thomson Financial survey of 21 analysts produced 2001 mean earnings estimate of $1.02 a share, on revenue of $33.94 billion for the company.

 Jury Convicts Day Trader Who Posted Phony Lucent Release

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal jury convicted a Houston day trader on one count of securities fraud for posting a fake profit warning on the Internet that was designed to resemble a press release from Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU). 

 Fred Moldofsky, 44 years old, was arrested by federal authorities last March after the fake press release sent Lucent's shares tumbling by as much as 3.6% the day after the posting. 

 Moldofsky had no reaction as the verdict was announced in Manhattan federal court. Defense attorney Cecelia Wang told jurors during the trial that her client posted the release merely to take part in a fierce message board debate over the company's prospects. 

 The release, which warned of an earnings shortfall but included the words "this is a joke,' wasn't meant to be taken as actual news issued by the company, his attorney had argued. 

 The government forwarded its case by putting witnesses on the stand who testified that they had lost money by selling their Lucent shares on what they thought was bad news. 

 Prosecutor Steven R. Peikin told the court during opening statements that Moldofsky had "something much more devious and cynical in mind" than a prank when he posted the release from a computer in his apartment. 

 Moldofsky, who traded about 6,000 shares of Lucent the day after the posting, didn't make any money off the alleged fraud, his attorney said in court. She noted that Moldofsky hadn't shorted Lucent's shares or bought put options, two methods he could have used to make money off a decline in Lucent's stock. 

 Moldofsky faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of at least $1 million. He is scheduled to be sentenced June 11 in front of U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson. He also faces pending civil charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 The jury of five women and seven men deliberated for less than four hours before handing down the guilty verdict. 

 Jury forewoman Carolyn Stoller said the jurors struggled a bit over the issue of whether Moldofsky posted the release with the intent to defraud - a key provision of the securities fraud charge. "It wasn't that easy," she said. "It wasn't that clear cut." 

 Another juror, Aliesha Corthell, said the jury wasn't hung up by the fact that Moldofsky hadn't apparently profited from the fraud. "We made the decision based on the action itself, not the cause," she said.

 Tellabs Is Last Domino In Telecom Equip Sector To Fall 

 By Johnathan Burns

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Telecommunications equipment maker Tellabs Inc. (TLAB) was the last domino to fall in the fiber optic market, following the company's warning late Wednesday that first quarter and full-year earnings and sales won't meet expectations. 

 The company's outlook revision wasn't unexpected, following warnings by familiar names like Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) and JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU). 

 Some on Wall Street now say that further reductions in communications companies' spending are likely, and there is little sign the overall economy will rebound in the second half of the year. 

 "I think it's going to be a tough market," said ING Barings telecommunications equipment analyst Tom Lauria. "I think a lot of the assumptions we have about a rebounding economy are based on conditions that there is yet no evidence of." 

 A study of the spending plans of 33 North American service providers released Thursday by Lauria and telecommunications services analyst Greg Miller shows the companies plan to spend $2.6 billion less this year than last on capital projects, a decline of 2.5%. The surveyed companies, which include the biggest names in telecommunications, plan to spend a combined $103.8 billion, down from last year's $106.4 billion. 

 Lauria and Miller believe those spending plans will likely be reduced further as the year progresses. 

 "The year could end up with spending down as much as 5% or 10% below last year's spending," Lauria said. "There are a lot of (start-up) carriers that are not well-funded, and I think gaining funding (to finance network construction) is going to prove difficult." 

 The ING Barings survey is consistent with a recent study by BlueStone Capital Securities Inc., which estimates U.S. phone companies will spend $113.6 billion on capital projects this year, down 9% from $124.6 billion last year. 

 Both surveys show how far spending expectations have fallen since October of last year, when some studies estimated carrier spending would increase 21% in 2001. 

 The equipment makers seemingly have little confidence in, or ability to forecast, what the second half of the year will look like. 

 In its second profit warning for the ongoing quarter, JDS Uniphase cited  "continued uncertainty" about carrier spending plans and less visibility concerning its own prospects. 

 JDS Uniphase's warning followed customer Nortel Networks' warning in mid-February, when the world's largest telecommunications equipment supplier trimmed 2001 revenue estimates by $2 billion. Component maker and optical fiber manufacturer Corning Inc. (GLW) subsequently lowered its guidance, followed by a rash of others. 

 Ciena Corp. (CIEN) and ONI Systems Corp. (ONIS) are the only big-name fiber optic companies to raise guidance this year. 

 Tellabs had been the last of the systems makers not to revise guidance. 

 Tellabs Inc. (TLAB) didn't lower guidance for 2002 when it lowered guidance for the first quarter and full year 2001 after market close Wednesday. The company did say goodwill related to the acquisition of Future Networks Inc. would dilute earnings by 5 cents a share in 2002. Excluding goodwill, the acquisition will add to earnings in 2002. 

 The shortfall is partially the result of longer-than-expected rollout of its TITAN 6500 product and lower-than-expected orders for its cable-telephony Cablespan product. 

 CIBC World Markets telecommunications equipment analyst Jim Jungjohann reiterated his buy rating on Tellabs, noting that company management believes the fundamentals of the company remain on track. 

 Overall enthusiasm about fiber optic companies is probably at its lowest point in a year - an understatement, perhaps, given that many of the optical stocks are trading near 52-week lows. 

 Following JDS Uniphase's most recent warning, Deutsche Banc Alex Brown telecommunications equipment analyst Raj Srikanth, an early proponent of fiber optic companies, advised investors considering JDS Uniphase to "stay on the sidelines" until visibility improves. 

 That may take some time. 

 Lauria believes there are few near-term catalysts. 

 He said if the financial markets stabilized and began funding start-up phone companies' spending again, the sector could turn around. 

 "But we're not seeing that," he said.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Henry Blodget reduced his forecast of overall Internet advertising spending for 2001 in the wake of Yahoo Inc.'s (YHOO) first-quarter profit warning Wednesday. 

 During his firm's Internet conference here Thursday, Blodget also said that about 95% of Web stocks would disappear either through business failures or consolidation. For at least a year he had predicted that 75% of Internet stocks would vanish. 

 "That was clearly too optimistic," Blodget said. 

 Blodget predicted that online ad spending in 2001 would fall 15% to 30% from an estimated $8 billion spent in 2000. Previously, he forecast online ad spending this year would be flat with 2000. 

 On Wednesday, Yahoo said its first-quarter earnings and revenue would miss analysts' expectations, and it backed off its previous estimates for full-year 2001, saying it can no longer predict how the second half of the year will shape up. The company cited the slowing U.S. economy and cutbacks in online ad spending. 

 Blodget thinks it will take another two to three quarters before the Web advertising market begins to improve. He is still optimistic about the long-term potential of the Internet as an advertising medium. 

 In his presentation to Merrill clients, Blodget poked fun at himself, an acknowledgment that his previous bullishness helped inflate the Internet bubble that has burst so badly. He displayed what appeared to be a stock price chart with a high peak followed by a steep decline. While confirming the chart tracked Yahoo's stock, he added that it also represented the relevance of Internet analysts over the past year. He concluded, in jest, "I'm taking this opportunity to announce that I'm Merrill's new rural hospital analyst."

 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Shares of Yahoo! Inc. fell more than 10 percent in after-hours trade on Wednesday after the Internet media company issued a profit warning, while other tech issues also suffered from similar bleak outlooks. 

 During Wednesday's regular session, stocks rose for the third straight day after top strategist Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs urged investors to put cash into equities after weeks of declines and persistent fears over a soft economy. 

 But a fresh batch of earnings warnings after the bell showed the slowing U.S. economy is hurting tech companies. Yahoo!, Tellabs Inc. and TIBCO Software Inc. ) warned the slowing economy and reduced spending on technology would hurt financial results. Their shares fell in the aftermarket. 

 Semiconductor maker Cree Inc. was another stock that was hit hard after-hours, after it reaffirmed its third-quarter earnings guidance. But Cree Inc. warned that fourth quarter revenues would fall below third-quarter sales, due to a slowing market for light-emitting diodes. 

 Yahoo! was among the most heavily traded stocks after-hours and was last at $18-9/16, down from the regular session, when it was at about $21 before its shares were halted for news pending. About 2.5 million Yahoo shares traded after-hours by 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT). The stock fell below $18 early in the aftermarket session. 

 After the close, Yahoo! warned that first-quarter revenues and earnings would lag Wall Street estimates, due to lower advertising spending amid economic uncertainty. 

 Yahoo! also said Chief Executive Tim Koogle will step down from that position, but will remain as chairman. The company said it is looking for a new CEO to succeed Koogle. 

 Cree shares fell to $19-7/8, off sharply from their close at $25-7/16 on Nasdaq. Cree projected that fourth-quarter revenues would fall 10 percent to 15 percent from the previous quarter and that earnings for the fourth quarter also would lag estimates. 

 The shares of TIBCO, the software maker, slipped to $10-1/16 on the Instinet electronic platform from a regular close at $10-7/8 following the company's announcement after the closing bell that it expected slower revenue growth, due to the flagging economy. During regular trade, Tibco rose 1/4 from Tuesday's close. 

 Based in Palo Alto, Calif., TIBCO is majority owned by Reuters Group Plc , the global news and information company. TIBCO said its first-quarter revenues could be as much as 18 percent below analysts' estimates, citing a slowdown in corporate spending on technology. 

 TIBCO was among the most actively traded issues in the aftermarket, with more than 676,000 shares changing hands by 6:00 p.m. Shares of Reuters listed in the United States were not traded after hours, as of 6:15 p.m. EST; they closed at $93-15/32, or down $1-1/32, in regular trade. 

 The shares of Tellabs also slid, down to $40-3/32 from their Nasdaq close at $45-11/16, after the maker of communications network systems cut its quarterly earnings and sales growth forecast. 

 Top-tier technology shares were mixed after-hours. 

 Showing slight gains were the shares of fiber-optics firm JDS Uniphase and Intel Corp. , the top computer chip maker, and Applied Micro Circuits , another chip maker. 

 But the stocks of other marque tech names declined, including Internet gear giant Cisco Systems Inc. , network computing giant Sun Microsystems , and software titans Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. . 

 In the regular session, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 138.38 points, or 1.31 percent, to 10,729.60, marking the blue-chip index's fourth straight rising session. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index advanced 8.09 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,261.89, the first time it rose for three straight sessions since mid-January. 

 The tech-laced Nasdaq Composite Index added 19.49 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,223.92, but closed well off an early rise of almost 2 percent. It was also Nasdaq's third positive close in a row.

 Nokia sales slowdown would signal telecom trouble.

 CHICAGO, March 7 (Reuters) - Rumors of a possible profit warning by Nokia, the world's largest cell-phone maker - if true - would signal a dismal year for the entire telecommunications industry, analysts and portfolio managers said Wednesday. 

 While the Finnish company declined to address rumors it might revise its profit forecasts down further - following similar moves recently by other technology giants including No. 2 cell phone maker Motorola Inc. - just the possibility raised concern things could get worse in the already battered telecommunications sector. 

 "Of course, things can get worse," said Alan Loewenstein, portfolio co-manager of the John Hancock Technology Fund. "This is more of a lackluster year. 

 "Everybody's going to bring down their (profit) targets, whether it's Procter & Gamble or Kodak or McDonald's or any technology company," he added. 

 Any slowdown at Nokia would follow what rivals at Motorola, Sweden's Ericsson or Korea's Samsung Electronics as well as electronics maker and Nokia supplier Texas Instruments Inc., have reported. 

 Shares in Nokia edged down 0.2 percent, or 5 cents, to $25.45 in early-afternoon trading, but over the past year have outperformed Motorola by about 59 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. In Europe, Nokia bounced back on Wednesday to close off 2.8 percent after initially declining about 7 percent. 

 Despite fears of a slowdown at Nokia, U.S. stock markets rose on Wednesday after Goldman Sachs Chief Investment Strategist Abby Joseph Cohen told clients to raise their weightings in stocks. 

 LEHMAN CUTS NOKIA RATING 

 Lehman Brothers on Wednesday cut its rating on Nokia to market perform from buy, pointing to recent comments by Samsung that Nokia was aggressively cutting cell-phone prices and that industry inventories were higher than expected. 

 Lehman also said Texas Instruments cited slackening industry cell-phone sales for the first quarter. Lehman lowered its share price target for Nokia and cut its earnings per share forecast for 2001 and 2002. 

 However, Wit SoundView analyst Matthew Hoffman said Nokia began cutting prices on its cell phones, or handsets, in January and has reduced its inventories as a result. 

 A profit warning by Nokia, which analysts and portfolio managers wouldn't rule out, would reflect the telecom industry's continued weakness. 

 "Nokia could give a profit warning but we're now at the beginning of March so if one was coming it should have come by now," said analyst Petri Korpineva at Finland's largest brokerage Evli Securities, which has a buy rating on Nokia. 

 But he said Nokia may miss slightly its flat year-on-year per-share forecast for the first quarter. 

 Analysts and brokers said market conditions had worsened since Nokia last gave its guidance on Jan. 30 in connection with its fourth-quarter earnings report. 

 In January, Nokia forecast first-quarter sales growth of around 25 to 35 percent, and the same level for the full year, both with continued high profitability. About 70 percent of its sales come from handsets, with most of the rest from networks. 

 MOTOROLA ALREADY WARNED 

 Last month, Motorola warned a dramatic sales slowdown could lead to its first quarterly operating loss in 15 years. The Schaumburg, Ill.-based company had warned in January that first-quarter results would suffer from a slowdown in cell phone and semiconductor sales. Motorola officials weren't available to comment on Wednesday. 

 Ericsson, the world's No. 3 cell phone maker, also has said 2001 will be challenging. 

 "Things can always get worse," U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Samuel May said. "The outlook on handsets is still a little muddied." 

 The telecom industry isn't the only sector seeing slowing growth as other high-profile technology firms have been ratcheting down expectations recently. 

 Communications chip maker Broadcom Corp. on Tuesday revised its first-quarter outlook downward, citing the "sharp downturn" in the U.S. economy that has caused a slowdown in customer orders. 

 Fiber-optic powerhouse JDS Uniphase Corp. pointed to similar reasons on Tuesday after it lowered its third-and fourth-quarter forecasts. 

 Despite the possible warning, most analysts and brokers consider Nokia a good long-term buy despite probable short-term volatility. 

 "A company like Nokia is really positioning itself so well to dominate its industry," said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager with mutual fund company Dreyfus Corp. "We'll probably look back at these (price) levels a couple years from now and say they were bargains."

 U.S. stocks set for flat to slightly higher open.

 NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Stocks are expected to open flat to slightly higher on Wednesday as Intel Corp., the world's No. 1 computer chip maker, and JDS Uniphase Corp., the world's No. 1 fiber-optic parts supplier, tempered Wall Street's enthusiasm after a two-day market rally. 

 "Expectations are really at a lower level - we continue to get bad news, but the market is not selling off on it," said Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. 

 Intel Chairman Andrew Grove said after the closing bell that he does not expect demand for semiconductors to recover quickly, while JDS cut its quarterly forecasts again and blamed a soft U.S. economy and waning customer demand. 

 Investors will tune in to a live video presentation by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, but his speech on banking supervision to a conference in Las Vegas is unlikely to sway the markets. Greenspan said in Congressional testimony on Friday that he wanted to keep investors guessing on the timing of interest-rate moves. 

 With more than an hour to go before the opening bell, Nasdaq 100 index futures for March gained 17.5 points to 2,003, climbing out of negative territory and pointing to a rise of 0.8 percent in the Nasdaq's 100 biggest stocks at the open. Standard & Poor's 500 index futures nosed up 5.30 to 1,262.30. The Dow Jones Industrial futures gained 17 points to 10,630. 

 Adding to Wall Street's cautious mood, communications chip maker Broadcom Corp. cut its earnings and revenue outlook for the first quarter, hit by a slowdown in customer orders because of the sluggish economy. 

 Several computer-chip makers had warned about future results on Tuesday, but investors snapped up those shares in a bet the worst of the pain had been discounted. 

 "The one thing the market has been lacking is sustainability and follow-through," Piskorowski said. "For two days we have had a rally and the key today will be whether we can work our way through the bad news and find some traction." 

 European markets stumbled on Wednesday as telecom equipment giant Nokia sank amid rumors of a profit warning. The pan-European Eurotop index of 300 shares shed 0.41 percent, while the narrower Euro Stoxx index of 50 blue chip euro zone shares lost 0.46 percent. 

 On the data front, consumer credit data will be issued at 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) Consumer credit is seen rising to $6.5 billion from $3.0 billion in January. 

 The Federal Reserve will issue its latest Beige Book, a report based on anecdotal information from businesses and economists, at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). 

 Neither data sets are expected to be a catalyst for the market. 

 In other corporate news, Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. on Tuesday after the market closed said that it has cut more than 3 percent of its staff and will have a hard time meeting first-quarter earnings estimates because of the stock market slump. 

 Handheld computer maker Palm Inc. said Tuesday after the close it agreed to buy software company Extended Systems Inc. for about $264 million in stock, in a deal that could spur Palm sales in the corporate market. 

 Stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq market posting its strongest rally in six weeks, as investors ignored corporate earnings warnings and snapped up technology shares in the bet they have scraped bottom. 

 Investors are betting the Federal Reserve will once again come to the rescue of the U.S. economy - and the stock market - with another interest-rate cut at its next policy-setting meeting on March 20. The central bank has already slashed the cost of borrowing by 100 basis points in two moves in January. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 61.51 points, or 2.87 percent, at 2,204.43, after jumping more than 4 percent early in the session. The rally, Nasdaq's second up day in a row, gave the index its best advance since Jan. 23 when it closed up 2.99 percent. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average eked out a gain of 28.92 points, or 0.27 percent, to 10,591.22. A drop in defensive stocks as money flowed into the techs put a damper on the Dow's advance. 

 The broad Standard & Poor's 500 Index added 12.39 points, or 1.00 percent, to finish at 1,253.80.

 Dow Jones Issues  Profit Warning , Unveils Plan to Reduce Work Force

 NEW YORK -- Dow Jones & Co. said it will miss first-quarter earnings expectations, citing softer-than-expected advertising revenue at its flagship publication, The Wall Street Journal. 

 The company said Wednesday that it is taking "aggressive actions," including some reductions in personnel, to cut expenses. 

 Dow Jones (DJ) said it expects to post earnings of 16 cents to 20 cents a diluted share in the first quarter. Analysts were expecting earnings of 56 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The company said advertising linage at the Journal fell 32% on a per-issue basis in February after a 42% increase in the year-earlier quarter. Linage is expected to decline by a similar percentage in March, compared with last year's 36% gain. As a result, Dow Jones now expects Journal per-issue linage to fall 25% to 30% in the first quarter, compared with a 38% increase in the first quarter of 2000. 

 Dow Jones reported operating earnings, excluding a gain, of $79.2 million, or 88 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $579 million in the first quarter of 2000. 

 Dow Jones is taking "aggressive actions that will even better align our expense structure with the current operating environment, without inhibiting future growth," Richard F. Zannino, the company's newly hired executive vice president and chief financial officer, said in a written statement. "These actions will include deferring discretionary expenditures and achieving new operating efficiencies across all of our businesses. Unfortunately, they will also include some reductions in personnel. When these steps have been taken, however, Dow Jones will be exceptionally well positioned for resumed growth, building on our very strong franchises and brands," Mr. Zannino added. 

 Dow Jones also said it has established a reserve of $255 million, charged against earnings in the fourth quarter of 2000, in connection with its guarantee of payments owed by the Telerate subsidiary of Bridge Information Systems. 

 While payments, if any, under the guarantee would be made in cash, the reserve doesn't reflect the expenditure of cash. With this reserve, and preliminary results and other special items reported earlier, Dow Jones recorded a loss of $274.3 million, or $3.15 a share, in the fourth quarter of 2000, and a loss of $119 million, or $1.35 a share, for all of 2000. 

 Dow Jones has guaranteed, under certain circumstances, certain annual minimum payments for data that Telerate acquires from Cantor Fitzgerald Securities and Market Data Corp. under contracts entered into during the period when Telerate was owned by Dow Jones. The minimum payments average about $50 million a year through October 2006. 

 Separately, according to Dow Jones's 10-K annual report filed Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Market Data Corp. filed suit against Dow Jones on Feb. 20 seeking payment of $11.7 million plus interest, attorneys fees and costs. 

 Market Data, a financial markets information provider, claims it is owed the money as part of guaranteed minimum annual payments owed to the firm and Cantor Fitzgerald for data supplied to Telerate under contracts entered into when Telerate was part of Dow Jones. 

 The lawsuit, filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, claims the payment from Bridge was due on Feb. 15. The lawsuit says this payment wasn't made because Bridge has recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Missouri, according to the Dow Jones filing. Bridge has said in the past that it had agreed to indemnify if Dow Jones is required to make any payment under the guarantee. 

 A Dow Jones spokesman said the company had no comment beyond what was included in the filing. 

 Bridge has filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with a view to seeking a sale of its assets. Dow Jones said it isn't possible to determine the extent to which it may be required to make payments under the guarantee. 

 "Based on continuing economic uncertainty and related softness in advertising, particularly in the financial and technology sectors, operating results for the balance of 2001 are difficult to project at this point," Peter R. Kann, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 

 "After coming up against the extraordinary first half of last year, we would note that advertising comparisons will ease considerably in the third and fourth quarters, and we expect the percentage declines in linage to ease as well, and perhaps turn into modest gains in the latter part of this year," Mr. Kann said. 

 In an e-mail message sent to Dow Jones employees Wednesday morning, Mr. Kann said many of the staff cuts can be achieved by attrition and that the rest will constitute "a very small fraction" of the company's 8,550 employees. 

 Dow Jones's first-quarter outlook follows an announcement by New York Times Co. (NYT) on Monday that its first-quarter earnings would be about 22% below what Wall Street had expected, due to the slowing economy. 

 Since November, publishers have said the slowing economy -- in particular the collapse of dot-com and financial advertising -- has hurt operations more than anticipated. 

 In addition to The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones publishes the Journal's international and online editions and the Ottaway group of community newspapers, Barron's and SmartMoney magazines and other periodicals, and Dow Jones Indexes. Dow Jones is co-owner with Reuters Group of Factiva, with Excite At Home Corp. of Work.com and with NBC of the CNBC television operations in Asia and Europe. Dow Jones also provides news content to CNBC and radio stations in the U.S.

 Zurich Financial Will Shed 610 Jobs in Restructuring, After Difficult 2000

 ZURICH -- Zurich Financial Services AG said it will cut 610 jobs at it Zurich headquarters within the next two years. 

 Zurich Financial said Wednesday that 230 jobs will be eliminated and 380 will be transferred to other units inside and outside Switzerland, resulting in annual cost savings of around 200 million Swiss francs ($121.4 million or 129.8 million euros). 

 The group's headcount in Zurich, currently at 1,100, will drop by more than half. The group said compulsory layoffs, however, should be minimal. 

 Zurich Financial also said that Adriano Passardi, a member of the group management board responsible for Zurich's head office operations, will retire at the end of 2001. 

 The reduction in jobs at its headquarters comes after Zurich Financial in November unveiled a restructuring plan that created eight regional operations and shifted the company's focus to New Economy businesses. 

 The group also issued a profit warning last month, reporting that its earnings for all of 2000 would be hurt by a reinsurance-related extraordinary charge of $400 million. In September, the group reported an unexpected 24% decline in first-half net income after a substantial fall in realized capital gains from financial investments. 

 Zurich Financial -- which employs 68,000 people world-wide, 8,000 of whom are in Switzerland -- was the second Swiss insurer to say 2000 was a tough year, following Swiss Re. 

 Switzerland is one of the world's tightest labor markets, with an unemployment rate of only 2%. 

 Zurich Financial was formed in 1998 through the merger of Zurich Group and the financial services business of B.A.T Industries PLC.

 Yahoo! CEO Says Co. Will Weather Economic Slowdown

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Chief Financial Officer Susan Decker said Wednesday the company was "committed" to achieving break-even results for full-year 2001. 

 That would be far short of the Web portal's previous forecast of earning between 33 cents and 43 cents a share. But Decker and other executives stopped short of saying they were formally changing guidance for full-year 2001 results. They said visibility into results in the second half of 2001 was too limited to make predictions now. 

 The hint of a major profit shortfall for 2001 came as Yahoo definitively said it would earn less than expected in the first quarter ending March 31, citing the slowing U.S. economy and a weak online advertising market. Yahoo! expects to break even for the quarter, down from previous guidance of  between 4 cents and 7 cents a share. 

 Yahoo said it expects first-quarter revenue to be between  $170 million and $180 million, or 22% to 25% less than the range it had projected last month. 

 Yahoo also said Tim Koogle would resign as chief executive but would remain chairman. In addition, Yahoo announced a $500 million share repurchase program. 

 What seemed to catch analysts' attention was Decker's suggestion that full-year results would be break-even. "We do want to communicate the message we're committed to achieving break-even for the full year, whatever the top line  is," Decker said. 

 Earlier, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Safa Rashtchy  said Yahoo's profit shortfall warning was "pretty bad, it's  pretty serious.... It's worse than our worst-case scenario." 


   Koogle, Yahoo's chairman and chief executive, said the
"macro-economic climate has weakened substantially." He said Yahoo's
first-quarter profit shortfall stems mainly from  its marketing
services unit, which sells banner ads and other services to
advertisers.



But Koogle tried to put a somewhat positive spin on the bad news. He
said the company has strong assets, including about $2 billion in cash,
that would allow it to weather the economic slowdown.



Koogle shed some light on his decision to step aside as chief
executive when the company finds a replacement. "I'm looking over the
horizon," he said. "When the economy starts to firm, what do we need to
have in place to scale continuously over five to 10 years? It's a great
time to extend our team. It's one of those decisions that... good
management makes."



Decker, the chief financial officer, said "external conditions" have
weakened. Many Yahoo customers have "frozen" their commitments to
purchases as their funding has tightened, she said. These factors are
beyond Yahoo's control, she added.



Decker noted that deferred revenue at the start of each quarter
previously comprised about 45% of Yahoo's quarterly revenue. But
deferred revenue from Dec. 31 is expected to be equal to about 65% to
70% of revenue for the first quarter ending March 31, which means new
contracts fell sharply during the quarter. Deferred revenue represents
revenue committed to Yahoo by customers, but not yet collected.



Decker also said business services revenue would represent a higher
percentage of overall revenue in 2001 than  the company expected in
January. At that time, Yahoo said business service revenue would be 15%
to 20% of total revenue. Marketing-services revenue was to comprise the
rest.



Decker said Yahoo would continue to pursue investments and initiatives
to support long-term revenue growth, and that  Yahoo wouldn't
"overreact" to the current softness. She also Yahoo wouldn't reduce the
quality of its services.



President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Mallett said Yahoo's
business and enterprise services were on track to post year-over-year
revenue growth in double digits. The company's enterprise portal
business is "above plan," and first-quarter business service revenue
should rise 15% from the fourth quarter.



The problem lies in marketing services, Mallett said. In particular, a
rapid decline in spending by Yahoo's dot-com customers has hurt Yahoo's
spot ad business. Also, Yahoo's customer mix is shifting to traditional
advertisers, who are delaying purchase decisions.



Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang spoke briefly and said he looked forward
to "bringing in another new leader to work with" Koogle, Mallett and
Decker. Yahoo has hired an executive search firm and is planning to hire
a new chief executive from outside the company.



In after-hours trading, Yahoo was at $18.69, according to  Island ECN.
The shares had been halted at 9:37 a.m. EST at $21.94.

said the company has strong assets, including about $2 billion in cash,
that would allow it to weather the economic slowdown.



Koogle shed some light on his decision to step aside as chief
executive when the company finds a replacement. "I'm looking over the
horizon," he said. "When the economy starts to firm, what do we need to
have in place to scale continuously over five to 10 years? It's a great
time to extend our team. It's one of those decisions that... good
management makes."



Decker, the chief financial officer, said "external conditions" have
weakened. Many Yahoo customers have "frozen" their commitments to
purchases as their funding has tightened, she said. These factors are
beyond Yahoo's control, she added.



Decker noted that deferred revenue at the start of each quarter
previously comprised about 45% of Yahoo's quarterly revenue. But
deferred revenue from Dec. 31 is expected to be equal to about 65% to
70% of revenue for the first quarter ending March 31, which means new
contracts fell sharply during the quarter. Deferred revenue represents
revenue committed to Yahoo by customers, but not yet collected.



Decker also said business services revenue would represent a higher
percentage of overall revenue in 2001 than  the company expected in
January. At that time, Yahoo said business service revenue would be 15%
to 20% of total revenue. Marketing-services revenue was to comprise the
rest.



Decker said Yahoo would continue to pursue investments and initiatives
to support long-term revenue growth, and that  Yahoo wouldn't
"overreact" to the current softness. She also Yahoo wouldn't reduce the
quality of its services.



President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Mallett said Yahoo's
business and enterprise services were on track to post year-over-year
revenue growth in double digits. The company's enterprise portal
business is "above plan," and first-quarter business service revenue
should rise 15% from the fourth quarter.



The problem lies in marketing services, Mallett said. In particular, a
rapid decline in spending by Yahoo's dot-com customers has hurt Yahoo's
spot ad business. Also, Yahoo's customer mix is shifting to traditional
advertisers, who are delaying purchase decisions.



Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang spoke briefly and said he looked forward
to "bringing in another new leader to work with" Koogle, Mallett and
Decker. Yahoo has hired an executive search firm and is planning to hire
a new chief executive from outside the company.



In after-hours trading, Yahoo was at $18.69, according to  Island ECN.
The shares had been halted at 9:37 a.m. EST at $21.94.

 WSJ.COM WRAP: Zale 2Q Net Down 15%, Same-Store Sales Dn

 A WSJ.COM News Roundup 

 DALLAS -(Dow Jones)- Zale Corp. (ZLC) on Wednesday recorded a 15% decline in fiscal second-quarter net income after a charge to write down inventory and a tough Christmas retail season. 

 For the quarter ended Jan. 31, the operator of mall-based jewelry stores posted net income of $71.5 million, or $2.07 a diluted share, compared with $84 million, or $2.33 a share, a year earlier. 

 Excluding a charge of $25.2 million to write down some of the company's inventory, Zale would have earned $87 million, or $2.52 a share. Analysts expected the retailer to earn $2.46 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Before Zale issued a profit warning in December, analysts had expected it to earn $2.77 a share. 

 Sales rose 16% to $855.3 million from $736 million a year earlier. Second-quarter sales at stores open at least one year fell 2.3% in constant currencies. 

 Looking ahead, the retailer, whose chairwoman and chief executive recently resigned after just six months in the top job, expects earnings, excluding items, to run between 28 cents and 38 cents a share for the second half of the year. Analysts currently expect fiscal third-quarter and fourth-quarter earnings, excluding items of 35 cents and 40 cents a share, respectively. 

 The retailer added that it expects a decline in the "mid-to-high single-digits" in its same-store sales for the second half of the year. 

 Explaining its performance last year, Zale said it sought to drive revenue higher in an environment that wasn't conducive to that plan. A tighter supply of certain diamond grades led to sacrificing quality to meet price points, the company said, while increased spending on marketing didn't pay off in expected revenue gains. In addition, Zale said its capital spending wasn't consistent with its reduced earnings growth and a slowing economy. 

 In February, Zale announced that its chairwoman and chief executive, Beryl Raff, resigned after just six months in the top job. She was succeeded by Robert DiNicola, who retired from the helm of the jewelry retailer in August. 

 Mr. DiNicola, who resumed his duties on Feb. 21, is credited with engineering the turnaround of Zale, which had just emerged from bankruptcy proceedings when he arrived 7 1/2 years ago. When he retired, Zale was churning out record profit.

 Interest rate  cut  bolsters Canadian dollar, Toronto stock market

 TORONTO (CP) _ The Canadian dollar and the Toronto stock market took their cue from the Bank of Canada's interest rate cut Tuesday and put on a robust performance. 

 The loonie leaped to 65.02 cents US, up 0.39 from Monday's close, after the central bank announced a half-point cut in its key rate to boost the economy. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite index rose 106.27 points to 8,205.56, reflecting increased confidence in Canadian companies as well as a spillover of buying on Wall Street for a second-straight day. 

 In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 28.92 to close at 10,591.22. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 61.51 to 2,204.43 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index moved up 12.39 to 1,253.80. 

 Breaking the mood, the western-based Canadian Venture Exchange slipped 6.68 points to 3,102.42. 

 Observers had been split on whether the widely expected rate cut would be a quarter percentage point or a half-point. 

 ``The Bank of Canada has won some kudos by cutting by a larger 50 basis points (half a percentage point),'' said Rob Palombi of Standard & Poor's MMS in Toronto. 

 ``It's created some confidence that the economy will be able to avoid recession, so we're seeing a bit of buying interest in the currency.'' 

 Palombi said the dollar is still vulnerable to weak economic numbers. Incoming data this week will include the February unemployment rate and manufacturing figures. 

 As for the stock markets, ``Everybody thinks they're really shaky still,'' said Katherine Beattie, senior technical analyst at Standard & Poor's MMS. 

 ``I wouldn't be surprised if we resumed the downtrend Wednesday.'' 

 Beattie said any weak U.S. and Canadian jobless figures that come out Friday may herald more interest rate cuts this month. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which has reduced rates by a full percentage point this year, is expected to announce another cut March 20. 

 In Toronto, nine of 14 stock groups rose. The industrial products group, containing Nortel Networks, was the biggest gainer, up 5.83 per cent. The financial services group was the biggest decliner, off 1.16 per cent. 

 Advancers outnumbered decliners 625 to 446 with 231 unchanged in trading of 163.8 million shares worth $3.47 billion. The TSE 100 rose 6/67 to 501.72. 

 Among the most active industrials, high-tech market leader Nortel gained $2.29 to $29.50 but Bank of Nova Scotia lost $3.46 to $42.44. 

 Scotiabank's drop came despite a strong quarterly profit report as investors focused on provisions for shaky U.S. loans. Sears Canada, after issuing a profit warning late Monday, was down $2.85 to $21.85 on 1.29 million shares traded. 

 After reporting stronger earnings, Descartes Systems gained $3.75 to $23.50 and Talisman Energy rose $1.10 to $60.25. 

 On the CDNX, Meteor Creek Resources fell seven cents to 75 cents and Boundary Crescent Resources dipped five cents to 90 cents; Eventure Capital rose 15 cents to 35 cents and Maxim Power was up five cents to $1.05. 

 In New York, investors bid shares higher in hopes that the market has bottomed and the U.S. economy is turning around. 

 Stocks continued to rise despite bleak earnings outlooks, which some analysts say is a sign the market is ready for a longer-term rally. More conservative analysts say the buying is temporary, a so-called bear market rally. 

 ``I think that, at least for the Old Economy names, this (rally) could be for real. We're starting to get a lot of fundamental signs that maybe things are about to turn better,'' said James Meyer, director of research at Janney Montgomery Scott, pointing to positive findings in recent economic reports. 

 The U.S. government reported that productivity, a key measure of rising living standards, slowed to a 2.2 per cent rate of growth in the fourth quarter as the economy weakened. That was slightly ahead of the two per cent analysts were expecting. 

 The economic data helped boost retailing shares, including Wal-Mart, up $1.18 at $49.55 US. 

 Dow component Intel rose $1.13 to $31.50 even though the chip maker slashed prices on its processors by as much as 19 per cent earlier this week. Intel cited an inventory pileup that came as demand slowed. 

 Bargain-hunting tech investors overlooked other bad news, sending Cisco up 92 cents to $24 after shares were downgraded by Banc of America. 

 Semiconductor stocks rose sharply again, with Micron Technology soaring $4.86 to close at $43.86. The sector advanced strongly despite widespread downgrades Monday by Prudential Securities, which said it believes semiconductors will bottom in the second or third quarter.

 Siebel fell 14% during yesterday's session to its lowest level since November, 1999. 

 Credit Suisse First Boston slashed its 2001 earnings estimate to US65 cents from US72 cents.

 The analyst lowered his fiscal 2001 earnings forecast from US$1.11 to US90 cents and his 2002 forecast from US$1.30 to US$1.15. The 12-month target price was adjusted to US$6 from US$8.50. He maintains his "hold" recommendation on the stock. Mr. David said in his report he lowered his targets because of declining margins and a softening housing market.

 Alcan Inc. (AL/TSE) down 51 cents to $59.74, on volume of 1.7 million shares. 

 Merrill Lynch lowered its 2001 per share earnings estimate for Alcan to US$2.80 from US$3.50. Merrill has a "buy" rating on the stock and a 12-month target price of US$50, up from yesterday's New York close of US$38.70.

 Shares in Cognos jumped more than 11% yesterday after the company issued only a moderate profit warning. 

 Cognos said late Monday it expected fourth-quarter net income of US23 cents to US24 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of US26 cents per share. The company also said revenues would be between US$143-million and US$144.5-million, slightly below its previous US$145-million forecast. 

 Cognos attributed the shortfall to slower than expected sales of its business intelligence software. 

 --- 

 O&Y Properties Corp. (OYP/TSE), up 65 cents to $6.50, on volume of 68,050 shares. 

 According to Raymond James analyst Harry Rannala, speculation that O&Y will pursue a real estate investment trust strategy has helped the company's stock price.

 The Bottom Line: Job Cuts Don't Stir Zurich Fincl Shares

 ZURICH -(Dow Jones)- Zurich Financial Services (Z.ZFS) Tuesday announced plans to more than halve the number of jobs at its corporate headquarters, but the move did little to bolster its shares, coming only a month after the company surprised markets with a profit warning. 

 Zurich, which will eliminate 230 jobs and transfer another 380 to units both inside and outside Switzerland, said the measures are part of an organizational restructuring announced in November to create eight regional operations. Although some analysts applauded the trimming of Zurich's headquarters, saying it would add jobs where they are more effective, investors remained skeptical. 

 At midafternoon Tuesday, Zurich shares were flat at CHF786. The stock has fallen more than 22% this year from its high Jan. 4, with the decline accelerating since February's profit warning. 

 "They've been piling on the pounds at their corporate headquarters, while their real strengths rest at regional divisions, such as Farmers in the U.S. or at their U.K. operations," said Heinrich Wiemer, analyst at Bank Sal. Oppenheim in Zurich. 

 The move will allocate Zurich's resources more effectively, Wiemer said. He rates Zurich a buy with a year-end price target of CHF980. 

 The company expects the cuts to save around CHF200 million in pretax expenses by year-end. 

 "The implementation of best practice and global knowledge exchange aims at avoiding duplication and scaling innovation," said Frank Schnewlin, a member of Zurich's executive committee. 

 "Stock Just Never Seems To Take Off" 

 Wiemer and his buy rating are in good company - 10 out of 21 analysts surveyed by I/B/E/S Media Source rate Zurich a buy. But another 11 rate it hold or underperform, demonstrating the confusion in the market over where the company is heading. 

 "I'm getting frustrated with this company, this stock just never seems to take off, and whenever you think the bad news is priced in, they come up with something new," said the chief dealer at a Swiss private bank, who holds options on the stock for his bank's proprietary accounts. 

 Despite the successful projection of its image as a fast-moving and agile company that can quickly tackle industry challenges, Zurich's shares have steadily declined since it merged with BAT Financial Services of the U.K. in 1998. 

 And widespread praise of Zurich's management began grinding to a halt in September, when the company reported sharply lower-than-expected half year earnings combined with a change in reporting methods which surprised many. 

 Credibility eroded further last month, when Zurich warned investors that net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 would be slightly below the prior-year figure of $2.29 billion. This figure will miss the previously forecast range of $2.78 billion to $3.06 billion by a significant margin. Zurich will detail its earnings March 22. 

 The damage to goodwill was more severe than the actual figures. Analysts wondered why Zurich had to boost reserves to meet claims from last fall's U.K. floods, as weather-related losses in the fourth quarter aren't totally unexpected events. 

 "Again management gave misleading guidance and we are convinced that Zurich has again lost a lot of goodwill," said Rene Locher, analyst at Bank Sarasin. He referred to comments from the company's chief executive, Rolf Hueppi, as late as November that Zurich was on track to meet its goal of earnings growth between 10% and 15%. 

 Although he rates the shares a hold, his year-end price-target of CHF960 implies a significant rise from the current level. 

 Those enthusiastic about the stock say a lot of the bad news should be priced in by now. 

 Andreas Frick, an insurance analyst at Bank Vontobel who was cautious about the stock throughout last year, recently raised his recommendation to buy from neutral, as he considers the company to be fairly valued at the current level. 

 Bank Sal. Oppenheim's Wiemer thinks Zurich is trading at a "distrust discount" of more than 10%, but expects this to vanish over the next 12 months.

 Ad Downturn To Hurt Dow Jones 1Q; Year In Question 

 By Brian Steinberg 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
1,142 words
7 March 2001

Dow Jones News Service

(c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dow Jones & Co. (DJ) delivered its second consecutive profit warning to Wall Street  Wednesday and indicated that staff reductions may waft on the horizon, two clear signs that the company, like its publishing brethren, faces the continued vagaries of a sharp downturn in the advertising climate. 

 Dow Jones, the publisher of this newswire and The Wall Street Journal, said that it expects first quarter earnings to total between 16 cents a share and 20 cents a share, sharply below a First Call/Thomson Financial estimate of 56 cents a share. 

 In last year's first quarter, Dow Jones reported operating earnings, excluding a gain, of $79.2 million, or 88 cents a diluted share, on revenue of $579 million. 

 The culprit, according to the company, is the continued decline of ad linage at its flagship newspaper. On a year-to-date basis, advertising linage, or volume, has fallen at The Wall Street Journal by 30.2%. The drop has been accompanied by a 14.9% decline at The Wall Street Journal Europe, a 6% decline at The Asian Wall Street Journal, and a 23.3% dip in national advertising pages at Barron's. 

 Richard F. Zannino, the company's new chief financial officer, told analysts during a conference call Wednesday that The Wall Street Journal witnessed steady ad-linage declines from December to February, and expects a similar drop in March. Because of the volatile advertising environment, he said, Dow Jones is unable to offer Wall Street a firm target figure for overall 2001 earnings. 

 Dow Jones' print publishing assets, along with revenue derived from the company's relationship with General Electric Co.'s (GE) CNBC business-news cable operation, account for approximately 60% of its revenue overall. 


             A Troubled Sector



The notice comes as newspaper publishers across the country attempt to
master the evaporation of advertising revenue, which had been so
plentiful during the recent economic expansion. Like Dow Jones, many
publishers face difficult comparisons with last year's rates of
advertising revenue growth.



Newspaper stocks have risen in recent weeks as investors anticipated a
better climate in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, said Douglas
Arthur, a publishing analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the
publishers "can't get (negative) preannouncements out fast enough. They
keep coming and they keep coming.



"After a while, you sort of have to say, 'Wait a minute, maybe there's
no 'e' in the 'p'," Arthur added, referring to price-earnings ratios.



In a prepared statement, Peter R. Kann, Dow Jones' chairman and chief
executive, said the company expects to see advertising comparisons "ease
considerably in the third and fourth quarters."



But Arthur expects the troubling times to continue across the sector,
and cautioned investors to be careful. "To say that things are going to
get better is just so speculative," he said. "I think that people with
that perspective in this market are getting crushed by reality."



Knight Ridder Inc. (KRI) and New York Times Co. (NYT) have already
indicated that their first-quarter earnings will fall well below Wall
Street expectations. While Times Co. believes it can still match its
guidance for 2001, Dow Jones said it was unable at present to offer such
a figure. Knight Ridder executives indicated Tuesday that layoffs at
certain newspapers may lie in the offing.



Dow Jones also expects some layoffs. During the call, Zannino said Dow
Jones would compare its current cost structure with the one it had in
1998. The earlier figures, he said, would serve as a measure of how
finances existed before the robust advertising growth Dow Jones
experienced in 1999 and 2000. Expenses "across the board" are to be
examined, he said.



In a memo sent to employees Wednesday morning, Kann, said the company
"will need to make some limited reductions in our workforce." Many of
the layoffs, he said "can be achieved by attrition." Company executives
did not specify what part of Dow Jones' 8,550-person workforce might be
cut.



In a separate memo Wednesday to Newswires staffers, Paul J. Ingrassia,
the unit's president said he expected "to meet our unit's cost-reduction
goals without any extraordinary measures, such as changes in our product
lineup or staff reductions."



Meanwhile, during the conference call, Zannino said Dow Jones' overall
headcount has grown approximately 3.6%, or by 300 employees, since 1999,
when it stood at 8,250. That growth rate, he said, is below the
company's revenue growth rate during the same period.



              Figures For 2000



Dow Jones also said Wednesday that it established a reserve of $255
million, charged against earnings in the fourth quarter of 2000, in
connection with its guarantee of payments owed by the Telerate
subsidiary of Bridge Information Systems (X.BSY). Dow Jones sold
Telerate to Bridge in 1998.



While payments, if any, under the guarantee would be made in cash, the
reserve doesn't reflect the expenditure of cash. With this reserve, and
preliminary results and other special items reported earlier, Dow Jones
recorded a loss of $274.3 million, or $3.15 a share, in the fourth
quarter of 2000, and a loss of $119 million, or $1.35 a share, for all
of 2000.



Dow Jones has guaranteed, under certain circumstances, certain annual
minimum payments for data that Telerate acquires from Cantor Fitzgerald
Securities and Market Data Corp. under contracts entered into during the
period when Telerate was owned by Dow Jones. The minimum payments
average about $50 million a year through October 2006.



Bridge has filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code with a view to seeking a sale of its assets. Dow Jones said it
isn't possible to determine the extent to which it may be required to
make payments under the guarantee.



"We believe the Cantor data has substantial value," Zannino said, "the
realization of which would go to offset any liability we might have
under the guarantee."



In recent trading, Dow Jones shares fell 6%, or $3.65 cents a share,
to $57.70 on high volume of 974,800. Average daily volume is 358,710.



In addition to this and other newswires, Dow Jones publishes The Wall
Street Journal and its international and online editions, Barron's and
SmartMoney magazines and other periodicals, dowjones.com, Dow Jones
Indexes and the Ottaway group of community newspapers. Dow Jones is also
co-owner with Reuters Group of Factiva, with Excite@Home of Work.com,
and with NBC of the CNBC television operations in Asia and Europe. Dow
Jones also provides news content to CNBC and to radio stations in the
U.S.

 JDS Uniphase stock tumbles after second  profit warning  in three weeks

 OTTAWA (CP) _ JDS Uniphase Corp. again lowered its expectations for its current quarter Tuesday, the second time the fibre-optics giant has done so in the past three weeks. 

 JDS, the dominant player in the fibre-optics components business, said after the markets closed it now expects to earn 14 cents US a share on revenue of about $925 million during the third quarter. 

 On Feb. 13, JDS warned that it expected to earn about 17 cents a share on revenue ``slightly above'' $1 billion during the quarter that will end March 31. 

 The company also said it expects earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter that will end June 30 to be ``approximately at the same levels as the third quarter or slightly above those levels.'' 

 On the Nasdaq stock market, JDS Uniphase shares fell $1.06 to $26.94 US in after-hours trading after slipping 31 cents in regular trading during the day. 

 On the Toronto Stock Exchange, they fell 14 cents to $43.61 Cdn Tuesday. The stock's 52-week high is $219. 

 JDS, based in Ottawa and San Jose, Calif., said in a filing to U.S. regulators that the lowering of its guidance ``reflects continued uncertainty in carrier capital spending prospects and customer inventory adjustments, as well as a lower level of near-term sales visibility.'' 

 When it lowered guidance last month, JDS said it was a sign that demand for the company's fibre-optic components and modules has slipped over the past few months as part of a broader slowdown in the telecom sector. 

 Mark Lucey, a technology analyst at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto, said the fibre-optics industry is suffering from uncertainty and that many analysts have already lowered their expectations for JDS and other key industry players below the companies' guidance. 

 ``It seems like almost everyone has made their trip to the confessional,'' he said. ``Now it seems like it's time to see what reality holds.'' 

 Before JDS lowered guidance last month, analysts on average had forecast earnings of 21 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 JDS took the unusual step of releasing its latest warning through the filing to regulators, instead of first issuing a news release or holding a conference call. Company spokesman Jeff Wild said the information was also released during a corporate conference in San Francisco hosted by Thomas Weisel Partners. 

 But the guidance changes haven't been the only signs of troubled waters at JDS. 

 The company said last week that it plans to slash its workforce by 3,000 workers by the end of June. JDS said 1,050 jobs _ 350 in Ottawa and 700 in San Jose _ would be cut immediately and another 1,950 positions eliminated over the next four months. 

 Earlier in February, JDS said it would trim its Ottawa manufacturing operations by about 700 jobs. 

 JDS's most important customers have also shrunk in recent months. Both Nortel Networks Corp. of Brampton, Ont., and rival Lucent Technologies Inc. of Murray Hill, N.J., have said they will each chop 10,000 jobs. The cuts reflect declining demand for new networks and their components, analysts say.

Quake claims could be up to $1 billion

NEW YORK - In the aftermath of last week's earthquake in Washington state, insurers could pay up to $1 billion in claims, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a New York-based trade group representing property and casualty insurers.

"The bulk of the damage is in the Olympia area, near the epicenter of the earthquake. Claims are likely to involve damaged roofs, cracked walls, foundations and contents, and damage to automobiles," said Loretta Waters, spokeswoman for Insurance Information Institute.

Waters said loss estimates were based on information gathered by Boston-based Applied Insurance Research.

Nearly 300 on picket line at Loves Park factory

LOVES PARK, Ill. - More than 280 union employees at Rockford Powertrain Inc. were on strike Monday in a dispute over wages, job security and health care for retired workers, a union official said.

The employees are represented by Local 803 of the United Auto Workers union. Their 3-year contract expired Sunday night.

The union has been unable to resolve differences with the company over health care for retirees, said UAW International Representative Bill Penn. The union has filed unfair labor practice charges, he said, because the company eliminated it for future retirees.

A decision from a National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge is pending, Penn said.

Cranberry growers see need to cut more surplus

BOSTON - Cranberry handlers have agreed on a plan to cut the surplus that's devastating growers, but some growers are grumbling the restrictions don't go far enough.

The industry-wide Cranberry Marketing Committee, meeting Sunday in Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., agreed to recommend a 32-percent crop reduction. Many growers wanted more. They're worried there won't be enough demand for the 5 million barrels that still would be produced.

Many growers say the handlers, who buy and sell berries, care more about keeping prices down than about protecting growers, some of whom are certain to fold if prices don't increase.

N.Y. Times warns soft ad market to cut earnings

NEW YORK - Citing a soft advertising market and the sluggish U.S. economy, the New York Times Co. warned that its first-quarter earnings will fall at least 19 percent from a year earlier, coming in well short of analysts' forecasts.

Excluding one-time items, the publishing and broadcasting firm said earnings would be between 35 and 38 cents per share, compared with 47 cents for the same period in 2000. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of 45 cents per share.

Heinz issues profit warning

KANSAS CITY - H.J. Heinz Co., the ketchup king scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter profits next week, surprised Wall Street late Monday with an unexpected earnings warning.

The Pittsburgh-based maker of Heinz 57 steak sauce and OreIda french fries revealed it expects to earn only 65 cents per share in its fiscal third quarter, five cents less than the market's consensus expectation.

Heinz also revised its fourth-quarter profit projection to 52-54 cents per share, compared with the 69 cents Wall Street analysts expected.

 WRAPUP 1-Bear Stearns sees tough quarter, cuts jobs.

 NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. on Tuesday said it will have a hard time meeting first-quarter earnings estimates because of the stock market slump and that it has cut more than 3 percent of its staff. 

 "It will be difficult for us to achieve the Street expectations for the quarter, given this current operating environment," Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro told Reuters in a telephone interview. 

 Falling stock markets - including the Nasdaq's third-worst decline ever in February - have brought investment banking revenue drivers like stock offerings and mergers to a standstill. 

 Analysts have been trimming their earnings estimates for weeks, though Bear Stearns is the first to acknowledge it will have a tough time living up to forecasts. 

 The company is expected to earn $1.38 a share in the first quarter, according to analysts polled by market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Bear Stearns, which has about 11,000 employees, also has cut 400 jobs to lower its costs and become more efficient, it said in an internal memo. 

 The cuts will result in a second-quarter charge of $8 million. That's about 5 cents a share, based on Bear Stearns' last income statement, when it had about 148.7 million shares outstanding. 

 Molinaro insisted the job reductions and profit warning aren't related, saying the job cuts are part of an ongoing plan to improve profit margins. 

 "This decision is not a reaction to the difficult operating environment that we as well as everybody else on the Street has experienced in the first quarter," he said. 

 "This is something that has been in the works and been planned for a long period of time," Molinaro said. "We're continuing to expand our business, we're continuing to hire across all of our different business units." 

 About half of the job cuts are in its technology operations, while the others are spread across its business. Bear Stearns did say some reductions are from its fixed-income and equities trading departments but said it hasn't shed any bankers. 

 The company also closed its information technology (IT) development center in Tampa, Florida, which accounted for about 120 jobs. Bear Stearns cut 63 tech jobs at the end of December in what it said was the first part of its plan to improve profits.

 UPDATE 3-Epcos cuts forecasts as mobile orders slow.

 FRANKFURT, March 6 (Reuters) - German electronics components maker Epcos AG cut its sales forecasts for the second time this year on Tuesday and said margins would be squeezed after a sharp slowdown in orders from mobile phone makers. 

 However, the market shrugged off the latest bad news from the mobile sector, driving shares in the world's second largest electronics components maker more than five percent higher amid a rally in European chip stocks. Epcos said it expected sales growth of about 20 percent for the full year to September and operating margins of 17 percent. 

 As recently as February 1, the company lowered its forecast for sales growth to 25 percent from an earlier target of 25-35 percent growth and said it would achieve earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins of 19 percent. 

 "Business development has been very good in most industries served but has slowed significantly in mobile communications," Chief Executive Klaus Ziegler said in a statement to the annual shareholders' meeting. 

 "Order income in the past eight weeks has weakened considerably here in comparison with the year-earlier period. Inventories are currently being adjusted all along the order chain," he said. 

 Epcos supplies leading handset makers including Nokia and Siemens with components including capacitors to store electric current and surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters used to select frequencies. 

 EPCOS RISES AS CHIPS SURGE 

 By 1241 GMT, Epcos shares, which have fallen about 22 percent since the start of the year, were 5.19 percent higher at 71.90 euros, with analysts and investors saying the revised profit targets came as little surprise after a spate of bad news from mobile phone makers over recent weeks. 

 Epcos' indication of slower sales and earnings growth followed a warning of slower orders from U.S. rival Sawtek last week and a string of negative comments from semiconductor makers in the mobile communications sector. 

 Traders also said the share price appeared to have been boosted by short-selling by investors wrong-footed by a sharp rise in chip-related stocks across Europe. 

 "It's nothing really new that the telecoms sector is in a bit of a crisis," Friedrich Diel, fund manager at Frankfurt Trust said, adding that some investors may have been expecting a more dramatic statement from the company. 

 "The official statement was a kind of profit warning but it was expected by the market and priced in," WestLB Panmure analyst Karsten Iltgen said. 

 Chip stocks across Europe surged after a rise of more than five percent in the Philadephia Stock Exchange semiconductor index overnight, although analysts and investors cautioned there was still no clear sign of a solid turnaround. 

 "Technically speaking, it's a sort of upward movement within a bigger downturn. You could characterise it as a dead cat bounce," said Gert-Jan Geels, fund manager at Eureffect in Amsterdam. "Generally, we'd need to see an additional 10 percent rise from these levels before we become neutral." 

 MOBILE SALES SLOW 

 Epcos said business development in most other segments had been very good but the slowdown in mobile handset sales reported by all the leading manufacturers in recent weeks would squeeze results as companies cut their component inventories before an expected recovery in the summer. 

 "Even though results for the first quarter of 2001 were encouraging, Epcos too will feel the impact of inventory adjustments in mobile communications in the second and third quarters," the company said in a statement. 

 Epcos also joined a growing list of companies to cut forecasts for global mobile handset sales this year, saying industry forecasts of 480 million unit sales after about 410 million in 2000 may be optimistic. 

 "We can be happy if we reach 450 million units this year," Ziegler told the AGM. 

 The company said it would continue to invest strongly, and though spending would be slightly less than earlier expected, it would still invest over 350 million euros ($325 million) in the current year. 

 Away from mobile communications, Epcos, a former joint venture of Siemens AG and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co of Japan, said fixed line communications was still booming, especially in switching systems, base stations and ADSL equipment for fast Internet access.

 (Adds details of Bear Stearns profit warning, paragraphs 

 4,5) 

 By Brian Kelleher 

 NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Profits at top Wall Street 

 firms dropped off in their fiscal first quarter from record 

 levels a year earlier as stock offerings and merger activity 

 dried up, leaving investors searching for signs that the worst 

 is over. 

 "It was a tough quarter, no question," said Mark Constant, 

 who covers securities firms for Lehman Brothers. January was an 

 excellent month, but February was terrible, he added. 

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., Bear Stearns Cos. Inc., 

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 

 wrapped up their 2001 first quarters at the end of February. 

 Earnings at the firms are expected to fall as much as 28 

 percent from last year, when soaring markets were driving 

 investment banking fees. 

 It could be even worse than that. Bear Stearns after the 

 close of trading Tuesday warned it would have a difficult time 

 meeting first-quarter analysts' forecasts because of slumping 

 stock markets. 

 "It will be difficult for us to achieve the Street 

 expectations for the quarter, given this current operating 

 environment," Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro told 

 Reuters. 

 The company also said it has cut 400 jobs to boost its 

 profit margins, adding it didn't fire any bankers. 

 The Nasdaq composite posted its third-worst month ever in 

 February with a 22.4 percent slide, sending stock offerings and 

 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) - major revenue drivers for 

 investment banks - down dramatically from earlier levels. 

 "These companies are so tied to the overall markets - and 

 selectively more on the Goldman and Morgan Stanley side, to the 

 Nasdaq - and to investment banking flow," said Tim Ghriskey, 

 portfolio manager of the $4 billion Dreyfus Fund. 

 "At this point, (a second-half recovery) is really wishful 

 thinking," he said. "We're certainly closer to the bottom than 

 to the top, but the environment remains very dicey." 

 BEAR STEARNS' WARNING FOLLOWS DOWNGRADES 

 Analysts have been downgrading their first-quarter 

 estimates while hoping interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal 

 Reserve will give the economy - and the stock market - a shot 

 in the arm. The Fed slashed interest rates by a full percentage 

 point in January. 

 "Typically rate cuts take a quarter or two to really impact 

 the economy," said analyst Jim Mitchell of investment firm 

 Putnam Lovell Securities. "So, I think it makes sense to 

 anticipate some sort of pickup at the end of the year." 

 Salomon Smith Barney analyst Guy Moszkowski on Tuesday 

 lowered his share-price target for Lehman to $85 from $95 and 

 reduced his Goldman target by $10, to $140. 

 Lehman was at $69.45 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange 

 trade, while Goldman Sachs was at $95.70. 

 "It is difficult to see an immediate catalyst" for reviving 

 investment banking earnings, short of a market rebound, 

 Moszkowski said in a research note. 

 NO DEALS LEADS TO CREATIVITY 

 Only 12 companies have gone public so far this year, 

 raising a total of $2.78 billion, according to market research 

 firm Commscan. That pales in comparison to year-earlier 

 activity of 75 initial public offerings (IPO) at a combined 

 value of $11.29 billion. 

 Global M&A volume - the value of completed deals - rose 6 

 percent from the fourth quarter, according to Putnam Lovell 

 data. But excluding the blockbuster AOL-Time Warner merger that 

 closed in January for a record $165 billion, activity in the 

 quarter was actually down 15 percent. 

 This dearth of activity led to a novel investment scheme 

 during the quarter. 

 Morgan Stanley agreed to buy about $2.6 billion of debt 

 from troubled Lucent Technologies Inc., according to a report 

 in the Wall Street Journal. Morgan Stanley reportedly agreed to 

 trade the debt back to the telecommunications equipment maker 

 for shares of its Agere Systems Inc. unit. 

 Agere is planning to raise about $7 billion from its 

 pending IPO, making it the second-largest new offering in U.S. 

 history, behind the $9 billion generated when communications 

 giant AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Wireless Group Inc. wireless telephone 

 unit went public last year. 

 Morgan Stanley will act as the lead manager on the deal and 

 will sell 200 million shares out of a total of 500 million 

 being offered. The deal could bring underwriting fees of up to 

 $250 million, with the lead manager taking the bulk of that, 

 the Journal reported. 

 "I think the economics of Morgan Stanley leading that 

 transaction are big," said Constant. 

 Goldman turned down a chance to help Lucent raise money and 

 is not participating in the Agere deal, according to the 

 Journal. 

 "Looking at a very large fee as a lead manager is different 

 from Goldman Sachs' decision, which would have been a 

 co-management role," Constant said. "Goldman certainly did the 

 right thing." 

 Morgan Stanley's approach is unique because of the size of 

 Lucent and its desperate need for capital, analysts said. The 

 company is trying to restructure its operations and recover 

 from massive losses. 

 "This is a sign of the times, but it's not a sign of the 

 future," Constant said. "Most issuers...two and three years 

 from now, will be having a different set of priorities in a 

 more favorable market environment" than which firm can lend 

 them money.

 LSI Logic Lowers 1Q Guidance

 MILPITAS, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- LSI Logic Corp. (LSI) slashed its first quarter guidance, citing the adverse economic climate and widespread inventory corrections in the communications and storage markets. 

 LSI now expects to earn 3 cents a share for the first quarter, which is well below analysts' and previous company estimates of 21 cents a share. 

 The semiconductor maker also expects to report a 30% revenue reduction sequentially from the $751 million revenue posted in the fourth quarter. Previously, the company expected revenue to drop 12%. 

 LSI's warnings follow in the same path as competitor Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. (VTSS), which also reduced its guidance Monday for its second quarter. Vitesse similarly blamed continued weakness in its communications and data storage applications for its profit warning. 

 LSI earned $2.98 million, or 29 cents a diluted share on revenue of $52.3 million in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. The company said it earned 26 cents a share, before goodwill amortization and special items. 

 The company started a cost-cutting project to align its operating expenses with this latest revenue projection. 

 "The sharp decline in U.S. customer end-demand coupled with a widespread inventory correction in the supply chain has prompted us to lower our guidance for the first quarter," LSI Chairman and Chief Executive Wilfred J. Corrigan said in a press release. "We are confident that revenue growth will resume when the overall economic outlook improves."

 ANALYSIS - Corporate Reputation - Nike still sweats its Far East factory problems.

 ANALYSIS - Corporate Reputation - Nike still sweats its Far East factory problems. A damaging new report shows that Nike is still dogged by conditions in its Third World factories. So what's new? It was Nike who published them. Claire Murphy reports. 

 Just when you thought it was safe to buy Nike again, here's another Third World scandal to give consumers food for thought, and keep the company's PR people busy. 

 Last time it was under-age and under-paid workers that made the Nike brand synonymous with sweatshops. This time it is arguably worse. 

 A report from Global Alliance for Workers & Communities (GAWC) has discovered sexual abuse of women working in Nike's sub-contracted factories in Indonesia, and possible denial of proper healthcare that may have led to deaths. 

 The allegations are bad enough in themselves. But they are a particular blow for Nike, as the company has spent the past four years telling anyone who would listen that they now constantly monitor the working practices of the factories they use in Asia. 

 Nike researches itself 

 But delve a little closer into this issue, one that has dogged Nike for nearly 15 years, and you begin to see how Nike has been working its corporate butt off behind the scenes to dissipate criticism of its policies towards its activities in the Third World. 

 For starters, it was Nike's efforts to embrace its critics and take a proactive stance toward its corporate reputation, which led to the creation of GAWC. 

 GAWC is not just any NGO (non-governmental organization), taking aim at Nike, the perennial activist's easy target. It was set up in January 1999 by the International Youth Federation, with funding from Nike, the World Bank, and Gap, another brand with its share of public troubles from its Asian factories. 

 Fed up of reports appearing in the media from all sorts of unverified sources, Nike chose to commission an organization with which it already had a dialogue to conduct some in-depth research. 

 Since then, GAWC has been to Thailand and Vietnam, former hotspots of controversy for Nike, and discovered that factories are being run in a far more humane way than in previous years. 

 But GAWC's report into Indonesia didn't make as happy reading for Nike's management. Interviews with 4,400 workers threw up serious allegations that has already sent the company's VP of corporate responsibility, Dusty Kidd, over to the country to investigate. 

 Unusually, Nike not only commissioned the report, but also released the grizzly details. Vada Manager, Nike's PR chief and director of global issues, says, 'We'd originally made the commitment to publish the results of (GAWC's) report. Our only stipulation was that we talk about facts. We couldn't then selectively release information if we didn't like it. We are confident that GAWC has produced a comprehensive piece of research, and we disclosed it to the media. So there is no dispute on our part about resolving these difficulties.' 

 Public Affairs Council president Doug Pinkham believes that, despite the risks, Nike made the right move in telling the world about the seamier side of its operations. 

 'Nike is a lightening rod for these issues. The one thing it really needs is to have access to facts which it can work with. It is becoming more proactive, by building allies, and increasing the transparency of its operations.' 

 'The age of spin is over - I really believe that. We live in a world where if you are doing something unethical, someone will find out. So it's far better to get in first and be able to say 'we've discovered this problem and we're dealing with it."

 The road to paying for a group to wash your dirty linen in public began in earnest for Nike in January 1998, when it appointed Kidd, its former US director of PR, to the new post of VP, corporate responsibility. Kidd had already been in charge of Nike's Labor Practices Department, set up two years previously to monitor Nike's production processes, principally in Indonesia, China and Vietnam. These three countries account for 75% of the company's sub-contractors. 

 Creating the role of VP of corporate responsibility, still a relatively rare position in a US firm, was designed to focus the entire business on issues which had become paramount for Nike. 'We identified a need to have one senior person responsible for manufacturing, environmental and labor issues, as well as our philanthropic and community efforts,' explains Manager. 'By putting one person in charge of this area, it gives a focal point for NGOs. It also humanizes the issue.' 

 Exactly 12 months later, Nike pledged $7.8 million to help set up GAWC and begin the process of using a third party to investigate any allegations with the potential to show up on an activist group's Web site. 

 Later that year, Nike went a step further to monitor and control the activities of its Asian partner factories. It invited a small number of students, a group that has traditionally been one of its most vocal critics, to form a working party to tour various Nike factories. It picked students from 11 colleges where opposition to Nike - organized through United Students Against Sweatshops - has been very strong. The program was arranged with help from PricewaterhouseCoopers, who sent inspectors into factories with individual students. 

 Although the students found some 'difficulties,' as Manager refers to them, they were nothing compared to allegations that GAWC's study unearthed. 

 So, why, after so many years of fervent monitoring activity by Nike, are problems like this still appearing? According to GAWC's director of International Programs, Maggie Alexander, the problem is that things can change very quickly in the factories. 'Monitoring has to be a continual process of checking,' she says. 'This is the first study of this size that has been conducted into Nike's Indonesian factories, and it will act as a baseline for future research.' 

 'GAWC conducted over 4,000 interviews. It was a highly in-depth study,' adds Manager. 'We can't expect our own people to gather that level of information.' 

 Early anecdotal evidence shows that the strategy may be working. Although Manager derides use of the word 'widespread' in some press reports of the alleged sexual abuse ('we're talking about 2.5% of employees - that's hardly widespread'), much of the press coverage that greeted the report praised Nike's quick response. 

 Nike's relationship with GAWC is expected to be a long-term one, with the group providing the company with information with which it can act before the activists. Looking into the future, the company is likely to keep even closer tabs on the practices of its factories. A profit warning released by Nike last week predicts that earnings in its current quarter will come in a whopping 30% below predictions. 

 Therefore, Nike will most likely need to cut costs and put the squeeze on its production process, the vast majority of which is sited in Asia. 

 All of which is going to lead to a quandary for Nike's senior management - whether to continue to pour money into programs to improve the lives of its Asian employees (and consequently improve its corporate reputation), or justify the expense to anxious shareholders.

NEW YORK - Enticed by bargain prices and heartened by the possibility of a tax cut, investors did some tentative buying Friday, limiting most of their purchases to safer blue chips.

Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told Congress he favors income tax cuts to reduce federal budget surpluses, helped boost some stocks. Still, another set of profit warnings, including one from software maker Oracle, reminded the market it could be some time before earnings and the economy show signs of improvement.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.17 to close at 10,466.31 after gaining as much as 129 points and falling as much as 148 during the session. For the week, the Dow gained 24.41, a 0.2 percent increase.

Broader market indicators, which include many riskier tech stocks, fell. The Nasdaq composite index lost 65.74 to finish at 2,117.63, a level not seen since December 1998. The Nasdaq lost 6.4 percent for the week, or 144.88.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 7.05 to 1,234.18, slipping 11.68, or 0.9 percent, for the week. The S&P - with more than a third of its components in tech stocks - is now down 20 percent from the high of 1,552.87 it reached a year ago, which analysts say is a sign that the bear market has spread to the broader market from the tech sector.

The Dow's tech components were mostly lower. Hewlett-Packard, however, gained 52 cents to close at $29.52.

Among other big tech stocks, Gateway fell 30 cents to $15.45 and Dell rose 56 cents to $22.06.

Analysts saw hope in the fact that some tech stocks moved higher while others recovered some of the steep losses they incurred on profit warnings from big-name companies like Oracle.

Software maker Oracle, which issued a profit warning, fell nearly 21 percent, down $4.50 at $16.88.

Preliminary results for the third quarter show earnings will be 10 cents a share, the company said late Thursday. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial were expecting earnings of 12 cents a share. Oracle earned 8 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners about 5-to-4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was 1.48 billion shares, down slightly from 1.51 billion on Thursday.

The Russell 2000 index gained 3.58 to close at 476.88.

The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 2/32 point, to yield 5.37 percent, up from 5.30 percent Thursday.

Bad economic data out of Japan, combined with the nation's ongoing political instability, are hurting the yen, currency traders said. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.16 yen, up from 117.39 yen.

The euro was quoted at 93.52 cents, up from 93.17 cents late Thursday. The dollar fell to 9.647 pesos from 9.695 Thursday. The peso rose to 10.3659 cents from 10.3146.

In Mexico, the bolsa finished up 52.69 at 6,133.34 points, an increase of 0.867 percent.

Overseas markets were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 declined 0.9 percent. But Germany's DAX index gained 0.6 percent.

NEW YORK (AP) - Enticed by bargain prices and heartened by the possibility of a tax cut, investors did some tentative buying Friday, limiting most purchases to safer blue chips.

Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told Congress he favors income tax cuts to reduce federal budget surpluses, helped boost some stocks. Still, more profit warnings reminded the market it could be some time before substantial improvement in earnings.

The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.17 to close at 10,466.31 after gaining as much as 129 points and falling as much as 148 during the session. For the week, the Dow gained 24.41, a 0.2 percent increase.

Broader market indicators, which include many riskier tech stocks, fell. The Nasdaq composite index lost 65.74 to finish at 2,117.63, a level not seen since December 1998. The Nasdaq lost 6.4 percent for the week, giving up 144.88.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 7.05 to 1,234.18, slipping 11.68, or 0.9 percent, for the week. The S&P - with more than a third of its components in tech stocks - is now down 20 percent from the high of 1,552.87 it reached a year ago, which analysts say is a sign that the bear market has spread to the broader market from the technology sector.

Analysts didn't expect any of Friday's gains to last and they described investors as cautious. The careful buying was due to the fact that stocks are cheaper following their most recent dive, not because the outlook for profits or the economy has improved.

"Until investors have more confidence that we are not going to get blindsided every day by a new wave of companies giving us bad news, the tone of the market will stay as it is - guarded at best," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp.

Defensive stocks - called that because they fare better in a bear market - accounted for much of the Dow's advance. Philip Morris climbed $1.15 to $49.70, while Procter & Gamble rose $1 to $69.65.

The Dow's tech components were mostly lower. Hewlett-Packard, however, gained 52 cents to close at $29.52.

Among other big tech stocks, Gateway fell 30 cents to $15.45 and Dell rose 56 cents to $22.06.

Analysts saw hope in the fact that some tech stocks moved higher while others recovered some of the steep losses they incurred on profit warnings from big-name companies like Oracle.

"People were worried that we might get another leg down in the Nasdaq, because of yet another warning from one of the glamour tech stocks, and that just didn't happen," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott & Stringfellow in Richmond, Va.

Software maker Oracle, which issued a profit warning late Thursday, fell nearly 21 percent, down $4.50 at $16.88.

Tech stocks' mixed day came from investors being torn between the lure of lower prices and fear generated by earnings warnings, Dickson said.

While investors are afraid the Nasdaq is going to keep sliding, Dickson said, they're also thinking, "What if these thing have hit the bottom and I missed the boat?"

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 1.28 billion shares, matching Thursday's activity.

The Russell 2000 index gained 3.58 to close at 476.88.

Overseas markets were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 declined 0.9 percent. But Germany's DAX index gained 0.6 percent

 Oracle shares crash after  profit warning

 Shares in database software giant Oracle slumped by more than a fifth in early trading today after the firm issued a profit warning. Citing the waning US economy, Oracle said its earnings would be a sixth lower than Wall Street estimates, with profits of 10 cents per share. 

 The market took the news badly, with shares falling from an opening price of $21.375 to $15.719 before rallying to $17.125 at 10.30am New York local time. According to Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison, a substantial number of customers have cut back on IT spending because of concerns about cooling economic growth. "Licence growth was strong in the first two months of the third quarter and our internal sales forecast looked good up until the last few days of the quarter," he said. Oracle is expected to announce its third-quarter results on 15 March. Richard Holway, director of analyst Ovum Holway, told vnunet.com: "This shows the market is finally catching up with reality. Oracle is a great company, but even despite this fall, itis still overrated. We predicted that Nasdaq would bottom out at 2000 points and it is now within one per cent of that." Earlier this week, 3Com and Gatewayalso revised their quarterly earnings predictions. 3Com expects to report a proforma operating loss, excluding charges, non-recurring charges and amortisationof goodwill, of between $235m and $245m, more than double its previous loss estimate of between $80m and $100m. The company blamed the reductions on a slowdown in the telecoms equipment market, less profit from its high-speed modem business because of sharp drops in prices for cable and DSL modems, as well as othereconomic factors. The revision came days after 3Com announced that it would reduce its global workforce by 10 per cent. Gateway estimated it would take charges of between $150m and $275m in the first quarter, which includes a previouslyannounced estimate of $50m for jobs cuts and other items. The PC vendor alsoplans to cut 10 per cent of its workforce, and warned that unit sales in the first quarter would be down slightly year-over-year.

 PROFIT  WORRIES GROUND AIRLINE STOCKS US AIRWAYS ISSUES EARNINGS  WARNING ; UNITED NOTES SLOWING BUSINESS

 Shares of the nation's biggest airlines plunged Thursday after Wall Street analysts downgraded most of their stocks in the wake of a profit warning from US Airways. 

 The warning came as officials of UAL Corp. said there have been indications that business has been softening as well. 

 "We are watching our February results and we will be moving quickly if we have to," said Rono Dutta, president of UAL, the parent company of United Airlines. 

 Saying that business travel appears to have dropped in the past month, Dutta added that the airline's total "passenger loads are holding up but the mix is off." 

 Moreover, weakness in business travel "appears to be industrywide as opposed to just United," he said. Corporations appear to be cutting back on travel as layoff announcements are issued each day, Dutta said. 

 "We're hoping that it recovers quickly," he said, adding there are no guarantees that business will rebound in six months. 

 Dutta's comments were echoed by US Airways. 

 "As corporations react to softening economic conditions and declining consumer confidence, the company is increasingly experiencing weakness in business travel, as seen in the decline of close-in business bookings," the company said in a statement issued shortly after the market opened Thursday. 

 Business bookings, with their often-higher fares, make up the bulk of a carrier's revenue. 

 As a result of the warning and growing weakness in the nation's economy, Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel increased his estimate of US Airways' loss for 2001. 

 Engel estimated that US Airways, which UAL is seeking to buy, will record a loss of 40 cents a share, instead of a loss of 15 cents. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus estimate for 2001, however, is for earnings of 24 cents per share. 

 Jarred investors sent the American Stock Exchange airline index down more than 4 percent. Since January, the index has fallen 17 percent. 

 UAL led the parade down Thursday with a fall of $3.04 a share, or 8 percent, to $35.01. Close behind were AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, down $1.93, or 6 percent, to $31.32, and Delta Air Lines, down $1.77, or 4 percent, to $40.35. 

 US Airways, which started the stampede, closed at $40.25, down $1.05, or 2.5 percent. FedEx Corp. bucked the trend, closing at $41.02, up 9 cents a share. 

 United's stock drop came as the carrier announced plans to beef up customer service so passengers don't have to endure another summer of discontent. Last summer, United canceled more than 25,000 flights because of severe weather and labor troubles with its pilots. 

 United unveiled a $150 million package of technological innovations Thursday, ranging from self-service check-in kiosks to an improved gate information display to a "customer advocate center" assigned to reschedule customers whose travel has been disrupted. 

 Larry DeShon, vice president-customer satisfaction, said the package should go a long way toward meeting the demands of customers who have said they felt abandoned by the airline. 

 Dutta said the improvements are aimed at improving passengers' impression that arriving at an airport is akin to entering a war zone. 

 "We all recognize that airline travel has become very, very stressful for our customers," Dutta said as United officials showed off some of the new equipment at O'Hare International Airport. "You have a lot of congestion at the airport, air traffic delays are bad and getting worse, and we still have to take the customer through that ... fairly hostile environment." 

 "We need to focus on what's happening on the ground," he said. 

 About 800 of the Easy Check-in units are to be installed in 25 airports by the end of 2001, and 300 to 400 more are planned for next year in 25 additional cities. Prototypes are being put in now at O'Hare and the San Diego and Aspen, Colo., airports. 

 In addition, the airline said it has created a customer advocate center that links the airline's operations center with its reservation center. Currently, when a disruption occurs on one of the 350 targeted business flights, the center works to book alternative flights and even hotels when delays or cancellations occur. Eventually, the advocate center operation will cover all of United's more than 2,300 daily flights.

 WRAPUP-U.S. tech stocks hit by Oracle, bonds fall.

 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. tech stocks took a hit on Friday after software giant Oracle Corp.'s profit warning, driving the Nasdaq down to a 26-month low, while bonds dropped after hopes for a quick interest-rate cut evaporated. 

 The warning shot from Oracle wreaked havoc on Japan's stock market, driving the Nikkei 225 average down 3 percent to yet another 15-year low this week. That, in turn, forced the Japanese yen to a six-week low against the dollar. 

 But the drop in U.S. consumer confidence to a five-year low pushed the dollar lower against the euro. 

 U.S. consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan's twice-monthly barometer, hit its lowest level in nearly five years in February. The three-month drop from December through February, however, is the largest since the last recession in 1990. 

 In New York, oil futures rose as the market waited for more hints about whether OPEC will cut production again. 

 "I don't think technology stocks, despite their deep descent so far, see the clean-up at hand," said Stanley Nabi, managing director of Credit Suisse Asset Management, which oversees more than $100 billion. 

 "Some companies that now are looking for some recovery in their business in the second half may come out and say that the recovery is going to be delayed," Nabi added. 

 The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index closed down 65.74 points, or 3.01 percent, at 2,117.63, its lowest finish since December 1998. It was the fifth down week in a row for Nasdaq, and brought it down 14.3 percent for the year. 

 The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.17 points, or 0.15 percent, to 10,466.31. For the year, the Dow is down 3 percent. 

 The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 7.05 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,234.18. This marked the fifth down week for the S&P 500 index, which is down 6.52 percent for the year so far. 

 Oracle, the most actively traded Nasdaq stock, lost more than 21 percent of it value, or $4-1/2 per share, to close at $16-7/8. The stock fell to lows unseen since November 1999. 

 After the close of trading on Thursday, Oracle told Wall Street its profits the soft U.S. economy would drive its earnings below the Street's estimates. 

 "We're seeing a very substantial slowdown in the U.S. economy that is making people cautions in all of their spending, including spending for software," Oracle Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Ellison told Reuters. 

 With Oracle's trading of more than 221 million shares, the stock was the Nasdaq's third biggest ever trading volume for a single day. 

 The Oracle gloom spread throughout the software sector amid fears of indiscriminate spending cuts in the industry. The S&P computer software index was down a whopping 9.29 percent, reflecting weakness by Siebel Systems Inc. , which fell $8-33/64 to $36-7/64, and Veritas Software Corp. , off $7-1/16 at $63-5/8. 

 The shares of a number of recently beaten-down computer makers rallied Friday, including Dell Computer and Apple Computer . The Philadelphia semiconductor index rose 2 percent. 

 But many other top Nasdaq names slumped, including top Internet gear maker Cisco Systems , which finished with a loss of $2-5/16 at $22-3/16. 

 The most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange was computer data storage firm EMC Corp which dropped $4.51 to $38.40. 

 At the 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) settlement, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note lost 15/32 to 100-13/32, yielding 4.95 percent, up from 4.88 percent at Thursday's close. The 30-year bond tumbled a full point, or $10 on each $1,000 of face value, to 100-5/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 5.37 percent from 5.30 percent late on Thursday. 

 The bond market sold off on disappointment that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did not give the signal it was hoping for this week - that he would cut interest rates before the Fed's next policy-setting meeting on March 20 to help a sagging economy and a slumping stock market. 

 Investors began the week with high hopes for a rare "inter-meeting" rate cut. But they went home empty-handed on Friday. 

 In late U.S. currency trading, the euro rose to 93.37 cents from 92.94 cents on Thursday. The dollar rose to 119.01 yen from 117.40 yen at Thursday's New York close. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, April crude oil gained 22 cents to settle at $27.84 a barrel. Short covering before the weekend helped lift prices, traders said. But some of the gains were tied to uncertainty about whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will approve cuts in production when it meets March 16 in Vienna. 

 Elsewhere in the futures markets, June palladium dropped to a four-month low, down $33.55 to $766 an ounce after falling to $750 - the lowest price for the benchmark month since last October. Dealers linked the price drop to expectations of more shipments from major producer Russia. Palladium is crucial to the production of automotive catalytic converters. 

 In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100 Index fell 50 points, or 0.85 percent, to 5,858.6. 

 In Tokyo, stocks plummeted to a 15-year low for the second time this week. The benchmark Nikkei 225 average plunged 419.86 points, or 3.31 percent, to finish at 12,261.80, its lowest close since July 31, 1985.

 FOREX-Euro leads pack, hits 6-week high against feeble yen.

 LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - The euro capitalised on worries about Japanese and U.S. stock performance on Friday, rising to six-week highs against the yen and three-week highs against the dollar. 

 The euro posted its largest gains against the yen, and its rapid ascent above the psychological 110 yen level, a gain of more than five yen in the past three days, pushed the dollar in turn to six-week highs against the Japanese currency. 

 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average crumpled to 15-year lows for the third day in a row on Friday, undermined by weak economic data and political uncertainty. 

 Nasdaq 100 futures, meanwhile, pointed to a lower open for the Nasdaq index following an after-hours profit warning on Thursday from Oracle Corp, the world's second largest software company. 

 "The euro is looking like a safe haven, as both the U.S. and Japan are underperforming," said Steven Englander, global currency strategist at Citibank in London. 

 "Markets are beginning to worry whether this is more than a normal cyclical downturn." 

 The euro rose to peaks of 111.40 yen, up two percent on the day, and $0.9380 by 1235 GMT, according to Reuters data. The dollar rose to highs of 118.81 yen. 

 NO CONFIDENCE 

 Economic data compounded gloom over the yen, with the Japanese jobless rate hitting an all-time high of 4.9 percent in January and Tokyo-area consumer prices posting their largest annual fall on record. 

 Japan's opposition, meanwhile, agreed to submit a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori on Monday. 

 "It's a whole host of factors that are negative for the yen," said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in London. 

 "The Nikkei fell sharply, the data was bad and obviously political uncertainty is nothing new, but when you have so many other negative factors kicking in, these things come back to haunt the yen." 

 The yen also faced further easing in monetary policy in coming weeks. 

 Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami said on Friday the bank needed to study a wide range of policy options including zero rates. He said zero rates were abnormal and that setting an inflation target was difficult. 

 He also said the bank needed to mull both the efficacy and side effects of unusual monetary policy steps such as outright buying of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), in contrast with his frank rejection of such measures until recently. 

 "Hayami was considered a hawk for a long time, and the fact that he is now coming out with these sorts of comments twice a week suggests he is beginning to reconsider his thinking," said Englander. 

 The BOJ cut its overnight call rate target to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent on Wednesday. 

 Traders said the yen was also suffering on Friday from talk there could be a possible reweighting of index-linked portfolios at the expense of Japanese shares, with sales of Nikkei futures in Asia said to have sparked such speculation. 

 EURO RIDES OUT SOFT DATA 

 The euro, meanwhile, took in its stride a larger than expected dip in economic sentiment in the euro zone in February, with the reading falling to 102.7 from a revised 103.1 in January. 

 This followed data showing the French consumer confidence index fell to five in February from January's record of seven. 

 Italian consumer inflation stood at a provisional 3.0 percent for the second month running in February, while the Italian adjusted services purchasing managers' index showed the lowest rate of growth for over two years, dipping to 55.3 in February from 56.1 in January. 

 Analysts said the data were insufficient to dent the market's renewed optimism about the euro-zone economy. 

 "The euro is doing well today because the growth outlook for the euro zone is looking quite good compared with the U.S. and Japan," said Ian Stannard, foreign exchange strategist at BNP Paribas in London. 

 "The Japanese stock market has collapsed and foreign investors are sitting on a loss with no bottom in sight. This could trigger a flight of foreign capital from Japan, helping dollar/yen and euro/yen."

 NEW YORK, March 2 (Reuters) - U.S. technology stock futures extended losses in pre-opening trading on Friday, hit by a profit warning from No. 2 software maker Oracle Corp. . 

 March futures for the technology-laden Nasdaq 100 index were off 54 points at 1,906. Futures for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were off 12 points at 1,231.50. 

 Oracle, the world's No. 2 software maker, was down at $15-7/8 on the Instinet electronic broker system from a Thursday closing price of $21-3/8. Volume was very heavy, with more than 12 million shares traded more than 30 minutes before the start of regular trading. 

 After markets closed on Thursday, the company forecast profits in its most recent quarter of 10 cents a share. Analysts expected 12 cents a share, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Oracle blamed the shortfall on lower spending by customers. The company joined a parade of high-tech companies that have slashed forecasts amid a slowing U.S. economy. 

 Goldman Sachs cut the shares from its Recommended For Purchase list. 

 The Oracle warning sent leading software shares lower. Among them, Microsoft Corp. , a component of the Dow Jones industrial average , fell to $57-3/4 from a close of $59-23/64. 

 Siebel Systems Inc. slipped to $35-1/2 from a close of $44-5/8. 

 SBC Communications Inc. , the No. 2 local phone company, fell to $43`???r markets closed on Thursday, the company said first-quarter profits may fall short of Wall Street for???ause of costs to upgrade service in its Ameritech unit.

 Software Shares Plummet on Oracle  Profit Warning

 SAN JOSE, Calif.--Confirming that no enclave of high-tech is immune from the economic downturn, database software giant Oracle announced Thursday that its fiscal third-quarter financial results will fall well below earlier predictions. The warning sent Oracle shares down 21 percent in after-hours trading. 

 Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Ellison said in a conference call with analysts and reporters that sales of software licenses were strong in the first two months of the quarter and several new contracts were in the works. But as the economic climate continued to dim, companies canceled plans to buy Oracle's software in the last few days of the quarter, which ended Wednesday, Ellison said. 

 Oracle is a bellwether company in the business software arena, and the unexpected slowdown is an ominous sign for the rest of the software industry. 

 "There is a general nervousness caused by uncertainty out there that is impacting senior executives across the board," Ellison said. 

 Revenue from software applications grew 50 percent and database revenue was flat or slightly down from the year-ago period, according to preliminary results. 

 Analysts had forecast sales of applications to increase around 75 percent and database sales to grow around 15 percent. 

 Earnings were up 20 percent to 10 cents a share and operating profit margins were 33 percent, a two-percentage point improvement from the year-ago period. Oracle said it will give more detail on the results when it announces earnings officially on March 15. 

 Investors dumped Oracle shares on the news, pushing the stock down to $16.88 in after-hours trading. During regular Nasdaq trading earlier in the day, shares rose $2.38 to $21.38. 

 Oracle's warning came on the heels of dozens of bleak financial reports from high-tech companies, including Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems. 

 "No one can escape the claws of the economy right now," said Brent Thill, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in San Francisco. "Software was one of the last pillars of strength in high-tech." 

 Software companies had been largely protected from weak demand for technology products because of big back orders for software licenses and because companies often cut back on hardware and networking equipment before they cut their budgets for software, some analysts said. 

 Because Oracle's quarter ends one month before most high-tech companies, analysts said the company's announcement portends problems for other software vendors. 

 Investors sold off shares of software companies in after-hours trading. Siebel Systems fell $6.38 to $38.25, PeopleSoft fell $3.81 to $30.25 and Veritas was down $5.63 to $65.06. 

 Mark Verbeck, an analyst at Epoch Partners in San Francisco, said he had already reduced his forecasts for database sales after purchases of computer servers, which host databases, fell earlier this year. But he was surprised by how weak Oracle's revenue figures were and how much the company was hurt in just the last few days of the quarter. 

 "I'm surprised they didn't have better visibility," he said. 

 Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley said that because of economic uncertainty, the company can't predict when sales growth will improve. 

 Still, Oracle executives have recently been upbeat about the impact a slowing economy would have on Oracle's business. In an interview Wednesday, Oracle marketing executive Bob Shimp said that in tough economic times, "people look where to find cost savings." An economic downturn, he said, would actually benefit the company.

 United Airlines Stock Plummets Following Downgrade

 Shares of the nation's biggest airlines plunged Thursday after Wall Street analysts downgraded most of their stocks in the wake of a profitwarning from US Airways. 

 The warning came as officials of UAL Corp. also noted indications that business has been softening. 

 "We are watching our February results and we will be moving quickly if we have to," said Rono Dutta, president of UAL, the parent company of United Airlines. 

 Saying that business travel appears to have dropped in the past month, Dutta added that the airline's total "passenger loads are holding up but the mix is off." 

 Moreover, weakness in business travel "appears to be industry-wide as opposed to just United," he said. Corporations appear to be cutting back on travel as layoff announcements are issued each day, Dutta added. 

 "We're hoping that it recovers quickly. But there aren't any guarantees that there are going to be bounces back in six months," he said. 

 Dutta's comments were echoed by US Airways. 

 "As corporations react to softening economic conditions and declining consumer confidence, the company is increasingly experiencing weakness in business travel, as seen in the decline of close-in business bookings," the company said in a statement issued shortly after the market opened Thursday. 

 Business bookings, with their often-higher fares, make up the bulk of a carrier's revenues. 

 As a result of the warning and growing weakness in the nation's economy, Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel increased his estimate of US Airways' loss for 2001. 

 Engel estimated that US Airways, which UAL is seeking to buy, will record a loss of 40 cents a share, up from a loss of 15 cents. The First Call/Thomson Financial consensus estimate for 2001, however, is for earnings of 24 cents per share. 

 Jarred investors sent the American Stock Exchange airline index down more than 4 percent to 145.56. Since January, the index has fallen 17 percent. 

 UAL led the parade down Thursday with a fall of $3.04 a share, or 8 percent, to $35.01. Close behind were AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, down $1.93, or 6 percent, to $31.32. It was followed by Delta Air Lines, down $1.77, or 4 percent, to $40.35. 

 US Airways, which started the stampede, closed at $40.25, down $1.05, or 2.5 percent. FedEx Corp. bucked the trend, closing at $41.02, up 9 cents a share. 

 United's stock drop came as the carrier announced plans to beef up customer service so passengers don't have to endure another summer of discontent. 

 Last summer, United canceled more than 25,000 flights due to severe weather and labor troubles with its pilots. 

 United unveiled a $150 million package of technological innovations Thursday, ranging from self check-in kiosks to an improved gate information display to a "customer advocate center" assigned to reschedule customers whose travel has been disrupted. 

 Larry DeShon, vice president--customer satisfaction, said the package should go a long way toward meeting the demands of customers who have said they felt abandoned by the airline. 

 Dutta said the improvements are aimed at improving passengers' impression that arriving at an airport is akin to entering a war zone. 

 "We all recognize that airline travel has become very, very stressful for our customers," Dutta said as United officials showed off some of the new equipment at O'Hare International Airport. 

 "You have a lot of congestion at the airport, air traffic delays are bad and getting worse, and we still have to take the customer through that ... fairly hostile environment." 

 "We need to focus on what's happening on the ground," he said. 

 About 800 of the Easy Check-in units are to be installed in 25 airports by the end of 2001, with another 300 to 400 planned next year in 25 additional cities. Prototypes are being put in now at O'Hare, San Diego and Aspen, Colo., airports. 

 In addition, the airline said it has created a customer advocate center that links the airline's operations center with its reservation center. Currently, when a disruption occurs on one of the 350 targeted business flights, the center works to book alternative flights and even hotels when delays or cancellations occur. 

 Eventually, the advocate center operation will be expanded to cover all of United's more than 2,300 daily flights.

 N.Y. Stocks End Mixed Amid Hope For Capitulation In Tech

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Software maker Oracle admitted that its earnings prospects have become another casualty of the weakness in the U.S. economy, and the collateral damage from its confession gauged another hole in valuations of high-technology issues. 

 Shares of the database products maker finished $4.50 lower at $16.88 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, sinking to a 52-week low, after the company issued a warning late Thursday that its fiscal third-quarter profits wouldn't live up to Wall Street's profit forecasts. 

 Wall Street analysts reacted with a mercilessness that isn't often on display when one of the market's bellwethers stumbles. At least 10 analysts blitzed the stock with downgrades, and then pasted a host of other technology names with downgrades and estimate cuts. 

 Shares of Microsoft dropped 2.67 to 56.69 on Nasdaq, while Siebel Systems lost 8.52 to 36.11, also on Nasdaq, following critical comments from Goldman Sachs. 

 Lehman Brothers raised questions about the outlook for software names such as BEA Systems, which fell 6.23 to 32.69, Mercury Interactive, which dropped 10.50 to 48.50, and Veritas Software, which sank 7.06 to 63.63, all on Nasdaq. Commerce One fell 2.56 to 15.50 on Nasdaq, after Salomon Smith Barney cut its estimates on the Internet infrastructure software developer. 

 The scope and depth of the pessimism in evidence Friday left traders with the impression that analysts, who have been criticized for moving too slowly to temper their profit expectations for growth stocks in a slowing economy, had finally thrown in the towel. That's often just the sort of capitulation to sorry conditions that accompanies a bottom. In fact, after a dizzying drop from the start of trading, the Nasdaq Composite Index managed an intraday turnaround. 

 That effort, however, faltered, wounded by the lack of courage on the part of traders to hold their positions ahead of the weekend. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished 65.67 points weaker, a fall of 3.01%, to 2117.70, its lowest finish since Dec. 18, 1998, when it closed at 2120.96. 

 Still, there were some characteristics that the recent technology selloff might begin to mark a bottom. 

 "We've retested the support levels that we were able to hold (Thursday)," Todd Clark, co-head of trading at W.R. Hambrecht, said in a report Friday, referring to the previous day's session, when the Nasdaq composite successfully executed a nifty intraday about-face and finished higher. "Perhaps we're at or close to an inflection point in the market." 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average also faded dramatically at the start of trading. It managed to work its way back, but couldn't hold the best of the trading session's gains, finishing up a modest 16.17, or 0.15%, to 10466.31. 

 (Corrected 05:50 PM) 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10466.31, up 16.17. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,919 issues advancing, 1,127 declining and 212 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,281,079,370 shares, compared with 1,276,011,650 Thursday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 626.87, up 1.72. The average price per share rose 11 cents. 

 The Dow industrial average's inability to hold its best levels of the session owed a lot to the changing fortunes of International Business Machines throughout the session. On Thursday, the computer giant acted as the agent of change, mounting an intraday recovery that sparked a turnaround in the whole tech sector. 

 On Friday, however, the stock faltered from the opening bell, rallied early, then ebbed and flowed throughout the session, finishing weaker by 3.75 at 102.30. 

 Energy and commodity stocks lent the Dow industrial average what support it enjoyed. Shares of Exxon Mobil gained 1.81 to 83.21, and other oil producers advanced, as well. Shares of Chevron rose 1.61 to 88.45, while Texaco gained 1.64 to 66.84, and Texaco advanced 1.64 to 66.84. The gains came amid talk that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut output later this month to fend off price declines. 

 Shares of oil-services providers made gains after some upbeat comments from Dain Rauscher Wessels. Santa Fe International added 84 cents to 38.50, Global Marine gained 1.28 to 30.09, and Rowan improved 1.48 to 30.83. 

 Among commodity issues, International Paper added 1.45 to 39, while Dow Chemical increased 84 cents to 34.12, and DuPont moved ahead 98 cents to 44.72. 

 For the week, the Dow industrial average added 24.41, or 0.23%. The Nasdaq composite, on the other hand, dropped 144.81, or 6.4%. 

 General Electric fell 1.34 to 44.57, after Merrill Lynch said the company's prospective merger partner, Honeywell, may have to report its first-quarter earnings as an independent company, now that the acquisition won't close as quickly as GE wanted. Earlier this week, European regulators opened an extensive probe of the merger, dealing the closing a setback. 

 Honeywell lowered its fourth-quarter earnings forecasts in December, raising concerns it may have to do it again for the first quarter. The stock lost 1.26 to 44.79. 

 Brocade Communications lost 4.69 to 35.63 on Nasdaq. Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on the San Jose, Calif., maker of storage networks products. 

 Clear Channel Communications gained 2.09 to 60.04. Thomas Weisel Partners reiterated its buy rating on shares of the San Antonio broadcasting and media concern. 

 Yahoo! sank 2.75 to 21.69 on Nasdaq, falling to a 52-week low intraday, as investors reacted to the Santa Clara, Calif., Internet service provider's adoption of a shareholder rights, or so-called poison pill, plan. 

 Tycom lost 36 cents to 18.04, falling to a 52-week low. J.P. Morgan H&Q cut its rating on the Bermuda operator of a transoceanic fiber optic system, citing concerns about pricing capacity. 

 Shares of Level 3 Communications, another broadband service provider, also finished lower, falling 1.69 to 23.25 on Nasdaq, and sinking to a 52-week low intraday. 

 Shares of Canadian broadband services provider 360networks lost 70 cents to 7 on Nasdaq, falling to a 52-week low, after the company late Thursday posted a net loss for its fourth quarter, and reduced guidance for the current year. That prompted a downgrade from Goldman Sachs, along with several other firms. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index finished Friday 65.67 points weaker, a fall of 3.01%, to 2117.70, its lowest finish since Dec. 18, 1998, when it closed at 2086.14. 

 (A report published around 4:36 p.m. EST (2136 GMT) incorrectly said the Nasdaq marked its lowest close since Dec. 22, 1998. In fact, however, Friday's close is below where the Nasdaq ended on Dec. 22, 1998.)

 Stocks end week mixed amid earnings warnings, cheap prices

 NEW YORK (AP) - Enticed by bargain prices and heartened by the possibility of a tax cut, investors did some tentative buying Friday, limiting most of their purchases to safer blue chips. 

 Comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told Congress he favors income tax cuts to reduce federal budget surpluses, helped boost some stocks. Still, another set of profit warnings, including one from software maker Oracle, reminded the market it could be some time before earnings and the economy show signs of substantial improvement. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.17 to close at 10,466.31 after gaining as much as 129 points and falling as much as 148 during the session. For the week, the Dow gained 24.41, a 0.2 percent increase. 

 Broader market indicators, which include many riskier tech stocks, fell. The Nasdaq composite index lost 65.74 to finish at 2,117.63, a level not seen since December 1998. The Nasdaq lost 6.4 percent for the week, giving up 144.88. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 7.05 to 1,234.18, slipping 11.68, or 0.9 percent, for the week. The S&P - with more than a third of its components in tech stocks - is now down 20 percent from the high of 1,552.87 it reached a year ago, which analysts say is a sign that the bear market has spread to the broader market from the technology sector. 

 Analysts didn't expect any of Friday's gains to last and they described investors as cautious. The careful buying was due to the fact that stocks are cheaper following their most recent dive, not because the outlook for profits or the economy has improved. 

 "Until investors have more confidence that we are not going to get blindsided every day by a new wave of companies giving us bad news, the tone of the market will stay as it is - guarded at best," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for First Albany Corp. 

 Defensive stocks - called that because they fare better in a bear market - accounted for much of the Dow's advance. Philip Morris climbed $1.15 to $49.70, while Procter & Gamble rose $1 to $69.65. 

 The Dow's tech components were mostly lower. Hewlett-Packard, however, gained 52 cents to close at $29.52. 

 Among other big tech stocks, Gateway fell 30 cents to $15.45 and Dell rose 56 cents to $22.06. 

 Analysts saw hope in the fact that some tech stocks moved higher while others recovered some of the steep losses they incurred on profit warnings from big-name companies like Oracle. 

 "People were worried that we might get another leg down in the Nasdaq, because of yet another warning from one of the glamour tech stocks, and that just didn't happen," said Richard A. Dickson, a technical analyst at Scott & Stringfellow in Richmond, Va. 

 Software maker Oracle, which issued a profit warning late Thursday, fell nearly 21 percent, down $4.50 at $16.88. 

 Tech stocks' mixed day came from investors being torn between the lure of lower prices and fear generated by earnings warnings, Dickson said. 

 While investors are afraid the Nasdaq is going to keep sliding, Dickson said, they're also thinking, "What if these thing have hit the bottom and I missed the boat?" 

 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was 1.48 billion shares, down slightly from 1.51 billion on Thursday. 

 The Russell 2000 index gained 3.58 to close at 476.88. 

 Overseas markets were mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 lost 0.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 declined 0.9 percent. But Germany's DAX index gained 0.6 percent

 Treasurys Drop Hard As Profit-Taking Rules The Roost

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. government security prices moved sharply lower Friday, as traders and investors took profits following a strong week's performance. 

 An earlier rebound in stock markets also helped push Treasurys lower. Stocks had fallen back into lower territory late in the session, but it was not enough to lift Treasurys out of their hole. 

 The profit-taking followed a week in which Treasurys had racked up some solid gains. Helped by early-week hopes for a between-meeting Federal Reserve rate cut that never materialized and ongoing weakness in stock markets, Treasurys had moved steadily higher. 

 The 10-year note, for example, is currently yielding roughly 4.94% following Friday's sell-off, compared with 5.11% at the end of last week. It had been as low as 4.87% earlier in the session. 

 At 3:45 p.m. EST, the benchmark 10-year note was down 16/32 at 100 14/32 to yield 4.94%. The 30-year bond was down 1 3/32 at 100 4/32 to yield 5.37%. 

 The five-year note was down 9/32 at 104 11/32 to yield 4.71%, while the two-year note was down 4/32 at 100 10/32 to yield 4.46%. 

 The primary influence on Treasurys Friday was the stock market, as it has been for several days. Early in the session, Treasurys had been solidly higher as stocks took an early dive following a high-profile profit warning from softward giant Oracle. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average had been as much as 150 points lower, but has since rebounded, and was recently up 46 at 10496. The Nasdaq also rebounded from its lows, though it was recently down 44 at 2139. 

 An economic reading on consumer sentiment Friday was largely seen as positive for Treasurys, though it had rebounded somewhat from its preliminary mid-month reading. As a result, the number did little to help Treasurys from their Friday fall. 

 The University of Michigan said its February month-end consumer sentiment index declined to 90.6 from 94.7 in January. The university's index for consumer expectations was said to have fallen to 80.8, from 86.4 at January month-end. The reading on the current-conditions index for February was said to have shown a decline to 105.8 from 107.7 at month-end January. 

 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other Fed officials have in recent weeks paid key attention to consumer confidence, fearing that a pullback in consumer spending could worsen economic conditions. Though consumer spending has held up amid falling confidence so far, the Fed is said to be assigning a heightened importance to the data. 

 The market also closely watched Greenspan's Friday testimony before the House Budget Committee, though his remarks were not significantly different from earlier statements. 

 The Fed Chairman noted that the economic slowdown, and weakness in the stock market in particular, presents a risk to current forecasts for future budget surpluses. Greenspan noted that the risk of reverting to a budget deficit is "not negligible." 

 However, he suggested risks to the surplus are not large enough to mitigate the need for tax cuts, which are currently under debate in Washington. 

 "To be sure, unless the current economic weakness reveals a less-favorable relationship between tax receipts income and asset prices than has been assumed in recent projections, receipts should be reasonably well-maintained in the near term, as the effects of earlier gains in asset values continue to feed through with a lag into tax liability," Greenspan said. 

 While trading activity wound down for the weekend, some market-watchers pinned their sights on next week. 

 Economic data next week will be highlighted by Friday's February employment report, as well as a Tuesday reading on January factory orders, and a reading on fourth-quarter productivity. 

 The Fed will also release its Beige Book, an anecdotal report on the economy from the 12 Federal Reserve districts, on Wednesday.

 UPDATE 1-Lawyers file class action against Intershop.

 FRANKFURT, March 1 (Reuters) - German law firm Rotter said on Thursday that together with its U.S. partner Shalov Stone & Bonner it had filed a class action suit in the United States against German software firm Intershop Communications . 

 In a statement, Rotter said the lawyers were representing Intershop shareholders who allege that an Intershop profit warning published in January was late and that investors were misled about the true state of the company's business. 

 "The company, with headquarters in San Francisco, and senior executives are accused of presenting, between May 2000 and January 2001, its market position in the United States to investors far more favourably than it actually was," the Munich-based lawyer said. 

 Intershop on January 2 cut its revenue and earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter of 2000, blaming a global slowdown in technology purchases. 

 The news hammered shares in the company, which were trading down 13.92 percent at 5.38 euros by 1721 GMT. The loss was aggravated by a 5.93 percent fall on the Neuer Markt Nemax 50 index. 

 Intershop is trading 96 percent below its 140.35 euros all-time high hit in March last year. At the end of January, the company posted a net loss of 32.5 million euros for the last quarter of 2000, four times higher than the year-earlier period and coming in worse than the company and the market expected after its shock profit warning earlier that month. 

 Intershop blamed the loss on a disappointing business development in the United States, where the company is struggling to gain market share. 

 In contrast to already reduced forecasts made in December that promissed a return to the black this year, the e-commerce software maker said it would have to endure another net loss in 2001. The company could not be reached immediately for comment.

 POINT OF VIEW: BAE Systems Clears Runway, But Not Doubts

 A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Seatbacks have been returned to the upright position and pilot John Weston assures us the runway before flight BAE Systems (U.BA) is clear. But the question remains: are the passengers on board for what could still prove a turbulent flight? 

 First the good news. There was no bad news. 

 The 2000 numbers released Thursday were broadly in line with market forecasts. That, and the fact that CEO Weston was able to stick to his January outlook indicates a line has been drawn underneath that month's shock profit warning. So, expect flat results next year before signs of growth again from 2002. 

 The numbers will no doubt take some time to work through, but at least they will serve as a solid base for analysts to make projections. Before they were playing with pro forma '99 numbers and BAE Systems' word on restructuring measures and exceptional charges. 

 The cash-flow was also reassuringly strong and debt only eked up, even after the acquisition of two Lockheed Martin (LMT) operations. 

 And the 'but?' 

 Missing was a military export order. BAE Systems' shock warning revolved mainly around a U.K. naval aircraft program, where the company admits it named the wrong price, and orders for its Hawk fighter trainer. In the early morning statement, there was only the promise customers were out there for such products as the Hawk, but sentiment needs to see a deal signed. 

 Despite Weston's assurances the company is now better insulated from similar shortfalls by its increased geographic spread (read here the massive U.S. market) and involvement on numerous key projects, the warning on Hawk and Nimrod made investors aware of the risk in what is a mighty order book. Investors must be asking whether other programs couldn't be canceled or delayed. 

 Another niggle is the possibility of a slowdown in civil aerospace following stronger-than-expected orders. If the slowdown in the U.S. economy persists or spreads, airlines aren't likely to place orders and could even delay deliveries. Although not certain, a downturn for minority-held Airbus (F.ABI) before BAE Systems' defense operations recover fully would be bad timing to say the least. 

 For now, relief BAE Systems has its hands back on the yoke, plus the perceived defensiveness of the stock against the TMT decline, stand to benefit the share price. A recovery to pre-January levels, however, appears unlikely while doubts linger.

 N.Y. Stocks Mostly Higher; IBM Keys Intraday Reversal 

 By Robert O'Brien

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. equities, facing another session of deadening losses, mounted an implausible turnaround in the final hour that allowed some market averages to finish in positive territory for the session. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index finished more than 100 points ahead of its low for the trading session, thanks largely to the contribution of semiconductor stocks. Evidence: the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index, one measure of the group's fortunes, lost nearly 5% at its intraday worst, trading at a low for the last 12 months, before a sprightly recovery wiped out all that loss; the index finished 5.45% higher on the session. 

 The gains came in improbable fashion, led by names such as Applied Micro Circuits, which ended $2.81 higher at $29.56 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, despite admitting, as so many other technology companies have lately, to a weaker profit forecast. 

 Likewise, Lam Research, which owed up to a profit shortfall late Wednesday, jumped 1 to 22.50 on Nasdaq; this despite a 10% intraday decline. 

 "Investors have started to speculate that all the bad news may have been released," Pat Davis, head of Nasdaq trading at PaineWebber, said Thursday, adding, though that he wanted to see some follow-through on this move before he'd agree that anything decisive took place. 

 The one real key to the turnaround appeared to come courtesy of International Business Machines, which mounted an intraday rally that coincided with the reversal of the indexes. Shares had traded 2.40 lower at their intraday low, then turned around, rapidly gaining ground. The stock finished 6.15 points higher on the day at 106.05, nearly 9% above its intraday lows. 

 It's not surprising, of course, that the averages would move in synch with IBM. The stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after all, which narrowed its loss to 45.14 by the close, after having been down 192.39; it finished at 10450.14. From the stock's intraday low to its close, IBM accounted for 55.63 points of the Dow industrial average's move. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index, meanwhile, ended 31.40 points better on the day, ending a two-day skid with the rise of 1.46%; it finished at 2183.23. 

 What IBM did or said, or didn't do or say, was a matter of some conjecture. But traders said the computer giant played a key role in the session. 

 "That really turned the market," Patrick Davis, head of financial trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, said Thursday. "After that, we saw some short-covering, but we also saw some plain-vanilla buying come into the market." 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,479 issues advancing, 1,561 declining and 218 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,276,011,650 shares, compared with 1,174,191,080 Wednesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 625.15, down 1.79. The average price per share fell 11 cents. 

 The volatile trading session came amid some moderation of the recent talk about the need for immediate interest-rate cuts. Economic data released Thursday, including the National Association of Purchasing Management report and February vehicle sales from U.S. auto makers, seemed to show that activity in some sectors of the economy did pick up in February, as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan argued it did during a widely criticized appearance on Capitol Hill Wednesday. 

 General Motors shares added 66 cents Thursday to end at 53.98. But with the data signaling the Fed won't cut rates again before its March 20 policy meeting, other economically sensitive issues struggled. Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, for example, fell 3.15 to 109.60. Wal-Mart lost 1.75 to 48.34. Boeing fell 2.55 to 59.65 in a session where the air carriers that buy its planes fell sharply. 

 A profit warning from US Airways sent shares lower, down 1.05 to 40.25. Salomon Smith Barney cut its first-quarter profit estimates for 11 airlines. Goldman Sachs also made some earnings cuts on the group. 

 AMR lost 1.93 to 31.32. Delta Air Lines fell 1.77 to 40.35. UAL, whose forecasts weren't reduced, nonetheless lost 3.04 to 35.01. 

 Shares of Chevron gained 1.18 to 86.84, while its prospective merger partner Texaco advanced 1.10 to 65.20, after the European Union approved their pending combination; the deal still needs the approval of U.S. authorities. 

 The striking feature of the session, though, proved to be the final-hour flurry from technology issues. Shares of Ciena, which had weakened intraday on profit worries from rival computer networking equipment maker 3Com, erased intraday lows, finishing 6.81 higher at 74 on Nasdaq. 

 3Com itself couldn't wipe out its losses, finishing 1.63 lower at 7.50 on Nasdaq. Broadcom fell in sympathy; 3Com is an important customer of Broadcom's communications chips. Shares fell 1.25 to 48. 

 However, many technology names made real progress in the final hour, including several blue chips that had sunk to 52-week lows this week. JDS Uniphase ended Thursday higher by 2.50 to 29.25, while Siebel Systems jumped 6.38 to 44.63, and Oracle gained 2.38 to 21.38, all on Nasdaq. Broadband network equipment maker ONI Systems ended 16% higher on the session, up 5.31 to 38.94 on Nasdaq. 

 HNC Software gained 6.44 to 29.75 on Nasdaq. The San Diego developer of software for the financial-services sector told analysts on a conference call Wednesday it expects to live up to their projections for the quarter that ends in March. 

 Verisign, Mountain View, Calif., gained 6.31 to 54 on Nasdaq. The company, which coordinates the world's master list of Web addresses, reached a tentative agreement with the nonprofit group that oversees the allocation of Web site names that allows Verisign to keep many of its most lucrative businesses. 

 King Pharmaceuticals fell 3.40 to 42.50. Thomas Weisel Partners started coverage of the Bristol, Tenn., pharmaceuticals concern with a market perform rating, saying it was concerned that sales projections for the company's Altace product, which reduces risk of stroke and heart attack, may be too aggressive. 

 Property/casualty insurers made some progress, perhaps surprisingly, given that many are exposed to sharp losses stemming from the cleanup of Wednesday's earthquake in Washington. But Lehman Brothers argued that, despite some uncertainties, this was an opportunity to buy them after sharp declines Wednesday. Safeco gained 75 cents to 22.50, Hartford Financial Services rose 1.40 to 65, and Allstate advanced 1.14 to 41. 

 Philip Morris ended modestly higher, up 37 cents to 48.55, though it set a 52-week high intraday. Salomon Smith Barney, in a research note, said under current market conditions, managers of growth stock portfolios who formerly owned the stock but dropped it in favor of high-technology positions might resume purchasing the stock for their portfolios. 

 Veritas DCG gained 1.85 to 32. Dain Rauscher Wessels, reacting to the Houston oilfield services provider's better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday, encouraged investors to buy the stock, saying that new business prospects are leading to increased business for Veritas. 

 PacifiCare Health Systems fell 8.22 to 30.91 on Nasdaq. Merrill Lynch said in a report that a cautious stance was warranted on the Santa Ana, Calif., provider of managed care services, due to recent regulatory actions, including a fine from the California Department of Managed Health Care for late payments to doctors and hospitals. 

 True North Communications fell 2.01 to 36.49. The Chicago advertising and communications concern decided late Wednesday to delay the release of its fourth-quarter earnings, originally scheduled to come out Thursday, but insisted that the postponement had nothing to do with its cash position. 

 Williams Cos. gained 1.53 to 43.23. Salomon Smith Barney started coverage of the Tulsa, Okla., gas pipeline and energy services concern with a buy rating.

 US Air 1Q Warning Heralds Tough Times For Airlines

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The first-quarter profit warning just issued by US Airways Group Inc. (U) highlights an ominous trend that's increasingly being felt by the nation's other major carriers: weakening demand for business travel. 

 The loss will likely give the nation's sixth-largest carrier even greater incentives to pursue its planned merger with UAL Corp.'s (UAL) United Airlines. 

 "I really think what's going on with US Airways is reflective of the whole group," said Brian Harris, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. 

 "We're just on the cusp of the full brunt of the economic slowdown catching the airlines," he said. 

 Harris on Wednesday reduced his earnings estimates on most major carriers, including US Air. 

 "A softening in business traffic is something that's happening across the board," said another airline analyst who asked not to be identified. "This is a cyclical issue. It's an issue that everybody is seeing." 

 Shares of major carriers opened sharply lower following the news. 

 US Airways was off $1.40, or 3.39%, at $39.90. UAL recently traded down $2.85, or 7.5%, at $35.20, while AMR Corp. (AMR), parent of American Airlines, was down $1.95, or 5.9%, at $31.30. 

 US Airways, of Arlington, Va., said it expects its first-quarter earnings to be "well below" the consensus estimate of a loss of $1.12 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The carrier also cited "intense" competition from low-cost and large network carriers in the eastern U.S., and continued high fuel costs for its expected losses. 

 In a move that could prompt some businesses to cut back on travel expenditures, the gap between business and leisure fares soared to 4.7 times in February, noted Salomon Smith Barney's Harris. That's just a tad below an all-time high of 4.8 reached in December. 

 "I think that could act as a catalyst for businesses finding ways around high fares," he said. 

 Bob Mann, airline analyst at R.W. Mann & Co. in Port Washington, N.Y., said: "Carriers that are...living at margin on business traveler premiums are one after another sounding some sense of warning at this point." 

 Neither the recent layoffs and profit warnings nor business-related economic indicators "tell a very good story as far as businesses' interest in continuing to spend at high levels for travel," Mann added. 

 Mann said US Air is trying to push its case for the merger by stressing its deteriorating profitability. 

 "This is just the latest in the long series of attempts to show that US Air needs to be in the failing carrier criteria," the analyst said. 

 The airline's campaign started last summer, Mann said, when it briefed members of Congress from Pennsylvania, who concluded that they had to support the merger because they considered US Air to be a failing carrier. 

 "Since that time we've had only three more quarters of (weakness), which suggest the problems are real," Mann said. 

 Before items, US Air lost $1.33 a share in the fourth quarter and $2.33 a share for all of 2000. 

 The recently proposed $3.5 billion acquisition of Trans World Airlines Inc. (TWA) by AMR Corp.'s (AMR) American Airlines has experienced far less resistance in Washington than it could have because TWA likely would have shut down without American's funding. An auction for the carrier in bankruptcy court is slated for Monday. 

 But that isn't to say the latest profit warning from US Air will ease concerns of antitrust regulators, members of Congress and consumer groups over its $11.6 billion acquisition by United. They fear the merger will reduce industry competition and increase air fares. 

 "I don't think (the situation at US Air) really addresses the Justice's concerns, and I don't think it really addresses the consolidation concerns that are out there," Mann said. 

 Raymond Neidl, airline analyst at ING Barings LLC in New York, said: "The only thing I see is maybe (the profit warning) gives greater incentives to have the merger go through." 

 "It is a carrier that is losing money, and it appears that it's still losing cash," he said. 

 US Airways spokesman David Castelveter and United spokesman Chris Brathwaite each declined to comment on the impact of the profit warning on their merger plans. 

 Adding to US Air's woes, low-fare carriers such as AirTran Holdings Inc. (AAI), Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV), JetBlue Airways Corp. (X.JTB) and Delta Air Lines Inc.'s (DAL) Delta Express are all expanding in markets served by the airline, analysts said. 

 "They're even starting to take the discretionary business away" from US Air, said R.W. Mann's Mann. 

 ING's Neidl said "I just don't see a turnaround with their high-cost structure and (with) low-cost airlines coming into their territory." 

 Salomon's Harris expects other Wall Street analysts to also reduce their 2001 earnings estimates on airlines. 

 Goldman Sachs & Co. Thursday slashed its forecasts for Delta, AMR, Northwest Airlines Corp. (NWAC), US Airways, Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK) and America West Holdings Corp. (AWA). 

 "It's going to be tough for the airline stocks to perform well until the spate of downside revisions subsides," Harris predicted.

 SMARTMONEY.COM: Can AMD's Ride Continue?

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- During the transition weeks between winter and spring, there's always one especially tenacious flower that breaks through the chilly ground first. It's a nice reminder that the thaw really will come and skies will get sunny again. From the looks of it, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is this season's early bloomer in the world of technology. 

 When we picked Intel's (INTC) feisty rival for our annual 'Where to Invest' portfolio back in November, we were looking for names that appeared to be cheap in sectors with superior growth prospects. AMD had gotten hammered in the late-2000 technology selloff and was sitting at a silly seven times forward earnings, despite projected annual earnings growth in the 16% range. 

 Soon after the magazine appeared on newsstands in mid-December, AMD joined a host of other tech companies and issued a profit warning because of slow PC sales and a lackluster holiday season. But since then it's been almost all uphill. 

 Year-to-date the stock is up more than 50%, which is especially impressive when you consider that the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is down 6% due to the industry's massive inventory correction and the overall economic slowdown. What's that tell you? That true bargains will eventually find buyers even in the worst of markets. AMD's basement dwelling valuation in December was simply a mistake relative to its impressive line of products and flawless execution on the manufacturing front. 

 'The overall semiconductor business is doing fairly poorly. However, as a company, AMD is doing quite well,' says Needham & Co. analyst Dan Scovel. 'Competitively, against Intel, its seems to be more than holding its own at this point.' 

 AMD, of course, does battle against one of the world's most formidable companies and over the years it has made more than its share of mistakes. But things have changed with its Athlon line of microprocessors. Employing a different architecture than Intel's chips, the Athlon is considered by many in the industry to offer the best balance of performance and price. Not only that, but Athlon processors can be used with two different types of memory interfaces, while Intel's high-end offering, the Pentium 4, currently only uses one. AMD's product lineup is gradually nibbling at Intel's massive market share. And it's widely viewed as the strongest it's ever been. 

 'I think from a processor standpoint, [AMD] is firing on all cylinders,' says Robertson Stephens analyst Eric Rothdeutsch. 

 Another key to AMD's recent success is the way it got its new manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany, up and running. 'Flawless execution' is a phrase often bandied about when analysts refer to that ramp. The Dresden fab uses some cutting-edge chip-making technology that allows the company to easily migrate to higher-performance processors. 

 Meanwhile, Intel has made more than its share of flubs lately. From misjudging demand back in 1999 and not producing enough chips, to rushing the Pentium 4 to market too soon (so it could compete with AMD's Athlon offering), analysts say Intel left some doors wide open for its competitor to walk through. 

 Nevertheless, says Drew Peck, a Wall Street Journal All-Star analyst at SG Cowen, 'Intel is not likely to stand by and allow the company to take market share indefinitely. I give AMD a lot of credit for their execution. They've done an excellent job. Nonetheless, in the end, Intel dictates the level of profitability in that business and if they want to bury AMD, they still have the wherewithal to do it.' 

 What's that mean from an investment perspective? Well, at 11.6 times fiscal 2001 earnings projections, AMD is certainly not the bargain it once was, but it still trades at a big discount to Intel's multiple of 27.5 and the S&P 500's average of 23. For that reason, it retains a lot of diehard fans on Wall Street. Robertson Stephens' Rothdeutsch still recommends AMD over Intel on the strength of its product lineup. And assuming the industry's fundamentals pick up with time, the recovery should lift all boats - and continue to benefit AMD. 

 Of course, AMD still has its first quarter to worry about. The company said in December that sales would be flat. And in this environment, another warning could deflate the stock in a heartbeat. For that reason, a true value investor might want to take a look at our other 'Where to Invest' chip pick: Texas Instruments (TXN), which has suffered a 37% decline since the first of the year. 

 On Monday, the news got worse. Citing ongoing lackluster demand for technology gear in this economic slowdown, TI warned that first quarter results would fall far short of expectations. Revenue should drop 20% sequentially, instead of a previously expected 10% decline. Management also expects the company's pro-forma operating margin to decline six to eight percentage points, instead of an earlier estimate for a five- to six-point drop. Despite these bumps, several analysts still consider TI a core holding. And at 35 time 2001 earnings, it's trading below its five-year average of 41 and 70% off a 52-week high hit last March. 

 The good news is that the company's strength in digital-signal processors should make it one of the best positioned companies in the chip business when spending for communications-equipment resumes. 'This is a cyclical industry,' Rothdeutsch says of the chip business. 'This is a down cycle and things will recover. For as bad as things look right now, they will get better.' 

 A fitting sentiment for the season...and the sector.

 United Airlines Pres - Interview

 BILL GRIFFETH, CNBC ANCHOR, POWER LUNCH: United Airlines, the nation`s largest carrier, today announcing a multimillion dollar high tech upgrade for its airports. The renovations seek to include self-check kiosks, all designed to make the airport experience less of a hassle when travelers are disrupted, you know, all those canceled flights and delayed flights we`ve been hearing about in the last few years and we`ve experienced in many cases. Despite some positive news from United, the entire airline sector is under selling pressure today on the heels of a profit warning from US Airways, which, as you know, UAL wants to buy. And some negative analysts` comments out from Goldman Sachs has put some added some pressure on that sector today. 

 But joining us to talk about that and many other things is the President of United Airlines, President Rono Dutta, joining us from a Chicago O`Hare. Good to see you. Thank you for joining us today, sir. 

 RONO DUTTA, PRESIDENT, UAL AND UNITED AIRLINES: Thank you Bill and good morning. 

 GRIFFETH: Tell me about these innovations. You know, you are acknowledging, as we all know, that travelers get caught when there is a canceled flight or delayed flights for whatever reasons. What are you trying to do to ease the pain of that? 

 DUTTA: Well, Bill, we recognize fully that air travel has become very stressful in the past few years. And I would say in the last three years we focused our products in the air and we`ve put in a last class, a first class suite, we have a business class, economy class. So a lot of investments in the air. Now we are turning our attention to the ground. And what we presented today was integrated plan to improve the airport experience. And I think there are three essential elements to that. One is proactive recovery. When your flight doesn`t leave on time, what happens? We want to take control instead of you having to find your way through the chaos that happens. And the second thing I would say is giving you a lot more information than we have done before. 

 GRIFFETH: So I mean you have got these kiosks you are setting up. What will I find there when I get there? 

 DUTTA: When you get there you, if you have an e-ticket and you are traveling domestically, you can check yourself in 20 seconds instead of waiting in line. And I would stress again, the kiosk is about one eighth of everything that I`m presenting today. 

 GRIFFETH: What more information will be available to me as a traveler to tell me either why I have got a delay or a cancellation and what I can do in lieu of the flight that`s just been cancelled? 

 DUTTA: OK, we will display now why the flight was delayed. We will give you alternatives of what flights you can present yourself on and give you more information on where are you on the list and are you going to make it to number five or number 20 and so forth. 

 GRIFFETH: This deals with a problem we`re all dealing with right now, but what can we do to solve the problem of the overcrowded skies that are causing a lot of the travel delays? 

 DUTTA: The real answer, Bill, is more capacity. What has happened is in this country there has been very little attention paid to additional runways, additional track ways, and I am delighted President Bush came out and said we need to build more runways. We need more runways in San Francisco and in Chicago and a number of other cities and that`s the only real, true solution. 

 GRIFFETH: Let me ask you about some other issues that you`re facing right now. US Airways, the company you want to buy, has announced it will not meet earnings targets for the first quarter. The labor problems continue. Your senior management team is meeting with labor leaders in Washington at this hour to deal with the US Airways situation. The stock price sit today around $41 when the deal you cut with them, it was around $60, meaning that maybe Wall Street doesn`t think this could happen. Where do you stand right now on US Airways and is it possible that the structure of the deal could be changed in light now of the these earnings warnings from the carrier? 

 DUTTA: A number of questions there, but let`s start with US Air. We very much want to complete this transaction. We are not thinking of restructuring the deal at this time. The profit warning that came out I think is an industry wide softness that we are seeing. Speaking for United, our load factors have held up very well and we are seeing all leisure travelers. But on the business side we, too, are seeing some softness. 

 GRIFFETH: You were not among the airlines that were downgraded today, by the way. But is it possible that you will be providing new guidance to Wall Street at some points as a result of what`s going on here in the first quarter? 

 DUTTA: We have no plans in the next couple of days to do that. But clearly we will be monitoring our February results and at that point if necessary we will make some announcements. 

 GRIFFETH: What are you hoping to get from labor leaders in Washington on the US Airways deal? Is that a potential deal breaker, if they are not willing to come to the table a little more on this? I mean, you know, the whole industry is having labor problems right now. There could be walk out this spring, as you well know. 

 DUTTA: You are right. This industry is going through a difficult time. We talked about the air traffic problem. But equally there is a labor situation that is brewing in almost every major airline. But no, I don`t believe those are deal breakers and we are talking to them about some fencing agreement of how the seniority gets integrated. But I believe those will be deal breakers. 

 GRIFFETH: And what is your assessment of the airline industry right now? Obviously, the first quarter has been tough. Other industries feel the first half of this year will continue to see softness. That will affect your business as far as the business travel lower goes, but they hope the second half is better. What`s your view of your industry in 2001? 

 DUTTA: Clearly, we are very a cyclical business. We are highly dependent on business traffic and to the extent corporations cut back on business travel it does hurt the airline industry. We are hoping it recovers quickly but I don`t think there are any guarantees that there is going to be a bounce back in six months. We are hoping for that. 

 GRIFFETH: But you don`t see that happening right now is what you`re saying? 

 DUTTA: It is too early to tell. I think I will rely on Mr. Greenspan to give us the assurance that things are going to recover quickly. We`ll just sit back and wait. 

 GRIFFETH: Mr. Dutta, nice see you. Thank you. 

 DUTTA: Thank you again, Bill. 

 GRIFFETH:  Rono Dutta, the president of United Airlines, joining us today from O`Hare, of course, in Chicago.

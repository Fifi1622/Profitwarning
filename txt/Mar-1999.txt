 PeopleSoft's Latest Warning Sparks Concern About ERP Software Sector

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- PeopleSoft Inc., a developer of so-called enterprise resource planning, or ERP, software, Wednesday issued another warning for its fiscal first quarter, prompting analysts to cast further doubts about the overall ERP sector. 

 In active trading on the Nasdaq Stock MArket, PeopleSoft's once-highflying shares (PSFT) fell 93.8 cents, or 6%, to close at $14.625. Earlier, the shares traded as low as $14.563, below the previous 52-week low of $15.125 set March 24. The stock traded as high as $57.438 last April. 

 PeopleSoft, which issued a warning in January, Wednesday warned that weak software-licensing sales will have an even greater impact on its revenue and profit margins than previously expected. It expects revenue of $275 million to $305 million, compared with the year-ago level of $277.7 million. 

 Peoplesoft's previous estimate for 1999 was that revenue would grow 20% to 30%. The company posted fiscal 1998 earnings of 61 cents a share, excluding charges, on revenue of $1.3 billion. 

 Analysts have slashed their 1999 and 2000 earnings estimates for Peoplesoft. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Chuck Phillips cut his 1999 estimate to 12 cents a share from 55 cents. He expects 1999 revenue to be flat at $1.3 billion. For fiscal 2000, he expects the company to earn 17 cents a share, down from his prior estimate of 65 cents, on revenue of $1.56 billion. 

 PeopleSoft, like others in the sector, posted a huge jump in revenue between 1997 and 1998 as customers bought software to upgrade their systems and prepare for the "year 2000" computer glitch all at once. But sales have weakened and customers are taking longer to close license agreements, the company said. It didn't provide a profit forecast, citing uncertainty in current market conditions. 

 The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company first warned in January that first-quarter results would fall short of analysts' estimates and announced job cuts. But investors were relieved to learn at the time that the company wouldn't have to restate results from 1996 to 1998 after a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into acquisition-related charges. 

 Meanwhile, the company's management ranks have been shaken up. The company is looking for a new president to replace founder David Duffield, who remains chairman and chief executive. It also appointed former senior vice president, Aneel Bhusri, to vice chairman. 

 ERP software makes it easier for firms to manage their finance, human resource, manufacturing and other operations. The software helps users with everything from better sales forecasting to reducing inventory and quickly spotting parts shortages. 

 PeopleSoft is one of four world leaders in the ERP segment. The other major players are German giant SAP AG (SAP), Dutch company Baan Co. NV (BAANF) and database giant Oracle Corp. (ORCL). Cracks in the once-burgeoning market appeared last fall when Baan issued a third-quarter warning. Later, SAP and PeopleSoft posted disappointing fourth-quarter profits and said 1999 revenue growth would be slower than 1998. J.D. Edwards & Co. (JDEC), another ERP concern, last month warned of weaker-than-expected earnings. And, earlier this month, Oracle reported disappointing ERP software growth. 

 "Classic ERP is pretty much dead," Phillips said. "The trick is to find new markets and who can execute and get to the new markets faster." Most companies that have a use for ERP software have already bought the products, Phillips said, estimating market penetration at 65% among the larger companies that rely on these products. 

 "The only difference between the 1999 ERP market and the Titanic was that the Titanic had a band," said Bruce Richardson, vice president, research strategy, at AMR Research Inc. The Boston firm predicts 20% to 25% growth for the ERP market this year, down from 40% to 45% in 1998. 

 The ERP market will be "in hibernation" for the first six months of the year, Richardson said. "If you're counting on big multimillion dollars orders from big first time customers, forget about it." 

 In the past, ERP software companies were able to sell their products to companies who needed to update their computer systems to be year 2000 compliant. But because of the lengthy installation requirements for these products - and the looming year 2000 deadline - there isn't enough time for companies to buy software for those purposes. 

 Also, customers' priorities have "shifted very dramatically to embrace the Internet, and none of the big ERP players really have the right products in place given that change," said NationsBanc Montgomery Securities analyst Bob Austrian.

 FOCUS-RMC 1998 profits down, more buys seen.

 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - British building materials firm RMC Group Plc on Wednesday reported its profits fell in line with a January warning and said it expects to complete a number of acquisitions in 1999. 

 RMC, one of the world's biggest ready mixed concrete producers said its pre-tax profits fell to 264.5 million pounds ($425.4 million) in the year ended December 31, 1998 compared with 307.6 million pounds in the previous year. 

 That was in line with a profit warning from the company in January, which cautioned investors that a difficult German market would keep 1998 pre-tax profits before exceptions below 265 million pounds. 

 "Germany was the big decline. If you strip out currency translation effects and the impact of disposals, I think our profits (there) were down about 34 percent," said RMC Finance Director Robert Lambourne in an interview with Reuters after the results were announced. 

 And RMC said in an outlook posted with the results statement that Germany was not expected to fare any better this year. 

 "In Germany, there has been a slow start to the year and the outlook is uncertain," RMC said in its earnings statement. 

 But in spite of the lower 1998 earnings, RMC shares rose 5.89 percent to 799 pence a share by midsession. 

 Analysts said RMC's cost-cutting programme, the company's 1998 results presentation to analysts and the announcement of two new U.S. acquisitions on Wednesday indicated a reduction in the 1999 impact of a poor trading environment in Germany. 

 "It doesn't really seem to be getting any worse," said Mike Foster, analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities. 

 However, Foster said he remained cautious on RMC shares because investors will have to wait to see a more clear indication from the company about the state of its business in Germany and because returns on cement acquisitions generally take some time to appear. 

 RMC's Lambourne also told Reuters the company had up to 500 million pounds to steam ahead with an acquisition programme to add to its 24-country empire. 

 "We made over 21 acquisitions in 1998, so I think it is inevitable that we will have a number of acquisitions in the year," he said. 

 He could not forecast where the company would be looking, but the two U.S. purchases have helped to position RMC to take better advantage of a six-year US$200 billion U.S. government backed national infrastructure spending programme there, known as TEA-21. 

 "We are still looking in the (United) States. There are some more opportunities out there that we are looking at and we have a number of opportunities in Europe," Lambourne said. 

 RMC said it completed the acquisition of privately-held U.S. companies Jobe Concrete Products Inc and Reno Sparks Ready Mix Inc for 46.2 million pounds ($74.54 million) cash and assumption of net debt of 25.9 million pounds. 

 ($1=.6218 Pound).

 LONDON, March 31 (Reuters) - British building materials firm RMC Group Plc said on Wednesday that it expects to complete a number of acquisitions in 1999. 

 RMC Finance Director Robert Lambourne told Reuters in an interview that RMC, one of the world's biggest suppliers of ready mixed concrete, could spend up to 500 million pounds ($804.8 million) to add companies to its 24-country empire in 1999. 

 "We made over 21 acquisitions in 1998, so I think it is inevitable that we will have a number of acquisitions in the year," Labourne said. 

 He could not forecast where the company was looking, but two purchases announced on Wednesday were in the United States and have helped to position RMC to take better advantage of a six-year US$200 billion U.S. government backed national infrastructure spending programme there, known as TEA-21. 

 "We are still looking in the (United) States. There are some more opportunities out there that we are looking at and we have a number of opportunities in Europe," Lambourne said. 

 RMC said on Wednesday it completed the acquisition of privately-held U.S. companies Jobe Concrete Products Inc and Reno Sparks Ready Mix Inc for 46.2 million pounds ($74.54 million) cash and assumption of net debt of 25.9 million pounds. 

 Lambourne referred to a Wednesday earnings statement when asked about RMC's outlook on Germany, the area which caused it to issue a profit warning in January. 

 "In Germany, there has been a slow start to the year and the outlook is uncertain," RMC said in the statement. 

 RMC reported on Wednesday pre-tax profits of 264.5 million pounds in the year ended December 31, 1998 compared with 307.6 million pounds in the previous year. It said in a January trading statement that its 1998 pre-tax profits before exceptions would not exceed 265 million pounds. 

 "Germany was the big decline. If you strip out currency translation effects and the impact of disposals, I think our profits (there) were down about 34 percent," he said.

 Coke Again Cuts Forecast for Volume ---- News of Up to 2%  Decline  Stuns Investors; Overseas Turmoil Blamed

 Coca-Cola Co., jarring investors for the third time in six months, said world-wide case volume in the first quarter is expected to "decline slightly." 

 The news stunned analysts who had already ratcheted down their forecasts in anticipation of a weak quarter but were still expecting volume to rise 1% to 2%. 

 Coke on Monday said world-wide volume, a key measure of the underlying business, will instead decline by 1% to 2%, with every international division -- Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa -- expected to drop. Even North America, a safe harbor for Coke amid the overseas turmoil, eked out a mere 2% volume increase, as higher prices hurt unit sales. 

 "Ouch," said Jennifer Solomon, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, who has been urging investors to buy Coke stock since December. "This is very weak across the board; we thought the worst was behind them -- we're surprised to see this much deterioration from the fourth quarter." 

 If the news had been announced before the close of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average might not have closed above 10000. Coke is one of the stocks in the 30 industrials. Coke stock, buoyed by Monday's stock-market surge, rose $1.875 to $67.1875 in primary trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But in composite trading after 4 p.m., Coke shares were down 50 cents from Friday's close, at $64.8125. At midday Tuesday, the stock was trading lower at $62.75. 

 The Dow Jones industrials are calculated on primary New York Stock Exchange trading, and every $1 move has about an impact of about 4.44 points on the index. 

 A Coke spokesman said the industrial average's run to 10000 had "absolutely no" bearing on the company's decision to release its news after the close of primary trading -- instead of early morning as is the company's practice. Many of the numbers, the spokesman noted, came in from various parts of the world over the weekend, and Coke executives worked during the day to compile and calculate data. "We didn't have the information earlier," he added. 

 The spokesman blamed the overseas turmoil, coupled with tough comparisons compared with a year ago, for the results. In the year-earlier quarter, Coke's world-wide volume rose 14%. He also acknowledged that "it will be a challenge" for Coke to hit its target of increasing annual world-wide volume by 7% to 8% this year. Coke officials only two months ago had reiterated that goal. 

 While many analysts had already expected Coke to miss that goal, Monday's news damps the view of bulls. While most analysts are still counting on a comeback, it is increasingly clear that the rebound will have to be massive to erase the weakness in the first half. 

 Indeed, several analysts said they expected to trim their earnings estimates even further. The company first issued a profit and volume warning in September, followed by another one in December. Most analysts had already reduced their earnings estimates to 31 cents a share for the first quarter, a 9% decline from the year-earlier quarter, and $1.45 for the full year, a 2% increase over 1998. 

 The continuing weakness comes at a particularly bad time for Coke. The softdrink giant's $1.85 billion bid to acquire the rights to Cadbury Schweppes PLC's beverage brands in 120 overseas countries is facing mounting antitrust scrutiny from various governments, a sign that Coke has a protracted regulatory battle on its hands. 

 Regulators in Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Mexico, Spain and a host of other countries are investigating the transaction, and a series of rulings is expected shortly. Analysts were rattled Friday when a Mexican antitrust official told reporters that the country's Federal Competition Commission would reject the deal. 

 Cadbury's Mexican business accounts for about 15% of the 600 million unit cases Coca-Cola hopes to acquire. A potential rejection by Mexico startled analysts, since Cadbury's market share there is only 4% (compared with 68% for Coke), and, as such, the deal wasn't expected to draw much scrutiny. 

 Coke and Cadbury executives said they hadn't been "officially notified" of a decision from Mexico's antitrust body. If there is such a decision, a Coke spokesman cautioned, "it would be of a preliminary nature and subject to further discussion." Both sides said they remained confident that the deal will be completed. 

 A Coke spokesman said the company has received approval for the Cadbury transaction from "several countries" and "positive signals" from others; however, he declined to identify those countries. 

 William Pecoriello, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that, "given the complexity and number of countries involved," it seems increasingly unlikely for the transaction to be consummated before July. 

 That is bad news for Coke, because Wall Street analysts had hoped for quick approval, as the added case volume would provide a badly needed lift to Coke's battered overseas business. "Given the current weak volume outlook for Coke, the timing of additional volume acquired through acquisitions is paramount," says Michael Branca, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. 

 Industry executives and analysts said a negative signal from Mexican regulators could embolden antitrust authorities in other countries to block the deal, seek concessions, or at the very least, mire the transaction in red tape. 

 In France, Coke has tried for 16 months to get approval for its $880 million acquisition of Orangina from Pernod Ricard SA.

 Wall Street Cuts  Profit  Outlook For Coke After Case-Volume  Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Several securities analysts Tuesday cut their near-term and full-year earnings estimates for Coca-Cola Co. after the soft drink maker warned that first-quarter world-wide case volume may decline, instead of increasing as many analysts had expected. 

 The mean estimate of 15 analysts who follow the Atlanta-based company is now 28 cents a share, according to Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call. Before the announcement, which Coke made late Monday, the mean estimate was 30 cents a share. 

 The mean estimate for full-year 1999 has also been lowered, to $1.41 a share from $1.47, Hill said. And estimates for the year 2000 have been trimmed by five cents to $1.64, though Hill said that number may still change since not all analysts have reported their estimates for that year. 

 The new projections suggest that Coke will show a drop in first-quarter earnings and only slight profit growth for the year. In the first quarter last year, the company earned 34 cents; 1998 profits were $1.40 a share. 

 Coke said Monday it expects a drop in the "mid-single digit range." The company anticipates weakened customer demand in many parts of Latin America and increased volatility in Russia to hurt volume. Case volume represents actual sales of Coca-Cola in stores and is considered an important indicator of a soft-drink company's underlying business. 

 Those predictions fall far short of the company's historical growth patterns of 6% to 7%. In the year-ago first quarter, cash volume jumped 14%. 

 William Pecoriello of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. was among those analysts who shaved estimates Tuesday. "The pressure on Coke's business due to weak economic conditions around the globe is greater than we anticipated," Pecoriello wrote in a morning research note to investors. 

 The analyst cut his 1999 earnings estimate to $1.40 from $1.46 to reflect the lower-than-anticipated global volume performance, which the company attributes to economic weakness in weakness in foreign markets across the board. Coke estimates a drop in volume of about 1% to 2%. Analysts, like Pecoriello for example, had been expecting growth of 1% to 2% in the quarter. 

 Pecoriello also sees the volume pressure continuing into the year. He now expects flat volume growth in the second quarter, compared to his earlier view of 2% growth. 

 As a result of the global volume weakness and the pressure it will likely put on earnings, a few analysts have also lowered their overall investment opinions on the stock. 

 Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs & Co. cut his rating to "market perform" from "recommend" list. Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney lowered her rating to "neutral" from "buy" and said, "Hopefully the second quarter won't be as bad." 

 Jack Maxwell of Davenport & Co. was actually the only analyst who had a "sell" recommendation on the stock before the announcement. In general, sell recommendations are very rare, Hill said. Maxwell had also had a 1999 earnings view of $1.40 a share. "I think he was on to something," Hill said. 

 Coke's shares were among the most active issues trading on the Big Board Tuesday. Coke, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was down $2.063, or 3.2%, at $62.75 in afternoon trading on volume of 7.9 million, compared with the daily average of around four million. 

 Last week, Merrill Lynch & Co. cut its first-quarter and full-year volume and earnings estimates, by one cent to 31 cents a share and by five cents to $1.45 a share, respectively.

 Investors Snap Up Protein Design Shares After Recent Price Drop

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Protein Design Labs Inc. rebounded Monday after hitting a 52-week low Friday, with the company citing the stock's low valuation. 

 The Mountain View, Calif., biotechnology firm's shares closed up $2.875, or 21%, at $16.313 on Nasdaq volume of 252,000, compared with average volume of 169,900. On Friday, the shares sank to a 52-week low of $13.375. 

 The stock's rise Monday was bolstered by a large block trade of 50,000 shares, noted Robert L. Kirkman, Protein Design's vice president for business development and corporate communications. 

 "Somebody realized that this was a significant buying opportunity," he said. 

 Several analysts agreed that investors appeared to be taking advantage of Friday's price decline to buy into the company. 

 "The stock got ridiculously cheap and ridiculously oversold," said Eric Ende, a Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst. 

 He attributed last week's weakness in the stock to a negative profitwarning announced March 23 by Pathogenesis Corp. (PGNS), a Seattle biotechology company. Pathogenesis estimated a first-quarter loss of 30 cents a share, citing stagnant sales of TOBI, its primary lung disease treatment. 

 "People started to look for other companies that had the potential of preannouncing revenues shortfall," Ende said. 

 Protein Design develops so-called monoclonal antibodies used in genetically engineered drugs sold by other pharmaceutical companies. 

 In terms of revenue, CIBC Oppenheimer Corp. analyst Matt Gellar expects Protein Design to report a strong first quarter for its three products, Zenapax, a kidney rejection drug; Herceptin, a breast cancer drug sold by Genentech Inc.; and Synagis, a respiratory disease drug sold by MedImmune Inc. 

 Gellar said the company should receive royalties of 14% this year on Zenapax under a marketing agreement with Roche Holding AG. 

 "People are beginning to think about the revenues (Protein Design) will be getting," he said. 

 He speculated that Protein Design might enter into "quite a lot" of partnerships in the near future. 


Kirkman said the company anticipates more partnerships this year, but
declined to comment on their timing or nature.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Protein Design Labs Inc. (PDLI) bounced back 19% from a 52-week low Friday, with the company citing the stock's low valuation. 

 The Mountain View, Calif., biotechnology firm's shares recently traded at 16, up 2 9/16, on Nasdaq volume of 216,200, compared with average volume of 169,900. On Friday, the shares sank to a 52-week low of 13 3/8. 

 The stock's rise Monday was bolstered by a large block trade of 50,000 shares, noted Robert L. Kirkman, Protein Design's vice president for business development and corporate communications. 

 "Somebody realized that this was a significant buying opportunity," he said. 

 Several analysts agreed that investors appeared to be taking advantage of Friday's price decline to buy into the company.

 FOCUS-BHP  profit  drop sparks dividend  warning .

 MELBOURNE, March 26 (Reuters) - A steep third quarter profit slide forced Australian resources giant The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd to warn on Friday that if conditions did not improve it might cut its dividend for the first time in 57 years. 

 Ravaged by ailing commodity markets, BHP reported an 83 percent slump in operating profit to A$46 million for the three months to end-February 1999 from the same quarter last year, as expected by the market. 

 "The results are certainly unacceptable," its new American managing director Paul Anderson told analysts. 

 He said weak commodity prices alone had wiped out A$280 million in the steel, minerals and energy group's earnings, and the outlook was no better, but the company would have to work smarter to improve its performance. 

 "These changes will not happen overnight. Market conditions could mean the situation gets worse before it gets better," he said. 

 Although the group held its quarterly dividend at 26 cents, with profits and cash flow falling the former self-titled "Big Australian" said it would review its payout and dividend buyback plan, under which most shareholders have bought new BHP shares at a discount instead of taking cash, diluting the company's equity. 

 Analysts said the move was necessary, but considered it a drastic shift for a company which had maintained or increased the size of its dividend since 1942. 

 "The dividend counts for a lot. It's a signal on the health of the company, and a lot of investors and investment strategies have that as a core criteria," said John Bugg, resources analyst for Macquarie Investment Management. 

 Anderson, who began as managing director last December, said long term he expected to be able to support dividends through earnings but did not like seeing the company's equity diluted through the dividend buybacks. 

 Anderson has wasted no time in trying to change the face of BHP, which was already selling assets and cutting costs before he joined. 

 He said his top priority now was to decide before the end of May on the fate of the company's U.S. copper assets, which it acquired for A$3 billion in 1996 but has since written down about two-thirds of its value. 

 Several other assets are under review, but Anderson said it was too early to review the cost-plagued hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant in Western Australia, which produced its first briquettes last month but has not begun commercial sales. 

 Anderson said the highlight of the third quarter was the change he had wrought at the company. 

 "I feel very good about the progress we've made in terms of organising the company, in terms of positioning, in terms of cultural changes we're making," he said. 

 Investors have backed him all the way, pulling BHP's share price from a six-year low below A$11 last December to an eight-month high close of A$14.25 on Friday despite the bleak profit outlook. 

 "Management changes and restructuring, asset sales and stemming losses, those are the key things," said a Sydney-based analyst, one of many who expects the company's full year profit to be around 40 percent of last year's A$1.3 billion at best.

 Building material companies to report softer 1998.

 LONDON, March 26 (Reuters) - Three British building materials producers will report weak 1998 results next week after trading in some parts of Europe, Asia and Latin America hurt profits, while American economic strength buoyed them. 

 Analysts said Blue Circle Industries  will report lower pre-tax, pre-exception profits, RMC Group Plc  results will fall in line with a January profit warning and Rugby Group Plc  profits are expected to be nearly flat. 

 The consensus of a Reuters poll of analysts said Blue Circle will report pre-tax pre-exception profits fell to 320.5 million pounds ($521.2 million) in the year ended December 31, 1998 compared with 342 million pounds in the previous year. 

 Blue Circle is expected to say that trading was hit hard by a downturn for its businesses in Malaysia and Chile where it made acquisitions in 1998. Both those geographic areas have been hit hard by international financial crises over the last year, reducing trade and cutting profits exposed to currency risks. 

 "The figures will be down on last year," said Kevin Cammack, analyst at Merrill Lynch in London. "The depression on the numbers is mainly Asia and to a lesser extent Chile." 

 But he said Blue Circle will have the poor performance in its emerging markets partially offset by strength in the U.S. building market, where Blue Circle sold its bathrooms division for 253 million pounds earlier this year. 

 Strength in building materials as a result of the booming U.S. economy will also provide some aid for RMC Group, who issued a profit warning in January as a result of poor trading conditions in Germany. 

 The consensus of analysts in the Reuters poll forecast that RMC will on Wednesday report pre-tax profits of 264.2 million pounds for the year ended December 31, 1998 compared with 307.6 million in the year earlier period. 

 They said there were few if any surprises expected to come from RMC's 1998 results after it said in January that it planned to cut 200 jobs in Germany and that RMC's pre-tax pre-exceptional profits would not exceed 265 million pounds. 

 Analysts said the focus will shift to RMC's 1999 outlook and and speculation over whether the company will join a bidding battle for Swedish rival Scancem AB . 

 "The outlook for the UK appears to be stable, with flat demand likely in the ready-mix market but real price improvements in the aggregates market," said Simon Brown, analyst with Williams De Broe in a research note on RMC. 

 Brown said U.S. trading results were likely to be better than others, showing volume growth, strong prices across the products range and good prospects for RMC's new concrete factory in Florida. 

 Polled analysts also said Rugby Group Plc will on Tuesday report pre-tax profits of 73.88 million for the year ending December 31, 1998 compared with 77 million pounds in the previous year 

 They said the key to Rugby's earnings this year will be any announcement on efforts to concentrate on the stronger-earning heavy building materials side, such as aggregates and dispose of assets in light building materials, like timbers. 

 "You are going to have very flat profits, probably a bit down on last year," said Merrill's Cammack. "The critical thing is if they announce anything on the disposal side." 

 Cammack said it remains to be seen whether Rugby will be able to refashion its business with any speed. 

 "Strategically that's what they have set out to do achieve," he said. "Whether they can do it in the short-term is contingent on there being buyers for the assets."

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Blue chips traded mixed Wednesday as investors
continued to remain cautious about corporate earnings.


 The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10 to 9661 in midafternoon trading. The Standard & Poor's 500-Index rose 0.38 to 1262.52 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index edged down 1.20 to 594.30. Declining issues outpaced advancers 1,474 to 1,336 on the Big Board, as volume reached 505 million shares. 

 Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 3.90 to 2326.70. 

 Networking-equipment maker 3Com issued an earnings report after the market closed Tuesday that exceeded diminished expectations, but raised questions about the extent of 3Com's recovery from the stumbles associated with the U.S. Robotics acquisition. The Santa Clara, Calif., company said it earned 24 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter, compared with 4 cents a share in the same period a year earlier. Analysts had expected 3Com to earn 23 cents a share, after the company warned in early March of disappointing results. Shares of 3Com inched up 5/16 to 23 15/16. 

 Some investors took comfort from talk in the market early Wednesday that Goldman Sachs & Co. market strategist Abby Joseph Cohen had bumped her estimates for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 for the year from 9850 to 10300 and from 1275 to 1325, respectively. Cohen could not be reached to comment. 

 America Online dropped 5 3/8 to 115 5/8. Brown Brothers Harriman downgraded its short-term investment rating on the Dulles, Va., Internet provider to neutral from buy. 

 International Business Machines jumped 2 1/8 to 167 1/2. The Armonk, N.Y., computer giant said it will sell disk drives to EMC over the next five years in a deal valued at $3 billion, chalking up its second multibillion-dollar supply deal this month. Shares of Hopkinton, Mass., ECM rose 1 3/4 to 115 5/8. 

 Seagate Technology, which also makes disk drives, slipped 1 1/8 to 27 on the news. 

 Comdisco slipped 1/2 to 15 3/4. The Rosemont, Ill., mainframe-leasing company is expected to announce that it will sell its portfolio of mainframe leases and leave a medical-equipment business to focus on leasing and computer services. The company is expected to take a $150 million pretax charge for writedowns and restructuring, resulting in a net loss of about $53 million, or 35 cents a share, for the fiscal second quarter ending March 31. 

 Burlington Resources jumped 1 3/16 to 39 11/16. Merrill Lynch & Co. named the Houston energy holding company to its "focus one" stock list. 

 Micron Technology rose 2 to 52 5/8. ABN Amro started its rating on the Boise, Idaho, chip maker with a buy rating. 

 American depositary receipts of L.M. Ericsson slipped 1 13/16 to 20 3/4. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter downgraded its rating on the Swedish telecommunications group to underperform from neutral after it reiterated that its first-half profit would fall short of its year-ago performance. Ericsson first indicated in early December that its first-half earnings would be disappointing, a warning that led troubled investors to wipe $8.7 billion off Ericsson's market value.

 3Com warns of slow times ahead

 3Com matched downgraded expectations for its third quarter, but warned that therest of the year will be sluggish. Much of the performance decline was attributed to the deceleration of demand for 3Com equipment in the North and LatinAmerican enterprise markets, the company said during a financial conference call yesterday. For the third quarter, ended 26 February, 1999, 3Com reporteda profit of $89.6 million, or $0.24 per share, compared with profit of $7.4 million, or $0.02 per share, posted in the year earlier period. Analysts had expected net earnings of $0.36 per share, before the company issued a profit warning at the beginning of the month. Estimates were subsequently revised to $0.23per share, which 3Com narrowly beat. Sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 13 per cent over sales of $1.2 billion in the year earlier quarter. For the first time, international sales were higher than sales in the US. 

  3Comchief executive, Eric Benhamou, said business in the Americas would remain tough. "While encouraged by February growth rates, we still have to assess thefundamental near term growth rates in end user demand in the enterprise part ofthe North American and Latin American markets," he said. ISP, carrier andconsumer markets in Europe and Asia Pacific remained unaffected by the trend, Benhamou added. The fourth quarter is historically strong for 3Com and thatis expected to be the case this year, said 3Com's chief financial officer, Christopher Paisley. However, taking into account the third quarter performance, "sequential sales growth will be modest," said Paisley. Sales into the channel during the fourth quarter will be less than sales out of the channel, said Paisley. Furthermore, 3Com's historically slow first quarter is expected to be slow again this year. 3Com is a leader in hubs, network interface cards and analogue modems. But has suffered because these are among the slowest growing areas of the networking market.

 Pillowtex Shares Tumble To 52-Week Low On Weak Earnings Outlook

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pillowtex Corp. shares tumbled to a 52-week low Tuesday after the company late Monday said it expects fiscal first-quarter and second-quarter earnings to miss analysts' expectations. 

 Pillowtex's Big Board-listed shares (PTX) fell $4.875, or 28%, to end at $12.625 on volume of 2.4 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 99,500. The shares fell below the 52-week low of $16.125 set Monday. 

 After the U.S. stock market closed Monday, Pillowtex said first-quarter earnings will be approximately 40 cents a diluted share, and second-quarter earnings will be approximately 50 cents a diluted share. That would be well below the mean estimates from analysts surveyed by First Call for first-quarter net of 60 cents a share and second-quarter net of 57 cents a share. 

 Because of the profit warning, Merrill Lynch & Co. Tuesday downgraded Pillowtex to near-term "neutral" from "buy," and NationsBanc Montgomery Securities downgraded the stock to "hold" from "buy." 

 Pillowtex, which makes pillows, towels and bed linens, attributed the expected shortfall to inefficiencies incurred during the installation of new computer systems in several plants, higher-than-expected manufacturing costs of new products, and costs related to the closing of an Alabama plant. 

 But some analysts said the extra costs causing the expected shortfall are short-term and that investors are overreacting to the news. 

 I cannot believe this," said Interstate/Johnson Lane analyst Kay Norwood of the drop in the stock. "It's like throwing the baby out with the bath water." 

 Prudential Securities Inc. analyst John Pickler said he isn't concerned that any of the difficulties Pillowtex is currently handling will follow the company into the second half of the year. 

 The company should be done with its computer systems work by the end of June. The changes the company needed to make with its looms and in its dye operations that resulted in extra manufacturing costs are behind the company, Interstate/Johnson Lane's Norwood said. Although there were added costs involved in closing the Alabama plant, the long-term result will be cost savings, she said. 

 Norwood, who sees the stock's decline as a buying opportunity, reduced her estimate for Pillowtex's fiscal year ending in January to $2.80 a share from $3.20. 

 "Demand is good and the top line should get good growth," Norwood said. She estimates that Pillowtex's sales will rise 7% this year. Pillowtex, which is based in Dallas, reported sales of $1.5 billion for fiscal 1999 ended Jan. 2. 

 Pillowtex's stock has been declining for some time. The stock traded as high as $52 last April. Some attribute the fall to a "sell" recommendation issued last June by Off Wall Street Consulting Group, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "The reality is that the company has been missing their top line numbers for some time now," said Off Wall Street Director of Research Mark Roberts. As a result of lower-than-expected sales, inventory has grown, he said. 

 On Tuesday, Merrill Lynch & Co. downgraded Pillowtex stock to near-term "neutral" from "buy", although the firm kept the stock at long-term "buy". Also, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities Inc. cut its rating to "hold" from "buy". 

 Separately, Pillowtex said late Tuesday its board authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares, or about 7% of the company's 14.2 million outstanding shares. 

 Pillowtex said it will use available cash or funds from a senior credit facility to make the purchases on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

 NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - Shares in Pillowtex Corp., maker of Cannon towels and other home textiles, dropped Tuesday after the company issued a profit warning for the first half of the year. 

 Pillowtex was down $5.56, or 31.9 percent, at $12.125, its lowest level since late 1996. The stock was the top percentage loser on the New York Stock Exchange and an order imbalance had delayed their opening. 

 Volume was heavy. Trade reached almost 10 times normal daily levels in the first hour of trade. 

 Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities analyst Shelly Hale cut her rating on the stock to hold from buy. Further details about the downgrade were not immediately available. 

 The Dallas-based company said after markets closed Monday that earnings for the first and second quarters would fall short of analysts' forecasts. 

 Pillowtex said it expected to earn 40 cents a diluted share in the first quarter and 50 cents in the second. Wall Street analysts had forecast first-quarter earnings of 60 cents and second-quarter earnings at 57 cents. 

 Pillowtex makes items like towels, sheets, and mattress pads under such brands as Cannon, Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet. 

 Pillowtex blamed the shortfall on inefficiencies during installation of new computer systems and on cost overruns in the start of production at several terrycloth plants. 

 The company also cited costs from shutting down Leshner spinning and weaving operations in Opelika, Ala. Pillowtex acquired the plant in its purchase of Leshner Corp. last year.

 NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - Cambridge Technology Partners Inc.  saw its stock lose nearly half its value in frenetic trading on Friday following the latest in a string of profit warnings by the computer consulting firm. 

 Cambridge shares were down $9, to $12, in late-morning trade. The stock was the most active on the Nasdaq stock market and was also the leading net loser. 

 The stock's fall, to a new low, came a day after Cambridge forecast that its sales and profits for the first quarter and full year would fall short of analysts' estimates. 

 "Investors have decided to exit the stock," said Steven Birer, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson Stephens. "At the end of the December quarter, people might have felt that the company was leaving its problems behind. I think there was disappointment it that." 

 Brier, who is maintaining a buy rating on the stock, said Cambridge's troubles were to be expected, given how it was restructuring along business rather than geographic lines. 

 "The company is in turn-around mode," he said. "It's trying to make a comeback but is having a difficult time about it." 

 Adams Harkness cut its rating on Cambridge by two notches, to market perform from strong buy, due to the profit warnings and the prolonged restructuring. 

 On Thursday Cambridge said it expected first-quarter earnings of up to $0.14 a share, about $0.10 below analysts' estimates. It said revenues would be up to $151 million, compared with Wall Street forecasts of up to $170 million. 

 Cambridge also said 1999 earnings would be as much as $0.74 a share on revenues of up to $675 million, against a forecast of $1.15 a share on revenues of $795 million. 

 Last September the company said it expected project delays to slow sales growth in 1999 by up to 45 percent. ((-Gilles Castonguay, Wall Street desk, +212 859 1730)).

 SHANGHAI, March 19 (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines, after warning it would show a loss for 1998, said it expected to return to profit this year, aided by lower costs and an easing of a domestic fare war. 

 The big Shanghai-based airline would be helped by tax concessions, an easing of the Asian economic crisis and reduced operating costs from service cutbacks on less profitable routes, said general manager Li Zhongming. 

 China Eastern Airlines Co Ltd also planned to sell 13 of its MD82 jets over the next three years - eight of them this year - to raise cash and repay debt. 

 "I'm confident that making a profit this year will not be a problem," he told Reuters in a recent interview. 

 China Eastern, which has stock traded in Hong Kong and New York as well as A shares in Shanghai for domestic investors, was one of some 70 listed Chinese companies that warned investors to expect a loss for 1998. 

 The airline had reported a loss of 360 million yuan ($43 million) for the first half of last year under domestic accounting rules. 

 Li said the final figures for all of last year were still not available. 

 "We have to wait until they are audited," he said. 

 The airline was profitable in February of this year, aided partly by increased travel over the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. 

 Li said the airline expected to benefit from a reduction of as much as 50 percent in airport construction fees that the government charges domestic carriers. 

 "Much of the airport construction programme has been completed," he said. 

 The Asian crisis had cut travel around the region, particularly from Japan, but there were signs of recovery, Li said. 

 "I don't expect things to get much worse from here." 

 Income had been reduced last year due to currency translations amid a weaker yen and a firm Chinese yuan. 

 The airline, however, has substantial yen-denominated debt and the executive said he hoped to see a stable yen this year. 

 China's major airlines all struggled last year amid intense competition in a weak market. Domestic passenger fares tumbled due to deep discounting but Beijing put a floor on ticket prices early this year. 

 While some analysts have said airlines could lose business to trains and buses, Li said China Eastern ultimately would benefit from higher fares. 

 China Eastern was also scheduled to take deliveries of three Airbus 320s and two MD90s this year, which after the MD82 sales would still leave it with a net reduction in its fleet, currently at more than 60 planes. 

 The net reduction was part of a government programme to trim the size of the domestic fleet and help cut costs. 

 "We will reduce some of our less profitable domestic service," Li said. 

 Li said cargo operations had held up better than passenger service last year although prices had also been under pressure. 

 The airline also would trim costs this year by taking over some maintenance on its Airbus aircraft instead of having work done in France. It was bringing in French supervisors to help train its maintenance force.

involves certain subordinated tranches of commercial mortgage-backed
securities with a face amount of $39.7 million, which have been in
dispute since October 1998 when Criimi Mae filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection (TRI, Oct. 9).  Criimi Mae said the agreement
adjourns the trial that had been scheduled to begin March 8 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Greenbelt, Md. (TRI, Feb. 5 & Feb. 19).  The
agreement also provides that Salomon Smith Barney, in cooperation with
Criimi Mae, will sell two classes of investment grade CMBS known as
Criimi Mae CMBS Corp. Commercial Mortgage Loan Trust Certificates,
series 1998-1.  Criimi Mae, prior to its Chapter 11 filing, had planned
to sell these CMBS.  Also, Citicorp Real Estate Inc., in cooperation
with Criimi Mae, will sell commercial mortgages sourced last year by
Criimi Mae.  The loans, with a face amount of $370 million, originally
had been intended for securitization.



  If the sales are successful,
Criimi Mae plans to use its portion of any net proceeds to help fund its
reorganization.
    Criimi Mae has reached similar agreements with three other creditors
in the past four months, including Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital Inc.,
German American Capital Corp. and Morgan Stanley & Co. International
Ltd. (TRI, Dec. 11 & Jan. 15).
    The court will conduct a hearing May 11 on Criimi Mae's original
motion for a six-month extension.  During the exclusivity period, Criimi
Mae has the exclusive right to prepare and file a plan of
reorganization.
    G&L Realty Corp. said its fourth-quarter results were affected
adversely by a reduction in short-term mortgage lending in response to
the costs associated with increased development activities and
unfavorable market conditions.  The company said that, during the latest
fourth quarter, two unrelated nursing home operating companies with a
total $5.8 of mortgage debt financed by G&L were in default.  The
company also anticipates losses on the purchase of $2.8 million of PHP
Healthcare Bonds for $1.3 million.  G&L said PHP declared bankruptcy in
November.  G&L increased loss reserves in response to these events.
    Glimcher Realty Trust's board of trustees declared a distribution of
one preferred share purchase right on each of Glimcher's common shares
outstanding.  The distribution will be made March 22, payable to
shareholders of record on that date; the distribution is not taxable to
shareholders.  The rights will expire March 22, 2009.  The rights will
not prevent a takeover, but should encourage anyone seeking to acquire
Glimcher to negotiate with the board prior to attempting a takeover.
The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 15% or
more of Glimcher's common shares or announces a tender offer, the
consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of
15% or more of the common shares.
    Separately, Michael P. Glimcher, who previously was senior vice
president of development and leasing, has been promoted to executive
vice president.  George A. Schmidt, who will continue to serve in his
capacity as the general counsel and secretary, has been promoted to
executive vice president from senior vice president.
    Great Lakes REIT completed the 1 million share repurchase plan
authorized by its board of trustees during September 1998 (TRI, Sept.
18).  The company repurchased the shares for $15.34 million.
    IndyMac Mortgage Holdings has been attacked on Internet message
boards since last October, which is when it was beset by financial
miseries and saw its shares plummet more than 60% in just three days,
according to the Interactive Edition of The Wall Street Journal.  The
Pasadena, Calif.-based company is beginning to regain the trust of bank
lenders and Wall Street analysts, but its Internet critics won't let up,
and its stock continues to struggle. Now, IndyMac says it is fighting
back.  Latching on to a growing trend among companies criticized on
Internet message boards, IndyMac is threatening to sue its detractors,
the articles author, Aaron Elstein, reported.  The company contends many
are short sellers hoping to profit by depressing its stock, or are
disgruntled former workers out to get revenge for being laid off.
    The company inserted two messages in recent weeks on a bulletin
board on the Yahoo! Finance site, quote.yahoo.com, warning "financially
interested authors" who have posted "untrue" messages may face lawsuits.
"IndyMac will use all the legal means at its disposal, including the use
of subpoenas, if appropriate, to identify the anonymous authors of such
messages," read the warning.  An IndyMac spokeswoman refused to say
whether the company has filed suit.
    Innkeepers USA Trust will purchase all dividend reinvestment shares
and optional purchase shares in the open market at the next investment
date.  As a result, the company said no discounts will be available to
participants in its dividend reinvestment plan.  If its share price
rebounds, Innkeepers again will be able to issue shares for the
reinvestment plan and to offer a 4% discount on company-issued shares
acquired with reinvested dividends.  Under an amendment to the plan,
Inkeepers also will offer up to a 3% discount on optional cash purchases
of more than $3,000.
    Lexington Corporate Properties Trust agreed to defer a portion of
FirstPlus Financial Group Inc.'s rent for FirstPlus headquarters in
Dallas.  Lexington said FirstPlus is required to pay $268,632 per month
under its lease; Lexington will defer $100,000 per month for four
monthly payments beginning with the March payment.  Lexington said the
agreement will reduce second-quarter revenue by $383,000.  FirstPlus is
Lexington's fifth largest tenant.  FirstPlus's lease expires during
2012, and its average annual rent during the term of the lease is $3.6
million.  As collateral for lease obligations, FirstPlus provided a $3.2
million letter of credit.  The deferral agreement doesn't affect
Lexington's ability to exercise its remedies, including drawing on the
letter, the company said.  Lexington expects that, if the letter were
drawn down, Lexington would recognize the proceeds as revenue during an
18-month period.
    Meditrust Corp. was allowed by a bank group to use cash proceeds in
excess of $300 million from the sale of Cobblestone Golf Group to pay
down a forward equity transaction with Merrill Lynch International and
certain affiliates (TRI, Feb. 12).  The bank group is led by J.P. Morgan
& Co., BT Alex. Brown. Inc., Fleet National Bank and BankBoston.
Meditrust expects to pay the remainder of its FEIT fully in cash.
Merrill Lynch agreed to halt the sale of remaining FEIT shares until
March 31.  Meditrust expects to close the Cobblestone sale by that date.
As reported, Meditrust has cut its FEIT to $89 million with the proceeds
of various asset sales completed since the company began restructuring
during November 1998 (TRI, Jan. 15).
    Mills Corp. plans to take its entertainment/factory outlet megamalls
into cyberspace before year's end, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
"We're researching it and in the process of putting together our own
cybermall - Mills.com," Mills Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Laurence Siegel told Dow Jones.  He, however, wants to work out a
business plan that ensures a profit before proceeding.  "A lot of people
take their businesses online and get tremendous volume, but have no
bottom line.  That's a huge problem today and we want to be sure there's
a profit," Siegel said.  "The multiples these [Internet] stocks are
trading at is ludicrous, especially when a lot of them don't turn a
profit."
    Patriot American Hospitality has agreed to pay $166.4 million in

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Aetrium Inc. shares fell 23% Thursday after the company predicted it would report disappointing first- and second-quarter results. 

 Aetrium said after Wednesday's market close that it would post a first-quarter loss between 22 cents and 24 cents a share, excluding a possible charge for cost-cutting actions. 

 The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call was for a loss of 13 cents a share. Atrium earned 27 cents a share in the year-ago first quarter. 

 The St. Paul, Minn.-based maker of electromechanical equipment cited weak market conditions in the semiconductor industry for the profitwarning. 

 Dick Ryan, an analyst with Miller, Johnson & Kuehn, doesn't expect the stock to trade higher until the company reports improved bookings. 

 "The market needs to see a sustainability that orders are improving and as of yet we don't have that," he said. "We're probably looking into the second half of 1999 before the core part of their business shows some sustained recovery." 

 Ryan added that the company would likely post a loss in the first three quarters, but might "break into profitability" in the fourth quarter. 

 Aetrium, which also cited contract delays and a spending cut by its largest customer, said second-quarter losses would be narrower than in the first quarter, but revenue would be about the same at $8 million. 

 Aetrium (ATRM) shares fell $1.875 to close at $6.125 on volume of 104,000, compared with average daily volume of 44,200.

 Aetrium said after Wednesday's market close that it would post a first-quarter loss between 22 cents and 24 cents a share, excluding a possible charge for cost-cutting actions, wider than First Call Corp.'s loss estimate of 13 cents a share.

 Data Processing Dn -2: SPR  Profit Warning  Cited >DPRC

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Data Processing Resources Corp. (DPRC) shares fell to a 52-week low Monday, with analysts saying the stock was dragged down with several other information technology staffing stocks. 

 One analyst, Matthew Litfin of William Blair & Co., attributed the decline in these stocks to SPR Inc.'s (SPRI) announcement earlier that it expects first-quarter operating results to be significantly below expectations. 

 In addition to drops in the shares of Data Processing and SPR, other declining IT staffing stocks included Syntel Inc. (SYNT), Cotelligent Inc. (CGZ) and Renaissance Worldwide Inc. (REGI). 

 IT staffing stocks have been slumping in recent weeks as investors suspect that demand for the firms' year 2000 remediation staffing services has dried up and corporate clients are waiting to start any new information technology projects, analysts said. 

 "(One) issue has been the Y2K hangover," said Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst Theresa A. Matacia. "Y2K has siphoned resources and demand from staffing companies. The question is, when does demand start to pick back up for non-Y2K projects?" 

 Staffing companies in general also have suffered from several profit warnings in recent weeks, including those by Personnel Group of America Inc. (PGA), StaffMark Inc. (STAF) and Romac International Inc. (ROMC). 

 Despite the concerns, Matacia believes the selloff of Data Processing shares is somewhat misguided. In a research note Monday, she reiterated her strong buy rating after company officials told her February results were above internal expectations, she said. 

 William Blair's Litfin also remained positive about Data Processing. He said the company offered more comprehensive services than SPR. 

 Data Processing's shares were recently off 2 1/4, or 14.2%, at 13 5/8, on volume of 584,500. Average daily volume is 187,500. Earlier, the shares traded as low as 12 3/4, under the previous low of 15 1/2 reached March 11. 


Shares of SPR, which also said Monday its planned acquisition by
Metamor Worldwide Inc. (MMWW) was terminated, were off 4 21/32, or 49%,
at 4 27/32. Syntel's shares were off 11/32, or 4%, at 8 13/32.
Cotelligent shares were off 3/4, or 6.5%, at 10 7/8. Renaissance
Worldwide shares were off 1/8, or 2.5%, at 4 7/8.

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Nasdaq stocks ended lower in average trading on Friday, led by Oracle Corp. , in a session described by some dealers as directionless. 

 "It was all over the place," said one of them. 

 "There was nothing special," said another. "People had a good week, and I guess they were a bit tired." 

 The Nasdaq composite index lost 30.70 points or 1.27 percent to close at an unofficial 2381.55 on a volume of 916.7 million shares. Decliners beat advancers 2231 to 1682, with 61 stocks hitting new 52-week highs, and 89 new lows. 

 "There was no real pressure on anything," said the second dealer, referring to any perceptible trend in the market. 

 Oracle, the leading U.S. database software company, ended 8-5/16 points lower at 28-9/16 on a volume that made it the most active stock on the exchange. Oracle, which touched a low of 28 Friday, began falling after the market close on Thursday when it reported weaker-than-expected revenues for the fiscal third quarter. 

 Dell Computer Corp.  went up 5/16 to end at 42-3/16, while Safeskin Corp.  lost 6-9/32 at 8-31/32 after a brokerage house cut its rating on a profit warning. 

 Microsoft Corp.  lost 1-1/4, closing at 160-3/16.

 Safeskin Shares Sink To New Low After 1st-Quarter  Profit Warning

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Safeskin Corp. hit a new 52-week low Friday after the maker of latex gloves warned first-quarter and full-year sales and earnings will fall below expectations. 

 After Thursday's market close, Safeskin said first-quarter sales will miss expectations by about $28 million. BT Alex. Brown Inc. analyst Andrew Jay, who had been expecting sales of $66.5 million, reduced his estimate to $48.5 million. 

 Safeskin said first-quarter earnings will fall 25 cents to 26 cents below analysts' estimates. The mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by First Call was for earnings of 27 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned 22 cents a share on sales of $53.3 million. 

 The San Diego-based company attributed the shortfall to higher-than-expected distributor inventory levels and a slower-than-anticipated ramp-up of orders from new contracts. 

 Safeskin, which has a market capitalization of about $887 million, also expects sales and earnings for the full year to be below expectations. 

 The mean estimate of six analysts survyed by First Call was for earnings of $1.25 a share. That's up from $1 per share for 1998, but  BT Alex. Brown's Jay already cut his view to 61 cents from $1.25. He also reduced his 1999 revenue outlook to $233 million from $299 million, which would be be down from $237 million reported for the previous year. 

 Safeskin (SFSK) stock, which had traded as high as $47.125 in July, earlier sank as low as $8, well below the previous 52-week floor of $14.375 set Thursday. For the day, the shares fell $6.281, or 41%, to finish at $8.969 on volume of 24.7 million, compared with a daily average of 1.1 million. 

 US Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Thomas Gunderson said the stock is probably at a low valuation, but risk also needs to be a factor in the equation. 

 But Jay said he believes the stock may be oversold. "This company does have a very high-quality glove and a very low cost of manufacturing," he said. "The company has a new surgical glove that will be widely available in March and the current valuation in the marketplace does not reflect the value this business could have to another company that would be interested in buying it." 

 The analyst downgraded his investment rating to "market perform" from "buy." Joseph Stevens & Co. analyst Evans K. Kissi also cut his rating, to "hold" from "accumulate." 

 "We believe that unless management develops a timely and effective system for evaluating inventory levels at various distributors and the prevailing market demand for products," Kissi said in a research note, "the shortcomings just announced could become a chronic event." 

 A Safeskin official wasn't immediately available for comment.

 Caterpillar Issues  Warning  On 1st-Quarter  Profit , Sales

DJON

 PEORIA, Ill. -(Dow Jones)- Caterpillar Inc. said Friday that first-quarter earnings will be 50% below what analysts are expecting as sales of its heavy machinery and engines slumped from fourth-quarter levels. 

 Its warning indicates that the current quarter will produce a profit of about 41 cents a share. The mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call is for earnings of 84 cents a share. In the fourth quarter, Caterpillar earned 83 cents a diluted share. 

 Caterpiller also said it sees first-quarter sales and revenue significantly below the $5.41 billion recorded in the fourth quarter. 

 The company does expect a stronger second half because of its current efforts to trim costs, including production-schedule cuts, layoffs, temporary plant shutdowns, and a reduction of inventory. The company sees 1999 sales and revenue slightly below last's year's level of $20.98 billion. 

 For the full year, the heavy-equipment maker expects earnings to be 10% to 15% lower than 1998 on falling sales volumes, an adverse product mix and continuing pricing competition. The company earned $4.11 a diluted share in 1998. The mean estimate of 18 analysts polled by First Call predicted 1999 earnings of $3.60 a share. 

 Friday's news bears out a warning that Caterpillar issued in January, when it said 1999 profit would be "moderately lower" and sales would fall short of 1998 levels because of lower demand in Japan, Latin America, Canada and Australia, as well as lower prices for oil and metals. However, it did say demand is expected to rise in Europe. 

 As the leading maker of construction equipment, Caterpillar has benefited for years from strength in the U.S. housing and construction markets. The recent economic turmoil in Asia has caused Caterpillar's sales in that region to plummet, making the North American market even more crucial to the company's bottom line. As a result, heavy discounting by domestic competitors is taking a big toll on its fortunes. 

 The repeated warnings apparently disheartened investors. Caterpillar shares (CAT) fell $6.188, or 12%, to close at $44.688 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 

 A Caterpillar spokeswoman, Marsha Hausser, said the company expects a much stronger second half in 1999, which will offset the expected shortfall in the first quarter. 

 Hausser also said that the company is comfortable with analysts' earnings estimates for 1999 of $3.60 a share. 

 As market pressures decline and the company's cost- cutting measures take effect, the following quarters should show signs of recovery. "We think that long term, the market is going to be a good one," she said. 

 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Lisa Shalett said she wasn't surprised by Caterpillar's announcement. Considering pricing pressures and market saturation in the equipment industry, Shalett said she has been predicting an earnings shortfall for the past six months. 

 Moreover, she said that Caterpillar's heavy involvement in the weak Brazilian economy has also hurt the company. 

 "Caterpillar makes significant profits in Brazil," said Shalett. "Brazil is responsible for a big part of the hit." 

 Shalett said that Wall Street has been underestimating how important Brazil is for the company. She also said that investors were misled by the small impact the Asian economic crisis had on Caterpillar and believed Brazil's impact would be mild. Now, Shalett said, "There's going to be disillusionment and the stock is going to have a downside." 

 Shalett said she doesn't know yet how badly the company will be hurt but said that judging from the company's announcement, "It's going to be tough." 

 "The company will have an awful lot of ground to cover in the second half of this year," she said. Shalett has her estimate for 1999 earnings at $3.35 a share, below the First Call mean estimate of $3.60. 

 PaineWebber Inc. analyst David Bleustein agreed with Shalett that Caterpillar's announcement had implications for future quarters. "The operating margins will continue to deteriorate," he said. 

 On the company's cost-reduction efforts, Bleustein said, "It's going to take a heck of a lot of cost cutting." 

 Bleustein said "it's hard to say" whether the company will emerge from its doldrums because "the information available is very sketchy, and it's very difficult to draw conclusions from sketchy details."

 Shares of Nautica Tumble 11% On  Warning  for Quarterly  Profit

 NEW YORK -- Shares of Nautica Enterprises Inc. plunged 11% after the men's-apparel maker said it expects fourth-quarter profit to trail Wall Street estimates. 

 Nautica expects to report per-share earnings "in the range" of 24 cents to 26 cents for the quarter ended Feb. 28. The results will reflect higher-than-expected costs related to "promotional discounts at retail and the disposition costs of excess (autumn) and holiday merchandise," Nautica said. 

 Before the announcement, a First Call survey of 12 analysts estimated Nautica would earn 31 cents a diluted share in the fourth quarter. A year earlier, net income was $13.8 million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $111.1 million. 

 Nautica shares fell $1.4375 Thursday to $11.9375 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

 Nautica, one of the top menswear suppliers to department stores in the U.S., has been struggling lately with higher markdowns at retail and lower demand for its products. Nautica said it plans to make significant investments in infrastructure and the marketing of new products, including jeans, and will cut back on its core men's sportswear collections this year.

 NEW YORK, March 12 (Reuters) - Nasdaq stocks ended lower in average trading on Friday, led by Oracle Corp. , in a session described by some dealers as directionless. 

 "It was all over the place," said one of them. 

 "There was nothing special," said another. "People had a good week, and I guess they were a bit tired." 

 The Nasdaq composite index lost 30.70 points or 1.27 percent to close at an unofficial 2381.55 on a volume of 916.7 million shares. Decliners beat advancers 2231 to 1682, with 61 stocks hitting new 52-week highs, and 89 new lows. 

 "There was no real pressure on anything," said the second dealer, referring to any perceptible trend in the market. 

 Oracle, the leading U.S. database software company, ended 8-5/16 points lower at 28-9/16 on a volume that made it the most active stock on the exchange. Oracle, which touched a low of 28 Friday, began falling after the market close on Thursday when it reported weaker-than-expected revenues for the fiscal third quarter. 

 Dell Computer Corp.  went up 5/16 to end at 42-3/16, while Safeskin Corp.  lost 6-9/32 at 8-31/32 after a brokerage house cut its rating on a profit warning. 

 Microsoft Corp.  lost 1-1/4, closing at 160-3/16.

 Alcatel Will  Cut  12,000 Jobs In Bid To Boost Profitability

 PARIS -(Dow Jones)- French telecommunications-equipment group Alcatel SA said Thursday it will cut its work force by 12,000 jobs, or 10%, over the next two years, to cut costs and boost earnings. 

 Chairman Serge Tchuruk said the job cuts, most of which will come as part of a restructuring of the group's U.S. operations, will result in savings of 300 million euros ($328.4 million) a year. Alcatel (ALA) cut 770 jobs last year. Alcatel also plans to subcontract some businesses over the next two years in an effort to improve profitability. 

 Tchuruk said Alcatel's profit margins will improve this year but fall just shy of the company's 8% target set in 1996. He said he expects Alcatel's profit margin, expressed as a percentage of sales, to improve to 7% this year from 4% in 1998. 

 "I am still keeping the 8% target in view but we are taking longer to get there than I had hoped due to the slowdown in the (telecoms) switching market," Tchuruk said. 

 The flurry of news, in particular the job cuts, appeared to please investors and analysts. With Alcatel stock up about 3.5% in afternoon trading in Paris, Denis De Ambrogi, a salesman at BNP Equities, said: "It is the restructuring and the cost savings. Cutting 12,000 jobs always makes the stock market happy." 

 De Ambrogi noted that sentiment has turned in Alcatel's favor since it announced the $2 billion purchase of Xylan Corp. last month in a deal that gives the French company proven technology for routing computer traffic. 

 "They've moved strongly in the right direction, so people are now beginning to put their trust in the management again," de Ambrogi said. 

 A profit warning by Tchuruk in September 1998 sparked a 38% plunge in Alcatel shares in one day and a large loss of market confidence in Alcatel. 

 "People think the profits will start to come through now that they have moved in the right direction," de Ambrogi said. 

 Chief Financial Officer Jean-Pierre Halbron repeated that Alcatel's telecom division should post a 40% rise in operating profit in 1999 from 575 million euros in 1998, while the cables-and-components division should show a steady performance after turning in operating profit of 426 million euros last year. 

 The company said recent acquisitions such as Xylan (XYLN) "will enhance Alcatel's profit generation potential and significantly improve telecom (operating) margins next year." 

 Halbron said 1999 revenue should climb "by a bit more than 10%" from 21.3 billion euros last year, and by another 10% in 2000. 

 Alcatel also said Thursday that it is proposing a 1998 dividend of two euros a share, up 14% from 1.75 euros in 1997.

 First Call Hill Urges Investors To Look Hard At Techs, Oil

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--On the threshold of preannouncement season, investors should take a hard look at the technology sector, said First Call Corp. research director Chuck Hill. 

 Following 3Com Corp.'s (COMS) third-quarter profit warning last week and rumblings about preannouncements from Intel Corp. (INTC) and Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ), "we really have to keep an eye to see if it mushrooms in the technology area or not," Hill said during a CNBC interview Tuesday. 

 Hill suggests investors also monitor the oil sector as analysts revise their earnings estimates ahead of the the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting, scheduled for March 23 in Vienna. 


Because of a long-term downturn in oil prices, largely due to
overcapacity, many oil companies had cut back on exploration, leading to
a sell-off in oil-service stocks. Those companies, as well as the major
oil companies, have recently benefited from the prospects of stabilizing
or even higher oil prices.

 Republic Dn -3: Hoak Breedlove Cuts FY99 View To $1.20 >RGC

 Yuschak of Hoak Breedlove said he cut his fiscal 1999 earnings estimate for Republic to $1.20 a share from $1.90. The analyst said he no longer has an estimate for fiscal 2000; it had been $2.50 a share. 

 The analyst cited uncertainty over the cost of the Lawton paperboard mill and the inability of the company to generate enough profits from the Duke gypsum mill to help fund expenses at the Lawton plant. 

 Production problems at the Duke plant have been a continuing source of trouble for Republic. In December, the company postponed the simultaneous operation of the two reconfigured production lines until January. But that has been delayed again. The company didn't specify when production lines would ramp-up to full capacity. 

 Analysts explained that Republic tried to build the Duke gypsum plant itself, without a general contractor or engineer, and only recently brought in consultants. But Republic has big-time help for the paperboard plant in the form of Fluor Corp.'s (FLR) Fluor Daniel unit, which received a $147 million design-and-build contract from Republic in October. The company then pegged total cost for building the plant at between $160 million to $170 million. 

 Because of the delays, the gypsum plant isn't producing up to capacity and Republic isn't able to make the higher-end liner boards and take advantage of the strong gypsum market, noted Lerner of Arnhold. Lerner also noted that Republic's third-quarter warning was the second profitwarning in the last two quarters. 

 Lerner cut his third-quarter projection to 23 cents from 63 cents, bringing his full-year estimate for Republic to $1.43 a share from $2.13. 

 With several weeks to go in the quarter, the analyst said he's expecting anemic volume at significantly higher costs, which could continue into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following fiscal year. 

 Because it's unlikely the Duke plant will be running at full capacity even by the fiscal first quarter, the analyst said, he lowered his earnings estimate for the following year to $2.27 from $2.57. 

 Lerner said investors will be very skeptical of any timetable management announces for the plants and sit on the sidelines until well after the paperboard mill starts producing.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Blue-chip stocks advanced Wednesday, lifted by a
strong performance by the oil sector.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 51 to 9745 in midafternoon
trading. DuPont helped support the blue-chip average, rising 3 13/16
to 57 3/8 after Deutsche Bank upgra ded its rating on the stock to
'accumulate" from "hold."
The industrials were also helped by a strong energy sector, after
reports from the Middle East pointing to more production cutbacks by
oil-producing nations. Chevron rose 3 1/2 to 83 7/16 while Exxon climbed
2 7/8 to 72 13/16. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained
2 to 1281.90 Wednesday and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index
jumped 1.50 to 604.40.
   Advancing issues led declining issues 1,541 to 1,300 on the Big
Board, as volume reached 523 million shares.


 However, the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.50 to 2391.40. 

 Technology shares, which have been plagued in recent weeks by a number of reports about a slowdown in the personal-computer industry, put in a mixed performance amid nervousness about the impact on first-quarter profits. 


Computer Associates International slid 5 11/16, or about 15%, to 34
5/16. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its investment rating on the
Islandia, N.Y., computer-software designer to "neutr al" from
"outperform." In a research note, analyst Chuck Phillips said he reduced
his rating because of concerns about increasing competition, softness in
near-term demand and a potential peaking of margins. But semiconductor
shares rebounded smartly from the battering suffered Tuesday on profit
jitters.
   Bellwether Intel, which was hammered as rumors circulated that the
company was preparing to issue a warning, recovered 2 1/8 to 117 7/16.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index rose 3.5 0 to
375.70.



And Internet stocks posted sharp gains after Merrill Lynch & Co.'s new
Internet analyst, Henry Blodget, assumed coverage of America Online,
Yahoo! and Amazon.com with long-term "buy" ratings. Shares of AOL rose 1
11/16 to 91 13/16, while Yahoo! gained 5 3/16 to 172 1/2. Amazon.com
surged 5 3/4 to 135 11/16.



Lycos soared 12 1/2 to 108 3/4, as prospects grew that its planned
merger with USA Networks could be overtaken by another suitor. An
article in The Wall Street Journal reported that David Wetherell, the
chief executive of CMGI, which has a 20% stake in Lycos, said he is
exploring other options for Lycos, including CMGI's outright purchase of
the Waltham, Mass., Internet portal. With the help of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, Mr. Wetherell is also seeking other Internet companies that
might be interested in Lycos. Shares of CMGI slipped 3 5/8 to 190 13/16
while USA Networks inched down 11/16 to 37.



Financial stocks gained ground, as speculation about the need for
further consolidation among international banks was fueled by news of a
hostile bid by France's BNP for Societe Generale and Paribas, valued at
an estimated $37 billion. If successful, the move would create the
world's biggest banking group, with assets of more than $1 trillion.
   Household International rose 3 7/16 to 45 1/4 after the Prospect
Heights, Ill., company said its board approved a $2 billion
common-stock repurchase program. At current prices, $2 billion would
buy about 48 million shares, or nearly 10% of t he company's common
stock outstanding. Household, the country's largest consumer finance
company, also said it increased its quarterly dividend 13%, to 17
cents a share from 15 cents. Century Telephone Enterprises gained 3
13/16 to 67 1/4.
Standard & Poor's Financial Information Services said that the Monroe,
La., telephone-service provider, is replacing Rubbermaid in the S&P 500.
Rubbermaid, a Wooster, Ohio, maker of plastic housewares and toys,
agreed in October to be acquired by Newell in a sto ck deal valued at
about $5.1 billion.
   Meanwhile, USG rose 1 7/16 to 47 7/16 on news that the Chicago
building-materials company will replace Century in the S&P SmallCap
600. Northern Telecom gained 2 13/16 to 60 13/16 after the Canadian
telecommunication company said it has been selected by AT&T as a
"potential supplier" for advanced voice-switching systems that will
support the evolution of the AT&T Worldwide Intelligent Network. The
potential value of the agreement wasn't disclosed. AT&T, based in New
York, fell 2 5/16 to 83 1/4.

 In Montreal-datelined story headlined "FOCUS-Alcan issues profit warning, hit by low price" please read in seventh paragraph analyst's name as Vahid Fathi. (Correcting name of analyst) 

 A corrected repetition follows. 

 (All amounts in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated) 

 By Charles Grandmont 

 MONTREAL, March 9 (Reuters) - Slumping aluminum prices claimed another casualty on Tuesday when Alcan Aluminium Ltd.   warned its profit for the first quarter of 1999 would be lower than expected. 

 Alcan's shares lost more than 4 percent of their value in morning trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, before regaining a little ground to trade down C$1.45 at C$36.25 at midday. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of the Montreal-based aluminum producer slipped $1 to $23-13/16. 

 Alcan, the world's second-largest aluminum producer, said first-quarter net income would be 50 percent to 60 percent lower than the $0.30 a share, before a special gain, it posted in the fourth quarter of 1998. 

 Alcan blamed the drop on low primary aluminum prices, the recession in Brazil and weaker fabricated product prices in Europe. 

 "In addition, the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, if maintained at the current level to the end of the quarter, will result in a revaluation of deferred tax liabilities and a non-cash charge to net income of $13 million, or $0.06 per share," Alcan said. 

 The North American aluminum industry is struggling with prices that have dropped to five-year lows as demand has fallen everywhere but the United States. 

 Producers have refused to cut output, said Vahid Fathi, metal and mining analyst at ABN Amro Inc. (Corrects name.) 

 Alcan's earnings caution follows a similar warning from Reynolds Metal Co. , the number two U.S. aluminum producer, which said last week that first-quarter operating profits would be wiped out by low aluminum prices and Brazil's currency devaluation. 

 Fathi said he intends to cut "substantially" his earnings estimates for Alcan for the first and second quarters of 1999, as well as for the full year. 

 "I think we are not out of the woods yet," he said. 

 Analysts were expecting Alcan and other aluminum companies such as Alcoa Inc. , the world largest producer, to post similar warnings. 

 "In the fourth quarter of 1998, aluminum prices averaged $0.60 per pound U.S. and they've been in the low $0.50 range in the first quarter so far," an analyst said. 

 Before Alcan's profit warning, analysts on average had expected earnings of $0.31 a share for the first quarter of 1999, compared with $0.55 a year earlier, according to a survey of 12 analysts by research firm First Call Corp. 

 "Despite the sharp downturn in Brazil, total shipments of fabricated products in the quarter are in line with the first quarter of last year and ahead of late 1998," Jacques Bougie, Alcan's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 

 The situation in Brazil has hit Alcan's rolled product plant in that country, but not its domestic can sheet plant, said Alcan spokesman Alain Bergeron. 

 The expansion of the can sheet plant, from a capacity of 100,000 tons to one of 280,000 tons, is not affected and will soon be completed as planned, Bergeron said. 

 Alcan doesn't intend to revise its earnings forecast for the rest of the year and no production cutbacks are in sight, he added.

 - SteriGenics was off 6-1/4 at 10-3/8 in morning trade a day after it said it expected its fourth-quarter results to fall below market expectations due to a delayed season showdown. First Call Corp. had a consensus estimate among analysts forecasting a profit of $0.28 per share for the quarter.

 U.K. Tobacco Firm BAT's Profit Fell On U.S. Litigation Costs, Asia

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- British American Tobacco PLC said Tuesday that it 1998 pretax profit fell 16% to 738 million pounds ($1.19 billion) on the combined impact of charges to settle tobacco lawsuits and Asia's regional economic crisis. The company also warned that its "difficult" business conditions are continuing. 

 The earnings figure included one-time charges of 613 million pounds for the initial costs of U.S. tobacco settlements in 1998, compared with 258 million pounds in settlement costs in 1997. 

 Analysts were looking for pretax profit, after items, of between 700 million pounds to 780 million pounds, but they said the figure was difficult to forecast because of the uncertainty over the litigation charges and other items. 

 Full-year operating profit, excluding exceptional items, fell 3% to 1.55 billion pounds. Operating profit was 1% higher in local currency terms before the U.S. tobacco-settlement costs, 74 million pounds from a recovery of sales tax in 1998 and headquarters relocation costs of 30 million pounds in 1997, the company (BTI) said. 

 BAT said performances in Latin America and Europe were good, but overall results were hurt by "very difficult" conditions in the Asia-Pacific region. Asia-Pacific sales fell 20% to 959 million pounds in 1998, while operating profit in the region plunged 41% to 182 million pounds. Latin America operating profit, which in 1997 was hit by one-time costs and depressed prices in Mexico, improved by 59 million pounds to 318 million pounds. 

 The company also said that a government crackdown on illegal cigarette trade in China hit fourth-quarter sales, as traders got nervous and stopped stocking products. The traders, who buy from smugglers, usually focus on selling international brands. But spooked by the crackdown, they switched to selling mostly domestic brands, hurting sales of smuggled international goods. Sales to China probably account for just under half of total Asia-Pacific sales, but BAT said that is a rough guess because muggling makes it difficult to judge where the cigarettes end up. 

 BAT estimates that the bulk of international cigarettes sold in China are smuggled, rather than imported legally. 

 The company also said it continued to feel the impact of the strength of the British currency in global foreign-exchange markets, which reduced operating profit before exceptional items by 55 million pounds. 

 BAT said the full-year results weren't as good as it had hoped for at the start of the year, but "they represented a satisfactory outcome against the background of very difficult trading conditions in Asia, as well as the impact of the crisis in Russia." 

 "The difficult trading conditions that had such a marked impact on the fourth quarter of 1998 are persisting in the first quarter of 1999," the company said. First-quarter volumes in Asia Pacific are likely to be lower than in the same period last year, although they will exceed fourth-quarter levels, BAT said. 

 While BAT said it is too early to have a clear view of the outcome for the first quarter, "the reality is that (group) operating profit is unlikely to match the same period last year." 

 On top of the Asian difficulties, BAT said the U.S. domestic market remains "intensely competitive," and the economic and currency situation in Brazil "is now plainly volatile." In Russia, however, volumes are well ahead of last year and margins are showing signs of improvement, BAT said. 

 Analysts said BAT's cautious outlook for Asia and its profit warning for the first quarter of 1999 dented investor sentiment. "We were expecting Asia to be pretty tough in the fourth quarter, but it looks a bit worse than anticipated," said Simon Willis, a tobacco-industry analyst at Charterhouse Tilney. 

 Jonathan Fell, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said. "The pattern for the first quarter is in line with expectations, because we've been warned since October about the Asia difficulties and the fact that recovery probably wouldn't come until the third of fourth quarter of this year." 

 Analysts also were disappointed that BAT failed to give details on when the group's acquisition of Rothmans International NV is likely to be completed, or how much it expects to save from synergies. BAT said it is undertaking detailed planning to enable it to merge the two businesses as quickly as possible following completion of the acquisition.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Shares of British American Tobacco PLC (BTI) are lower in early trade Tuesday after the company reported a 16% fall in full year pretax profit, after exceptional items. 

 Tobacco litigation charges and Asian economic woes caused BAT's pretax profit to fall to GBP738 million from GBP875 million. 

 Analysts said BAT's cautious outlook for Asia and warning that operating profit in the first quarter of 1999 is likely to be below last year's level dented market sentiment. 

 At 0930 GMT, BAT shares were down 22.5 pence at 550 pence. The shares opened Tuesday 33 pence lower at 539.5 pence. 

 "We were expecting Asia to be pretty tough in the fourth quarter, but it looks a bit worse than anticipated," said tobacco analyst Simon Willis at Charterhouse Tilney. 

 But Willis and other analysts said BAT had already made clear to investors that conditions in Asia were very tough. 

 "I'd be happy to buy on this (share price) weakness," said Willis. 

 When BAT's acquisition of Rothmans International NV (N.RMI) was announced in January, the company had said it was having a difficult first quarter, analysts said. 

 "I'm surprised (the shares have fallen so much) because the company has been warning us this is the case for some time," said Jonathan Fell at Merrill Lynch. 

 "The pattern for the first quarter is in line with expectations, because we've been warned since October about the Asia difficulties and the fact that recovery probably wouldn't come until the third of fourth quarter of this year (1999)," he added. 

 Fell said he would advise clients to buy at this level. He thinks 700 pence would be a fair price for BAT.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved into record territory Tuesday, as technology shares bounced back from early weakness and Treasury bonds steadied. The industrial average was up 58 to 9786 in midday trading. 

 The blue-chip average recovered from its early lows amid strong gains for tech bellwether International Business Machines. Its shares rose 4 1/4 to 183 1/8. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.40 to 1291.10 after setting its own new high on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 25 to 2423 Tuesday and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index edged up 3 to 607.10. 

 Declining issues outpaced adv ancers, 1,408 to 1,358 on the Big Board, as volume reached 379 million shares. 

 Monday's tech-driven rally stalled Tuesday following a profit warning from Advanced Micro Devices, which reported after the close of trading Monday that it would post a "significant" first-quarter operating loss because it missed, by at least a half-million units, its target of shipping 5.5 million K6-2 processors in the quarter. The chip maker also said it will cut 300 jobs. Its shares slumped 1 15/16 to 17. 

 The warning heralded the kick-off of the dreaded preannouncement season, when companies warn analysts and shareholders that earnings for the current quarter are running short of expectations. With the market trading at near-record levels and the Dow industrials flirting with the 10000 milestone, traders said the warning was enough to inject an ounce of caution in the market. 

 Microsoft, meanwhile, surged 4 5/16 to 163 5/16 on a report that the company may be exploring a settlement with the Department of Justice in its antitrust suit. 

 Also weighing on Wall Street was the unsteady debt market, which saw interest rates rise ahead of a report on fourth-quarter productivity and a speech expected later Tuesday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 

 Nonfarm productivity rose by a greater-than-expected 4.6% in the fourth quarter, helping to allay fears that the economy is in danger of overheating. The data, which follows on the heels of a benign employment report on Friday, helped provided further evidence that economy is growing without spurring inflation. 

 Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, speaking at a luncheon at the Fed's Business Access to Capital and Credit Conference in Arlington, Va., Tuesday, said that while U.S. economic growth has remained vigorous and unemployment is lower than it has been in nearly 30 years, "there have been no obvious signs of emerging inflation pressures." Traders said the Fed chief's remarks, which essentially reiterated comments made before Congress in his  semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony in February, were largely ignored by the market. 

 Lycos soared 11 3/16 to 95 1/16, after CMGI's chairman quit the Web portal company's board. He opposes the merger pact with USA Networks and is seeking other potential buyers for Lycos. Shares of CMGI, which owns about 20% of Lycos, gained 2 11/16 to 202 3/8. All of the companies trade on the Nasdaq. 

 Sony jumped 4 1/2 to 90 5/16. The electronics producer and retailer announced it will cut the number of fa ctories world-wide, reduce its work force by 10% and raise its stake to 100% in three Japanese subsidiaries, as part of a broad restructuring of it global holdings. 

 Drug concerns suffered following an article in The Wall Street Journal that reported that the Federal Trade Commission has expanded its probe of big pharmaceutical companies to determine whether they are unfairly stifling generic competition. The agency's investigation, which now involves Eli Lilly, DuPont, Abbott Laboratories and Hoechst was prompted by concerns about spiraling drug-price inflation and  possible anticompetitive practices. One subject of investigation is Eli Lilly's pact with Sepracor on Prozac. Eli Lilly lost 1 1/4 to 96 1/16, and Sepracor slumped 4 1/2 to 134 7/8. 

 RJR Nabisco Holdings rose 1 9/16 to 30 3/16 after the company agreed to sell its international tobacco business for $7.8 billion to Japan Tobacco. RJR also said that its board approved a plan to separate its domestic tobacco business, R.J. Reynolds Tobac co, from its Nabisco food business.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved into record territory Tuesday, as technology shares bounced back from early weakness and Treasury bonds steadied. The dollar was little changed against the euro and yen. 

 The industrial average, which eased 8.47 on Monday after hitting a new high in the previous session, was up 67 points to 9795 in late morning trading. The blue-chip average recovered from its early lows amid strong gains for tech bellwether International Business Machines. Its shares rose 5 3/8 to 184 1/4. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 7.90 to 1290.60 after setting its own record on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 28.60 to 2426.25 Tuesday and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 2.10 to 606.20. Both remained well below their all-time closing highs. 

 Monday's tech-driven rally stalled early Tuesday following a profitwarning from Advanced Micro Devices, which reported after the close of trading Monday that it would post a "significant" first-quarter operating loss because it missed, by at least a half-million units, its target of shipping 5.5 million K6-2 processors in the quarter. The chip maker also said it will cut 300 jobs. Its shares slumped 1 7/8 to 17 1/16. 


  An Ounce Of Caution Outweighed By Enthusiasm



The warning heralded the kick-off of the dreaded preannouncement
season, when companies warn analysts and shareholders that earnings for
the current quarter are running short of expectations. With most major
market indicators trading at record levels and the Dow industrials
flirting with the 10000 milestone, traders said the warning was enough
to inject an ounce of caution in the market.



But the tech sector quickly regained its footing as investors switched
their attention to other developments in the group.
   "There's a lot of enthusiasm in the market over Intel's settling
their suit with the FTC, and now there also some speculation that
Microsoft is looking into settling its suit," said Boynton Hussey,
market strategist at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in Dallas.
   Intel agreed to settle charges that it used monopoly power to bully
customers with which it had patent disputes. The world's largest chip
maker avoided a lengthy trial that would have aired rough tactics it
uses against competitors.
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's shares jumped following a report in the
Seattle Times that the company may be exploring a settlement of its
antitrust case. Intel's shares rose 1/4 to 119 7/8, while Microsoft's
stock surged 4 1/4 to 163 1/4.



Wall Street also was encouraged after the bond market recovered from
an early slide that briefly lifted interest rates on the bellwether
30-year Treasury bond above 5.6%. Bonds steadied in response to a report
on fourth-quarter nonfarm productivity that helped to allay fears that
the economy is in danger of overheating. The data, which follows on the
heels of a benign employment report on Friday, provided further evidence
that the U.S. economy continues to grow at a healthy clip without
spurring inflation.



Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is slated to give a
luncheon address at the Fed's Business Access to Capital and Credit
Conference in Arlington, Va., Tuesday. Market participants will listen
closely to his remarks for any hints about the direction of short-term
interest rates.



World-wide, stocks rose in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock
Index was up 1.41 to 206.14 as of 11 a.m. EST.



In major market action: Stocks rebounded. On the New York Stock
Exchange, where 274 million shares traded, 1,370 stocks declined a nd
1,290 advanced.



Bonds steadied. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up less than
1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of its price, stood at 5.59%.



The dollar idled. It was quoted at 121.67 yen and $1.0865 to the euro,
compared with 121.57 yen and $1.0885 to the euro late Monday in New
York.

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Stocks edged lower early Tuesday, weighed down by a profit warning in the technology sector and rising Treasury bond yields. The dollar was little changed against the euro and yen. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which eased 8.47 on Monday after hitting a new high in the previous session, was down 26 points to 9701 a half hour after the opening bell.

 Boynton Hussey, market strategist at Rauscher Pierce Refsnes in Dallas, noted, however, that the market overall was seeing a healthy rotation from one sector to another, rather than the wholesale profit-taking one might expect following a high-profile profit warning from one of the tech giants. 

 Some of the gloom in the technology sector was lifted by welcome news from bellwethers Intel and Microsoft. "There's a lot of enthusiasm in the market over Intel's settling their suit with the FTC and now there also some speculation that Microsoft is looking into settling its suit," Hussey said. Intel's shares eased 3/8 to 119 5/16, while Microsoft's stock surged 3 3/16 to 162 1/8.

 CompUSA shares fall after  profit warning .

 NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - After CompUSA Inc.  bought the ailing Computer City franchise from Tandy Corp  last summer, it looked like it would reign supreme as the premier U.S. computer superstore. 

 That status does not guarantee profits, however. 

 CompUSA is projecting a loss for the third quarter ending March 27, 1999 and the following quarter after plunging computer prices hurt sales and gross margins, the company said in a statement issued after the stock market closed on Thursday. 

 During a positive day for stocks, CompUSA is the leading percentage loser on Friday with its shares falling 28.89 percent, or $2.4375 to $6.00 a share. 

 CompUSA shares traded as high as $19.9375 a share as recently as Sept. 22, 1998. 

 Analysts from CS First Boston, Salomon Smith Barney, Goldman Sachs, NationsBanc Montgomery, and Lehman Brothers rushed to cut investment opinons of the stock on Friday. 

 A Lehman Brothers memo says that CompUSA has been hurt by slowing coprorate sales, as well as losing market share to direct sellers, such as Dell Computer Corp.  and Gateway Inc. , online sellers and consumer electronics retailers. 

 Harry Katica, Prudential Securities analyst, said the primary cause of the loss is the slowdown in the corporate market, which accounts for about 25 percent of its sales. Corporate clients prefer more sophisticated machines, which carry higher-than-average pricetags. 

 Some of the slowdown in corporate purchases is attributed to the millennium bug that makes computers unable to read the year 2000 properly, Katica said. 

 The sub-$1,000 personal computer market remains good, but Katica said CompUSA has not been quite as effective in marketing the low-cost PCs compared to Best Buy Co. Inc.  or Circuit City Stores Inc. 

 Former Computer City stores have dragged on the company's results, but Katica said they "gradually appear to be turning a corner." 

 "They are not killing profitability of CompUSA like they had been at Tandy," Katica said. ((William Borden, 212 859-1708, fax 212 859-1717, or bill.borden@reuters.com)).

 Israeli Delta Galil U.S. Issue Seen Aimed At Raising Profile

 JERUSALEM (Dow Jones)--Israeli textile manufacturer Delta Galil Industries Ltd.'s (C.DGL) plans for an equity offering in the U.S. is partly aimed at increasing its U.S. market penetration, analysts said. 

 Long a supplier to trendy U.S. retail chains, the company isn't well-known overseas as a stand-alone name. It's vulnerable to a high dependence on sales to Marks & Spencer of the U.K. and faces competition from Asian producers, analysts said. 

 But they said the company has a strong potential, riding on a solid reputation and its ability to draw on regional cooperation to cut costs. 

 Delta Galil is currently conducting an overseas road show and plans to offer 20.4% of its equity in late March, with an option to enlarge the flotation by 15% if it is oversubscribed. The company hopes to raise $40 million to $45 million in the offering, which is being managed by Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Co., ING Baring Furman Selz LLC. 

 "Delta Galil wants to be considered a global company and as such they have to have access to global capital markets," said Martin Geifman, an analyst at Nessuah Zannex Securities Ltd. 

 Delta Galil officials wouldn't be interviewed during the quiet period preceding the company issue. 

 Delta Galil manufactures a broad range of upscale textile products, from women's lingerie to baby clothes and leisure wear. The company's client list in the U.S. includes The GAP, Victoria's Secret and J. Crew, along with designer labels Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Donna Karan. Sales to the U.S. amounted to 16% of all proceeds in 1998, up from 13% in 1997. 

 But while GAP underwear may sport a "Made In Israel" label, Delta Galil isn't a well-known name overseas, analysts said. A listing in the U.S. should raise Delta's profile there, they said. 

 "They supply to the big names but, as a private label supplier, they do have a problem with name recognition," said Geifman. 

 The share offering may also give a boost to its stock, which is thinly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. On Thursday, Delta Galil shares were trading unchanged at 39.80 shekels ($1=ILS4.0470) on a volume of ILS317,00. Market capitalization is some ILS587 million. 

 Dependence On Marks & Spencer A Possible Risk 

 In 1998, Delta Galil sold 51% of its merchandise to Marks & Spencer, which recently issued a profit warning. "If there is a risk factor for the company, it is its dependence on one major customer which has recently reported problems," said a textile analyst at Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest bank. 

 Yet Delta hopes to gain in the near term from an expected reevaluation of cost effectiveness at the U.K. chain, increasing sales to Marks & Spencer because its prices undercut competitors, analysts said. "They present the Marks & Spencer story as working to their benefit - which is all fine unless Marks & Spencer is hit really hard," said Amit Tessler, analyst at Ofek Securities and Investments in Tel Aviv. 

 Delta Galil's net profits rose to ILS74.6 million in 1998 from ILS51.8 million in 1997, largely due to the lowered labor costs and a slight rise in foreign sales. A stronger focus on Delta Galil's popular line of women's lingerie should also strengthen profits in the future, analysts said. 

 Revenues rose only slightly to ILS1.26 billion from ILS1.33 billion in 1997, after Delta Galil sold an Israeli intimate apparel chain, discontinued sales of Lee brand jeans and Arad Towels merchandise and stopped manufacturing football jerseys. 

 Company Capitalizes On Mideast Peacemaking 

 Delta Galil's share issue stands to benefit from the company's reputation of providing quality merchandise to well-known clients, analysts said. But "there are comparable companies in the Far East, and the pricing they get in New York could be pressured just due to the fact they're not the only ones out there," Geifman said. 

 Yet Delta Galil still maintains an advantage by being a full-service provider, doing everything from weaving and dyeing its own cloth to designing and marketing finished products, he said. 

 Delta Galil is also known as the first Israeli textile company to reap a so-called "peace dividend," taking advantage of Mideast peacemaking to move factories to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, where lower costs have helped boost profits. 

 "Delta Galil has already been doing for four years what other suppliers are beginning to do now," the Bank Hapoalim analyst said regarding the relocations. 


"What is interesting is that they identified the trend early and
carried it out on a large scale," the analyst said, noting other Israeli
textile companies have since followed. Delta Galil manufactured 53% of
its products in Israel in 1998, down from 60% in 1997, and plans to
reduce it to below 50% in 1999.

 3Com Blames  Profit Warning  On Slower Sales

 3Com Corp.'s Chairman Eric Benhamou blamed "an unexpected slowdown" in sales to businesses in the U.S. and Latin America for the company's warning that it wouldn't meet analyst's targets for quarterly revenue and earnings. 

 Mr. Benhamou also cited slower-than-expected personal-computer sales. 3Com, of Santa Clara, California, makes modems and networking devices that fit inside PCs. 

 Mr. Benhamou, who is also 3Com's chief exective, told analysts in a conference call that sales to businesses slowed sharply in January and recovered slightly in February. "There was a weakness beyond seasonality," he said in an interview. 

 Mr. Benhamou said 3Com appears to have been a victim of the same sluggish sales affecting PC makers such as Compaq Computer Corp. and distributors such as Ingram Micro Inc. "There's no evidence the issue is specific to 3Com," he said. 

 3Com said it expected to report operating income of about 23 cents a share for the third quarter ended Feb. 26, more than one-third below the 36 cents a share that analysts had been expecting, according to First Call Corp. 

 Quarterly revenue should be between $1.41 billion and $1.415 billion, 3Com said. That would be a decline from the $1.54 billion in revenue in 3Com's second fiscal quarter, which ended Nov. 27, the first such drop in five quarters. Analysts had been expecting revenue between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 

 The announcement confirmed suspicions that first surfaced on Wall Street in early February, when several analysts warned of slowing sales. Mr. Benhamou played down those worries in an interview two weeks ago. He now said that 3Com's problems didn't become clear until the final days of last month. 

 Still, the concerns have had a devastating effect on 3Com's stock, which has lost more than 40% of its value since Feb. 1. 3Com made its announcement after the U.S. stock markets closed on Tuesday. Earlier, shares fell $3.6875 to $27 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 3Com's shares were halted in after-hours trading. In late morning trading on Wednesday, 3Com shares were at $23.6875. 

 "They had some fundamental problems in the quarter," said Joseph Bellace, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Co. "February is the weakest seasonal quarter, and any problems that surface get magnified."

 FOCUS-SAirGroup sees hard 99 after 98 gains.

 ZURICH, March 3 (Reuters) - SAirGroup, the parent of airline Swissair, on Wednesday posted a 11.4 percent rise in 1998 net profit to 361 million Swiss francs ($247.8 million), but forecast the current year would be difficult. 

 Chief Executive Philippe Bruggisser said he hoped the airline and service company's 1999 results would still be able to match 1998 figures, which were within analysts' expectations. 

 "We can see...that the good times are over," Bruggisser told a news conference announcing the results. "The airline cycle has turned negative. The Asian crisis has done its bit. The South American crisis will have its impact too." 

 An exerpt of SAirGroup's annual report said it expected pressure on margins in all its divisions in 1999. Its operating profit margin was steady at 6.2 percent in 1998. 

 But thanks to internal company programmes to address cyclical shortfalls and the European focus of Swissair's Qualiflyer Group alliance, Bruggisser said "we hope to be able to deliver similarly good results" for 1999. 

 The 1998 figures were in the mid-range of analysts' forecasts, which had put net profit at between 332 million and 391 million francs. But some analysts said the profit warning for 1999 put a damper on expectations for the current year. 

 "The numbers were good but the profit warning was the decisive point," said Dieter Winet at ABN AMRO, adding that he planned to hold his 1999 forecast for a 10 percent drop in net income to 340 million francs. 

 At 1405 GMT, SAirGroup was down nine francs or 2.83 percent at 309 francs in a generally firmer Swiss market. 

 The company's 1998 operating profit rose 6.4 percent to 700 million francs. It also proposed an unchanged dividend of four francs per registered share, reflecting a 1:5 share split in May and a move and convert certificates into registered shares. 

 SAirGroup said it did not expect last September's crash of Swissair Flight 111 off Canada's Atlantic coast to have negative financial repercussions. It said it was exerting all possible efforts to assist the families of victims and support the Canadian Transportation Safety Board in its investigation. 

 Bruggisser told reporters that SAirGroup was in talks with AMR's Corp's  American Airlines on cooperating on flights to Chicago from Zurich and Brussels. 

 "We are talking with American Airlines on a route-specific agreement between Zurich and Chicago and on behalf of Sabena between Brussels and Chicago too," he said. SAirGroup owns 49.5 percent of Belgium's Sabena . 

 Swissair has been on the lookout for possible new alliance partners. An spokeswoman said last month the company was planning a new U.S. code-sharing programme to supplement its current scheme with Delta Air Lines . 

 Swissair also has partnership deals with several other airlines through the 10-member Qualiflyer scheme, including Austrian Airlines  and Sabena. SAirGroup also owns stakes in other European airlines. 

 "We are for this year trying to consolidate our participations which we have taken in the various companies in Europe. At this time we have no plans to enhance that," Bruggisser told Reuters Television in an interview. 

 He told reporters that SAirGroup was interested in a stake in Turkish Airlines if the carrier is privatised. 

 The group said only two of its four divisions - SAirLines and SAirServices - increased their 1998 operating profit. SAirLogistics and SAirRelations posted lower operating results. 

 SAirLogistics, which handles logistics and transport, was hit by lower demand and prices due to Asia's economic turmoil. 

 SAirRelations also failed to meet its targets. "While growth could be maintained in most parts of the world, the new positions of (caterer) Gate Gourmet and Nuance Global Traders in Hong Kong were hit by the economic crisis in Asia," it said. 

 Bruggisser said the decline was under control, adding that duty-free retailer Nuance had seen positive developments for a few months. "We're confident that we've reached the turning point with Nuance," Finance Director Georges Schorderet said.

 U.S. stocks end lower, interest rates a focus.

 NEW YORK, March 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks drifted lower Wednesday, as investors focused on rising long-term interest rates and looked toward a jobs report due on Friday with hope that it will suggest the Federal Reserve's next move. 

 "There are no major catalysts in the market now, so we're left pondering what's going to happen with interest rates," said Jospeph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Gruntal. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed unofficially off 21.73 points, or 0.23 percent, at 9275.88. 

 It spent much of the day swinging around in negative territory, with a decline in the U.S. Treasury market - and the subsequent increase in the yields on Treasury bonds - adding pressure. The benchmark 30-year bond was off 1-5/32 to yield 5.7 percent. 

 "The bonds fell and stocks went down with them," said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. 

 The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index ended up 6.17 points, or 0.27, percent at 2265.20. While computer chip group Intel Corp. recovered from its sharp drop the day before and gained 4-7/8 points to 114-11/16, a profit warning from 3Com Corp.  brought more jitters to the group. 

 The S&P500 Index, a broader market gauge, ended up 2.2 points, or 0.18 percent, at 1227.7. 

 Declining stocks outpaced gains on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. 

 Amid Wall Street's decline during the day, investors were seen focusing on a big employment report from the U.S. government due to be released before the stock market opens on Friday. 

 The government data on payrolls, wages and unemployment could give an idea of whether the Federal Reserve could raise short-term rates at its next policy-setting meeting on March 30, analysts said. 

 "People have a little fear in them that (the data) could lead to higher interest rates," said Kenneth Ducey, director of trading at BT Brokerage. 

 But while Wall Street is watching for signs of a change in the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates, it mostly shrugged off some comments that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan made Wednesday about the stock market. 

 Appearing before the House Commerce Committee, Greenspan repeated his opposition to President Bill Clinton's plan to invest part of Social Security funds in stocks. 

 In making his comments, Greenspan warned about the risks of Internet stocks in particular. The discussion appeared to have little impact on Wall Street. 

 "Internet stocks are truly in their own orbit," Battipaglia said. 

 Oil and oil service stocks rose as crude oil prices firmed with a drop in petroleum prices. The American Stock Exchange's oil index gained 2.45 percent, and oil group Chevron Corp.  posted the biggest rise in the Dow, gaining 2-5/16 points to 78. 

 Another Dow stock, DuPont Co. , came under focus Wednesday on renewed talk of a possible merger with Monsanto Co.  DuPont shares fell 1-1/8 points to 50-3/8, while Monsanto shed 2-1/4 to 46-5/8. 

 Shares of Intel got a boost after Morgan Stanley Dean Witter reiterated its strong buy rating on the company. 

 The stock had come under pressure on Tuesday when another Wall Street firm, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, cut its rating on the company.

 FOCUS-Euro stocks hit by Wall St, US rate worries.

 LONDON, March 3 (Reuters) - European bourses were dragged down at the close on Wednesday as Wall Street turned lower amid uncertainty about U.S. interest rates. 

 The dollar held above 121 yen and the struggling euro dipped just below $1.09 but was a nearly a cent up from record lows this week, as markets reckoned the European Central Bank would defy political pressure and refuse to cut euro zone rates on Thursday. 

 In capital markets, European bonds ended mostly lower in uninspired trading, giving up early gains on the back of technical selling and a further slump in U.S. Treasuries. 

 Frankfurt and Paris stocks closed with heavy losses. London ended slightly down with the blue-chip FTSE index showing some disappointment over a Bank of England decision to leave UK rates on hold at 5.5 percent. 

 The Dow was down 0.4 percent as Europe closed and analysts said the market would remain cautious ahead of a U.S. jobs report on Friday, seen as a clue to whether the Federal Reserve would tighten credit. 

 Frankfurt tumbled 2.7 percent and traders said more falls were possible amid the talk of a U.S. interest rate rise and with political uncertainty over domestic tax reform. 

 Dealers said sentiment was suffering from threats by firms including utility RWE AG to take business out of Germany if the government's tax reform plans go ahead and from recent wage strife between engineering unions and employers. 

 RWE shares closed over four percent down at 37.4 euros. "Things are uncertain as it's not clear what will happen with interest rates...or with the new government," said Thomas Herbst, a trader at DT Girozentrale. 

 Worries about European interest rates also weighed on the markets and investors awaited more information on rates from Thursday's European Central Bank's monthly news conference. 

 German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has repeatedly called for interest rate cuts to stimulate the euro zone's economy and create jobs. But a Reuters poll on Tuesday predicted a rate cut would happen within three months, not in the next month. 

 In Paris, stocks ended 1.1 percemt lower with traders looking to the U.S. employment figures for a lead. 

 Alcatel closed 7.49 percent higher as its planned acquisition of Xylan sparked interest among U.S. fund managers who have largely avoided the stock since it plunged on an unexpected profit warning last September. 

 London, Europe's biggest bourse, closed with modest losses, echoing the indecisive trend on Wall Street and as the Bank of England passed up its latest opportunity to cut interest rates. 

 Profit-taking in Glaxo and other index heavyweight drug stocks dragged the FTSE 100 lower late in the session, leaving the index down 13.0 points or 0.2 percent at 6,048.3 by the close. 

 In currencies, the dollar was higher after Japan's overnight call rate sank to a near-zero record low on aggressive Bank of Japan credit-easing efforts, pushing Japan's bond yields lower and prompting yen selling. 

 There is "every reason to buy dollars and no reason to buy yen", said Ben Strauss, vice-president at Bank Julius Baer and Co. 

 European bonds had a lacklustre day. "There's no real direction. The fundamental picture still points to the downside," said a euro debt trader in Frankfurt. 

 The influence of the U.S. bond market surfaced yet again, with prices of euro issues moving up in early trading only to see the gains erased as Treasuries turned lower late in the day. -

3Com Tolls the Mournful Bell That Revenues Are Slowing; Networking giant says profits won't meet expectations

Networking giant 3Com Corp. said weak sales will take a toll on third-quarter earnings and profits are expected to fall short of Wall Street's forecasts.

In a call with analysts yesterday, 3Com said it expects net income of 23 cents a share and revenue of $1.41 billion to $1.415 billion for the third quarter, which ended February 28. Wall Street had predicted earnings of 36 cents a share.

The predicted earnings are still higher than last year's third-quarter results. 3Com reported revenue of $1.25 billion and earned 2 cents per share in 1998.

Bruce Claflin, president of 3Com, said the third quarter is traditionally 3Com's worst but that sluggish sales in the United States and Latin America hurt the company more than officials expected.

"We were surprised," Claflin said. "We had gone into the third quarter expecting higher sales and higher profitability."

But slow sales of network interface cards, PC cards and modems took a toll on earnings, Claflin said. Part of that was a post- Christmas season downturn, Claflin said, but the company is also facing stiff competition from rivals, such as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks, now part of Northern Telecom.

In response, 3Com has slashed prices on modems and computer connector cards, which has hurt revenue growth, analysts said. The company's market value has plunged by half since December.

Claflin said traditionally strong sellers such as 3Com's PalmPilot continued to do well, but sales were not good enough to overcome other third-quarter weaknesses. 3Com recently cut the price of some PalmPilots..

3Com's stock took a blow as it prepared to warn analysts about the third quarter. The stock had been sinking in recent days but fell 12 percent before trading was halted by the Nasdaq, 20 minutes before 3Com released its profit warning.

Prior to the halt, 3Com fell $3.69 to $27 in trading of 31.4 million shares. The Santa Clara company will release official quarterly results March 23.

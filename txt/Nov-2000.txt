 U.S. Treasury yields fall amid stock, slowdown fears.

 NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields pressed on with their downward march on Thursday, notching up fresh year lows as the market focused once more on the outlook for stocks after personal computer maker Gateway issued a profit warning. 

 "We are experiencing a global bond market rally on the back of evidence of slower growth, particularly in the U.S.," said Bill Sullivan, director money market research at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 

 "Evidence of slower consumer spending came overnight from Gateway and the expectations of a lower opening for stocks has pushed money into the front end of the Treasury market." 

 In early dealings, two-year Treasury notes gained 2/32 to 100 even, as their yield which moves in the opposite direction to prices, fell to 5.62 percent. Five-year notes were up 3/32 at 101-9/32, yielding 5.45 percent. 

 Benchmark 10-year notes climbed 4/32 to 101-26/32, yielding 5.51 percent. Thirty-year bonds rose 4/32 to 108-28/32, yielding 5.63 percent. 

 The Nasdaq future was off 60 at 2,469. On Wednesday the Nasdaq lost 1 percent to close at 2,706.93. 

 Gateway, the No. 4 U.S. PC maker, warned after U.S. stock markets closed on Wednesday that its fourth-quarter sales and profits would fall far short of Wall Street estimates, citing slack holiday sales that could spark a PC price war in the New Year. 

 The company said it expected to report revenue of about $2.55 billion for the fourth quarter, about equal to the same period in the previous year, and $500 million below previous estimates. 

 U.S. jobless claims are due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) along with personal income and spending. The Chicago PMI is expected at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT). 

 Yields slid on Wednesday after the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.4 percent in the July-September period, its slowest pace in four years, down from an earlier estimate of 2.7 percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP). 

 That marks a dramatic slowdown from the robust 5.6 percent pace of growth in the second quarter and all Treasuries now yield almost one full percentage point below the key federal funds overnight borrowing rate, signaling that market players are now sure the Federal Reserve will cut rates soon to keep the economy's momentum moving.

 SEATTLE, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The holidays aren't looking so happy for the technology industry. 

 In the latest of a string of bad news that analysts say bodes ill for the once-booming tech industry, computer maker Gateway Inc. on Wednesday warned of slowing sales in the crucial fourth quarter. 

 Technology stocks imploded in after-hours trading. Gateway fell 27 percent to its lowest level in 1-1/2 years, and dragged down other companies with links to the computer business. 

 Microsoft Corp. , the leading maker of personal computer software, fell almost 4 percent while top chip maker Intel Corp. , dropped almost 12 percent. 

 Gateway's announcement that operating earnings per share for the quarter could miss expectations by as much as 40 percent confirmed analyst fears of a major slowdown, formally adding PC firms to a growing list of troubled tech companies. 

 "All of them are under severe pressure. The whole sector has been whacked. And no one is going to want to sit back and differentiate who has the better business model," said U.S. Piper Jaffray analyst Ashok Kumar. 

 But it's not just computers. 

 Microchips, dot-coms, network equipment and wireless - all have been hit by factors ranging from market saturation to Europe's weak currency or overblown expectations for a sector that had so far delivered phenomenal returns to investors. 

 BEAR ESSENTIALS 

 "Technology appears to be in a bear market," Steve Milunovich, Merrill Lynch technology strategist, wrote in a note on Wednesday, ahead of the day's round of bad news. 

 "The burden of proof is on the optimists, in our view," Milunovich said. "We remain cautious with analysts now cutting ratings and estimates, a process not completed." 

 The Internet sector has been hardest hit, dropping 75 percent for the year, while computer hardware has fared little better, shedding 45 percent of its value, Milunovich said. 

 Internet plays like Web portal Yahoo! Inc. are being hit by a slowdown in ad spending. 

 Online retailers have been savaged. Stores from pet supply seller Pets.com to gardening goods Garden.com have run out of cash and shut their virtual doors. 

 Even e-tailing pioneer Amazon.com Inc. , with some $2 billion in annual sales, is buckling under pressure to boost profit margins and staunch the flow of red ink. 

 But while the demise of money-losing dot-coms with sky-high stock values has been widely expected, the trouble has hit many solid companies with billions of dollars in sales. 

 Although investors have fared better in semiconductors, up 33 percent on the year, and storage, up 32 percent, even those sectors are well off highs set earlier in the year. 

 WIRELESS WEAKNESS 

 In a harsh example of how the market can taketh away, semiconductor test and packaging services provider ChipPAC Inc. saw its shares plummet 60 percent on Wednesday, a day after it warned that fourth-quarter net income would crumble to 3 cents per share, compared with forecasts of 18 cents. 

 It cited weakness in the wireless and computing markets, weakness that is weighing heavily on the shares of mobile phone companies such as Motorola Inc. , Ericsson and Nokia . 

 Martin Reynolds, an analyst with technology consultancy Gartner Group, said the PC and wireless telephone industries might see slower growth ahead as new markets get saturated. 

 "We're selling enough cell phones every year to replace half the world's land lines," Reynolds said. "It is quite possible that they're feeling a bit of a replacement market pinch." 

 But he said such companies were still extremely strong businesses, pointing to computer chip maker Intel as an example of a company that is being unfairly punished. 

 "This is one of the most aggressive, well-managed and successful companies in the world. If they're sitting at a PE (price-earnings ratio) of 28, that tells you that the market is undervaluing them a little bit," Reynolds said. 

 NOT OVER YET? 

 But bad news continues to stream out. 

 Specialty chipmaker Altera Inc. on Wednesday had more bad news for investors, issuing its second profit sales warning in less than a month. 

 Like many other high-tech companies, Altera blamed - in part - customers who were paring their inventories now that supply isn't a problem. 

 San Jose, Calif.-based Altera said fourth-quarter sales will be little changed from the $395 million it had in the third quarter. On Nov. 1, Altera disclosed that sales failed to meet expectations in October. 

 Wednesday's warning sent its shares and those of competitor Xilinx Inc. down in after-hours trading. Altera traded at $20, down from a close of $25-15/16, while Xilinx traded at $37-2/8, down from a close of $42-15/16. 

 "If one believes that we are on the brink of a real economic downturn then semiconductor revenue growth next year could be much lower than the 26 percent we are forecasting," wrote Merrill Lynch analyst Joe Osha said in a note regarding the sell-off in communications chipmakers like Broadcom Inc. , Applied Micro Circuits Inc. and Vitesse Semiconductor Inc. . 

 But he did not agree with some, who have posited that the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry was peaking sooner than expected. 

 "There is, in sum, very little evidence that the semiconductor cycle is ending," Osha wrote. 

 Osha's Merrill colleague Milunovich said he holds out hope for several sectors, including computer services, storage, software and the so-called "supply-chain," made up of companies that automate logistics and procurement. 

 "Valuations have come down to much more attractive levels but are not screaming bargains yet," Milunovich said. 

 Gartner's Reynolds said he was bullish on the makers of networking and telecommunications equipment, saying there was no end in sight to construction of new grids for pumping oceans of data around the globe. 

 "There's no fundamental reason why that's slowing down any time soon. They are building out further and further and that's a pretty solid market that's going to continue rolling right along," Reynolds said.

 UPDATE 1-DaimlerChrysler shares at four-year low on U.S. woes.

 FRANKFURT, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Shares in DaimlerChrysler AG fell on Thursday to a fresh four-year low of 44.70 euros amid mounting shareholder disquiet over the group's ailing Chrysler unit. 

 The shares regained some ground and by 1010 GMT, when they were down 1.3 percent at 45.20 euros the DAX blue chip index was down 1.6 percent. 

 "Sentiment is bad and shareholders are selling out because of the disaster at Chrysler - and the fact that (Daimler Benz) bought it at all," said one trader. 

 The company is facing a widening investor revolt, sparked by worries about Chrysler. The group's third largest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian this week sued the company for $8 billion, alleging that shareholders were deceived over the acquisition of Chrysler in 1998. 

 That has prompted a handful of similar lawsuits from the U.S. Some German investors have also called for Chairman Juergen Schrempp to resign, regarding the Chrysler merger as detrimental to shareholder value. 

 DaimlerChrysler shares have lost about half of their value since April 1999 while the DJ Auto Stoxx index has slipped about 20 percent. 

 The situation at the U.S. unit has deteriorated more than anticipated following a $512 million loss in the third quarter. Earlier this month it was forced to issue a profit warning and Schrempp sent in a taskforce of German executives to get Chrysler back on the rails. 

 But the company has declined to quantify the losses at Chrysler and the uncertainty is taking its toll on the stock. 

 "The decline will continue until Schrempp says something definite about Chrysler and there may be no recovery until (Schrempp) goes," said the trader. 

 Many analysts say the stock could fall as low as 40 euros before a rebound.

 Companies: Gateway Shares Drop as Company Says Holiday Sales Will Miss Forecasts --- Computer Maker Issues Fourth-Quarter  Profit Warning

 SAN DIEGO -- Shares of Gateway Inc. plunged after the personal-computer maker warned that holiday sales will be weaker than expected. 

 The San Diego company said that operating income for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2000, is expected to be about 37 cents (43.2 European cents) per share, 25 cents below a consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Last year, Gateway earned 42 cents a share in the fourth quarter. 

 Gateway's shares fell $1.50, or 4.8% to close at $29.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange after an influential analyst lowered his estimates for the company. After the company confirmed the dim outlook, the stock dropped sharply in after-hours trading, falling as low as $21.50 a share, 27% below its closing price as of 4 p.m. 

 Other technology stocks fell as well. After finishing at $21.81 in regular trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Dell Computer Corp. fell to $19.25. Intel Corp. fell 11%, while both Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. dropped as well. 

 Gateway blamed its revised estimate on "considerably weaker-than-expected consumer holiday sales of personal computers." 

 "We expect consumer sales to continue ramping up this quarter, but it is now obvious to us following the Thanksgiving weekend that they will not grow sufficiently to allow us to meet previous (estimates)," Gateway chief financial officer John Todd said. 

 "The economic slowdown, coupled with ongoing shifts in PC seasonality, clearly had a significant impact on our sales over the holiday weekend. We expect these issues will continue to have an effect on overall demand over the next 12 to 18 months." 

 The company said it expects to report revenue of approximately $2.55 billion for the fourth quarter, about equal to the same period last year, and $500 million below previous estimates. 

 The computer maker also lowered its earnings guidance for 2001 to $1.89 a share, well below a First Call/Thomson Financial consensus earnings estimate of $2.28 a share. 

 Gateway, which provides built-to-order computers and support services, had total revenue of $8.65 billion in 1999. 

 Earlier, Merril Lynch analyst Steven Fortuna cut fourth-quarter revenue estimates for Gateway to $3.04 billion from $3.14 billion, but left his his fourth-quarter earnings estimate of 63 cents a share intact.

 N.Y. Stocks Stunned Again; Selling Frenzy Intensifies

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Trading levels expanded, and bearishness intensified, as high-technology stocks sagged under the latest welter of bad news about profits. 

 Shares of Gateway dropped $10.50 to close at $19, the lowest that stock has traded in more than two years, after the computer maker warned Wall Street late Wednesday that its sales had slowed dramatically, and that it wouldn't, as had been previously expected, report a profit for the fourth quarter. 

 The collateral damage proved to be considerable, as shares of other personal-computer makers suffered steep declines. Shares of International Business Machines sank 6.31 to 93.50, while Hewlett-Packard, which insisted Thursday that its outlook remains intact, lost 2.94 to 31.63. 

 For a technology market already reeling from a wave of warnings about an inventory buildup for key products, and anxiety about what that would do to profit growth, the Gateway forecast, coupled with a warning from chip maker Altera, caused a spasm of selling. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index, which came into the session 46% off its high for the year, declined 108.95 points, a drop of 4.02%, and finished at 2597.98; it marked the third consecutive session in which the index finished at a low for the year. 

 Trading activity picked up markedly, with most of the activity on the downside. On the Nasdaq market, 2.7 billion shares changed hands, the second-busiest session ever, behind the 2.88 billion on April 4 this year. On the New York Stock Exchange, a total of 1.51 billion shares changed hands, just a few million shares below the record, also set April 4. 

 "We came in, we were already in a very emotional time," Brian Belski, chief fundamental analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. "The earnings warnings gave the market a data point that it could overreact to." 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been making progress most of this week in the face of the sell-off in technology, this time capitulated to the pressure, losing 214.62 points, or 2.02%, to 10414.49. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10414.49, down 214.62. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 1,012 issues advancing, 1,882 declining and 433 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 1,498,407,970 shares, compared with 1,096,414,780 Wednesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 629.79, down 7.63. The average price per share fell 45 cents. 

 Shares of Microsoft dropped 7.69 to 57.38 on Nasdaq, as analysts worked through the implications of a slowdown in the PC market. Lehman Brothers, in a research note, warned that the slowdown could have consequences for the software giant in the fourth quarter, even though products like Windows 2000 are in fine shape. 

 Lehman also slashed its rating on shares of Intel, which fell 4.69 to 38.06 on Nasdaq, and traded near its low for the year of 35, reached Oct. 11. 

 Shares of communications chip makers shuddered in a spillover from the pessimism wrought by the warning from Altera. Shares of Applied Micro Circuits fell 2.56 to 48.44, while PMC-Sierra slid 11.33 to 92.19, and Vitesse Semiconductor lost 6.06 to 43.13, all on Nasdaq. 

 Xilinx, a close rival to Altera, lost 4 to 39 on Nasdaq, trading at its 52-week low. Lehman Brothers said it expects the chip maker to issue a warning of its own shortly, while analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Chase Manhattan and Bear Stearns all weighed in with pessimistic comments about the company. 

 "Let me tell you - if skepticism were publicly traded, it would have a very high value today," Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse First Boston, who was attending a technology conference his firm sponsored, said Thursday. 

 The pessimism wasn't limited to the technology sector, though. Some analysts questioned whether the market convulsions wouldn't show up in banking and brokerages, which collect big revenue streams from their investment banking activities on behalf of technology and telecommunications companies. 

 Shares of Bear Stearns lost 3.06 to 45.94. CIBC World Markets cut its rating on the stock of the brokerage firm, citing exposure to technology underwriting. CIBC also cut its rating on Chase Manhattan, which slipped 1.06 to 36.88. 

 The monthly totals for market averages painted a bleak portrait of market conditions during what is, traditionally, an upbeat season for stocks. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished November down 22.9%, the second-worst month on record, trailing only October 1987. The Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, meanwhile, fell 8% in the month, its worst since August 1998. The Dow industrial average, however, kept its losses to a relative minimum, off 5.1%. 

 Shares of Gap also turned weaker, falling 88 cents to 24.94, after the apparel retailer warned late Wednesday that it remained cautious about its quarterly results, owing to its dependence on holiday shopping. 

 Shares of Best Buy lost 4.06 to 25.75, sinking to another 52-week low. The consumer electronics retailer turned in sales totals for the fiscal third quarter, which included the start of holiday shopping, that lived up to expectations, but the company acknowledged that some of the success came thanks to heavy promotional activity. 

 Shares of rival Circuit City Stores eased 81 cents to 12.69, while Radio Shack dropped 3.94 to 46.88. 

 Pacific Sunwear, an Anaheim, Calif., apparel retailer, gained 3.81 to 22.25 on Nasdaq. Credit Suisse First Boston boosted its rating on the stock, after the company reported that same-store sales rose 5.1% for the four weeks ended Nov. 26. 

 Deere gained 1.81 to 40.69. UBS Warburg raised its rating on the stock of the Moline, Ill., farm machinery maker, citing an improved outlook for the company's 2002 earnings. 

 WellPoint Health Networks gained 7.31 to 107.81. Cerulean Cos., the parent of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Georgia, agreed to accept the Thousand Oaks, Calif., managed-care provider's $700 million acquisition bid. 

 DeVry lost 8.38 to 30.31. The Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., education-services provider said three graduates of DeVry Institute of Technology's Chicago campus filed suit against the company. 

 Level 3 Communications declined 3.44 to 26.88 on Nasdaq. CIBC World Markets cut its rating on the Broomfield, Colo., telecommunications service provider, saying that it doesn't believe demand for telecom capacity has been growing as dramatically as service providers have said. 

 CIBC also cut its rating on Williams Communications, which eased 1.50 to 10.88, and on Akamai Technologies, which dropped 2.19 to 28.75 on Nasdaq, and sank to a 52-week low. 

 Synopsys gained 4.13 to 39 on Nasdaq. The Mountain View, Calif., maker of design automation software reported fiscal fourth-quarter results late Wednesday that showed losses weren't as dramatic as analysts anticipated. Merrill Lynch boosted its rating on the stock. 

 Brocade Communications improved 14.19 to 167.94 on Nasdaq, after falling sharply earlier this week. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber optic switches reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday that topped Wall Street's targets, and raised its revenue projections for fiscal 2001. 

 GlobeSpan fell 5.31 to 31.31 on Nasdaq. Bear Stearns lowered its rating on the stock of the Red Bank, N.J., maker of chips for digital subscriber line applications.

Energizer issues profit warning

ST. LOUIS - The battery maker Energizer Holdings said Tuesday that its first-quarter earnings will be only 50 to 60 cents per share, much less than analysts expect, because sales have plunged from the high levels of a year earlier.

Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected earnings of 84 cents per share.

The company said sales for the October-December quarter will be 12 to 16 percent less than a year earlier. Sales were unusually high in the fall of 1999 because consumers bought batteries in case the Year 2000 computer bug disrupted electricity supplies.

Energizer, the nation's second-biggest battery maker, said retailers' efforts to cut inventories have also hurt profits. Another factor in the profit drop has been currency devaluations in key markets, it said.

Shares of the company fell $2.12, or 9.8%, to $19.62.

 STUART VARNEY, CNNfn ANCHOR, MONEYLINE: Tonight on MONEYLINE, peril on Wall Street: the markets buckle in a frightening sell-off, but stocks close off their lows. Setting off the turmoil: that warning from Gateway, more troubling news on the economy, and the ballot drama rolls in Tallahassee. 

 ANNOUNCER: This is MONEYLINE. Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney. 

 VARNEY: Good evening everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. Willow is off tonight. 

 It was a ferocious day of selling on Wall Street, closing out a November that was nothing short of a nightmare. The Nasdaq posting its sharpest monthly decline since October 1987. Though stocks came off their lows today, nearly $300 billion in market value was still wiped out. That is more than $1,000 for every man, woman and child in America. 

 This month, there`s been high anxiety over the three E`s: earnings, the economy, and the election, and it all intensified today. This time the fear centered on tech earnings after a 911 from Gateway, fresh evidence that the economy is slowing and slowing fast. And, as ballots journeyed to Tallahassee, some fear that we are risking a constitutional crisis. 

 All this a recipe for a brutal session, and brutal it was. The Nasdaq plunged 183 at its low before ending down 109, just under 2598. It was the second busiest day ever, nearly 2.7 billion shares changed hands. In November, the Nasdaq lost 23 percent. And it is worth reporting, that is the Nasdaq`s worst month since the crash of October 1987, and that`s according to Ned Davis Research. 

 As for the Dow, it hasn`t fared as badly in November, but today it tumbled 214 --that`s 2 percent. The S&P lost nearly 27 points. It closed just under 1315. In November it was down 8 percent. This nightmare month is especially disturbing because November is known as one of the best months  of the year. 

 Peter Viles tallies the damage today. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The bad news rolled across the nation from Gateway headquarters in San Diego to Wall Street. From the highways of Florida to check out lines at the Gap. Disappointing computer sales, weakness in retail, fears of a recession. Eroding confidence in Wall Street. A promise from the Gore campaign to prolong the battle for the presidency at least until December 12th. The result was a furious bout of selling. 

 BRIAN FINNERTY, C.E. UNTERBERG, TOWBIN: You call it indiscriminate selling. Selling stocks that shouldn`t be sold. Selling stocks at levels where they should be bought, not sold, because they have to sell it. So they`re selling them and they don`t care what it is. 

 VILES: Some of the selling was forced by margin calls, when investors who borrowed money to buy stocks are told to repay loan immediately, which forces more selling. Datek Online said this was, quote, "it`s busiest week ever for margin calls." Even after a late afternoon rally the damage was severe. 

 Stunned by the Gateway sales weakness, investors carpet bombed the big names of technology. Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) , Cisco (URL: http://www.cisco.com/) and Dell (URL: http://www.dell.com/) all suffered. IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) took a bit hit as did America Online. J.P. Morgan was among the damaged financials. A whiff of weakness from retailers such as  AnnTaylor (URL: N/A) and RadioShack (URL: http://www.RadioShack.com/) led to swift punishment. 

 AL GOLDMAN, A.G. EDWARDS: The market`s made up of fellow human beings and we`re all a little bit nutty, and that means our emotions go to extremes both from greed to fear. And right now there`s high level of fear which causing people to think negatively. The majority in the marketplace now thinks that we`re going to have a recession next year. 

 VILES: Much of the pessimism came from Wall Street. The list of stocks downgraded or otherwise bad mouthed by analysts included: Gateway, Dell, Intel, Micron (URL: http://www.micron.com/) , PMC-Sierra (URL: http://www.pmc-sierra.com/) , Chase Manhattan (URL: http://www.chase.com/) ,The Limited (URL: http://www.limited.com/) and Ann Taylor. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VILES: Now, this was clearly a Gateway-inspired sell-off, but Wall Street continues to be unsettled by the election gridlock in Florida. In the words of one market analyst today, at a time like this, quote, "We would like to know who our leader is." -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: That`s Peter Viles reporting. Thank you, Peter. 

 For more on the other stocks hit hard today, let`s go right to John Metaxas at the Nasdaq marketsite. You had quite a day, didn`t you John? 

 JOHN METAXAS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Surely did, Stuart. Gateway, you know, may trade over at the New York Stock Exchange, but its warning reverberated across the Nasdaq today extending fears about a slowing economy and a slow down in technology earnings. All in all, it was a day to remember here and analysts are wondering was this the capitulation. They are looking at the 2.7 billion shares that changed hands here and wondering whether that augers a bottom for the market, hoping to see signs of capitulation. 

 Perhaps they sought in the staggering ratio of new lows to new highs today -- 900 new 52-week lows versus only 47 new highs. This in a market that is down 24 percent since Election Day, 39 percent since Labor Day and 50 percent from the March highs. At our low today we did get that 50 percent correction. 

 Among the losers today were those chip stocks on several downgrades. Intel among them. Lehman Brothers downgrading them. Altera (URL: http://www.altera.com/) , Xilinx (URL: http://www.xilinx.com/) , PMC Sierra and Vitesse among the losers as well. But indeed, everything was hit here. Microsoft down 12 percent. Apple (URL: http://www.apple.com/) losing 6 percent on the day. The Internets were down. Amazon.com (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) lost 8 percent on the day. They suffered an outage. E*TRADE (URL: http://www.etrade.com/) , one of the leaders in online brokerage, down 15 percent on the day. 

 Where do we go from here? Well, many analyst are looking to the past, looking to the charts. This is a two-year chart of the Nasdaq. Some of the technicians say 2200, 2400 may be downside targets. Others, like Abby Cohen, looked to the past and say well, we have cash levels that rival those of two years ago. Valuations are attractive. She`s overweight technology stocks. She says we move higher from here. Split opinion that`s what makes a market -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: You got that right. John Metaxas at the Nasdaq market site. Thanks indeed, John. 

 Now, just to give you a sense of how painful this week has been in the market, just look at some of this week`s really truly big washouts. We have PMC Sierra, Siebel Systems (URL: http://www.siebel.com/) , Xilinx, Apple Computer, JDS Uniphase (URL: http://www.jdsunph.com/) , all of them down very significantly in just four trading sessions. 

 Take a look at the biggest of the big caps this week --Microsoft, Dell, Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) , Intel, Cisco -- they`re all down very considerably this week. A total market value loss there in the tens of billions of dollars. 

 Well, it sounds like a cliche, but for the Nasdaq over the past two years, it is accurate. The best of times followed by the worst of times. 1999 was by far the best year ever for the Nasdaq, up a whopping 86 percent. Ah, but the year 2000 has been one big reversal of fortune. If we closed out the year tonight, it would be the worst year ever  for the Nasdaq, down more than 36 percent. Where will it end? 

 Joining us now, Barton Biggs, chairman of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter`s investment management committee. Barton, welcome back, indeed. 

 BARTON BIGGS, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: Thanks, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: On the Nasdaq, are we at all close to a bottom? 

 BIGGS: Yes, I think we are pretty close. The bad news --everybody knows what the bad news now is. It`s out there. But what we need is we need some capitulation. And by capitulation, I mean we need to see real panic selling. This has been a -- really a controlled sell-off. The market goes down a lot. But it has periodic rallies that fail and I think before it`s over we`ll see real panic and capitulation with maybe the Nasdaq down at some point. I mean, maybe tomorrow, maybe some other day, 8-10 percent. 

 VARNEY: In one day? That kind of selling. You think that`s what it takes to hit that bottom and establish it firmly? 

 BIGGS: Yes, and I think from that point we could get a thousand point rally in the Nasdaq. 

 VARNEY: OK. Let`s move on, shall we. How is Morgan Stanley characterizing the state of the economy? Are you people saying we`re sliding towards  recession? 

 BIGGS: Well, now our economists are saying that we`re sliding towards a recession. Frankly, I think we`re already in a recession. 

 VARNEY: All sectors of the economy or just some specific sectors? 

 BIGGS: Well, I think -- it`s certainly the industrial part of the economy is in a recession. But I would guess that when the final numbers come out, you know, six months from now on what the fourth  quarter of this year will show, it`ll show real GDP down maybe 1 percent . 

 VARNEY: Now, Moody`s said today, and I`m quoting: "U.S. Corporate credit quality is in one of its most pronounced declines since the 1991 recession." That`s a serious issue, isn`t it? 

 BIGGS: It certainly is. 

 VARNEY: And real bad for the market going forward? 

 BIGGS: Again, the market is starting to understand all those things and if the credit situation is really that bad, it means the bear market will last longer. But that`s not going -- this market is getting very oversold. It`s not going to keep us from having a big rally. 

 VARNEY: To sum it up, though, you`re looking for a day of capitulation, major selling on the Nasdaq to establish a bottom and you think it`ll come soon? 

 BIGGS: I do. 

 VARNEY: All right, Barton Biggs from Morgan Stanley. Always a pleasure. Thanks for being with us tonight of all nights. Thank you, Barton. 

 BIGGS: Thank you, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Well, one of the e`s that`s been tormenting investors as we mentioned is the economy. There`s been a deluge of troubling news on the economy this week, sparking fears of a sharp slowdown, even a recession as you just. And today, the warning signs continued to just pour in from the employment office to the factory floor all the way through to department stores across the nation. 

 Here`s Lisa Leiter from Chicago. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you. Have a nice holiday. 

 LISA LEITER, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It may be a happy holiday just a few retailers like Talbots (URL: http://www.talbots.com/) and Sharper Image (URL: http://www.sharperimage.com/) , which rang up impressive November sales. But many retailers today delivered disappointments. Ann Taylor sales fell by almost 3 percent. Neiman-Marcus (URL: http://www.neimanmarcus.com/) by 2 1/2 percent and Dillard`s (URL: http://www.dillards.com/) by 1 percent. J.C. Penney (URL: http://www.jcpenney.com/) and Saks (URL: http://www.saksincorporated.com/) barely eked out a gain. 

 KIMBERLY GREENBERGER, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: All will not be merry this holiday season. We believe that there will absolutely be pockets of brightness as many retailers continue to execute very well. However, we do believe that there will also be many disappointments. 

 LEITER: Consumer spending in October climbed just 2/10 of a percent. The smallest gain since April. The same report showed incomes dropping unexpectedly for the first time in almost two years. And more people are filing for unemployment, new claims last week jumped to their highest level since July 1998. 

 PAUL CHRISTOPHER, A.G. EDWARDS: These numbers look a lot like other numbers we`ve seen on the economy so far this slowing period, this autumn that  suggest the economy is due for a slowing down that looks a lot like the slowing we had in 1995. There`s going to be a slowing in growth, we think, not a recession. 

 LEITER: But there are echoes of the last recession in a fresh report on Midwest manufacturing. The employment and production indexes of the Chicago Purchasing Managers are at their lowest levels in almost a decade. 

 GREG MOUNT, BANK ONE: Manufacturing is slowing down. The question is: To what rate is it slowing to. We`re coming off of a very robust period for manufacturers. The economy is growing close to 6 percent. Now they are downshifting their gears, no doubt. 

 LEITER: That is true, especially, for auto makers, tomorrow expected to report weak monthly sales. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 LEITER: The mounting evidence of a slowdown, coupled with today`s brutal stock sell-off fueled a rally here in the Chicago bond pits. Just look at those yields, Stuart. The yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.48 percent as prices jumped; and that yield on the 30- year bond is all the way down to 5.61 percent -- and those are at their lowest levels in a year and a half. 

 Now, the bond market in recent days is betting that the Fed will  act sooner rather than later to prevent a recession. The odds of a rate cut by the Fed in January have increased to 76 percent, and the bond market is now fully pricing in a rate cut by the end of first quart of next year -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: All right, that`s Lisa Leiter at the Chicago Board of Trade -- thanks, Lisa. 

 Just ahead: on MONEYLINE, a trip that may go down in history, a Ryder rental truck travels the length of Florida to help decide an American presidential election. 

 And later in the program we`ll have more on a grueling day for Gateway. In the wake of a stiff earnings warning, we`ll talk with chief executive Jeffrey Weitzen. 

 Plus, with the markets in an uproar, should we expect Alan Greenspan to save the day? We`ll check out prospects for the Fed to flex its muscle. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In the contested presidential election today, all eyes were on a Florida motorcade bringing Palm Beach County`s ballots to Tallahassee where a judge will decide this weekend whether to order another count. 

 Wolf Blitzer joins us from Washington with a wrap-up of today`s events --Wolf? 

 WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Stuart. 

 Under police escort, a yellow, rented truck carried Palm Beach County`s more than 400,000 presidential ballots to Tallahassee today. Another 600,000 ballots from Miami-Dade County are scheduled to make the  trip tomorrow. The Palm Beach ballots arrived this afternoon at the Leon County courthouse. They were placed in vaults, where they`ll be kept under guard until a court hearing on Saturday. That`s when a county judge is expected to decide on a request by Vice President Al Gore`s campaign for a count of some 14,000 disputed ballots or, if necessary, a full count of all the Palm Beach and Miami-Dade ballots. 

 There was another twist today, this one from the Republican- controlled Florida legislature: A joint committee recommended that the legislature convene a special session to pick the state`s 25 electors, a move that almost certainly would give the election to Governor George W. Bush. Gore`s running mate, Senator Joe Lieberman, criticized the committee`s recommendation, saying the state legislature should stay out of the vote dispute. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 SEN. JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (D-CT), VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We bring it to the courts for independent judgment. And to take it back to the political body, a legislative body, with a clear partisan majority there, takes us down a road that, regardless of which side we`re on in this election, America ought not to want to go down. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BLITZER: Republican George W. Bush today continued work on a transition. At his Texas ranch, Bush met running mate Dick Cheney and retired General Colin Powell, whose name has been floated as a possible secretary of  state in a Bush administration. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The reason why we`re moving forward with our discussions and our -- the transition is because when the counting finally stops we want to be prepared to lead this nation. That`s what we were elected to do. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 BLITZER: Tomorrow, the Florida vote moves to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court hears oral arguments about the Bush campaign`s challenge of hand- counted ballots in Florida. CNN will bring you special coverage of that historic court session beginning at 9:00 a.m. Eastern, 6:00 a.m. Pacific. And tonight I`ll have a special edition of "THE WORLD TODAY" live from the U.S. Supreme Court, that`s at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, 5:00 Pacific --Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Wolf, half of all American households now own stocks or bonds. And this is a large constituency. It is losing money, in part, because of the election. Do you think that the two camps aware of this emerging interest group of voters? 

 BLITZER: They`re very aware of that. Remember, early on James Baker, the former secretary of state, who is Bush`s point man in Florida -- he spoke about the uncertainty, the effect of all that uncertainty in this presidential election on the markets. What the Bush people would like to see is the uncertainty end. They`re saying that the uncertainty, once it ends, will help stabilize the market somewhat. 

 Although they don`t say that publicly, they do insist, like the Gore people that, you know, markets go up, they go down, sometimes they`re good, sometimes they`re bad and there are other factors playing into this  downward cycle that we`re seeing in the markets. At the same time, both sides recognize that, presumably there might be some good news for the markets once the president-elect is finally determined. 

 VARNEY: That`s Wolf Blitzer, and many thanks for joining us tonight. Thank you, Wolf. 

 Now, a blockbuster lineup still ahead: Abby Joseph Cohen, Gateway`s chief executive Jeffrey Weitzen, and Salomon Smith Barney`s John Manley. That`s all still to come here on MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Topping the list of stocks that fell to new 52-week lows in today`s trading -- plenty of them -- look at Gateway, check out Apple Computer, Best Buy, Level 3 Communications, and MicroStrategy, all down. 

 "The Wall Street Journal" is reporting that Pepsi is in new talks to acquire Quaker Oats (URL: http://www.quakeroats.com/) . It would be, we are told, a $14.3 billion deal. The board is meeting this weekend. There could be a firm decision, according to "The Wall Street Journal," by early next week.

The price tag: nearly $10 billion for a 16 percent stake of AT&T Wireless (URL: http://www.attws.com/) . The deal gives NTT DoCoMo instant access to the U.S. wireless market, while AT&T gets a cash infusion and a new partner in its drive to deliver mobile Internet services. AT&T Wireless shares have been on a steady decline since going public back in April and the stock barely moved on today`s news, it closed today up just a fraction at 18. 

 In tonight`s "Tech Watch," another crash for Amazon.com (URL: http://www.amazon.com/) . Its Web site shutdown at around 3:30 Eastern Time today, and for about 15 minutes, visitors were greeted with this apologetic message. The company is calling it an "internal glitch" and says it is not related to traffic on the Web site. But it is Amazon`s second site crash in this crucial  first week of the holiday shopping season. Its stock, which has its own high-profile problems, closed today at 24 11/16, it was down another 2 1/4 points. 

 And coming up on MONEYLINE: as the market spirals lower, investors are scooping defensive plays. But is it too late for you to jump in and make you some money? We`ll take a look at that when MONEYLINE continues. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: The stock market is clearly in a serious slump with tech stocks in turmoil, and investors, from the pros on Wall Street to the rest of us with 401(k)s -- we`re all wondering where the safe havens and pockets of strength really are. In the weeks ahead, we`ll be covering this aspect of the market. We call it "Getting Defensive." 

 Tonight, Fred Katayama looks at some of the old standby stocks and some of the new ones catching Wall Street`s attention. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With the storm sweeping the stock markets, many investors are turning defensive, seeking solace in old-line names, and they`ve been richly rewarded so far this year. 

 Boeing (URL: http://www.boeing.com/) and Philip Morris (URL: http://www.philipmorris.com/)  rocketed more than 60 percent. Merck yielded 38 percent. Citigroup (URL: http://www.citi.com/) returned 19 percent. And SBC Communications (URL: http://www.sbc.com/) up 13 percent. Even state utility stocks turned into studs: Exelon excelled, returning 98 percent; Reliant Energy (URL: http://www.reliantenergy.com/) and Duke Energy (URL: http://www.duke-energy.com/) rose more than 70 percent; Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) soared 46 percent. But now, some strategists argue that some defensive plays  have gotten too pricy to be defensive. 

 ELIZABETH MACKAY, BEAR STEARNS: Defensive investing certainly in the last few months has meant buying energy stocks, or utility stocks, or consumer nondurable stocks. I would argue that buying a Gillette at 30 times earnings, or Coca-Cola at 40 times earnings, at this point is not being defensive. 

 PETER CANELO, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: Investors right now don`t care whether you call a group defensive or aggressive. They care about how expensive it is. If they think it`s too expensive, they`re selling. 

 KATAYAMA: So Canelo is pushing cheap stocks like financials, on the bet that interest rates will come down. He likes retail and -- get this --technology, because they have fallen so low. Health care stocks have become a bit expensive, but he believes they could benefit under a Bush administration, because the industry may be less prone to regulation. 

 Those who want to bet on history can turn to a study by the stock research firm Leuthold Weeden: Among the best defensive performers in the past are electric utilities, followed by energy, and -- surprise -- brewers, which have outdone beverages -- perhaps those who stomached the downturn need a stiff one. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 KATAYAMA: Extremely defensive investors can always dump stocks and turn to bonds or cash. But some strategists say, why buy cash when the market appears to be near a bottom? And others say stocks should outperform since inflation remains tame -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: It would be nice to have an easy answer, wouldn`t it? 

 Thank you, Fred. 

 Now, next on MONEYLINE, one of the street`s biggest bulls comes out swinging. Hear what Abby Cohen thinks of today`s market. 

 And we`ll talk to a man whose company helped spark today`s market turmoil: Gateway`s president and chief executive, Jeffrey Weitzen. 

 Plus, in such a grim market, will the Federal Reserve chairman come to the rescue? We`ll take a special look at that one. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s headlines, Wall Street closes out November in a tailspin, capping off a terrible month with a triple-digit slide in both the Dow and the Nasdaq. Setting the mood: Gateway Computer. Its stock cut by 33 percent after a chilling profit warning. We`ll hear from Gateway`s chief Jeffrey Weitzen. 

 Plus, with the markets heading south, we`ll talk to one of Wall Street`s most renowned bulls, Abby Joseph Cohen, who says she now likes the prices of some of these beaten down tech stocks. 

 But first more on tonight`s top story: stock prices plunge, as investors close off a tough month with a dramatic sell-off. Signs of earnings gloom at Gateway cast a long shadow over the markets, leading investors to bail out of tech shares. The Nasdaq bore the brunt of the early selling, plunging as many as 183 points before cutting its loss, then ending down 109 points. That`s about 4 percent. It closed just under 2598. The volume close to 2.7 billion shares -- the second busiest session ever. 

 Well, the selling was also felt on the Dow. Blue chips dropped 214 -- the worst showing in nearly three weeks. The Dow closing out at 10414 with 1.1 billion shares changing hands. In the broader market, the S&P 500 it sank nearly 27. 

 Now just look at some of the big time movers. Microsoft plunged more than  7 1/2. Cisco down nearly 4. Intel off almost 5. JDS Uniphase gave back nearly 7 1/2. But Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) , well, it bucked the trend. It gained more than 3 1/2 points. 

 Now to the big board. Gateway plummeted $10.50. IBM down more than 6. Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) off nearly 3 and J.P. Morgan slipped 5 1/2. The energy sector slumped as well, led Enron which lost more than 5 1/2 points. 

 Well clearly, November turned into one of the cruelest months on record for the Nasdaq -- the worst month for the index since October 1987. It was  the bleakest for the S&P 500 since August 1998, when the Russian financial crisis rocked the markets. 

 Greg Clarkin looks back over a 30-day stretch that most investors will not soon forget. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It goes down as the November nightmare, the worst month for tech investors since the October 1987 stock market crash. The bottom began to drop out when it became apparent the race for the White House didn`t end on election night. Three weeks later the lack of a declared winner has been like a cold the markets can`t shake. Couple the election with earnings fears and you have the attack of the killer e`s. 

 ASH RAJAN, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: You have an earnings problem, a crisis, if you will, with technology earnings and broad based earnings for the fourth quarter and for the first quarter of next year. You have a euro currency situation that is clearly hurting us and oil prices that have been, to say the least, unstable. So, you have several dragons out there meeting together to cause this malaise, if you will, in the market. 

 CLARKIN: The Nasdaq`s first triple-digit loss in November came on the eighth, the day after the election. Two days, later another one. There were five more by today`s closing bell. In all, the Nasdaq plunged 23 percent in November. The Dow fell 5 percent and the S&P 500 8 percent. 

 Broken stocks litter Wall Street but a few stand out. Gateway plunged 63 percent in November. Investors would like to turn back the calendar on PMC Sierra. It sank 45 percent and WorldCom (URL: http://www.wcom.com/) fell 37 percent. Analysts say many of the problems that attacked the markets in November will probably stick around. The capital spending slowdown on technology is expected to linger, and many tech companies will be looking to slash prices to move product. 

 DAN NILES, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Technology is like fish, all right. You know, the longer it sits on the shelf, the worse it is and the less money you can get for it. So that`s the real issue, quite honestly, is, you know, what is the sell through of PC`s and other equipment in the fourth quarter. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CLARKIN: Niles cut his rating on a number of big name tech stocks today in the wake of that Gateway profit warning and in his research not he says his chief concern has been global... 

 VARNEY: As you can tell, that is a small technical problem. We do apologize. Now, given the sorry state of the markets, many people are looking for help from the man who guided the county through its longest boom in history. But does Alan Greenspan have the capacity and perhaps more importantly, the inclination to come to the rescue, especially when it was the Fed`s intention to cool off the economy with a series of rate hikes? 

 Allan Chernoff joins us with the outlook for Fed action -- Allan. 

 ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, with confidence in stocks eroding daily, the profit picture turning dark and fourth quarter warnings season approaching, it appears there is only one man who can save the day. One man who can bring holiday cheer to Wall Street. Yes, investors are putting their trust in Alan Greenspan. But the Fed chairman is more concerned with consumer prices than share prices. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF (voice-over): It`s ironic. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman who had criticized investors for irrational exuberance is now viewed as the stock market`s best hope for recovery. According to Wall Street`s reasoning, which can often appear counterintuitive, investors should hope for weak economic data because that would pressure the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, one move that would surely rally the stock market. 

 PETER BOOCKVAR, MILLER TATE: When people are losing money to the extent that they are right now, they want something to bail them out. And right now, the only thing that can bail us out is Alan Greenspan cutting rates and regenerating this economy again. 

 CHERNOFF: Already, bond traders are looking for a change in tone at the Fed next month, away from a tightening bias back to neutral. Futures traders are betting a rate cut could come in March. And, a ray of hope came today from the usually-hawkish president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve, William Poole, who said: "I would want to respond if it looked like financial market events are feeding in to affect the real 

 economy in an adverse way." 

 But, while it is clear the economy is slowing down, the Fed`s primary concern is fighting inflation which is why the central bank has raised interest rates six times since June of 1999. Only two weeks ago the Fed`s open market committee said it continues to see a risk of heightened inflation pressures as it maintained a bias towards tightening. Bill Sullivan warns stock market investors should not pin their hopes on the Fed. 

 BILL SULLIVAN, MORGAN STANLEY DEAN WITTER: Clearly, the Fed is not as aggressively disposed to cutting rates as I think the investment community believes. I think right now, the Fed is on hold regarding their interest rate targets for at least several more months. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 CHERNOFF: The Fed`s policy-making committee is worried most about high energy prices and the tight labor market. Crude oil remains well above $33 a barrel. And while jobless claims have been creeping up, economists say the Fed still needs to see a real slowdown in job creation. So, Fed watchers say it is highly unlikely that Alan Greenspan and his band of central bank governors are going to come to the stock market`s rescue any time soon. And Stuart, the next policy meeting is on December 19th. 

 VARNEY: All eyes on December 19th. 

 CHERNOFF: Oh, yes. 

 VARNEY: Allan, thanks very much. 

 All right, the dismal state of the markets did not stop one of Wall Street`s most prominent bulls today from forecasting better times ahead. Abby Joseph Cohen, U.S. Market strategist at Goldman Sachs, issued a note recommending buying tech shares, but that statement did little to stem today`s sell-off. 

 Earlier this afternoon I spoke with Abby Cohen and began by asking her whether the market`s losses actually represent a buying opportunity. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 ABBY JOSEPH COHEN, GOLDMAN SACHS: I think a buying opportunity is certainly developing and in some sectors of the market it is already here. We see some very good and interesting valuations for companies where the prospects are good. 

 VARNEY: Now, what sectors of the market would you say this buying opportunity has already arrived? 

 COHEN: We see some very interesting opportunities in financial services companies. Now, we even see it in selected areas of technology --something we could not say earlier this year. 

 VARNEY: Are you talking about some of those very, very big name leaders on the Nasdaq that have been chopped in half? 

 COHEN: We are talking about some of them, Stuart. We see that their P/E ratios have come down not just because the share price is down but because their earnings have continued to grow. 

 VARNEY: Are you sure we`re not headed for recession? 

 COHEN: One can never say never, but I think the likelihood of recession is extremely remote in the United States this coming year. We believe that we are seeing a very sharp deceleration. The economy was growing more an 8 percent a year ago. We think it`s now growing at a rate closer to 3 percent. It feels bad, but we think it is a good rate of growth that will lead to more jobs and profit growth that can last a long time. 

 VARNEY: If you had fresh cash to invest, how much of it would go into technology stocks right now? 

 COHEN: In our model portfolio, which is geared to the S&P 500, we`re saying 35 percent in a combination of technology and telecom. And that is somewhat above what the actual market weighting is right now. 

 VARNEY: You`re fairly bullish. Can you quantify it? Give us some numbers. Where are we headed on the Nasdaq and the Dow in the short-term to intermediate term? 

 COHEN: We do all of our valuation work on a 6 to 12 month perspective and we think the S&P 500 will be a fair value at about 1650, and that, of course, is noticeably above today`s close. 

 VARNEY: Abby Joseph Cohen, a pleasure. Thanks for being with us again. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 VARNEY: For Abby`s forecast of 1650 on the S&P to hold up, the index would need to rise 25 percent over the next six to 12 months. So far this year, it is down 10 percent. 

 Coming up on MONEYLINE, Gateway loses a third of its value just today. Were sales that bad Thanksgiving weekend? We`ll go directly to the source for the answer, Gateway`s president and chief executive Jeffrey Weitzen. He`s next. Stay with us please. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: In tonight`s MONEYLINE "Focus": Gateway and the outlook for the entire PC industry. 

 Gateway shares plunged more than 30 percent today, its worst session ever, investors pummeling the stock after the company released a bleak earnings forecast last night. Gateway said that earnings would fall way short of expectations this quarter and for all of next year. The company said that sales over the Thanksgiving weekend were very disappointing and  that sent waves of fear throughout the PC business and the stocks suffered as a result -- just look at this: Apple down more than a point, Compaq off $1.20, Dell losing more than 2 1/2 points today, and just look at IBM, down over 6, Hewlett-Packard off almost 3. 

 But does the news out last night really spell trouble for the whole industry, or just Gateway? 

 Steve Young joins us now with more on that one -- Steve. 

 STEVE YOUNG, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, I spent the day doing what many analysts were doing, talking with a range of companies to see if they agree that the consumer PC holiday selling season is turning out to be dismal -- several of them don`t. 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG (voice-over): Despite Gateway`s startling guidance that its fourth quarter sales will fall short by a half billion dollars, a slowdown in consumer PC sales may not be universal. 

 RadioShack, for example, says holiday sales of consumer PCs, it carries Compaq, are strong. Best Buy, which sells Compaq (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) as well as Micron, eMachines (URL: http://www.e4me.com/) and Hewlett-Packard PCs, says it`s having a good holiday season, especially with more expensive notebook computers. And J&R Computer in New York City, which sells all major brands, told MONEYLINE it`s having a good selling season, too. 

 Analysts are still trying to figure out what the Gateway warning portends for sales and PC stocks in the weeks ahead. 

 STEVEN FORTUNA, MERRILL LYNCH: Gateway particularly has a lot of exposure to the consumer, about 60 percent of its revenue mix comes from consumer, and clearly, if people are slowing down in their buying of PCs, Gateway feels the pinch the most; also Compaq, but to a lesser extent. We think Dell actually is by far the most immune to such a slowdown, but obviously is falling in sympathy as well. 

 YOUNG: The only PC chief executive to surface, Hewlett-Packard`s Carly Fiorina, said HP is on track to hit its growth projections for 2001. She sees some consumer softness, but added: "We are still experiencing growth over fiscal sales levels, and our sales this Thanksgiving week were ahead of last year." 

 ART RUSSELL, EDWARD JONES: I talked to Compaq today, they haven`t changed any of their guidance. But, you know, it`s still a mystery as to why Gateway would be down so sharply and why they are making that call based on just one weekend of data. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 YOUNG: Gateway may yet be right that consumer PC sales will be blue all over, or maybe, as one analyst suggested, Gateway was too focused on making money from financing, providing Internet service and bundles of software and training, and not focused enough on unit sales of PCs themselves -- Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Steve Young, thanks very much. 

 All right, joining us now with more on the company and its outlook, Gateway`s president and chief executive, Jeffrey Weitzen. 

 Jeffrey, welcome back to MONEYLINE. 

 JEFFREY WEITZEN, PRESIDENT & CEO, GATEWAY: Thanks, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: We just heard that Compaq, Dell, the other computer makers are not projecting as serious a problem as you are. 

 Have you got a problem that`s specific to Gateway? 

 WEITZEN: Well, the first thing I should point out is that a number of our competitors have already lowered estimates for fourth quarter as well as 2001. In fact, some of those competitors have lowered those estimates as many as two or three times over the course of the last couple of months, and this is the first signal that we have given. 

 You know, we did see a very tough weekend over Thanksgiving weekend. We recognize that it`s early in the quarter to call. But we felt that we owed it to our share owners to let them know that we did see some fairly significant softening over Thanksgiving weekend, and that was important for us to communicate that for not only this quarter, but the potential outlook, and be conservative over the course of the next year. 

 VARNEY: Jeffrey, in hindsight, are you happy that you made this call based on the evidence of one weekend, the Thanksgiving weekend? In hindsight, would you do it again? 

 WEITZEN: Well, you know, I think that when the dust settles, people will recognize a few things. One is that we do have a very strong business model. People will see that this year we have increased net income by 25 percent, even stronger than our growth last year. And I think  that being conservative is very, very consistent with our values of communicating early and being open and honest with the market. And I do believe that when the dust settles, people will recognize that, and I think today was probably a pretty dramatic over- reaction. 

 VARNEY: Now, part of the problem is clearly the slowing economy, but the other side of the coin is the shift away from the PC desktop market toward hand-held computing gadgetry. 

 Now, are you satisfied, with your product lineup, that you are in this expanding area of the market, which is the non-PC sector, but the mobile computing? Are you happy with your product lineup going forward? 

 WEITZEN: As a matter of fact, we are. First of all, we`re very happy with the product line that`s out there right now. We have a great product lineup. We`re very competitively priced. Our marketing and communications is good. You know, we don`t have issues from a pricing standpoint, so we`re very satisfied with that. 

 In addition to that, over the last couple of weeks, we have also announced a range of new products, ranging from Internet appliances, to music appliances, to hand held devices as well. So we are absolutely expanding into those other areas. We`ll continue to add to that product line in 2001. We think we have a very solid story and a great lineup of products. 

 VARNEY: Jeffrey Weitzen, you had a very difficult day today, but we thank you indeed for appearing with us tonight on MONEYLINE. 

 Thank you, Jeffrey. 

 WEITZEN: Thank you. 

 VARNEY: A lot more MONEYLINE still to come. We will be back in one minute. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: Late breaking news tonight from "The Wall Street Journal" about one of the hottest properties in the food and beverage business, and that is Quaker Oats. The "Journal" is reporting that PepsiCo is once again in advanced talks to acquire Quaker, with its highly-valued Gatorade brand. The reported price tag from the "Journal": 2.3 Pepsi shares per Quaker share. Well, that works out to more that $104 per share or $14.3 billion total. The boards of both companies are expected to meet this weekend to vote on the deal -- that, again, is according to "Journal." Quaker stock has been on a roll recently as Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Danone have reportedly vied for Quaker. It closed today  just below $87 a share. 

 In our sector focus tonight, one of the few bright spots in today`s market turmoil: healthcare stocks. WellPoint (URL: http://www.wellpoint.com/) saw its shares rally more than seven on news that it beat Trigon Healthcare (URL: http://www.trigon.com/) in the bidding war for Cerulean. It will pay $700 million for the privately-held insurer. Even Trigon HealthCare was a winner today, it gained over four points, helped, in part, by positive comments from Bear Stearns. And fellow managed health care firms, CIGNA (URL: http://www.cigna.com/) and Oxford Health Plans (URL: http:/www.oxhp.com/) also up on the day. Cigna gained $6.76; Oxford rose 2 1/2 points on the day. 

 Just ahead, what, may we ask, is the outlook for the markets tomorrow? We`ll ask John Manley. He will have the last word on this wild market -- he joins us next. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: On Thursdays we usually bring you the hot trends in the job market in our "Workplace 2000" segment. But in light of today`s upheaval, we`ll 

 do something different -- and what an upheaval it has been: The Dow and the Nasdaq way down today and, indeed, way down for the month of November. Next question: Where to tomorrow morning? 

 Here`s John Manley to give us an answer to that one. John is with Salomon Smith Barney. 

 John, there are a lot of people watching this program who want an answer to the following question: Should I buy those big-name, beaten-down tech stocks first thing tomorrow morning -- should I jump in tomorrow? Do you have an answer? 

 JOHN MANLEY, SALOMON SMITH BARNEY: The answer is, I think you want to start looking pretty darn soon. I don`t know if it`s tomorrow -- it won`t  be the day after tomorrow, or next week, but we`re very close, I think. We`ve really pushed these things pretty hard. Tax selling abates pretty soon; and don`t forget there are positive sides to a slowing economy as well. 

 VARNEY: I know you can`t put a number on a bottom here, but what would it take for us to reach a bottom? What would you want to see to achieve that? 

 MANLEY: I don`t think it`s going to be a number -- I don`t think it`s a certain price because valuation doesn`t have that much to do with  it. You have to have some sign that the economy is stabilizing. What people are beginning to worry about right now is that it`s spinning out of control. I think those thoughts are premature, but you`ve got to give people a sense of stability -- that the downturn doesn`t spiral down. 

 VARNEY: I hate to say this, but following this dreadful year, I`ve got to say that the analysts and the strategists don`t look particularly good this year, now, do they? 

 MANLEY: No and... 

 VARNEY: Sorry, John. 

 MANLEY: You know, we had five good years, and it goes back and forth. We always do the best we can, but it`s been a tough year. I think it`s been a tough year because there were so many twists and turns to it. What you do is you keep on looking for opportunities; that`s the only way to approach the market. 

 VARNEY: Do you think we`ll get a relief rally when the election is finally decided? 

 MANLEY: I think it`s one of the things that could help. I don`t think it`s the main cause of the problem, so I don`t think it pulls us up. We need some sense that the economy is about the stabilize, that it`s not going to spin out of control. 

 VARNEY: Well, would we get a relief rally if Mr. Greenspan makes any kind of speech or presentation saying he recognizes the slowing economy? 

 MANLEY: Absolutely... 

 VARNEY: Right immediately -- the moment he speaks? 

 MANLEY: Absolutely; as the words leave his mouth I think the market would start to rally. We want some sense the Fed has got a commitment. 

 You know, if we have a hard landing, which I don`t think we will -- but if we do, if you go back and look at prior hard landings, `90 and `82, once the Fed started to move to stop the down-draft the market had, effectively, come fairly close to its bottom. In `82 it was about 5 or 10 percent, in `90 there was almost no risk. 

 VARNEY: Do we get a market plunge if we go flat out into a constitutional crisis -- and by that I mean a direct clash between the legislature and the judiciary branch of governments? 

 MANLEY: I don`t think so. It would just accelerate the process. You`ve have to have some sense the economy was decelerating without help to make that happen. 

 VARNEY: John Manley, always a pleasure, thanks for being with us. 

 MALEY: Thanks, Stuart. 

 VARNEY: Up next, "Ahead of the Curve," some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open again tomorrow. You are watching MONEYLINE. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 VARNEY: And here`s just some of what could move the markets tomorrow: Watch for several reports on the economy, starting with construction spending figures for October; and the National Purchasing managers Report, the NAPM, very important, the November numbers expected to show manufacturing contracting again. Also due out, auto sales for November, watch out there, too. 

 And that is MONEYLINE for this Thursday. I`m Stuart Varney, good night from New York.

 Stewart Enterprises Issues  Profit Warning , Cites Lower Cemetery-Plot Sales

 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

 METAIRIE, La. -- Funeral-home chain Stewart Enterprises Inc. slashed its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings estimate, citing lower sales of cemetery plots, vaults and gravestones. 

 Stewart Enterprises (STEI) said it now expects to earn eight cents to 11 cents a share for the quarter ended Oct. 31. The company had previously estimated earnings for the period at 15 cents to 17 cents a share. 

 Analysts were looking for earnings of 16 cents a share in the quarter, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 For the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company reported net income of about $16.6 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of about $189.9 million. 

 Stewart said its domestic funeral business continued to perform well and in line with expectations in the fourth quarter, but a decline in so-called preneed sales of cemetery plots hurt revenue and earnings. 

 Stewart and Service Corp. International, another major player in the U.S. funeral industry, had warned earlier this year that a requirement by the Securities and Exchange Commission to defer recording revenue from preneed sales could reduce their revenue and net income. 

 Under the old practice, funeral and cemetery operators recorded revenue from preneed sales at the time of the sale, although buyers might put down as little as 5% of the cost and pay the rest over a period of years. 

 Stewart said the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 in December 1999, after the company's estimates for fiscal 2000 had been prepared. Stewart and others in the industry held discussions with the SEC to determine what effect the requirement would have on accounting for preneed sales, and at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Stewart "significantly" reduced the commissions paid on preneed services and merchandise that it believed will not be recognized as revenue until delivery under SAB 101. 

 "This had the effect of considerably reducing preneed sales," the company said in a statement Wednesday. "It further affected overall preneed sales as it influenced morale and caused turnover within the sales force. 

 "Had management not de-emphasized preneed merchandise and cemetery-service sales, the company believes that it would have reported results for fiscal year 2000 in the range originally expected," Stewart said. 

 The company now estimates fiscal 2000 earnings of 61 cents to 64 cents a share, well below the current Wall Street estimate of 69 cents a share. 

 Net income for fiscal 1999, which ended Oct. 31, 1999, was $40.4 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of about $756.1 million. 

 William E. Rowe, chief executive officer, said the company expects to generate cash from operating activities of at least $70 to $75 million for fiscal year 2000 compared to $16 million for fiscal year 1999, "and we continue to consider the possible sale of certain foreign assets and other noncore assets." 

 Stewart owns and operates 627 funeral homes and 163 cemeteries in North America, South America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. 

 The company has an outstanding debt balance of $928 million.

 Unexpectedly strong U.S. retail sales on "Black Friday" -- the day after Thanksgiving, which is viewed as a make it or break it day for retailers and one that puts them in the black -- was followed up by a happy Monday as retail stocks soared almost across the board. 

 A handful of top U.S. retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Sears, Roebuck & Co., reported strong sales gains over the critical Thanksgiving weekend. Those better than expected results sent Wal-Mart shares (WMT/NYSE) up US$4 1/8 to US$49 5/16, and Sears shares (S/ NYSE) up US$2.13 to US$32.01, to lead the entire sector higher. 

 Some analysts called it a relief rally. "There was weakness in October and November but it looks like it has stopped," said Gary Balter, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. 

 "The expectation coming today is that we don't have to do adjustments for the quarter that had been expected." 

 However, other analysts noted that the promotions and discounts that apparently stimulated the good numbers may cut into margins. 

 Retail analysts from both Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman Sachs & Co. said yesterday they were cautious about the holidays, particularly on specialty apparel retailers such as Gap Inc. and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. 

 Despite the cautious tone, Gap shares (GPS/NYSE) were up 9.2%, or US$2 5/16, at US$27 5/16, while Abercrombie shares (ANF/NYSE) climbed 7% before unwinding to close up 11/16 at US$29 5/8. 

 Investors similarly shook off a profit warning issued by Dillards Inc. The stock (DDS/NYSE) climbed 5/16 to US$11 1/4, even after the company said profits would fall because of a weak retail environment. 

 Electronics retailer RadioShack Corp. was a big winner yesterday after it said sales over the weekend exceeded expectations, driven by demand for digital audio, video and communications products. 

 The Fort Worth, Tex.-based company said because of the strong sales seen throughout the month of November, its same-store sales could rise by double digits. Last November gains were 17% so the company faces a difficult comparison. 

 The news sent shares of RadioShack (RSH/NYSE) surging 8.6%, trading up US$4 1/4 at US$53 1/2. 

 Online retailers saw support from the U.S. Commerce Department after it issued a report yesterday showing a healthy e-tail sector heading into the holiday shopping season. 

 Online purchases of goods -- including books, clothes and toys -- jumped 15.3% from the second quarter to US$6.373-billion in the third quarter, even as total retail sales fell 0.4%, according to the Commerce Department. 

 However, the news failed to boost the stock of bellwether Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc. The shares (AMZN/NASDAQ) fell 15/16 to US$28.

 GERMAN CASH AND THE HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION SLATE 

 FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, HOLLYWOOD HAS BEEN SWALLOWING GERMAN CAPITAL LIKE AN OVEREXUBERANT AMERICAN TOURIST GUZZLING BEER AT OKTOBERFEST. UNPRECEDENTED SUMS OF MONEY -- SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS WORTH -- from public companies and private investment funds have made their way from Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin into Los Angeles accounts. But Hollywood's new cash cow could be running dry. The collapse of Germany's media-heavy Neuer Markt index and a change to the country's tax laws may spell the beginning of the end of today's Teutonic boom. 

 On Friday, Nov. 17, the Neuer Markt index, Germany's answer to the NASDAQ, dropped to 3,482 points, a new record low for the year and just 40% of what the index was worth at its peak in March. Two weeks ago, traders were talking about a year-end rally. Now most are just hoping there won't be a winter sale. 

 The Neuer Markt's woes could soon become Hollywood's because the index -- Frankfurt's high growth equivalent to the NASDAQ -- has been the motor behind the recent German cash boom. Consider the following: 

 Powered by market equity, Munich merchandiser and kids TV producer EM.TV paid $680 million for Jim Henson Co. and snapped up a majority stake in Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One racing circuit. 

 Kinowelt Medien bought 20% of Canadian giant Alliance Atlantis, signed an output deal with Warner Bros. and arranged first-look or co-financing deals with Gale Anne Hurd's Valhalla Prods., Harvey Keitel's Goatsingers and veteran producer Robert Rehme. 

 Munich-based rights buyer Helkon Media acquired Beverly Hills financier Newmarkt Capital Group, dropped an estimated $50 million into John McTiernan's "Rollerball" remake, backed the Leslie Nielsen vehicle "2001: A Space Travesty" and signed output deals with John Fremes' Fusion International and Intermedia. 

 Video distributor Splendid Medien bought 49% of Graham King's Initial Entertainment Group (with an option for an additional 2% next year). It sunk $60 million into Martin Scorsese's Leonardo DiCaprio starter "Gangs of New York," backed Robert Altman's "Dr. T and the Women" and Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic," as well as "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys," starring and produced by Jodie Foster. And Splendid signed a two-year co-financing and co-production deal with Catherine Zeta-Jones' Milkwood Films. 

 In a recent deal, Munich-based Cineartists, a film-financing outfit set up last year by Phillip Kreuzer and Wieland Schulz-Keil, will take a major stake in Peter Guber's Mandalay Pictures. Despite the current market slump, Guber and Kreuzer, who will be majority shareholders in the new venture, plan to take the new company public on the Neuer Markt in January. Another German partner -- film production fund KG Medien --will provide additional financing, extending its long-standing co-production agreement with Mandalay. 

 Under the new arrangement, Mandalay could see as much as $250 million in co-financing over the next three years. 

 Over the past 12 months, it seems nearly every big-name Hollywood producer has linked up with a Neuer Markt company in some form of co-production or co-financing agreement. Mark Canton and Joe Roth signed on with Senator Entertainment. Arnold and Anne Kopelson inked with Intertainment AG. Gall Katz and Wolfgang Petersen formed Red Cliff Prods. with Advanced Medien. Chuck Gordon's Daybreak Prods., and the "American Pie" producing team Warren Zide and Craig Perry, married up with Helkon. 

 For the German entities, the attraction was invariably the allure of Hollywood producers with a proven track record and the opportunity to establish a relationship with a major Hollywood player. 

 Even as producers and studios were reaping the benefits of the new German market boom, they were also profiting from the country's equally lucrative film fund system, which provides an estimated $3 billion a year for mostly Hollywood pictures. Most German funds take advantage of a loophole in the country's tax code that gives private investors major tax breaks if they put their money into "creative industries" such as film. 

 The original idea behind the tax break was to boost local production but the result was a multitude of tax shelter funds set up to ship cash to Los Angeles. Virtually all the studios dipped deep into the twin pools of equity and fund capital, both of which fed their appetite for high-budget, hard-to-recoup event pictures. 

 "If the studios did not have access to these tax schemes or strong investment from the German market, I think fewer films would've been made," says Moritz Borman, co-chairman of U.K-U.S. rights buying firm Intermedia. "For good or for bad, more than half of the big pictures coming out this Christmas season in the U.S. have somehow or other made use of the sale and leaseback facility or the German investment scheme." 

 With so much money flowing into the system and so many inexperienced German buyers traveling to Los Angeles -- with "suitcases full of money," as one analyst put it -- the result was easy to predict: Prices shot up. 

 "In 1999 we saw absolutely absurd prices. It was total insanity," says Han-no Huth, CEO of German rights buyer Senator. "It was a year when we didn't buy any American films for the entire year. The market was just too hot." 

 Germany had always been a major part of the international financing puzzle, with buyers paying an average of 8%-15% of a picture's budget for German rights. But the combination of newly rich IPO companies and booming film funds sent prices skyrocketing. There were stories of companies paying 20%-25% for German tights and up to 75% for all foreign rights -- levels almost impossible to recoup. 

 "A lot of independent companies just went over-aggressively into purchasing U.S. product at exorbitant prices, (paying) way too much in overhead deals, and in the purchase of rights and stock in U.S. companies," says Ashok Amritraj, co-head of Hyde Park Entertainment. "They simply handled their money very loosely." 

 "A number of companies knowingly paid too much for rights in order to boost their share price with impressive announcements," says Friedrich Schellmoser, a media analyst at Germany's Hypo und Vereinsbank. "But that was short-term thinking. Stocks in those companies have come down and come down hard." 

 WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES. 

 NO MEDIA STOCK HAS ESCAPED THE NEUER MARKT'S COLLAPSE, AND MANY HAVE OUTPACED IT IN THE RUSH TO THE BOTTOM. EM.TV, Kinowelt, Advanced Medien and Intertainment have all lost more than 60% of their peak value. Senator, Highlight, Constantin and Splendid have seen their paper worth halve. Production house H5B5 lost almost 80% of its share value and had to drop plans to take an equity stake in New York-based distribution and production company Unapix Entertainment Inc. 

 After a long honeymoon, the market got mean. Traders who had accepted promises of massive profit growth suddenly turned on Germany's listed media firms when the numbers turned out to be less than rosy. Intertainment's warning Nov. 17 that year-end profits would miss original forecasts sent its stock plunging. The markets also got jumpy. News of the death of Helkon Media co-head Werner Koenig in a skiing accident cut Helkon's share price by 25% (HR 11/15). 

 It appears that impressive sounding announcements are no longer enough. Advanced's news that it had signed Johnny Depp and Jude Law to the upcoming period project "Marlowe" -- a co-production with United Kingdom's Natural Nylon -- did nothing to slow the stock's slide. 

 Internationalmedia is the German holding company of U.S./U.K. sales, production and financing house Intermedia, formed this year by Intermedia to go public on the Neuer Markt and raise German capital. It unveiled an output deal with C2 Prods. that will include the "Terminator 3" and "Basic Instinct 2" sequels. But Internationalmedia shares picked up for all of a week before falling again. 

 In his last interview prior to his death, Koenig told The Hollywood Reporter, "The boom is over" in German media stocks. 

 "Investors aren't impressed by big names or big deals anymore," Koenig said. "They are waiting to see how the films actually do before buying. Investors have learned their lesson. They won't be making the same mistakes again -- investing in companies that don't have a smart business plan." 

 Koenig said that as pictures backed by German cash started to hit theaters -- but failed to make back their initial investment -- a period of consolidation would begin. 

 "Everyone is just waiting to see who falls first," he said. "I think within six months you will see the first mergers and acquisitions within the Neuer Markt compmies (and) the first bankruptcies." 

 "When somebody pays 70% or $10 million on an overhead deal and is clearly unable to recoup it, the banks panic, the stock market sees quarterly earnings go down and that's the beginning of the end," says Hyde Park's Amritraj. 

 The market blues will not mean an immediate end to German cash, and none of the big deals of the past year is currently at risk. 

 Stephen Brown, former president of Kopelson Entertainment and head of U.S. operations for Munich-based rights buyer Intertainment (and the man who brokered Intertainment's $500 million co-financing deal with Kopelson) called the market slump "a natural process (that) does not threaten our ability to finance pictures." 

 But unless the situation improves, Hollywood can say goodbye to the fresh bursts of capital from Frankfurt. Listed firms are already shying away from plans to issue more stock in order to finance new projects or acquisitions. As Advanced Medien boss Christoph Montague puts it: "If we had to raise money on the market right now -- forget it." 

 New companies, or established ones that had been considering a float to boost their purchasing power, are being forced to rethink. Munich-based rights giant Tele Munchen group, for example, had planned its IPO for late 2000, early 2001. Now the company avoids mention of any fixed date. 

 The tight capital markets are also starting to have a knock-on effect on the film financing end as Germany's conservative banks begin to lose confidence in their media investments. 

 "Banks have also become more suspicious," Koenig said. "I don't think it has affected loan rates (for film financing) yet, but they are definitely checking things more carefully." 

 On the other side of the German financing coin, film funds are also on shaky ground. A new law, due to go into effect next year, will close the loophole that gave private investors major tax breaks for investing in Hollywood pictures. This could spell an end to the sale and leaseback funds, widely used by Sony and Paramount. 

 "I think the change in the law will have an influence on certain segments of the market," says Intermedia's Borman. "The purely sale and leaseback structure deals that Sony and Paramount have done in the past will have to change. For the pure equity investment funds like IMF and KC Medien, they will continue to be around as long as those deals are structured with some slight modifications." 

 "The tax shelter funds are going to be almost impossible to finance (under the new law)," says Roland Pellegrino, head of KC Medien, which together with main U.S. partner Mandalay Pictures is co-financing and co-producing the upcoming Joseph Fiennes-Jude Law starrer "Enemy at the Gates," Oliver Stone's "Beyond Borders," and "The Score," starring Robert De Niro and Edward Norton. 

 "With the new law, you will see more funds going in our direction, making purely business decisions when it comes to financing a film -- looking for guarantees and pre-sales as an upfront condition," says Pellegrino. 

 This isn't to say there won't he any more Hollywood cash from Germany. Many new players are stepping in to fill the looming gap left by the tax-shelter funds and bottomed-out Neuer Markt firms. German rights buying and broadcasting group KirchMedia, together with Italy's Mediaset, has set up Epsilon, a co-financing/co-production group that has already backed "Big Momma's House" and "The Sixth Sense." It is also committed to providing $500 million for at least 30 films over the next three years with partners Hyde Park, New Regency Prods., Wildwood Enterprises and Spyglass Entertainment. 

 RTL Group, Kirch's main competitor in Germany, has plans to set up a similar co-financing scheme. 

 The more businesslike money-making film funds are still popular, if not yet as numerous as their tax-shelter counterparts. Dusseldorf-based fund Mediastream recently raised DM 149 million ($63 million) to back Rob Cohen and Universal Pictures' action-drama "Street Wars" (aka "Redline"). Paramount Pictures has paired with fund ALCAS to finance four pictures: Chris and Paul Weitz's "Down to Earth"; the Keanu Reeves starrer "Hardball"; William Friedkin's "Shooter" and the Mutual Film Co.-developed comedy "Guam Goes to the Moon." 

 "This time next year there will still be a lot of German money around, but it won't be called stupid money anymore," says Intermedia's Borman. "People are getting smarter in the deals they are making." 

 "The money is there, the capital is available and a lot of it will end up going to Hollywood," says Helmut Behring, head of film financing at German bank Staatspaarkasse Cologne. "The question is, will there be as much, will it come from the same companies and will it be given away, no questions asked, like before? Some how, I don't think so."

 CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 27, 2000--Edward A. Burkhardt, Chairman of the Wisconsin Central Shareholders Committee to Maximize Value, wrote Wisconsin Central Transportation Corporation (NASDAQ: WCLX) shareholders on Friday highlighting the incumbent board's failure to grow traffic. 

 Mr. Burkhardt pointed out that Wisconsin Central was "dead last" in growth in carloads handled year to date compared with the same period of 1999 among the eight railroads compared in a report issued Monday, November 20, by Jim Valentine, rail analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 

 Mr. Burkhardt also cited a continuous downgrading of WCLX by stock analysts this year as earnings failed to meet expectations and the company issued numerous profit warnings. 

 The Committee was formed to reverse the current poor performance and to maximize shareholder value by selling off minority shareholdings in poorly performing overseas railways and to foster a strategic sale of WCLX's domestic rail operations. It is currently conducting a consent solicitation of shareholders to replace the incumbent board with nominees of the Committee who will implement of the Committee's program. 

 A copy of Mr. Burkhardt's letter is attached. 

 CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSALS 

 Information regarding the Committee's proposals is included in a definitive consent statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2000. The Committee has mailed copies of the consent statement, together with consent cards, to Wisconsin Central shareholders. Wisconsin Central shareholders are urged to read the consent statement carefully as it contains important information. The definitive consent statement is available without charge at the SEC's Internet web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, the Committee will provide copies of its definitive consent statement without charge upon request. Requests for copies should be directed to the Committee's information agent, Innisfree M&A Incorporated, at its toll-free number: 1-888-750-5834.

 Dear Fellow Shareholder: 

 You recently may have received materials from Wisconsin Central's incumbent board and management. We believe the board and management are attempting to paper over their poor record by referring to highly selective performance statistics while ignoring the Company's lack of growth and precipitous decline in earnings. In our view, Wisconsin Central's performance has been dismal. We are confident that Wisconsin Central shareholders will see through management's attempt to divert them from the real issues at stake in this consent solicitation. 

 On Monday, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Analyst Jim Valentine issued the following report(1) of year-on-year changes in rail industry carloadings sorted by four-week trend:

WCLX led all the railroads listed in traffic growth from its startup in 1987
through the time of my departure from management. Today, WCLX ranks dead last
in growth, yet incumbent management in its proxy materials cites "strong
operational performance"! We view the overseas investments as being in
free-fall, and the domestic operation as characterized by no growth and
reduced profitability. It is no wonder that the analysts are disappointed, and
share price has plummeted.



We urge you to consider the opinion of the independent research analysts who
closely follow our company. We believe they paint a much more accurate picture
of WCLX's financial condition than does the company's proxy material.
Currently, all of the six research analysts who cover Wisconsin Central rate
the shares as a "Hold, "Neutral" or "Reduce". In our opinion, it's highly
unusual for a company with this level of coverage not to elicit a single "Buy"
recommendation.



Here are representative quotes and recommendations from various research
analysts and technical rating services on Wisconsin Central's operating and
financial results this year:(1)

 An Interview With David Herro 

 Herro. Hero. These days, what's the difference ? A dedication to value, a healthy disregard for indexes and a heavy concentration in a small number of stocks are the hallmarks of Herro's style and the reason the Oakmark International fund he's managed for the past eight years remains in positive territory this year. The 3.3% advance in the $1 billion fund with roughly 50 stocks is in sharp contrast to the double-digit losses suffered by the growth and momentum players in the category; his $100 million international small-cap fund knows something of their pain -- it's off 12.8% this year, but that still beats the loss of 15.78% posted by the average international small-cap fund. Make no mistake, Herro zigs while others zag. "If we don't like something, we don't invest in it," says Herro. "If we love something, we are not afraid." The fund's tendency to show little correlation to the performance of the indexes and its peers may begin to hold some appeal in uncertain times. In the following Q&A, Herro, a veteran of Chicago-based Harris Associates since 1992 and on the international investing scene since 1986, tells why he's bullish on Latin American companies and bearish on Japan. 

 -- Sandra Ward 

 Barron's: Are you still as bullish on the international arena as you were in July? 

 Herro: Very much so. I base my bullishness on the availability and ease of finding the types of stocks we invest in: value stocks that are well-managed, that grow their businesses and represent real, true, solid, long-term investments. More and more of these companies have been brought to the forefront as a result of the tech bubble imploding. Tech has been a major influence in the global equity markets and as the values there erode, it vindicates our strategy. Money is slowly but surely making its way back into sectors other than technology, media and telecom. It means lots of upside for companies like Diageo and Bank of Ireland -- name any non-U.S. non-tech company. So much of the global market cap was being hogged by such a narrow sector, automatically there is huge opportunity. 

 Q: You haven't completely avoided telecom, though. 

 A: We were there early. We sold off most of the European stuff when valuations ballooned. We were in some of the off-the-beaten-path areas such as Brazil and South Korea, where we saw value and where, in fact, that value was vindicated. Almost every Brazilian phone company we owned got bought out. We had a fairly strong presence in our international small-cap fund two years ago in both Japanese and Australian software companies. In the past, we've been in the technology sector very strongly in the small-cap area. But again, we don't believe in paying an infinite price for anything, and that's what was happening in the global markets. We are finally starting to see the tech values unwind, and it's having a very distinct impact on results. If you look at value international funds, like ourselves, we are doing much better than the momentum-oriented funds, which are down 15%, 20%, 25%. 

 Q: What sectors are benefiting from a reallocation, or are likely to? 

 A: Two sectors that have been completely ignored that are starting to get some attention are engineering and consumer nondurables. Engineering, a cyclical sector, trades at five or six times cash flow. Private-market transactions have been made at 10-12 times cash flow, so we're talking about huge undervaluation. Consumer nondurables are at nine to 10 times cash flow, and they probably should be at 15-16 times. We see a lot of upside potential, but the money has to come from somewhere, and I believe the money will continue to come from people rebalancing portfolios over the next year or two. This is going to be a long process. It isn't going to happen overnight. When you consider what's happening with European companies on a micro level, as managements focus more on profitability, along with what's happening on a macro level, with the European economy finally turning the corner, and figure that money will be flowing out of tech, media and telecom into other sectors, the prospects going forward are extremely favorable. 

 If you look at Asia, which has gone through a kind of a minor double dip, take South Korea and Hong Kong as examples, and even places like Australia and New Zealand, the prospects there look good, too, because the worst of the crisis of two years ago is definitely behind us, even though reform in some markets has been two steps forward, one step back. Share prices are again at bargain-basement levels, and for those who missed the first leg up, I would anticipate those people won't want to miss the second leg up. 

 Q: We seem to be on the verge of a global slowdown, and Japan's recovery is faltering. What do you make of that? 

 A: The U.S. is slowing down. I would not agree that Europe and Asia are slowing down. In Europe, unlike the U.S., equitymarket gains were much more compressed, and therefore there wasn't the big consumer spending movement that we had in the U.S. There are other factors in Europe which will continue to propel growth. For the first time in my memory, there's some real restructuring taking place. Who would ever believe Germany would be lowering corporate tax rates to the 30% range? Tax reform is happening in France. Cross-shareholdings in Germany are going to get unwound. These things are monumental. The last pillars of old Europe are being taken down. I just came back from France, and the attitude is completely different from five years ago. Five years ago I used to sit in meetings there and wonder, "Why am I even here?" People talked of restructuring; I didn't see it. Now companies seem to realize they're in a global economy and there is a global fight for capital and they have got to start running their businesses for the owners of the company, or their share price is going to be so low that it will be prohibitive for them to use their share price in the global equity markets to raise money to expand. There's been a U-turn among even the most provincial French companies. The amazing thing is that the middle-age people are the ones driving it. These are people who have actually changed their way of thinking. For a value investor with a strong focus on Europe and with investments in all these markets, this is a very, very comfortable position to be in right now. We have company fundamentals in our favor and the wind is at our back from a macroeconomic growth perspective. While the unwinding of the tech bubble will knock a quarter- or half-point off U.S. economic growth, it won't hit Europe as hard because their tech bubble occurred in a compressed period, starting in August of 1999 and ending in March, whereas ours started two years ago. 

 Q: You mentioned a new attitude toward restructurings and corporate governance, but it seems you as an individual have done much to force the issue. 

 A: I've always been a believer that corporate boards should represent the owners of the business first and foremost. In instances where that is not the case, there needs to be a reminder. We are not, per se, active shareholders. We don't seek to invest in companies that have bad boards to turn them around. If a situation is terrible and we made a mistake by investing in a company that has a bad board, our first line of defense is to get out. If it makes sense, such as in the case of Saatchi & Saatchi and more recently Tompkins, we more or less provide a reminder that there ought to be board members in place who are independent and represent our interest. The direction is moving in our favor, which is one more positive. But there is still room for improvement. This is a really long haul, because old habits die hard. 

 Q: What about the currency issue? How concerned are you about the depressed euro? 

 A: It's hurt us. We would be up 12% or 13% if it weren't for the euro, instead of the 3% we are up. But I view it as an opportunity, going forward, for the obvious reason that we hold European stocks, and if the euro goes up, our stocks will go up, because they are priced in euros. On the other hand, if the euro were to go up 50% tomorrow, European multinationals with dollar revenues will be hurt. That is a secondary and weaker impact than a direct impact. But it looks like the euro has hit a bottom and will start trudging back up in a slow and uniform way. We will probably have the best of both worlds: European companies will be able to maintain their profitability and we'll have the accounting impact, as long as you are not talking about 50% appreciation overnight. Yet the euro appears to be undervalued by at least 20%-25%. So I think at this stage of the game, investing in the Euro is an opportunity rather than a risk. 

 Q: Does Indecision 2000 in the U.S. bolster the case for the euro? 

 A: It demonstrates this country is not infallible and it's not the perfect safe haven, but it is still the best haven. There is $400 billion of outside money in our equity market that is probably dubious. There has been a big runup in the last couple of years, and the level of foreign investment is probably at a level that is unnatural and unsustainable. As equitization becomes more and more the trend outside the U.S., some of the portfolio investments in U.S. stocks and bonds will trickle back to where they came from. That will have a positive influence on currencies like the euro and even some of the East Asian currencies. It will have a negative impact on the dollar. 

 Q: Do you hedge currencies at all? 

 A: We have the ability to do so and have hedged in the past. We are basically unhedged at these levels. 

 Q: And where do you find yourself most concentrated? Can you give a breakdown of the countries? 

 A: We are today about 55% in Europe. Of that, 25% is in the United Kingdom and 30% is in Continental Europe. About 30% is in the Pacific Rim and about 15% in Latin America. Our exposure to Latin America is going up for the first time in a couple of years. We have been finding Mexican stocks that look attractive. We have been adding to an already big position in Quilmes Industrial, the largest brewer in Argentina, on recent weakness. And once again we have been buying UniBanco, the second-biggest bank in Brazil, making it one of our bigger positions. When it dipped into the mid-30s we cut our position size, but it has since dropped into the low 20s. Latin America is back in buy territory for us. 

 Q: What's the story on Quilmes? 


A: It's one of our favorite names. Quilmes' big markets are in the
southern cone of South America: Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia.
They have 80%-85% market share in the southern cone. They also became
the biggest Pepsi bottler in Argentina when they bought -- out of
bankruptcy -- the assets of Baesa. They have interests in mineral water.
So they are a South American beverage company that trades at about 6.5-7
times cash flow, and they do about 20% operating margins. The company
recently announced that they are going to have the ability to buy back
stock. They probably are going to simplify their share class as well. At
the same time the stock price of $9 a share is at its low of the past
couple of years. It's worth about $15-$16 and it's traded as low as 8
last week or so. UniBanco, which we think is worth 35 or 40, trades just
over one times book and is probably one of the most profitable, most
efficient banks in the world. It trades at 22 a share.
Q: What's the reason for your enthusiasm for Latin America? Will
reforms stick?



A: We've seen structural change take hold finally in South America
and Mexico. Massive privatization has taken place. No longer are the
governments the owners of these assets. Whether we're talking banks,
steel companies, oil companies, phone companies, they are now run by
profit-maximizing individuals. Huge chunks of the South American economy
have been put into private ownership. The whole structure of the Latin
American economy has transformed itself in 10 years. Because it has
happened over such a long period, people don't realize what's happened.
Latin America has opened itself up to free trade, and its companies are
forced to compete. Another leg to the turnaround is monetary policy. All
these countries now are extremely sensible. They are running monetary
policy for price stability, not for political reasons. It is a whole
different animal. It's actually becoming a normal place.



Q: Even Venezuela?



A: Well, Venezuela is not quite there yet. I would direct my comments
toward Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Venezuela may get there, who
knows? I think Chavez is kind of a question mark. It's unclear whether
he will drive the country to legitimate reform or not.



Q: What names have you been buying in Mexico, and when did you start?



A: We've been buying the big Coca-Cola bottler and brewer, Femsa,
recently. We also own another Coca-Cola bottler called Grupo Continental
in the small-cap fund.



Q: Why would you want two?



A: One is a small-cap and one is a big-cap, and they are in different
districts in Mexico.



Q: Seems you like the beer makers an awful lot.



A: They are awfully cheap right now and have a good profitability
profile: good return on capital, decent growth and they are undervalued.
Another investment we made is in Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, or
ASUR, an airport operator in Mexico. Its biggest one serves the resorts
of Cancun and Cozumel.



Q: Did you get familiar with it from your scuba-diving excursions?



A: I haven't been able to dive for the last year or so, I've been so
busy. I'm going to try to do some over the holidays.



Q: What are the fundamentals on ASUR?



A: It trades for about eight or nine times cash flow, and it's
probably growing near double digits. Some of their key assets have a lot
of potential in terms of retail development. A lot of these airports get
paid in two ways, usually: from landing fees and slotting fees. There
are deals worked out with their government that allow them to collect
rents on the airports. The more they could develop the airport, really,
the better it is for them. From discussions with managements we think
they are going to be focusing on this. It's an ADR, trades on the New
York Stock Exchange. It came out at about 14 or 15 and that's where it
is now. We think it represents excellent value.



Q: In investing overseas, is there still some sort of corruption
element you have to factor in?



A: There certainly is, and it's everywhere, even in the United
Kingdom, even in this country. You can't assume every management and
every board is corrupt, but you have to do as much due diligence as
possible. One of the toughest things about this job is being wary, yet
not so distrusting that you are gun-shy. Anytime you see a profitwarning, you could conclude someone misled. There are different forms of
misrepresentation that take place, and whether it's in the Third World
or the First World it's a major challenge for any investor. We look for
managements aligned with shareholders. And hopefully that alignment is
management holding shares, not just a boatload of options where it's
possible for them to juice up the share price by entering into some kind
of short-term discussions. That doesn't do anyone any good. We want them
to hold either long-term options or shares outright.



Q: Where in the Pacific Rim are you most bullish?



A: The two areas where we have the most exposure are South Korea and
Hong Kong.



Q: Let's take South Korea first.



A: We are still not very comfortable with the chaebols, the big
companies. But if you look at the mid-size companies, they have done
amazing things in terms of managing their businesses. These companies
have really reformed themselves and have begun to focus on
profitability. One of our biggest positions in our small-cap fund is
Hite Brewery. I don't want you to think that all we invest in is brewing
companies, but it is a brewing company. Before the crisis of 1998, they
had about a 35% market share in South Korea, their competitor was way
overleveraged and poorly managed. Hite used the crisis to clobber them
in terms of market share, and now they are well over 50%. They have had
huge increases in the top line over the last couple of years and
maintained good levels of profitability, but they are still selling at
very reasonable valuation levels -- five to six times
price-to-cash-flow, compared with 11-12 times for the industry on a
global basis. The chaebols, on the other hand, are still fighting
change. They are still overleveraged. They are still playing games. They
are still subsidizing companies in their group. You saw Samsung
Electronics recently move to bail out a weaker member of its group and
all the other members chipped in, too. These are big no-nos.



In Hong Kong, we are also focused on the small to mid-size companies.
They have made changes to make themselves more competitive, changes
brought upon by the crisis, to some degree. The big obvious area we are
not in is the Hong Kong property sector.



Q: Why not?



A: Property prices seem to have bottomed and are coming back, but we
just don't think Hong Kong and its high rents can be globally
competitive when there is China 45 minutes away and property that is 50%
cheaper. But I think Asia will be the economic story of the 21st
century, led by China. The big question is whether Japan is going to
join or not. It is interesting to remember that in the last three or
four years, Asia has been able to recover somewhat without any help from
Japan. It shows how isolated and unimportant Japan is becoming to the
global economy.



Q: Those are strong words.



A: It's sad, but true. South Korea, as an example, was following in
Japan's every footstep with industrial policy; it was a very closed
economy and very monolithic. Yet this crisis changed South Korea. Japan,
however, has yet to open up. Japan has yet to undo the shroud of
opaqueness that hangs over the place. There are still a lot of weird
regulations. There are still trade barriers. There are still
cross-shareholdings. There needs to be a complete renaissance in the
country. But there is no sense of urgency. Their idea of getting their
economy going is more of this pumppriming. Everyone is all excited
because last year direct foreign investment in Japan equaled $12
billion. But direct investment in China was $30-$40 billion and in
Brazil it was $20-$30 billion. In the U.K. it's $80 billion. A huge
industrialized country like Japan with over 100 million people should
have more direct foreign investment than $12 billion. That is an
indication that it is still a closed place.



Q: Contrast that with China, hardly the most open place on the globe.



A: Maybe not from a corporate-stock-market perspective, but it is
more open from an economic perspective. Some of the things they've done,
joining the World Trade Organization, are quite startling. Allowing
foreign ownership in phone companies. They are moving rapidly. The
Chinese companies in existence today are far more bottom-line-oriented
than Japanese companies are.



Q: What's your weighting in Japan at this point?



A: It's very low. It's 2% in the big fund and about 6% in the small
fund. The funny thing is, we have two analysts who constantly are over
there looking for stocks. We have not given up. The country represents
about 25% of the indexes, so we want to be aware of what's happening. We
just don't see much change taking place still.



Q: Should it, then, even represent that much in the index?



A: When I started in this business in 1986, Japan was 60% of the
index. Now it's 25% of the MSCI EAFE Index. As a percentage of the world
index, it's 11% on a market-cap basis. Its peak as a percentage of the
world was around 30 or 40 and its peak EAFE was about 60%, not any more.
What is amazing is that, though Japan has been in this depression, the
economies around it have been able to grow marketcaps.



Q: While you may be a value player, you don't sound contrarian.



A: We were in the Pacific Rim when everyone was out. We were out of
tech when everyone was in. There have been times when we have been
extremely contrarian. If we are contrarian, it's because stocks are
underpriced or because they are out of favor. We don't set out to be
contrarian.



Q: Let's turn to Europe. What have you been buying there?



A: One of the names we recently added was Wolters Kluwer of the
Netherlands. They are a big publisher of legal books and tax guides.



Q: What's the appeal?



A: It's a huge cash-flow-generating business. This was a contrarian
play. If you look at its graph, it was a former growth darling that
traded as high as $45 a share and went down to $18-$19 a share. We
started buying it in the low 20s. Momentum players dumped it when it had
an earnings disappointment. It also got dumped as investors became
enchanted with tech and names like Vodafone and Ericsson and Nokia and
Philips. This company peaked in early 1999, and by fall of 1999 it was
in full retreat. They have some great assets. One of their biggest
businesses is making manuals for tax planners. When tax laws change,
these planners get new manuals. We bought it at about eight times cash
flow and think it should be trading at closer to 14 or 15 times cash
flow. It has good growth prospects because this industry has been
consolidating. They have been one of the two consolidators, along with
Reed Elsevier. That's been in the portfolio for only about four or five
months.



Q: Any other names on the Continent you find attractive?



A: One of our second- or third-biggest positions right now is a
Finnish company called Metso, and we are still buying. It also has an
ADR. It's the largest maker of machinery and systems for the pulp and
paper industry. They also bought a service business, with 10%-15%
operating margins, from Beloit for a song. Beloit was a U.S. competitor
that went under. The industry is structurally less competitive. It's
also more profitable than it was three or four years ago. Paper
companies are in much better shape than they have been. We are past the
bottom of the cycle. There's robust demand for paper and decent prices.
We think there is huge upside in Metso. It trades at about 10.5 euros
and we think it is worth about 20-25 euros. The ADRs trade for about
$8.75 a share, and so we think they're worth at least $16 a share.



Q: Thanks very much, David.

 South Texas Drilling 3rd quarter earnings up 

 Cost controls and an increased demand for drilling rigs led San Antonio-based South Texas Drilling Co. to improved third quarter financial results, company officials said. 

 South Texas, with 12 drilling rigs serving oil and natural gas exploration companies, earned $307,000 in the third quarter. That amounts to 3 cents per diluted share of South Texas stock, which trades over the counter. 

 The results represented a turnaround for South Texas, which lost more than $110,000 in the third quarter of 1999. 

 Though South Texas increased its number of drilling rigs from eight to 12 with July's purchase of Pioneer Drilling Co., rig utilization was at 96 percent for the quarter. During the third quarter of 1999, rig utilization was only 74 percent. 

 South Texas' shares rose 12 cents to $2.31 in brief trading Friday. 

 Troubled California ISP 

 prepares to shut down 

 LOS GATOS, Calif. - Solopoint.com Inc., a provider of Internet access and online marketing, said it fired 11 of its 13 workers and begin to wind down operations after failing to raise capital or sell the company. 

 It will surrender its assets, including inventory, equipment, and intellectual property to its secured creditors, the Los Gatos, Calif., company said in a statement. Company officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

 French group eyeing U.S. market sans Quaker 

 PARIS - The chief executive of French group Danone said that although the company dropped plans to buy Quaker Oats Co., the food and drinks conglomerate still has ambitions to enter the U.S. market. 

 In an interview published Friday in Le Monde newspaper, Franck Riboud declined to rule out further U.S. acquisition moves. 

 Danone suddenly dropped its offer Thursday for the Chicago-based cereals maker and owner of the Gatorade sports drink brand. 

 In their first day of trading after the announcement, shares of Quaker Oats were off $3.25, or nearly 4 percent, to close at $83.75 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Japan adjusts figures 

 to show faster growth 

 TOKYO - The Japanese economy grew nearly 1.4 percent last year, nearly three times the 0.5 percent announced previously, the government said Friday after recalculating the numbers using newer international standards. 

 The new method takes a broader look at the economy. For example, it classifies computer software development outsourced by companies as business investment and adds the depreciation costs of infrastructure, such as dams, to government spending. 

 Russia aims to stanch illegal caviar trade, sales 

 MOSCOW - Russia reportedly plans to introduce a state monopoly on caviar production and exports, a move that would cut off illegal sales to the luxury market abroad and increase government revenues. 

 The move, which would come in 2001, aims to stop poaching that has devastated sturgeon stocks and in some areas far exceeds the catch of licensed fishermen. 

 Russia officially exported $25 million worth of caviar last year, while poachers' exports were estimated at $250 million, Segodnya newspaper reported. 

 Southeast Asia leaders mull new trade alliance 

 SINGAPORE - Southeast Asian leaders Friday proposed creating a new East Asian trade alliance that could redefine the continent's political and economic landscape. 

 The leaders, opening a two-day summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, conferred with their counterparts from China, Japan and South Korea, who would be key partners in such a regional alliance. 

 Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Asia should forge stronger ties because it has "common problems." 

 Top German regulator 

 leaving government post 

 FRANKFURT, Germany - Germany's top postal and telecom regulator plans to quit by the end of the year, signaling a possible setback for the country's attempts to curb former government monopolies and open markets to competition. 

 Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, a vehement free-market champion appointed by former chancellor Helmut Kohl, will begin work next year at Credit Suisse First Boston, the regulatory agency said Friday. 

 Barnes & Noble in talks about e-book merger 

 NEW YORK - Barnes & Noble Inc. acknowledged Friday that it is holding talks with Gemstar-TV Guide International about different ways to cooperate in selling e-books, including a possible merger. 

 Earlier this week, the bookselling giant denied a report in the Wall Street Journal saying the two companies were discussing a merger. But Barnes & Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating said the talks have expanded since then. 

 "We are now discussing a whole wide range of issues, and all options are open," Keating said. 

 Barnes & Noble acquired a stake of less than 1 percent of Gemstar when it sold the company NuvoMedia, the maker of the Rocket eBook, one of the first electronic text readers. 

 Gemstar, which publishes TV Guide magazine and operates on-screen programming guides, is one of the leading e-book publishers, having also purchased Softbook Press earlier this year. 

 Enron soothes worries over earnings warning 

 HOUSTON - Enron Corp., the world's biggest energy trader, said it won't be issuing a warning on fourth-quarter profit. 

 "It was a persistent rumor on Wednesday," company spokesman Mark Palmer said. "We wanted to get the news out to everyone that it's not true." 

 The Houston-based company said it expects earnings to be in line with analysts' estimates of 35 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.65 for next year. Enron's shares rose $2.19, or 2.9 percent, to $77.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading. 

 Enron received numerous calls Wednesday from investors and analysts about a possible earnings warning, Palmer said. The company doesn't know where the speculation began, he said.

 TECH WEEK IN REVIEW: Not Much To Be Thankful For

 WSJ.com 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- This Thanksgiving, there wasn't a whole lot to make technology watchers thankful. 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index has sunk to its lowest level of the year, closing at 2755 on Wednesday, down from more than 5000 back in March. The sexiest dot-com stocks have all been pounded, with Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) suffering another blow this week when Walker Digital, which created the name-your-own-price system, laid off most of its headquarters staff. 

 Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) shares lost 15% on Tuesday, hitting a two-year low, following comments from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Mary Meeker, who warned of the impact a slowing dot-com advertising market might have on the popular Web portal. It didn't much matter to investors that she was merely playing catch-up with Lehman's Holly Becker. Becker has made a name for herself recently with bearish prognostications about Internet names in much the same way that Meeker and Merrill Lynch's Henry Blodget did in the past with bullish calls. 

 At less-established dot-coms, the layoffs continued. Kids site MaMaMedia Inc. laid off most of its remaining staff, and game site Sandbox Inc. cut about one-quarter of its work force. 

 Meanwhile, the trouble at speech-recognition software maker Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV (LHSP) hasn't let up. This week, company co-founder Pol Hauspie resigned from the company's board along with two of his longtime lieutenants. L&H earlier said it would have to revise the past two and a half years of its books after it discovered accounting "errors and irregularities." 

 But the really dejecting bit this turkey day is how technology's leaders have slumped. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is still embroiled in its antitrust case. PC makers have seen better days: Apple Computer Inc. (AAPL), the comeback kid, has seen its high-priced G4 Cube machine flop, and the company's stock price and most of its profits with it. 

 Worst off, though, is Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU). The telecommunications-gear maker recently dumped its chief executive and revealed this week that revenue in the recent quarter will be about $125 million shy of what it initially reported. The company also said its previous projections for the current quarter should be tossed out. Lucent's announcement marked the fifth time in a year that the company warned of a financial disappointment. 

 Lucent, you recall, was the big success story of the AT&T breakup in the mid-1990s - a move that created the new AT&T Corp. (T), Lucent and NCR Corp. Lucent is now splitting off pieces of itself, including the recently separate Avaya Inc. (AV) - though none as radical as AT&T's recent decision to announce another breakup, one that essentially reverses its cable strategy and will end AT&T's historical position as one of the great large conglomerates.

 Lucent Revises 4th-Quarter Sales Downward, Pulls Forecast Telecom: Shares drop 16% on the news, which follows weak profit and the recent ouster of its CEO.

 Lucent Technologies Inc. sprang yet another nasty surprise on investors Tuesday, reducing its already-reported fiscal fourth-quarter revenue by $125 million and revealing that it might not make its profit forecast for the upcoming quarter. 

 The revelations spurred a renewed sell-off in Lucent's stock, which hit its lowest level since 1997. The shares fell $3.38, or 16%, to $17.56 in New York Stock Exchange trading, and are now down 75% this year. 

 The "revenue recognition" problem for the three months ended Sept. 30 was discovered while the company was completing year-end financial reports, the Murray Hill, N.J.-based maker of telecommunications equipment said. It declined to provide further details. 

 As a result, Lucent will restate its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue, which had been reported as an unaudited $9.4 billion, and will reduce its profit from continuing operations from 18 cents per share, or $600 million, to 16 cents per share. 

 In addition, Lucent said it can no longer confirm its forecast for its fiscal first quarter. It had predicted sales would be down 7% from the year-ago period and the company would only break even, a hard fall from its days of steady, double-digit profit increases. 

 The latest bad news for the former Wall Street darling comes after a string of disappointing earnings, the ouster of its chief executive, layoffs and a series of restructurings. The company's once dominant position, as well as its credibility with analysts, has fallen sharply as it misjudged market trends and lost business due to production and other problems. 

 "We [now] have more questions about what's going on, and that's not good" for the stock's value, said analyst Steven D. Levy, a managing director at Lehman Bros. Inc. in New York. 

 Henry Schacht, who returned to his old job as Lucent's chairman and CEO on Oct. 23, said the company had notified the Securities and Exchange Commission and was having auditors and attorneys review all the finances and any related issues. 

 "Until that review is complete, we really wouldn't be able to comment on any further details or specifics," said company spokesman Bill Price. He said there is no timetable for completion of the review. 

 Just four weeks ago, Lucent fired its top executive, Richard McGinn, after warning of weak profit for an astounding fourth time this fiscal year--despite booming demand for network equipment to expand and upgrade the Internet. Top rivals such as Nortel Networks, meanwhile, have been churning out rosy earnings reports and forecasts. 

 Schacht, 66, was at Lucent's helm from its inception in September 1996 until October 1997. 

 Two weeks ago, Lucent said it planned to streamline its upper management and had already cut 240 such jobs as part of companywide layoffs. Analysts say layoffs could eventually total as many as 10,000, nearly 10% of Lucent's work force.

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Stocks slumped as investors found little to be thankful for in the pre-holiday session. 

 Major indexes finished at or near their low points of the day, and the Nasdaq Composite Index marked a new low for the year. 

 The market went through a fair share of shifts, seemingly moving on developments in the presidential election turmoil. 

 But one strategist recommended investors not to count on a sustained rally once a victor is declared. 

 "There is smoke and there is fire," said Charles Gabriel, political analyst with Prudential Securities. 

 "The election is smoke; profits are the fire," Gabriel said. "We still facing slower demand, less credit and high interest rates." 

 It was software's day to slide - especially Internet providers - on concerns about the quality of earnings and revenues. 

 Portal Software, whose billing systems aid Internet companies, lost $11.88, or 64%, to $6.75 after beating third-quarter estimates but trimming guidance for 2001. A number of analysts reduced their projections for the company, citing disappointing revenue growth and missed expectations for software licenses. 

 Intuit shed 4.31, or 8.9%, to 43.88 after the maker of financial software showed a pro forma loss of 10 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter, compared with analysts' consensus forecast of a 16 cent loss. But ABN Amro cut its rating on the stock to add from buy, saying that the shift from direct selling to retail and Web-based sales could hurt Intuit's market share. 

 CacheFlow, whose systems store and update frequently requested Internet sites, plummeted 31.88, or 42%, to 45 after posting a narrower-than-expected fiscal second-quarter loss, but indicating slowing revenue growth. 

 Among other software firms, Novell shed 1.44, or 19%, to 6, Adobe Systems lost 7.69, or 9.6%, to 72.31 and Veritas Software dropped 3.94 to 93.38. 

 Microsoft bucked the software sector's falling trend with a gain of 50 cents to 68.25. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 95.18 points, or 0.91%, to 10399.32 and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 116.11, or 4.04%, to 2755.34. 

 On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners outpaced gainers 1,829 to 941. Volume on the Big Board was 966.5 million shares. 

 The final Dow Jones Industrial Average close was 10399.32, down 95.18. On the New York Stock Exchange, there were 941 issues advancing, 1,837 declining and 524 unchanged. 

 NYSE volume totaled 960,348,180 shares, compared with 1,111,503,900 Tuesday. 

 The NYSE Composite Index was 626.46, down 8.77. The average price per share fell 52 cents. 

 Among large Internet concerns, Yahoo! lost 3.50 to 38.19 and Commerce One fell 6.69, or 17%, to 32.31. But eBay, after initially being off, ended the day ahead 1.31 to 32.88. 

 Coca-Cola gained 4.31 to 59.56, the Dow's best performer. Quaker Oats lost 7.44 to 87 after Coke backed away from plans to buy Quaker for $15.75 billion. 

 Watson Pharmaceutical shed 2.56 to 48.50 after being dealt a setback in its effort to offer a generic version of Bristol-Myers anxiety drug Buspar, which represents $700 million market. Bristol-Myers filed a new patent application related to Buspar with the Food and Drug Administration, which means generic versions could be put on hold. Bristol-Myers gained 1 to 67.94 

 Home Depot lost 1.50 to 35.75 after cautious comments from Lehman Brothers. 

 Hormel Foods, whose offerings include Spam and Dintey Moore beef stew, lost 69 cents to $18 after its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street's expectations. But Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to long-term buy from accumulate, citing a "change toward higher margin products." 

 Managed health-care providers took another round of hits, with WellPoint Health Networks off $3.13 to $100.81, UnitedHealth Group losing 2.56 to 112.69 and Oxford Health dropping 1.44 to 36.13. 

 General Electric closed 2.19 lower at 48.56 after the company issued a statement disputing rumors that it would be posting a profit warning. GE reaffirmed fourth-quarter and fiscal-year earnings estimates. 

 Consumer products stocks advanced a bit, with Clorox up 88 cents to 47.94, Procter & Gamble adding 1.38 to 75.44 and Kimberly-Clark gaining 94 cents to 69.06. 

 Among tech movers, Comverse Technology dropped 8.25 to 86.75, Nextel Communications fell 1.50 to 32.06 and Celestica lost 1.56 to 57.06. 

 The financial services sector was weak, with banks and brokers pulling back. Among the latter, Goldman Sachs shed 4.25 to 79.94, Merrill Lynch was off 1.69 to 58.81 and Lehman Brothers dropped 3.25 to 49.94. 

 Life insurer Nationwide Financial dropped 4.94, or 11%, to 41.88 after Morgan Stanley reduced its earnings projections for this year, 2001 and 2002, and cut its price target to $57 from $59. The action "reflects recent equity market weakness, which has pressured the company's asset balances," analyst Nigel Dally wrote in a note to clients. 

 Cabot Corp. dropped 2.38 to 22.75 after J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded the chemicals concern to market performer from buy and cut its earnings estimates. 

 Liz Claiborne shed 63 cents to 39.94 after its president, Denise Seegal, said she is resigning. ING Barings said that Seegal's departure was probably tied to cost-cutting moves, and that it anticipates "additional streamlining of management." Still, the company has a "strong strategic manager" in chief executive Paul Charron, Barings said in its note.

9:28 (Dow Jones) Underwriters can take Wednesday off to get a jump on
basting the bird. Rigel Pharmaceuticals was supposed to price its IPO
Tuesday and trade today, but, instead, the company cut terms on its deal
yet again and delayed the offering. Rigel, which pulled its offering in
the spring, now says it will sell 5 million shares at $7 or $8. That's a
far cry from the 9 million shares at between $8 and $10 a share it hoped
to sell earlier this week. Rigel's pullout leaves no IPOs on the this
week's docket. (RJH)



9:23 (Dow Jones) Portal Software (PRSF) beat 3Q earnings estimates,
but its revenue growth was disappointing and software licenses missed
expectations - marking the first hiccup since last May's IPO. Portal
also trimmed guidance for 2001. The culprits: financing woes among its
telecom customers and increased competition from more established
vendors, like Amdocs (DOX). Stock poised to open 50% lower. (MLP)



9:16 (Dow Jones) Spread widening of bonds in banking sector is
warranted by deteriorating fundamentals, says Gimme Credit. The research
service says more banks likely to be hit with problem loans in months
ahead. Federal Mogul (FMO), Loews Cineplex (LCP), and AMF Bowling (PIN)
all have loans that could have bankers reaching for Maalox, says Gimme.

4Q, 2000 earnings views. Calls rumor of profit warning "outrageous."
Stock futures coming back a bit. (TG)



9:09 (Dow Jones) CBOT T-bonds up half a point, mainly on election news
and stocks, but low volume ahead of holiday keeping market from adding
to its early gains. "You'd think we'd be higher, but it's pretty quiet
here," trader says. (DMR)



8:55 (Dow Jones) John Roque notes that some observers claim that
technology represents some value, but the Arnold & S. Bleichroeder
technician says that value is still being created. "There is still no
real reason to step up to get aggressive on tech," he says. (TG)



8:40 (Dow Jones) Lehman cuts 4Q view on Home Depot (HD) to 25c a share
from 27c, 2000 view t $1.15 from $1.16, and 2001 estimate to $1.40 from
$1.45. While impressed with long-term initiatives to drive sales and
control costs, the brokerage firm senses a more conservative outlook
from management. Reiterates cautious outlook on stock, though it
continues to believe HD is one of the best names in retailing. (TG)



8:36 (Dow Jones) Jobless claims rose by 7,000 in the week ended Nov.
18 to 336,000 from an upward revised level in the prior week.  That
brings the 4-week moving average to 330,250.  The increases seem to
reflect layoffs in the auto industry, which are themselves a sign of
fundamental weakening in demand.  (JM)



8:34 (Dow Jones) A Greenwich Capital Markets Treasury strategist says
Gore's renewed chance of victory helps put the yield curve flatteners
back on, and should help widen credit spreads at the same time. It will
also allow for a test of the October yield curve low, with the 10-year
snipping away at a 5.56% yield, which means the issue's already decent
bid can improve. (MSD)



8:30 (Dow Jones) Stocks just can't get a break. Last night's ruling
from the Florida Supreme Court was a blow to George W. Bush and a
perceived blow to equities. At least that's how traders are interpreting
the short-term impact. Increasing talk of a Constitutional crisis isn't
helping. Meanwhile, there seems to be more concern that the soft landing
the Fed is trying to engineer may be in jeopardy. Trading will likely be
slowish Wednesday, particularly later in the session. The expected move
to the downside may be exacerbated by a lack of full participation in
front of Thanksgiving. Stock futures sharply lower, and Nasdaq may crack
below 2800. Sentiment numbers at 10:00 a.m. ET should be interesting.

helping. Meanwhile, there seems to be more concern that the soft landing
the Fed is trying to engineer may be in jeopardy. Trading will likely be
slowish Wednesday, particularly later in the session. The expected move
to the downside may be exacerbated by a lack of full participation in
front of Thanksgiving. Stock futures sharply lower, and Nasdaq may crack
below 2800. Sentiment numbers at 10:00 a.m. ET should be interesting.

NEW YORK - Lucent Technologies, reeling from profit shortfalls and management upheaval, on Tuesday said it may cut its already-reported fourth-quarter results because of $125 million in improperly recorded sales. The warning slammed Lucent shares down 16 percent.

Lucent, the world's No. 1 telecommunications equipment maker, said about $125 million in revenues may have been improperly recognized during the quarter ended Sept. 30. It also said it could not confirm its already-reduced financial guidance for the fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31.

Shares of Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent fell $3.38, or 16.1 percent, to close at $17.56. The stock, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, fell as low as $17.50, well below its previous 52-week low of $20.

"You don't expect a company of this size and this expertise to have accounting issues. It's a major blow to the credibility and honesty of the company," said John Forelli, a portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates, with more than $25 billion under management.

Lucent's stock has plunged 76 percent this year as the company has missed its profit growth targets, struggled with manufacturing constraints and product introductions, and fallen behind rivals in the booming optical-networking market.

Lucent last month fired its chairman and reported a 22 percent drop in fourth-quarter profits. It has trimmed its outlook for growth four times this year.

Lucent said the possible reduction in fourth-quarter revenues might cut its profits for the quarter and the full year by 2 cents per share. The company reported $9.4 billion in revenues and a profit of 18 cents a share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter.

"We wanted to make this public as soon as we discovered the issue," Lucent Chairman Henry Schacht said. "I have asked our outside auditor and our outside counsel to assist us in doing a complete review of this and any related issues."

The revenue issue was discovered as the company was completing the final preparation of its financial statements for its fiscal year.

Lucent said it alerted the Securities and Exchange Commission about the review.

"I'm absolutely incredulous that they could make a mistake of this magnitude," said Henry Asher, a portfolio manager with North Star Group, which owns shares of Lucent. "It makes you wonder what kind of systems they have in place."

Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Ching said the possible restatement reflected Lucent's "aggressive revenue recognition and financing positions" in the past. He cut his long-term rating on Lucent to "accumulate" from "buy."

"With a new management team in place," Ching said in a research report, "the review process will likely lead to more conservative revenue growth," and therefore earnings per share performance in the near term.

Ching slashed his 2001 profit forecast for the company to 20 cents a share from 65 cents.

 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday on concerns that a Florida Supreme Court decision threatened to prolong the battle for the White House. Fears that slowing U.S. growth will affect corporate earnings also rattled investor optimism. 

 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 93.93 points, or 3.27 percent, to 2777.52. The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 80.01 points, or 0.76 percent, to 10414.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 18.27 percent, or 1.36 percent, to 1329.08. 

 U.S. equities making significant moves included: 

 PORTAL SOFTWARE INC. FELL $11-11/16, OR 62.75 PERCENT, TO $6-15/16. 

 **The e-commerce software company reported quarterly sequential revenue growth of 2 percent in North America on Tuesday, compared to the better than 20 percent sequential growth it had reported in the prior five quarters, according to Goldman Sachs. Goldman and Prudential both said on Wednesday they cut their ratings on Portal. 

 Prudential said it cut its rating on software maker Portal to accumulate from strong buy after Portal reported lower-than-expected third-quarter revenues. 

 Goldman said it cut Portal to market outperform from recommended and took the shares off its recommended list, on company expectations for lower growth due to tighter capital markets. 

 The stock lost more than half of its value on Wednesday morning and has dropped to about a sixth of its value at the beginning of the month. 

 WATSON PHARMACEUTICALS INC. FELL $4-9/16, OR 8.94 PERCENT, TO $46-1/2. 

 BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO. ROSE $1-1/2, OR 2.24 PERCENT, TO $68-7/16. 

 **Watson on Wednesday slashed its revenue and earnings outlook, as a move by Bristol-Meyers crippled its plans to begin shipping a copycat version of No. 3 U.S. branded drug maker's anti-anxiety drug BuSpar. 

 Watson said it now expects to lose $18 to $20 million in fourth quarter revenues, and $38 to $40 million in 2001 revenues. The revenue shortfall will take 10-12 cents off the company's earnings per share in the fourth quarter, and reduce earnings by 15-17 cents per share in 2001, Watson said. Analysts had been expecting the company to earn 39 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $2.36 per share in 2001, according to data compiled by market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter on Wednesday said it lowered its investment rating on Watson to outperform from strong buy. 

 GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC. FELL $4-3/16, OR 4.97 PERCENT, TO $80. 

 LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. FELL $2-15/16, OR 5.52 PERCENT, TO $50-1/4. 

 BEAR STEARNS COS. INC. FELL $2-11/16, OR 5.3 PERCENT, TO $48-1/16. 

 AMEX BROKER DEALER INDEX FALLS 4.7 PERCENT. 

 **The Amex Broker Dealer Index fell for a fifth day extending it's decline since the year's peak in early September to 26 percent. Merrill Lynch warned yesterday of growing earnings risks for the financial services sector. "I don't think its anything new," said Lauren Smith, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "It's the combination of political uncertainty and interest rate uncertainty. Investors are nervous about the near-term earnings outlook." If investors don't buy and sell stocks the companies who make their money by arranging trades will see their profits fall. 

 GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. , FELL $1-3/16, OR 2.34 PERCENT, TO $49-9/16. 

 **General Electric on Wednesday denied rumors that it planned to issue a profit warning and said it was very comfortable with Wall Street expectations that the conglomerate will report higher fourth-quarter and full-year earnings. 

 "Responding to an outrageous rumor this morning of a potential profit warning, nothing could be further from the truth," GE Vice President of Investor Relations Mark Vachon said in a statement. 

 Analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is 36 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 COCA-COLA CO. ROSE $3-15/16, OR 7.13 PERCENT, TO $59-3/16. 

 QUAKER OATS CO. FELL $6-7/16, OR 6.82 PERCENT, TO $88. 

 DANONE FELL 2.80, OR 10.22 PERCENT, TO 24.60 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE TRADING. 

 **Shares of Coke rose on Wednesday after the world's largest soft drink maker issued a two paragraph statement saying it "will not pursue a transaction with Quaker Oats," the owner of the Gatorade brand of sports drinks. 

 French food group Danone said on Wednesday that it may be interest in Quaker.

 NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Lucent Technologies Inc., reeling from profit shortfalls and management upheaval, on Tuesday said it may cut its already-reported fourth-quarter results because of $125 million in improperly recorded sales. The warning slammed Lucent shares down 16 percent. 

 Lucent , the world's No. 1 telecommunications equipment maker, said about $125 million in revenues may have been improperly recognized during the quarter, ended Sept. 30. It also said it could not confirm its already-reduced financial guidance for the fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31. 

 Shares of Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent fell $3-3/8, or 16.1 percent, to close at $17-9/16. The stock, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, fell as low as $17-1/2, well below its previous 52-week low of $20. 

 "You don't expect a company of this size and this expertise to have accounting issues. It's a major blow to the credibility and honesty of the company," said John Forelli, a portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates, with more than $25 billion under management.

He slashed his 2001 profit forecast for the company to 20 cents a share from 65 cents. 

 The possible restatement puts pressure on Lucent's new chief financial officer, Deborah Hopkins, to rid the company of bad habits from the past. 

 Hopkins, who joined the company in April from Boeing Co., needs to quickly impose discipline on Lucent's contract revenue recognition policies, and must reassure investors that any future financial guidance the company gives can be believed, analysts said. 

 "She may have inherited these bad systems, so (investors) might give her the benefit of the doubt," said one portfolio manager. Lucent has slashed its growth outlook three times during Hopkins' brief tenure. 

 Still, some investors were less bleak. 

 "To us, it's one of those situations where new managements just throw in everything they can, digging up all those skeletons and getting rid of them, and it's often a good sign," said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus Corp. 

 COST-CUTTING EFFORT 

 In an effort to stop its streak of profit shortfalls, Lucent is restructuring its operations. Analysts expect the company to cut about 12,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force, in an effort to save money and speed up its product development efforts. 

 Earlier this month Lucent shuffled some top managers to mesh its sales and service organization, cut bureaucratic red tape, and quicken the pace of decision making.

 UPDATE 1-Watson stock falls on new BuSpar patent.

 NEW YORK, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares fell 6 percent Wednesday after U.S. regulators granted a new patent on a byproduct of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s BuSpar - a development that could stifle Watson's generic version of the anti-anxiety treatment. 

 Watson, Mylan Laboratories Inc. and other generic drug companies were counting on BuSpar to lose its U.S. marketing exclusivity on Wednesday and planned to begin shipping copycat versions within days, according to industry analysts. 

 But the 11th-hour patent approval for Bristol-Myers, the No. 3 U.S. branded drug maker, led Watson to slash its revenue and earnings outlook earlier Wednesday, the same day that it had expected Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its abbreviated new drug application for BuSpar equivalent buspirone. 

 Shares of Watson, which is based in Corona, Calif., fell 11 percent, or $5-3/4 to $45-5/16 on the New York Stock Exchange, making the stock the biggest percentage losers on the Big Board in early activity. It later trimmed its losses and recently traded at $47-7/8, down $3-3/16, or 6 percent. The stock is trading up nearly 37 percent year-to-date. 

 Pittsburgh-based Mylan's shares were off 3/4 at $22-1/4. St. Louis-based K-V Pharmaceutical Co. , which also has tentative approvals from the FDA to market buspirone, saw its stock dip $2-1/2, or 8 percent, to $31. 

 Bristol-Myers shares rose $1-1/8 to $68-1/16, off their year high of $76-1/4 and above a 52-week low of $42-7/16. 

 SHORTFALL SEEN 

 Bristol-Myers received the U.S. patent Tuesday on a metabolite, or derivative, of BuSpar known as 6-hydroxy-buspirone. The chemical is created when the body breaks down BuSpar, a leading anxiety drug that had global sales of $175 million in the third quarter. 

 BuSpar would probably have U.S. revenues of up to $750 million in 2001 if Bristol-Myers can keep generics at bay, but perhaps only $200 million if rival generics are allowed to come to market, according to Banc of America analyst Len Yaffe. 

 Without the expected revenue, Watson warned early Wednesday that it expects a delay to cost it $18 million to $20 million in revenues for the fourth quarter and $38 to $40 million in 2001 revenues. The company booked $183.4 million in sales for the quarter ended Sept 30. 

 It said the revenue shortfall will cut fourth-quarter earnings per share by 10 to 12 cents and by 15 to 17 cents in 2001. Analysts had expected it earnings of 39 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $2.36 in 2001, according to research firm First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Following the warning, analyst Joseph Riccardo of Bear Stearns adjusted his profit and revenue outlook for Watson in line with the company's guidance and cut his one-year share-price target to $70 from $75. 

 "We view the event as a positive for Bristol-Myers and a near-term negative for Watson," Riccardo said, "but in our opinion, Watson's underlying investment thesis remains intact. 

 "Watson remains our single-best idea within the drug group and we would use share price weakness as a buying opportunity," he said. "...At current valuations, you can reasonably buy the ongoing business and get the pipeline for free." 

 Morgan Stanley analyst Marc Goodman downgraded Watson to outperform from strong buy and set a price target of $60. 

 Lehman Brothers analyst Richard Silver estimated prior to Watson's warning that the new patent, assuming it delays generic versions of BuSpar, could hurt that company's earnings by about 7 cents per share in 2001 and Mylan's profits by at least 10 cents per share annually. 

 Silver said he is currently reviewing his estimates for Watson given the company's new outlook, but warned that further downward revisions of earnings projections for both companies are possible if the delay continues. 

 "We recommend that (Mylan Labs) investors remain on the sidelines pending additional clarification," he wrote in a note. Mylan officials were not immediately available for comment. 

 Bristol-Myers listed the patent on the metabolite in the so-called Orange Book kept by the FDA. Once a patent is listed there, the FDA typically is forbidden for 30 months to approve any generic drug that might interfere with that patent, a policy meant to give competing parties time to fight it out in the courts.

 NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Lucent Technologies Inc., already reeling from profit shortfalls and management upheaval, on Tuesday said it may cut its already-reported fourth-quarter results because of $125 million in improperly recorded sales. The warning sent Lucent shares tumbling 14 percent. 

 Lucent, the world's No. 1 telecommunications equipment maker, said about $125 million in revenues may have been improperly recognized during the quarter, ended Sept. 30. It also said it could not confirm its already-reduced financial guidance for the fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31. 

 Shares of Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent were down $3-1/16, or 14.6 percent, to $17-7/8 in afternoon trade. The stock, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, fell as low as $17-1/2, well below its previous 52-week low of $20. 

 "You don't expect a company of this size and this expertise to have accounting issues. It's a major blow to the credibility and honesty of the company," said John Forelli, a portfolio manager at Independence Investment Associates, with more than $25 billion under management. 

 Lucent's stock has plunged 76 percent this year as the company has missed its profit growth targets, struggled with manufacturing constraints and product introductions, and fallen behind rivals in the booming optical-networking market.

 In an effort to stop its streak of profit shortfalls, Lucent is restructuring its operations. Analysts expect the company to cut about 12,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force, in an effort to save money and speed up its product development efforts. 

 Earlier this month Lucent shuffled some top managers to mesh its sales and service organization, cut bureaucratic red tape, and quicken the pace of decision making. 

 Lucent brought back Schacht - who served as chairman of the company from 1995 to 1997 - to lead the recovery effort, but the task may prove harder and more time-consuming than investors initially expected, analysts said. Without firm guidance for the fiscal first quarter, investors will be skittish about the stock for several months, analysts said. 

 For the first quarter, Lucent previously forecast it would break even on a pro forma basis and revenues from continuing operations would decline 7 percent. 

 Amid Lucent's troubles, rival Nortel Networks Corp. on Monday reaffirmed its financial guidance through 2001, saying it continues to see strong growth in sales of optical, wireless and Internet equipment. Nortel, whose stock has fallen sharply after weak third-quarter fiber optic equipment sales, was hosting an investor conference in Boston on Tuesday to outline its strategy and growth prospects.

 Belgium's Puilaetco Funds L&H Stake  Cut  To 0.1%

 BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Belgian broker Puilaetco has cut its position in Belgian speech recognition company Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV (LHSP) to less than 0.1% in two of the investment company's funds from about 0.5%, a Puilaetco fund manager said Monday. 

 Yves Vaneerdewegh, fund manager at Puilaetco, said he sold most of his EUR375,000 position in Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products NV (LHSP) on Nov. 9 for about $5.00 a share when L&H admitted that accounting "errors and irregularities" would lead the firm to restate 1998 and 1999 and first-half 2000 results. 

 The admission, which accompanied a third quarter profit warning, caused a 47% one-day drop in the share price to $3.50. 

 "We tried to sell the entire position and we managed to sell most it," he said, adding that he'd like to sell the remaining stake when the share resumes trading. 

 L&H shares have been suspended on Easdaq and Nasdaq market pending the outcome of a KPMG audit, which the company commissioned last August. The results are expected in the next few weeks. 

 L&H used to have a 4% weighting in Puilaetco's EUR75 Belgian Fund. The company's EUR140 million High Growth Europe Fund also had a stake in the Belgian technology company. 

 Vaneerdewegh said the positions were substantially reduced in September when L&H issued a third quarter profit warning and the share price started to fall. 

 He said the funds' performances haven't been hurt by their stakes in L&H because Puilaetco sold shares in July when shares were trading about $35.00 and in September when the share price was about $12.00. 

 Puilaetco also sold its L&H stakes in several European institutional funds in September, he said.

 FRANKFURT, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Shares in American-German automaker DaimlerChrysler skidded to a fresh year-low on Monday as investment houses rushed to downgrade it in the wake of last week's profit-warning linked to its U.S. operations. 

 Deutsche Bank cut the group's earnings per share forecast for 2000 to 4.5 euros per share from 4.8 euros and its 2001 forecast to 3.7 euros from 4.7 euros a few hours after Lehman Brothers slashed its price target to 39 euros from 43 euros. 

 By 1430 GMT, the group was trading 5.20 percent down at 47.21 euros after earlier diving to a fresh all-time low of 46.90, past this morning's previous record of 48.10 euros. 

 Traders said DaimlerChrysler shares were trading just above technical support at the 46.50 euros level but they expected this level to hold in the short-term. 

 DaimlerChrysler has shed 36.5 percent of its value since the beginning of this year and is trading some 41 percent below a year-high of 79.97 euros reached in January. 

 It has underperformed the European car sector by 27 percent. 

 The world's fifth largest car maker is suffering from a crisis of investor confidence after it said on Friday results at its U.S. Chrysler unit would fall below expectations and would drag group profits down. 

 Schroder Salomon Smith Barney cut its price target to 42 euros from 45 on Friday while Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch set the trend with downgrades earlier last week.

 FRANKFURT, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank said on Monday it had cut its DaimlerChrysler AG earnings-per-share forecasts for the years 2000 to 2002 after the transatlantic auto giant issued a profit warning last Friday. 

 Deutsche said in a statement it cut its 2000 EPS forecast for Daimler to 4.5 euros per share from 4.8 euros and its 2001 forecast to 3.7 euros from 4.7 euros. 

 It cut its 2002 forecast to 3.7 euros from 5.2 euros. 

 "While the management changes and the likelihood of tougher restructuring may create some hope for a turnaround in profitability, we fear that the root cause of DaimlerChrysler's problems is an overall decline in profitability of the North American light truck market," Deutsche said.

 WORLD BONDS-Ratings protection a risky option for BT bonds.

 LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - A rumoured plan by British Telecom to cut borrowing costs by offering downgrade protection on its forthcoming dollar bond could prove risky for the operator, analysts said on Monday. 

 BT ended months of speculation on Friday, when it announced it would sell up to $8.0 billion of bonds, with tenors of five-, 10-and 30-years expected. 

 Market rumours on Monday suggested the cost-conscious UK group would include a step-up coupon offering investors a cushion against any future downgrade. Such a move should lower BT's cost of funding but would leave the company vulnerable should a ratings downgrade occur. 

 Downgrade protection was a feature of several telecoms deals sold earlier this year - among them Deutche Telecom's $14.6 billion June megabond - but the structure has fallen out of favour as sentiment towards telecoms debt has improved. Analysts forsee a period of ratings stability in the sector after an across-the-board downgrade to single-A following Germany's UMTS auction in August. 

 Richard Deutsch, a credit analyst at BNP Paribas, said a step-up coupon would probably not subsidise a materially lower cost of funds for BT. He said the company must believe it could not place bonds without a step-up structure. 

 "We feel BT is taking a huge risk with this structure, as we think it is entirely possible that BT will see its credit downgraded to the BBB+ level, particularly by S&P," Deutsch. 

 He said that unless BT can sell non-core assets quickly, bring down its debt materially, and securing its rating, the company risked entering a downward spiral. 

 Dealers said talk was BT's bonds would include a covenant committing it to an additional 25 basis points of interest if Moody's or S&P cut their ratings for the company to Baa1 or BBB+, respectively. 

 For each agency downgrade below this trigger level, the company would pay another 25 basis points. 

 "All these telecom issuers have come to the market and have had to pay such a premium to get their deals away," said Bradley Bugg, telecom analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. "They (BT) have thought do we pay the premium, or do we reduce this premium by including some sort of feelgood measure like the coupon step-up showing we are relatively committed to where our ratings are at the moment." 

 RATINGS CUT

 BT is rated A2 by Moody's rating agency and A by Standard & Poor's, which slashed their respective ratings by four notches earlier this year. Both warned of further cuts - to below the crucial "A" grade, below which many investors cannot hold the debt - unless it dramatically reduces its debt. 

 Like other telecom operators, BT has been forced to issue debt to pay for the spiralling costs of obtaining third generation mobile phone licences across Europe. BT's dollar bond issue will be used to reduce its exposure to the U.S. commercial paper market, which it relies upon heavily for its funding. 

 Earlier this month, BT announced a partial break-up of the company and plans to slash its debt, slated to reach 30 billion pounds by next March, by a third. 

 Since a profit warning in February, and on investor jitters triggered partly by the cost of UMTS licences, BT shares have halved in value. On Monday BT shares were trading at 647 pence. 

 STEP-UP NOW LIKELY 

 Bound by SEC rules, neither BT nor the lead managers would comment on whether a step-up coupon was being considered. 

 Some in the market had expected BT to wait until the new year to launch its bonds, but with roadshows to potential investors in Europe this week, and to U.S. investors next, issuance is expected before year-end. 

 "It really makes sense to get the deal done this side of the silly season rather than wait for January when the world and his wife are going to be wanting to come to the market as well," said Simon Ballard, a market strategist at Bear Stearns. 

 Dealers said there had been some talk that BT was looking to price themselves against existing Vodafone and Telefonica bonds, but this was dismissed as too ambitious. Within the bedraggled telecom bond sector, both are regarded the highest credits, and dealers said a pricing against Deutsche Telekom , WorldCom or AT&T bonds would be more realistic. 

 Dealers said telecom spreads were five to 10 basis points wider in the dollar market and around five basis points wider in the euro market on Monday.

Holiday card maker has grim greetings

CLEVELAND - American Greetings Corp., a maker of sentiments for birthdays and holidays for 94 years, jolted investors Thursday with a profit warning and said it needs to make big adjustments to compete in the Internet age.

Investors quickly sent its shares down 39 percent. American Greetings shares fell $7.75 to close at $12 on the New York Stock Exchange.

At a time when the second-largest greeting card company normally anticipates an annual holiday season surge in sales, American Greetings announced it expects much lower earnings for its third quarter, will cut its dividend by more than half and plans a restructuring.

The company's online venture, AmericanGreetings.com, continues to be a drag on profit and will cost American Greetings between 35 and 40 cents per share in the current fiscal year.

Trans-Atlantic auto merger in rough seas

DETROIT - After two years of trying to make its trans-Atlantic merger work, DaimlerChrysler AG is still two companies divided by an ocean of troubles. With Chrysler president Jim Holden due to be replaced by Dieter Zetsche from Germany today, the vaunted merger of equals enters another time of doubt. U.S. workers are uncertain what the new regime will bring, with distrust stirred by statements from DaimlerChrysler's chairman that he never intended a merger of equals.

Chrysler's performance hasn't met Stuttgart-based DaimlerChrysler's expectations, with sales incentives erasing profits and production of the hot new PT Cruiser falling short of demand. Daimler and Chrysler also have been reluctant to share parts to cut costs, which might change with a new emphasis on saving money.

 Punters punish Hardie as interim profit slumps.

 JAMES Hardie yesterday joined the throng of building sector companies warning of falling profits, sparking a savage sell-off of its shares. The company, which has hitched its fortunes to the United States, reported a 56 percent drop in its half-year profit to $30 million. James Hardie shares hit a nine-month low of $3.46 yesterday before closing down 21 at $3.50. The building products maker was stung by softer market conditions in North America, particularly a sharp fall in gypsum prices. It was also hit by a $35.5 million abnormal loss relating to the company's exit from its Australian windows business. The profit downgrade follows similar tales of gloom reported by building sector heavyweights such as Brambles and Boral. CSR is also expected to be hit hard. Group chief executive Peter Macdonald said a steep fall in gypsum prices in the second quarter in the US meant the company would not "achieve its stated target of exceeding last year's ($150.6 million) profit". 

  "This is due to the much steeper than expected decline in wallboard prices in the US which has occurred in the first six months," he said. "It's well below what anyone predicted it might be. It's now got to the point where quite a lot of the (rival gypsum) plants are in losses - we're not though." Half-year sales were almost on par with the previous interim, at $816 million. But with gypsum prices expected to continue to fall, the company's outlook remained uncertain, Mr Macdonald said. While James Hardie expected to exceed its cost reduction targets in the gypsum business, they would not be sufficient to offset the fall in product prices. "In the first half we have achieved better-than-planned reductions in costs ... but, as wallboard prices have already fallen 26 percent in the first half, we are seeing a stronger-than-expected drop in profitability," he said. In the company's US fibre cement business, a slight lift in profit to $58.6 million from $57.1 million was not enough to counteract an 18 percent slide to $65.7 million in pre-tax profit from the company's US gypsum wallboard business. James Hardie has three gypsum plants in the US - Nashville, Las Vegas and Seattle. It intends to expand its line of joint compound products, which hold wallboards together and have more stable prices than gypsum. The group is building a factory in Washington, where it has a 40 percent share of the base wallboard market and has a joint manufacturing deal with an existing player in California. Mr Macdonald said the company also planned to sell its Australian windows business to enable it to better focus on fibre cement. "The group plans to accelerate the expansion of its fibre cement operations, based on growing confidence that its proprietary fibre cement technology has significant potential around the world," he said. In September, the company said it would spend $100 million on its US fibre cement businesses by March, 2001 as part of its $200 million capital expenditure programme. Stronger growth in sales and profits of its fibre cement businesses in the US would be delivered as early as next year, he said.

CLEVELAND (AP) - American Greetings Corp., a maker of sentiments for birthdays and holidays for 94 years, jolted investors Thursday with a profit warning and said it needs to make big adjustments to compete in the Internet age.

Investors quickly sent its shares down 39 percent. American Greetings shares fell $7.75 to close at $12 on the New York Stock Exchange.

At a time when the second-largest greeting card company normally anticipates an annual holiday season surge in sales, American Greetings announced it expects much lower earnings for its third quarter, will cut its dividend by more than half and plans a restructuring.

Morry Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer, tried to assure analysts in a conference call Thursday that the company will come out of the slump.

"This is still a great industry and that we can be successful in it, provided we are properly aligned with the changes that are taking place,' Weiss said. "The Internet is having an impact on our business. We have conflicting research as to what extent."

The company's own online venture, AmericanGreetings.com, continues to be a drag on profit and will cost American Greetings between 35 and 40 cents per share in the current fiscal year.

There is no question the company is feeling the inevitable stress from people feeling more comfortable communicating via the Internet, said Eric Bosshard, an industry analyst with Midwest Research in Cleveland.

"I think the growth of the Internet spells trouble for the traditional greeting card business," he said. "I think that's the root of the issue. You have to spur sales by cutting prices."

American Greetings said it also is troubled with too much inventory and increased competition from lower-priced cards.

Market leader Hallmark Inc., based in Kansas City, said it has not been stressed as much at the cash register and doesn't feel it has been hurt by the Internet.

"The Internet provides yet another way for people to connect," spokeswoman Julie O'Dell said. "So that's the purpose of our hallmark.com site. It's a way for us to help them do that."

Some of the lower priced competition in the industry comes from Hallmark, which in March 1999 introduced its 99-cent Hallmark Warm Wishes cards in more than 21,000 stores.

American Greetings said it has been increasing its production of lower-priced cards as well.

The price of greeting cards is one thing that puts off Noel Lavezzi, 24, who was shopping Thursday at Gorant Candies Cards & Gifts.

"I know we're paying for the idea and the work. But they're throwaway items," she said.

American Greetings will reduce its quarterly dividend from 21 cents to 10 cents, beginning with the dividend payable in March 2001.

Earnings for the third quarter, which will be released Dec. 19, are expected to be as low as 50 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had pegged earnings for the quarter at 91 cents per share.

In the year-ago quarter, American Greetings earned $53.9 million, or 81 cents per share, down 28 percent from the 1998 quarter. Sales totaled $623.4 million.

That was the quarter American Greetings announced its $162 million acquisition of Cincinnati-based Gibson Greetings, uniting the second and third largest U.S. greeting-card makers behind industry leader Hallmark.

Vice Chairman Jim Spira said American Greetings is reviewing operations companywide, including a look at all brands, product lines and facilities. He said some job cuts will be inevitable, but the number will depend on the extent of the restructuring. The company has more than 20,000 employees.

American Greetings anticipates earnings for its full fiscal 2001 to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.35 per share, compared with Wall Street expectations of $1.98 per share for the year.

The Cleveland-based company is the biggest publicly held creator, manufacturer and distributor of greeting cards and gift products with about $2 billion in annual sales.

Hallmark, which is privately held, last year had sales of $4.2 billion.

 WRAP: Qantas To Finalize Fleet Upgrade Dec

 SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. (A.QAN) said Thursday the carrier's board will meet next month before finalizing a decision on a massive fleet upgrade. 

 "We are seriously evaluating a fleet plan," Qantas Chairwoman Margaret Jackson told reporters after the company's annual general meeting. 

 "At the last two board meetings in October and November we have discussed fleet plans and we will do so again in December." 

 She is expected to make a final announcement on the fleet upgrade by mid-December. 

 Meanwhile, the airline's shares dropped 20 cents, or 5.7%, to A$3.30 as Jackson warned Qantas is battling new domestic competitors, rising fuel prices and the fall in the Australian dollar. 

 Analysts had expected Qantas to announce the fleet upgrade decision this week, with Airbus Industrie (F.ABI) favored to win an order for at least 10 A3XX super jumbos in place of a new version 747 from Boeing Co.(BA). The proposed orders include six of Airbus's smaller A330 models. 

 The airline has been under pressure to upgrade its fleet after rival Singapore Airlines Ltd. (P.SAL) ordered 10 A3XX airplanes in September. 

 Separately, Qantas is to take delivery of six more Boeing 767-300 jets on lease from its 25% shareholder British Airways PLC (BAB) before the end of December. 


   Qantas Market Capitalization Cut By A$243 Million



The sell off in Qantas stock Thursday afternoon wiped A$243 million
off its market capitalization.



Qantas said its fuel bill for the current 2000-01 fiscal year could be
A$170 million more than 1999-00.



Eric Gale, director of Ord Minnett Securities, said the shares fall
was exacerbated by the chairwoman's comments about the blowout in fuel
prices although that was "not necessarily taken as a profit warning."



"We expect to deliver an operating profit result for the first half
broadly consistent last year," Jackson said.



Chief Executive James Strong said the carrier has not progressed
further in its discussions with Malaysian Airline System BDH (P.MAS)
despite comments made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad.



Earlier this month, the Malaysian Prime Minister said that his
government was considering giving up its golden share in Malaysian
Airlines if it became a barrier to bringing in a foreign partner.



The Malaysian government holds special rights, otherwise known as the
"golden share" in the Malaysian carrier which enables it to ensure that
major decisions affecting the operations of their company are in line
with government policy.



Strong declined to comment any further on talks the carrier had
earlier with Thai Airways International PCL (H.TAI).



Strong, whose retirement plans have already been announced, has agreed
to leave the company in July next year.



He will hand over to Geoff Dixon as chief executive earlier than
expected in March "as part of an orderly, planned transition".



Qantas also said it is expanding its partnership with British Airways
through the Oneworld alliance, which some analysts and aviation
commentators have speculated could be disbanded or lose key members in
the near future.



"Both airlines are founding members of Oneworld and contrary to recent
media speculation, the partners are continuing to work on ways of
providing further benefits for customers as well as for alliance
members," Qantas said.

 ATLANTA -- Home Depot Inc. reported a 13% rise in net income for its fiscal third quarter, matching expectations it lowered last month, but sounded increasingly wary about its outlook for the current quarter, partly because the economy is cooling. 

 Arthur M. Blank, Home Depot's president and chief executive officer, said growth in customer traffic at the 1,064-store chain had slowed during the past several weeks. Mr. Blank added that Home Depot isn't lowering its earnings projection "at this time" for the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31. 

 The world's largest home-improvement retailer posted earnings of $650 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, for the quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $573 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 17% to $11.55 billion from $9.88 billion. 

 While the results weren't a surprise given Home Depot's profitwarning last month, they demonstrated that one of the decade's fastest-growing retailers now faces an uphill battle to spark sales over at least the next several months. One important indicator of sales momentum, average per-store sales, fell 1.9% to $862,000 a week in the third quarter, the steepest decline in almost five years. 

 Still, Home Depot's shares surged as many investors breathed a sigh of relief that the company hit its lowered projections for the latest quarter, including a 4% increase in sales at stores open at least a year. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Home Depot rose $2.13, or 5.7%, to $39.50. 

 Home Depot said it was battered by a 25% decline in the price of building materials such as lumber and drywall compared with a year earlier, as well as difficult comparisons against last year's results, when it got a big boost from purchases tied to hurricane-rebuilding efforts and preparations for the year-2000 computer glitch. 

 Home Depot's gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of sales, widened to 29.9% from 29.3% in the year-earlier period. 

 While that shows Home Depot continues to use its enormous clout to demand better terms from suppliers, company officials said they expect smaller boosts from such product reviews in coming quarters. 

 With little improvement in lumber prices expected until at least early next year and the economy's slowing down, Mr. Blank said Home Depot plans to watch expenses and make a huge sales blitz in its massive stores. 

 "Whenever there has been this kind of slowdown, we have turned back to our basic kind of nature, which is to be piranhas," he said, referring to Home Depot's past aggressiveness and low prices that nibbled away market share from rivals. "We plan on doing the same thing again." 

 In the current quarter, Mr. Blank said Home Depot has "some flexibility" to reach the average estimate of 26 cents a share from analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial even if same-store sales growth continues to shrink. But anything worse than 2% or 3% same-store sales growth, "and we're looking at lowering estimates again," said Aram Rubinson, an analyst at the UBS Warburg unit of UBS AG. 

 For last year's fiscal fourth quarter, Home Depot posted net income of $578 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $9.17 billion. 

 Mr. Blank said the retailer would continue to increase its store count by about 20% a year despite the uncertain outlook, adding that Home Depot still is aiming to boost per-share earnings by 23% to 25% next year. "It still is a good business environment," he said.

 NEW YORK -- Shares of Network Appliance Inc. tumbled despite posting fiscal second-quarter earnings late Tuesday that exceeded analysts' expecations. 

 The maker of storage systems for web sites said net income for the period ended Oct. 27 was $35.4 million, or 10 cents a diluted share, a penny a share higher than the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 But in a subsequent conference call, chief financial officer Jeffrey Allen warned that Network Appliance (NTAP) expects gross profit margins to "decline over the next several quarters." He noted that margins had exceeded company expectations "due to the mix and the increasing level of software content." 

 Mr. Allen added the expected increase in sales of large-capacity systems, which have a higher mix of disk drives, will probably drive margins down. However, he said Network Appliance would be able to balance declining margins with "continued strong investments across the company." 

 At 4 p.m. EST on the Nasdaq Stock Market, shares of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company were down $20.12, or 21%, at $76.13 on very heavy volume of 27.3 million shares. The daily average is 7.7 million shares. 

 Despite robust 109% year-over-year revenue growth in the second quarter, the figure was down from the 124% leap reported in the first quarter. The first-quarter's gain was probably peak revenue growth, management said in the conference call, but that the company was certainly pleased with an 109% gain. 

 Network Appliance also said that sequential revenue growth will be in the 10% to 15% range for the next several quarters, as earnings from operations should comprise about 18% to 19% of revenue. 

 Amid a slew of reiterations, two analysts came out Wednesday with opposing viewpoints, one boosting his investment rating of Network Appliance, while another cutting his rating. 

 First Albany's Mark Kelleher raised his rating to "strong buy" from "buy" and put an $120 price target on the stock. Andy Neff of Bear Stearns cut his investment rating to "attractive" from "buy." 

 Mr. Kelleher said Network Appliance hit its revenue estimate, and he projected fiscal 2001 revenue of $1.1 billion, a 94% gain from the previous year. The industry standard is about 70% growth, he noted, adding that even if the company's growth rate were 55%, it would justify the $120 target. 

 One reason for his upgrade and bullish comments, Mr. Kelleher said, was that he "didn't have a strong buy on the company," like many other analysts, and was "waiting for a place to put out the upgrade." 

 Expecting softness in the stock Wednesday, he issued his upgrade, and said "anywhere in the 80s" would be a great place to buy shares. "We believe the recent pull-back in anticipation of the new EMC product," from competitor EMC Corp. (EMC), "presents a rare entry point for the stock," Mr. Kelleher added in his research note. 

 Mr. Neff was at the Comdex Fall 2000 technology conference in Las Vegas and wasn't immediately available for comment. 

 In his research note, Mr. Neff called the second quarter "in line" and maintained his estimates for Network Appliances, but said business momentum is "decelerating" and that there are "valuation concerns."

 CAMDEN, New Jersey (AP) - First-quarter earnings at Campbell Soup Co. fell 13 percent due to increased marketing spending on its U.S. soup business and Pepperidge Farm snack foods. 

 For the three months ended Oct. 29, Campbell reported net income of dlrs 204 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with dlrs 235 million, or 54 cents per share, for the same period a year ago, the company said Wednesday. 

 The results exceeded Wall Street's lowered expectations of 45 cents per share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Camden-based Campbell had issued a profit warning in September, saying that first quarter earnings would be 6 cents to 8 cents per share below estimates at the time. 

 Net sales for the quarter increased to dlrs 1.78 billion from dlrs 1.77 billion in the year-ago period. 

 First-quarter global soup volume was up 4 percent. Soup consumption in the United States, where Campbell has 70 percent of the wet soup market, rose 3 percent, said David W. Johnson, president and chief executive officer. 

 Campbell's other brands include Franco-American and Prego pasta sauces.

 THOMASVILLE, North Carolina (AP) - A multinational telecommunications company plans to open a training center in Thomasville, a city known more for its furniture jobs than high-tech employment. 

 ABEST Communications Corp., based in Taipei, Taiwan, will train its engineers from a high-tech office in a Thomasville business park, said Larry Burton, the company president. Groups of about 15 computer engineers will spend a year in Thomasville learning the details of ABEST's software and hardware components before they are sent to plants around the world. 

 ABEST designs and manufactures broadband access equipment for telephone and Internet service providers.

 ATLANTA (AP) - The Coca-Cola Co. will cut 600 jobs abroad and in Houston as part of its an ongoing restructuring effort launched last January. 

 Company officials said the cuts will be in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and the Houston-based Minute Maid operation. The cuts would bring the company's total job reduction to nearly 5,000 worldwide, down from the original estimate of 6,000 cuts and an April estimate of 5,200. 

 "We're going to complete the streamlining process" with these cuts, said Coca-Cola President Jack Stahl. "Plans to increase revenue growth have been accompanied by the determination that additional cost reductions are also necessary to meet our overall performance goals." 

 In addition, the company's Africa and Middle East organization is being split into three divisions. Coke said employees who lose their jobs in those regions will be able to take advantage of a special entrepreneurship loan program.

 MONTREAL (AP) - The transportation division of Bombardier Inc. has won a dlrs 130 million order to produce electric trains for the French national railway. 

 The Montreal company said Wednesday a group that includes Bombardier Transportation and Alstom Transport had landed a dlrs 520 million order from the French national rail company for 203 electric train sets. 

 Bombardier will build 89 multicar trains, valued at dlrs 130 million, and deliver them between October 2002 and October 2005. 

 The contract includes an option for 426 additional vehicles, which would give Bombardier about dlrs 376 million worth of work. 

 Bombardier Transportation is a world leader in making rail cars and also produces freight cars and provides operations and maintenance. 

 It is part of Bombardier Inc., one of Canada's major industrial companies, which employs 56,000 people in Canada and around the world making regional and corporate aircraft and recreational products such as snowmobiles and water craft. 

 BEIJING (AP) - Coca-Cola Co. expects sales growth in China to hit 25 percent for the second straight quarter because of strong local marketing efforts, the company's Asia-Pacific president said Wednesday. 

 The Atlanta-based beverage giant expects its fourth quarter will be a repeat of the third, when China sales jumped on the impact of ads featuring local pop-stars, Sandy Allan said in an interview, Dow Jones Newswires reported. 

 Long-term growth is likely to ease, but Coca-Cola still expects to sell as much product in the next four years in China as it has since it entered the market in 1978. 

 "Realistically, we're aiming for 15 percent to 16 percent growth" a year, Allan told Dow Jones. 

 China's growth will be enough to propel it past Japan in the next two to three years to become the No. 1 market in Asia by volume, Allan said. Worldwide, Coca-Cola expects China to become its fourth biggest market in that period, from its current No. 6 position. 

 Having invested dlrs 1.1 billion since 1978, Coca-Cola will pump another dlrs 200 million to dlrs 250 million in the next four years to boost production capacity.

 Home Depot's 3rd-Quarter Profit Rose 13%, Matched Reduced Estimates

 ATLANTA -- Home Depot Inc. said fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 13%, meeting analysts' lowered expectations. 

 The world's largest home-improvement chain said its results were hurt by lower retail pricing of lumber and building materials. The company also noted year-earlier results were boosted by hurricane and Year 2000 sales. 

 Home Depot (HD) reported net income of $650 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, for the period ending Oct. 29, compared with $573 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 Sales rose 17% to $11.55 billion from $9.88 billion. Sales in stores open at least a year rose 4%. 

 Home Depot opened 52 new stores and reopened one in the third quarter, bringing the total number to 1,064. They include Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Centers and Villager's Hardware stores. 

 The company said it is cautious about its sales outlook for the fourth quarter, but repeated its expectations for earnings of $1.16 to $1.17 a share for the full year. For fiscal 2001, Home Depot said it remains committed to achieving earnings growth of 23% to 25%. 

 Home Depot stunned investors in October with its first profit warning in more than five years. The company lowered its estimate to about 28 cents a share for the third quarter, and indicated it expected to earn about 26 cents a share for the fourth quarter. The home-improvement retailer's shares plunged 28% immediately after the warning, contributing to a big decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that day. 

 Analysts subsequently lowered their estimates for both quarters. The current estimate is for fourth-quarter earnings of 26 cents a share. 

 Home Depot had same-stores sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, of 4%. Strong sales in kitchen, bath, home decor, seasonal products and gardening were offset by lower pricing in lumber and building materials. Officials said comparisons to a year earlier also were made tougher by strong sales last year related to Y2K preparations and sales related to Hurricane Floyd. 

 Gross margin rose 58 basis points to 29.88%. However, Home Depot officials expect fourth-quarter gross margin will decline by 100 basis points from a year earlier because of a slower rate of vendor rebates, moderating benefits from product-line reviews, the impact of Home Depot's rapidly growing but lower-margin appliance business and ongoing pressure from energy and transportation costs. 

 For the coming year, Home Depot President and Chief Executive Arthur Blank said in a conference call that the business environment "will probably continue to be fairly difficult." 

 Mr. Blank expects improved lumber prices sometime in the second quarter and modest gross margin improvement companywide. 

 Home Depot said it will focus on offering low prices, a good product assortment and strong customer service and should be in a position to deliver 23% to 25% earnings growth for fiscal 2001.

Third quarter same-store sales rose 4%.


 Home Depot Inc. (HD) reiterated its expectations of fiscal 2000 earnings of $1.16 to $1.17 a share. 

 The company said the third quarter was hurt by lower retail pricing in lumber and building materials. Sales comparisons were affected by increased sales in September 1999 from "hurricane activity" and Year 2000 related sales in the second half of 1999. 

 The company expects the factors affecting the third quarter to continue in the fourth. 

 Home Depot is "cautious" regarding its sales outlook for the fourth quarter, but remains committed to its goal of 23% to 25% earnings per share growth for fiscal 2001. 

 In the third quarter, Home Depot opened 52 new stores and reopened one store, bringing the total stores operated to 1,064. The stores include Home Depot stores, EXPO Design Centers and Villager's Hardware stores. 

 In October, the retailer issued its first profit warning in more than five years, saying it expected third quarter earnings of 28 cents a share, which was below analysts estimates at the time. 

 Home Depot also indicated that fourth quarter earnings would be about 26 cents a share, which was also below analyst expectations at the time. The company saw fiscal 2000 earnings at $1.16 to $1.17 a share. 

 A current First Call/Thompson Financial survey of 20 analysts produced a fourth quarter earnings estimate of 26 cents a share. 

 A First Call survey of 23 analysts produced a fiscal 2000 estimate of $1.16 a share and a fiscal 2001 estimate of $1.41 a share.

 NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc., the No. 1 home improvement retailer, on Tuesday said third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent, meeting analysts' lowered estimates, as results continued to be dampened by lower selling prices for the company's lumber and building materials products. 

 The Atlanta-based company, which last month stunned Wall Street by warning it would miss earnings targets for the third quarter and full year because of the drop in prices, said third-quarter profits rose to $650 million, or 28 cents a share, from $573 million, or 25 cents a share, a year ago. 

 Following last month's profit warning, Wall Street analysts polled by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial cut their consensus earnings forecast to 28 cents a share from 31 cents. 

 Home Depot said Tuesday it expects the same factors that hurt third-quarter results to negatively affect the fourth quarter. It forecast full-year earnings of $1.16 and $1.17 per share, in line with Wall Street estimates. 

 Prior to the earnings warning, analysts had been expecting a profit of $1.25 a share, according to First Call. 

 Home Depot said those results, however, depend on customer traffic and sales in the fourth quarter that are consistent with those of the third quarter. 

 "Continued commodity price deflation, as well as the stronger retail sales environment and higher gross margin rate experienced in 1999, pressure our ability to generate earnings growth this year at the strong rates we have experienced in the last several years," Arthur Blank, president and chief executive of Home Depot, said in a statement. 

 "These factors have also made us cautious regarding our sales outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000," he said. 

 "Longer term, trends underlying the home improvement industry remain favorable for continued sales and market share growth at The Home Depot," Blank said, adding that the company hopes to see 23 to 25 percent earnings growth for fiscal 2001. 

 Sales for the third quarter rose 17 percent, to $11.5 billion from $9.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least one year, rose only 4 percent for the quarter, also hurt by a deflation in retail prices for lumber and building materials. 

 The company said this year's comparable sales were up against the positive sales impact from hurricane-related activity in autumn of last year and "Y2K"-related sales activity over the second half of 1999. 

 Shares of Home Depot, which fell 29 percent after the earnings warning, closed at $37-3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. The stock's 52-week low is $34-11/16.

 NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc., the No. 1 home improvement retailer, on Tuesday said third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent, meeting analysts' lowered estimates, as lower selling prices for lumber and building materials products continued to dampen results. 

 The Atlanta-based company, which last month stunned Wall Street by warning it would miss earnings targets for the third quarter and full year because of the drop in prices, said that if trends continue, fourth-quarter and full-year 2000 results could be pressured, as well. 

 To be sure, Home Depot's top competitor, Lowe's Cos Inc., said Monday it expected the environment to remain hostile, pressured by price deflation and sluggish sales across most retail sectors. 

 CIBC World Markets analyst Peter Benedict said the rest of this year and the first part of next year will be difficult for Home Depot. 

 "The macro environment is not going to immediately turn more favorable," he said. "It's still going to be a challenge over the next couple of quarters." 

 Amid a strong surge in retail stocks, shares of Home Depot rose almost 5 percent, or $1-13/16, to close at at $39-3/16 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Standard & Poor's retail index was up 3 percent, or 23.5 points, at 790.21. 

 Home Depot saw its shares fall 29 percent after it said in early October that it would miss earnings targets for the back half of the year. The stock's 52-week low is $34-11/16 and its high $70. 

 "It was a good quarter by the measurements most retailers would use, but not the kind of year-over-year performance that we're used to seeing," Carol Tome, vice president of finance and accounting, said on a conference call. 

 Home Depot said its third-quarter profits rose to $650 million, or 28 cents a share, from $573 million, or 25 cents a share, a year ago. 

 Following last month's profit warning, Wall Street analysts polled by research firm First Call/Thomson Financial cut their consensus earnings forecast to 28 cents a share from 31 cents. 

 Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $11.5 billion from $9.9 billion a year earlier. Same-store sales - those at stores open at least one year - rose only 4 percent for the quarter, also hurt by a drop in retail prices for lumber and building materials. 

 TOUGH COMPARISONS 

 The company said this year's comparable sales were up against the positive sales impact from hurricane-related activity in the autumn of 1999 and "Y2K"-related sales over the second half of last year. 

 Despite the dismal results, Home Depot President and Chief Executive Arthur Blank remained optimistic about the company's ability to pull through this negative period and emerge with even more market share in the home improvement retail segment. 

 "(In) this kind of slowdown, we turn back to our basic kind of nature, which is to be piranhas," Blank said. "We plan on doing the same thing again. We'll be very aggressive in the marketplace to gain as much share as we can." 

 Still, analysts said they are cautious about the outlook for both Home Depot and Lowe's, saying increased competition in the sector may create even more pressure. 

 "The competition will remain heated over the next few quarters," Benedict said. "However, the competitive environment in home improvement retailing is better than that of a number of other retail sectors. 

 "This essentially a duopoly - it's Home Depot versus Lowe's - so the likelihood of an extended period of irrational pricing or competition or promotional activity is much less here than it is in other places." 

 Shares of Lowe's were up $1-3/4, or 4.4 percent, at $41-3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Home Depot on Tuesday forecast full-year earnings of between $1.16 and $1.17 per share, in line with Wall Street's current estimates. Prior to the earnings warning, analysts had been expecting a profit of $1.25 a share, according to First Call. 

 Home Depot said those results, however, depend on fourth-quarter customer traffic and sales that are consistent with those of the third quarter. 

 "Continued commodity price deflation, as well as the stronger retail sales environment and higher gross margin rate experienced in 1999, pressure our ability to generate earnings growth this year at the strong rates we have experienced in the last several years," Blank said. "These factors have also made us cautious regarding our sales outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. 

 "In the coming fiscal year, the business environment probably will continue to be fairly difficult," he said. "We are building our business plan from the bottom up with very conservative comp (comparable) assumptions, assuming lumber price deflation gets better in the second quarter of this coming year." 

 During the quarter, Home Depot opened 52 new stores and reopened one, bringing the total number to 1,064.

 NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc., the No. 1 home improvement retailer, on Tuesday said third-quarter earnings rose 12 percent, meeting analysts' lowered estimates, as lower selling prices for lumber and building materials products continued to dampen results. 

 The Atlanta company, which last month stunned Wall Street by warning it would miss earnings targets for the third quarter and full year because of the drop in prices, said that if trends continue, fourth-quarter and full-year 2000 results could be pressured, as well. 

 To be sure, Home Depot's top competitor, Lowe's Cos Inc., said Monday it expected the environment to remain hostile, pressured by price deflation and sluggish sales across most retail sectors. 

 CIBC World Markets analyst Peter Benedict said the rest of this year and the first part of next year will be difficult for Home Depot. 

 "The macro environment is not going to immediately turn more favorable," he said. "It's still going to be a challenge over the next couple of quarters." 

 Amid a strong surge in retail stocks, shares of Home Depot rose $2-1/2, or 6.7 percent, by midday Tuesday to $39-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Standard & Poor's retail index was up 3 percent, or 23.5 points, at 790.21. 

 Home Depot saw its shares fall 29 percent after it said in early October that it would miss earnings targets for the back half of the year. The stock's 52-week low is $34-11/16.

 The Two Sides of Online Agencies: Expedia Rises as Priceline Stumbles.(Expedia Inc., Priceline.com Inc.)(Statistical Data Included)

 NEW YORK--The latest results from Expedia and Priceline appear to show one company that is turning the corner toward profitability and another that is retrenching to focus on its core business. 

 Expedia reported a fiscal first-quarter loss from continuing operations of $1.6 million, or 4 cents per share, which blew away the consensus estimates of most securities analysts who track the company's performance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to report a 26-cents-per-share loss from operations, excluding special charges. 

 The company said it is now on track to becoming profitable by the second quarter of 2002, which is earlier than originally projected. Suzi Levine, spokeswoman for Expedia, says the company's improved results show that there is a bright future for online travel. "We have a business model that's proven," she says. 

 Expedia officials say that the financial results show that the company is successfully moving away from a revenue model based on selling airline tickets, while moving toward a more diversified strategy of vacation packages, hotels and other non-airline products. Says Richard Barton, president and chief executive officer of Expedia Inc.: "The strong progress we've made this quarter is the result of our continued focus on delivering the best prices and the most powerful shopping tools to our customers." 

 Barton notes that the fiscal first quarter was the first full quarter since the company integrated its Expedia Special Rate merchant hotel inventory into the site. The site allows customers to access 1,600 hotels around the world. "Combined with improvements in site usability, this has allowed us to strengthen our non-air business and continue to diversify our revenue base," he says. Indeed, airline bookings now account for only 25 percent of Expedia's overall revenue base, which company officials say will make the company less vulnerable to airline commission policies and create added value for customers. 

 Beyond Air Sales. The Expedia Special Rates program offers discounts of up to 70 percent off standard hotel rates, according to Expedia officials. Using this service, Expedia acts as a wholesaler and negotiates special net rates with suppliers. Expedia is also working to strengthen its ties with brick-and-mortar agents through a program with eGulliver.com. The program gives Expedia customers access to 1,000 travel specialists who can help them with complex travel planning. 

 Expedia officials are expected to announce a program called Vacationspot.com, which will be integrated into the Expedia.com site. The specialized vacation site will allow Expedia customers to book specialized lodging, such as castles, cottages and other unique properties that are usually booked directly by consumers. 

 Meanwhile, shares of Priceline, the Norwalk-Conn. based name-your-price online service, tumbled after the company lost several key executives, issued another profit warning and announced that it was laying off employees. 

 Priceline reported a pro forma net loss of $2 million, or 1 cent per share in the third quarter, compared with a pro forma loss of $12 million, or 8 cents per share a year ago. Revenue more than doubled to $341 million in the quarter from $152 million a year ago. Priceline shares last week fell to a new low of 3 7/32. Meanwhile, a suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that the company defrauded investors. 

 According to several reports, the airline industry declined to honor many bids made by consumers during the past summer, when flights were running at record load factors. Priceline says it sold about 1.29 million airline tickets in the quarter, compared with 624,000 airline tickets in the year-ago quarter. Chief Executive Daniel Schulman says that the company was "disappointed" by airline ticket sales for the quarter, but says he believes the company is making progress on several fronts. Schulman also says the company is increasing the amount of hotels and rental cars being sold during airline ticket transactions, and that the percentage of repeat customers using the site represented more than half of all purchases. 

 However, Schulman says the combination of negative media reports regarding customer service issues, as well as other factors, had hurt sales in the month of October, which was the first month of the fourth financial quarter. He says sales for October would fall about 20 percent below September figures. "While demand for tickets has stabilized over the last few weeks, given seasonal factors, we expect revenues to decrease sequentially in the fourth quarter," he adds. 

 Priceline Perils. Priceline spokesman Mike Darcy says that the late summer fuel surcharge may have played a part in the disappointing air sales, and adds that several major airlines launched their own fare sales for the fall. 

 When asked if the airline industry was not honoring Priceline tickets on purpose, Darcy points out that Priceline has sold more than 5 million airline tickets since it launched, and that there are still many unsold seats that the major commercial airlines just cannot move through traditional means. "There are many different ways the airlines are looking at moving this excess inventory," he says. "They are certainly going to look at additional types of ways of selling those seats." 

 Analyst David Dietze, president of PointView Financial Services, in Summit, N.J., says that "it's not going to be an easy job" for Priceline to turn things around. He says Priceline is facing competition from its own airline partners, who are aggressively pushing discount fares over their own Web sites. "Priceline doesn't run an airline," he says. "They're a middleman." 

 The airlines have also developed their own auction site, called Hotwire.com, which allows the airlines to quote discounted fares when a consumer requests a certain city pair. The site went live late last month after about two months of testing. 

 In a bid to trim operating costs, Priceline cut 87 employees, representing 16 percent of its workforce, at the same time it reported the departure of Chief Financial Officer Heidi Miller, adding to the recent declines in the stock price. The company also lost three other executives: Maryanne Keller, the head of its auto-services unit; William Pike, vice president of financial planning; and Allison McEnerney, director of investor relations. 

 Just like many brick-and-mortar agencies, the business models of Priceline and Expedia depend heavily on diversifying beyond sales of airline tickets. Expedia appears to be moving in that direction, and Priceline will likely have to get back on track if it wants to survive--a lesson many traditional agents have been learning in recent years. 

 Summary 

 * Expedia has reported better-than-expected results and hopes to become profitable by the second quarter of 2002. 

 * Expedia's success is due in part to its move away from a reliance on airline bookings. 

 * Priceline's stock has dropped dramatically amid layoffs, departures of key executives and profit warnings.

 BILL TUCKER, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  Good morning, everyone, and welcome to IN THE MONEY, I`m Bill Tucker. 

 SASHA SALAMA, CNNfn ANCHOR, IN THE MONEY:  And I`m Sasha Salama.  The counting and recounting continues in Florida, meanwhile, the employment market for lawyers is growing.  We`ll have the full details on the story of the men who might be president. 

 TUCKER:  And accounting is done at Hewlett-Packard (URL: http//www.hp.com) , the results there pleasing no one.  Hewlett-Packard earning 10 cents less than Wall Street was looking for.  Its stock getting hammered, dragging down the Dow and its fellow tech stocks, as well, over on the Nasdaq.  Let`s take a quick look at the numbers and see how they look.  The Dow at the moment down 136 points, 10,466 is the level there.  The Nasdaq down 109 at 2,919.  The Nasdaq has been filing some supporting around its lows at 2,910 and the Dow, as bad at it looks, also finding support down right about these levels as well. 

 Let`s get the story behind these numbers and for that we`re going to go to Jennifer Westoven.  She is watching the action on the New York Stock Exchange today. 

 Hewlett-Packard the big loser in the - in the Dow today, correct? 

 I guess we`ll tell you about the computer maker reporting fourth quarter profits of 41 cents a share, 10 cents below estimates.  HP says it`s due in part to higher expenses.  The company`s profit, however, 14 percent above last year`s numbers.  HP Chairman Carly Fiorina, who speaks at COMDEX tradeshow this afternoon out of Vegas, says she accepts full responsibility for the profit shortfall.  Separately, HP also confirmed it has ended discussions on the potential acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting business. 

 SALAMA:  And meanwhile, HP getting killed.  It is down at a new 52-week low, down at about 33 1/2.  For more details on that and what else is pressuring the markets today, Jennifer Westoven live for us at the New York Stock Exchange. 

 It`s not looking pretty, Jennifer. 

 JENNIFER WESTOVEN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  No, Sasha. 

 Now of course, as you mentioned, Hewlett-Packard, it is indeed the worst performing Dow stock that we have this morning.  It`s a little bit off its low but it was the confusion surrounding the opening of Hewlett-Packard that really helped spook the market this morning.  Now after it did open and people sort of getting a sense of where it had, you know, opened and what the level was likely to be for a while, the stock market actually came up a bit after that but then we are starting to go back near our session lows for the morning.  In part, we`re actually seeing a pullback in the financial stocks now.  They started lower, they bounced back as well and now a lot of them seem to be leading the way lower. 

 One stock I`m just going to mention in addition to the other stocks we`re going to touch on today is J.P. Morgan (URL: http://www.jpmorgan.com/) and it`s just because it is now down about 3 9/16 and it`s just near its low for the session.  It was downgraded by Wattington Parrello (ph) and that`s also help pressuring the Dow. 

 Now another stock we want to talk about this morning is Toys "R" Us (URL: http://www.toysrus.com/) . That company came out with a quarterly loss this morning that was one penny better than expectations.  The company had - excuse me, it looks they have earnings there of 32 cents a share. 

 A bit of confusion here, but let`s move on to Willamette (URL: http://www.wii.com) . This is a paper and forest products company.  They are being bought out by rival Weyerhaeuser (URL: http://www.weyerhaeuser.com/) , that company there.  The deal is worth about $5.3 billion and Weyerhaeuser saying they would pay $48 a share. This is an unsolicited bid and at this point Willamette -  Weyerhaeuser has said that Willamette`s board got news of this deal on Thursday and did not take any action so it`ll be interesting to see what happens. 

 Of course, we have a spate, I think we have roughly five deals on Wall Street today so it is interesting to see some stocks doing a little bit better despite the overall downdraft. 

 Back to you in the studio. 

 SALAMA:  Thanks so much, Jennifer Westoven. 

 TUCKER:  Well, the Nasdaq Composite continues to trade below 3,000 for the first time in a year.  Charles Molineaux is at the Nasdaq market site with the latest and, Charles, if there is a bright spot in this market it`s that the Philly Semiconductor Index is actually trading a little bit higher after a bad start. 

 CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, Bill, we`re actually - we saw the Philly Semiconductor Index slide in early trading but at the moment it is positive and that is a big change from number one, what we saw everywhere else; number two, what we see just about everywhere else now as well.  We`ve got the biotechs down by six percent, computers are down by four, telecoms and industrials are down by three percent all because, of course, of what, a stock that doesn`t even trade here and that is Hewlett-Packard casting a pall over just about all the technology names and dragging us down pretty heavily and as I said, computers down four percent. 

 Now let`s look at some good news.  All right, for example, USFreightways (URL: http://www.usfreightways.com) , which is enjoying an analyst upgrade, actually it`s sort of 180 degree analyst upgrade, now up by 2.37 or 9 1/2 percent.  Credit Suisse First Boston analysts have upgraded this stock from a buy to a strong buy.  They had actually downgraded it in September because of concerns about weaker than expected profits and now are giving it a nice boost upward. 

 Adaptive Broadband (URL: http://www.adaptivebroadband.com/) , meanwhile, is down by 13 cents. This is not what you expect to see concerning that this company is being bought.  Adaptive is a data networking company who is being acquired by high-speed communications equipment maker Western Multiplex (URL: http://www.wirelessinterconnect.com/) for $645 million based on Friday`s closing prices.  Video (ph) values Adaptive stock at about 17.15 a share but down it goes and so does Western Multiplex, now down by 22.  Nothing unusual there, of course, because it is the acquirer. 

 We`re down by 117 points now.  We hit a new session low within the past few minutes, Bill and Sasha, down 124 points at 2,904.  That will be the lowest point for the Nasdaq this year. 

 TUCKER:  Ouch, I guess thank you is all I can say, Charles.  Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq. 

 SALAMA:  In election news, Florida Secretary of State says she won`t extend tomorrow`s 5 p.m. deadline for certifying those election results. Katherine Harris says no votes reported after the deadline will be counted and that would exclude any hand counts that aren`t finished by then.  A short while ago a member of Florida`s State Canvassing Committee explained why that decision may have been made. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 BOB CRAWFORD, FLORIDA CERTIFICATION OFFICIAL:  I would suppose that the legislature contemplated a manual recount but that it would have to be done expeditiously so that you don`t extend the election beyond what the legislature felt was a reasonable period of time.  So unfortunately for those who want more time, I think - I think the law is clear you have to conduct - you have to get everything straightened out in that seven day period and that`s just the way the law reads. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 SALAMA:  In the meantime, a federal judge is hearing arguments from the Bush camp to stop hand counts from taking place in four counties in Florida.  In Volusia County a hand count is going on right now. Preliminary figures there show Bush netting 21 votes over Al Gore. 

 TUCKER:  Well, the post-election sell off trimmed 231 points from the Dow on Friday falling to 10,602.95.  The Nasdaq ended the week down 171.36 at 3,028.99. 

 SALAMA:  The last time the Nasdaq finished lower was a year ago, November 3, `99, and in fact, it is at its lowest point since then.  For last week the Nasdaq gave back 12 percent. 

 TUCKER:  Bad week in the markets no matter how you look at it. Joining us now to discuss these markets is John Hughes of Shields & Company. 

 John, welcome. 

 JOHN HUGHES, SHIELDS & COMPANY:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  A lot, much ado has been made of this ongoing election and the fact that there isn`t a resolution.  Is that what`s weighing on this market or are there other things at play here? 

 HUGHES:  I think in part it`s what`s weighing on the market or at least giving the market the excuse for why this selling is going on.  I think, again, if you look at what had been going on prior to the election you look at the Nasdaq stocks, technology stocks and the markets in general, markets had some difficulties both with fundamental and a technical standpoint. And I think what we`ve basically done is we`ve taken this election and it`s provided us an excuse to continue on with this selling.  The uncertain background makes investors nervous but if things were good and we were in a good market, it`s the idea of if all news is goods in a bull market and all news is bad news in a bear market.  I think that`s really more or less what`s at work here.  There were other factors that are still going on in the market that are taking them - these stocks lower in the market, in general lower, besides just the election outcome. 

 SALAMA:  How bad is the bad news?  I mean Hewlett misses by 10 cents, we had Dell forecasting 20 percent growth instead of the 30 to 50 the Street is looking for, lots of other techs out there warning, how bad is it really fundamentally? 

 HUGHES:  Well, I think the news is bad.  I think that, you know, we were looking for some optimism here in a world of pessimism right now but the fact that these things are as bad as they are, as negative as sentiment is right now, as bad as people feel in general just about the markets, the country as a whole, I think it`s almost a positive because it does suggest as we go through these stocks one by one and they begin to report and they miss their numbers and they guide us lower for next year, we`re basically going through the cycle of washing out all of these stocks whether it be one by one or a group at a time.  And now we`ve gotten to these other kind of safe havens or the stalwarts or the generals, we`ve gotten to Hewlett-Packard, we`ve gotten to Sun Microsystems (URL: http://www.sun.com/) , to Oracle (URL: http://www.oracle.com/) , to Applied Micro Circuits (URL: http://www.amcc.com) , all of these bastions of strength where a lot of institutional money had been, we`ll use the word hiding for now, but where people could go because the stories were intact.  Slowly but surely each one of these stories is no longer in tact and we`re seeing some major selling go on there because there was a lot of money put into those stocks over the past few months. 

 TUCKER:  Not everything is bad, though, and that`s what`s interesting is there are some sectors that are fairing fairly well.  The HMOs and the pharmaceuticals, I know you have noted, and there are a couple of others as well. 

 HUGHES:  Right. 

 TUCKER:  Is this, what do they call it, a sector rotation?  Those minds not quite working on a Monday morning, is that what this is? 

 HUGHES:  I think it could be part of a sector rotation.  The healthcare stocks and the HMOs have been doing well really all year and they`ve done so very quietly.  We really haven`t focused on them.  A lot of people`s attention has been on technology then it was on energy. HMOs are up, I believe, about 50 percent as a group on the year. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah. 

 HUGHES:  Managed hospital stocks are up close to 100 percent on the year although there`s not a lot in that group so these are stocks that have been doing well and they`ve been a place to hide.  And you would think with what Al Gore has been saying about healthcare and HMOs that these stocks really shouldn`t be doing that well if they were concerned with that or they anticipated a victory - a Gore victory. 

 TUCKER:  Right. 

 HUGHES:  So I think it`s one of two things there, I think it`s both we - maybe those stocks are telling you that George Bush will be president or that what Al Gore is saying really isn`t going to hold much water at least with those stocks.  Those are the stocks that have been - have been doing well, they continue to do well, though, really throughout the entire year. 

 SALAMA:  Quickly, where is long-term growth going to be for individual investors? 

 HUGHES:  Well, I think, again, technology is still an area that`s going to be long-term growth.  I think when you start to ring out these stocks on the downside in a short-term sense you`re really talking about a short intermediate term phenomena that`s occurring now.  If you look for growth, it really still has to be within technology.  There`ll be other sectors that you rotate to.  Healthcare will have its turn, insurance stocks are still doing very well, some financial stocks have held up very well also, but I think if you`re looking longer term, technology is still the place you have to be. 

 TUCKER:  All right, John, thanks.  John Hughes of Shields & Company. 

 HUGHES:  Thank you guys. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Well, a "Wake-Up Call" goes out this morning to voters waiting to find out the results of the Presidential election.  Well, while you`re waiting, why not profit from the politics.  Many are already trying. 

 SALAMA:  It`s a good idea.  Everything from sample Florida ballets to T-shirts are on sale through auction Web sites and also a Maine-based company called Electoral College Sportswear is selling, you guessed it, clothing with the name of the famous group on it. 

 TUCKER:  The founders - that`s too good.  I like this.  The founders of the Electoral College Sportswear - not the country, trademark the name Electoral College, business is so good they have now had to go out and hire two full-time employees.  Is that amazing or what?  That`s great. 

 SALAMA:  That is pretty funny.  That`s the American - American way and -at work there. 

 TUCKER:  And it might be worth noting actually for everybody who`s now obsessed and absorbed in this whole thing the terms Electoral College don`t ever actually appear in the Constitution. 

 SALAMA:  Is that right? 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, Electoral. 

 SALAMA:  Interesting. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, exactly.  There you have it.  Well, for other more interesting and other arcane things, we`re going to have turn it over to Greg Clarkin who has been chasing after some of the movements in this market today. 

 SALAMA:  That`s right.  And I just want to mention, we`ve slipped the low Nasdaq 2900 just as you sat down there. 

 GREG CLARKIN, CNNfn CORRESPODENT:  Thank you, Sasha.  No correlation between the two events. 

 TUCKER:  A leading market indicator. 

 SALAMA:  I`m not drawing any correlation. 

 CLARKIN:  Let`s see what happens if I stand up. 

 SALAMA:  OK. 

 CLARKIN:  All right.  OK.  Looking at Hewlett-Packard this morning, guys, this company coming out and not even coming close to its earnings estimates for his quarter posting 41 cents a share in profit, 51 cents a share it was expecting.  Now the reasons for the shortfall, while they are numerous according to the company, one is adverse currency effects - adverse currency impact basically.  Also margin pressures, the business mix of the operations and then higher than expected expenses as well. 

 Now also this morning there`s kind of a side note, Hewlett-Packard coming out and saying that they have ended discussions with - with, yeah, PricewaterhouseCoopers about buying that company`s consulting business. That was a deal that they had announced or a deal that they were working, they announced this a while back, and were unable to reach terms with PricewaterhouseCoopers.  So that deal is off at the moment. 

 Now analysts have weighed in this morning over at Sanford Bernstein. They say they are keeping their market perform rating on Hewlett-Packard but they do see that the company`s growth target, the guidance basically of 15 to 17 percent revenue growth may not be realistic but Hewlett-Packard this morning not backing off that.  They say their business is healthy, demand is strong and they stand by their guidance - their guidance to Wall Street analysts. 

 Let`s take a look if we can at the stock of Hewlett-Packard this morning. It is off, significantly down 5 5/8, trading now at 33 1/2.  We have Compaq Computer (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) down a dollar and a quarter. 

 IBM (URL: http://www.ibm.com/) , really interesting story here.  This opened up lower, actually traded a little bit higher and now it is pretty much at break-even.  It`s down a fraction at 92 15/16.  And then Apple (URL: http://www.apple.com/) is down 11/16.  And Gateway (URL: http://www.gateway.com/) also down a dollar 94 cents trading at 37.80. 

 So Hewlett-Packard, again, this morning really just kind of sending a shiver through that whole - through to Dallas specially, with this profit miss, and, again, not even close. 

 SALAMA:  Right and they came out early.  They were expected to report even later this week so it was an early present ... 

 CLARKIN:  Get the bad news out there. 

 SALAMA:  Exactly.  Thank you, Greg Clarkin. 

 CLARKIN:  Sure. 

 TUCKER:  All right.  Still to come, we`ve computed the results of your votes on our IN THE MONEY portfolio.  And computed is the key word here. 

 We`ll explain its significance in just a moment. 

 SALAMA:  Plus the lawsuits, the ballot counting, the waiting, we`ll have the status of the presidential election. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Well, investors haven`t been kind to telecom stocks lately. After the bell today they will get a look at the results for one of the giants of that industry, Global Crossing (URL: http://www.globalcrossing.com/) . A company expected to show a loss of 79 cents a share according to Thompson First Call . 

 Just last week Global Crossing left the Nasdaq stock market to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under its new symbol GX.  And we made GX our "Stock of the Day." 

 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER (voice-over):  In 1997, Bermuda based Global Crossing began laying fiber optic cable under the world`s great oceans to connect continents seamlessly.  Completion of the project expected in the first half of next year.  Global Crossing`s network will then ultimately span over 100,000 route miles connecting 200 major cities in 27 countries on five continents. 

 The company offers local and international phone service.  And is one of the top long distance carriers in the U.S. through its acquisition of frontier.  But, investors have questioned some of the deals made by Global Crossing.  And the company is now on its fourth CEO since 1998. But, that hasn`t hindered its transition to a provider of advanced voice and data services from a supplier of raw bandwidth capacity. 

 Analysts believe globalization of the Internet and increasing demand for the application space webbed services puts Global Crossing in the hot seat. And with Global Crossing shares having lost nearly two-thirds of their value so far this year some analyst say there`s no better time to dive in. 

 (END VIDEOTAPE) 

 TUCKER:  And Global Crossing losing a little more today.  OOPS, I`m sorry, no it`s not.  I`ve got it down, but up on the screen we`ve got it unchanged at 21 and 7/16.  And that`s not the correct ticker.  The correct ticker for those of you at home keeping track is GX. 

 And for more on Global Crossing let`s give thoughts of an analyst who follows the stock, Floyd Greenwood is the telecom analyst at Prudential Securities.  He joins us from his firm`s trading floor here in New York. 

 Floyd, good morning. 

 FLOYD GREENWOOD, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES:  Good morning, thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Let`s begin with the profitability of Global Crossing.  They lost money.  When are you and the rest of the analytical community expecting Global Crossing to report profits, if ever? 

 GREENWOOD:  Well, we are looking for the company to break even on a cash flow basis in 2002.  And since the company is generally valued on a series of discounted cash flows we think this is a critical measure and we think the company is moving steadily in this direction right now. 

 TUCKER:  So, you use a sort of-the same sort of cash flow metrics in the telecom against Global Crossing as you might expect to see in the cable industry then, right Floyd? 

 GREENWOOD:  Well, I don`t cover the cable industry.  But, we do value telecommunications companies as a series of discounted cash flows.  It`s really the best measure we`ve found to value these entities. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah, it`s an easy thing to make fun of and to have fun with. The fact that Global Crossing has now run through three chief executives and working on their fourth even as we speak. 

 Should we as investors be concerned about what appears to be management turmoil? 

 GREENWOOD:  No, I don`t think so.  We`ve given this issue a lot of thought ourselves. And I think if you look at the company`s track record, you look at the series of transactions they`ve done, you look at the fact that they are steadily executing on what we think is a very sensible business plan. We think the changes at the top of the company while certainly they raise questions we see no fundamental issue as it impacts the company`s strategy. Or as it impacts the company`s ability to be successful in the marketplace. 

 TUCKER:  When looking at this sector is Global Crossing the most attractive to you or one of its competitors more attractive? 

 GREENWOOD:  Well, clearly in our view Global Crossing is an extremely attractive play on the global demand for telecommunications bandwidth. We think the company is pursuing a very sensible and actually very straightforward strategy which is to build a global network, deploy a global network, and then to layer advanced service on top of that to leverage that network. 

 So, we think this is a very attractive name right now.  Particularly at today`s valuation levels. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Floyd.  Thank you. 

 GREENWOOD:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Speaking with the analyst at Prudential Securities, Floyd Greenwood. 

 SALAMA:  Now that you`ve heard all about Global Crossing go to the bottom of our homepage, CNNfn.com.  Tell us whether you think we should add it to our portfolio. 

 Joining us now to release the results of your vote is managing editor of CNNfn.com, Allen Wastler - Allen. 

 ALLEN WASTLER, CNNFN.COM:  How are doing guys?  Nope, we don`t need a recount. 

 TUCKER:  No, I don`t think so. 

 SALAMA:  No recount. 

 TUCKER:  Well, how did it come out. 

 WASTLER:  Actually the techs got a little hammered on this.  And some of the hot areas in the techs, the ones that they were saying, even though the tech sector is down you can look at these... 

 TUCKER:  Yeah. 

 WASTLER:  Nah, they got dumped on too.  I think we are going to show you 11 through 15 first. 

 If we go to the screen you`ll see it.  There we go.  Costco (URL: http://www.costco.com/) , Yahoo! (URL: http://www.yahoo.com/) , General Motors (URL: http://www.gm.com/) , VerticalNet (URL: http://www.verticalnet.com/) , Motorola (URL: http://www.mot.com/) . OK.  Now, VerticalNet, remember is a B2B.  Here`s the next one, Lucent (URL: http://www.lucent.com/) , Compaq Computer (URL: http://www.compaq.com/) , Lowe`s (URL: http://www.lowes.com) , Citrix Systems (URL: http://www.citrix.com/) , and Dell (URL: http://www.dell.com/) . Citrix, that`s ASP, Application Service Provider, that`s another one of those hot sectors where people are saying, Oh this is like going to be "The Thing." 

 TUCKER:  Oh, yeah.  But, it was so hot.  I remember when the stock went up for review. It was a very hot stock.  It had been very successful.  And then some irregularities were discovered in Citrix Systems. 

 WASTLER:   And it sort of - it sours a lot of people and you know, that kind of thing. 

 TUCKER:  Imagine that. 

 WASTLER:  You know, you see numbers wrong. 

 TUCKER:  Accounting problems. 

 WASTLER:   And then I think we`ve got the final screen here for you. And this where you really see the bitter taste in investors` mouth. Apple Computer was the number one stock people wanted dumped. 

 TUCKER:  Really? 

 SALAMA:   Wow. 

 WASTLER:   Really.  And, you know, besides all the jokes about the shine being off the Apple.  Remember it had a fairly steady rise there and there`s a lot of the Apple devoted and faithful.  I think people feel a little bit betrayed by that latest, you know, warning and the latest profit outlook. 

 And so, you know, emotion tend to come out in these polls. 

 TUCKER:  Well, it`s interesting too because you know the analyst that we spoke with on Friday said, look this is not a portfolio for the faint of hearts.  It`s pretty aggressive portfolio and you should lighten up on some of these tech stocks. 

 WASTLER:   And they sure did.  CMGI (URL: http://www.cmgi.com/) , the Internet incubator, it`s out.  AT&T (URL: http://www.att.com/) , of course, now you know you can argue is it old time tech or new time tech. 

 Either way tech people wanted out. 

 Dell, of course, and Lucent both have had their bad news hard luck stories. So, your top five there is pretty much the down and out techs that have recently gotten hammered in the headlines. 

 SALAMA:   Lots of tax-loss selling there. 

 WASTLER:  Take them out. 

 SALAMA:  Thank you very much. 

 TUCKER:  Yes, and you know - and that`s a good point, Sasha.  Actually for those of you at home if this had been a real portfolio what we would do at this point is tally up the net losses and then you can take a net loss of up to I think it`s $3,000 against the gains that you`ve had. If you`ve got more than that you can then lay those out over a couple of years.  Talk to your accountant about that, but it does help reduce taxable income.  So, there`s a benefit to realizing losses and taking them. 

 SALAMA:   Right. 

 Sorry? 

 WASTLER:   We have your net loss for the portfolio. 

 TUCKER:  Oh, do we? 

 SALAMA:   Oh, yeah, what is it? 

 WASTLER:   If you are doing that tax bill, $7,612.72. 

 SALAMA:   All right.  So that`s what... 

 WASTLER:   Save that for the accountant. 

 SALAMA:   OK. 

 WASTLER:  That`s what you would write off. 

 SALAMA:  That`s pretty good. 

 TUCKER:  And send them off, you`d give it to the accountants.   So, remember that when you`re getting your taxes ready. 

 SALAMA:   A glimmer of hope, exactly.  Thank you Allen Wastler. 

 TUCKER:  Thanks a lot. 

 Up next, we are going to talk oil.  OPEC hints at cutting production. 

 SALAMA:   Kitty Pilgrim has that story when IN THE MONEY comes back. Plus we`ll take you to Las Vegas to preview COMDEX 2000. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  At it, live from New York City.  The traffic is stacking up on 8th Avenue.  The day a little hazy and uncertain, which about matches the mood in the markets. 

 SALAMA:  Sure.  Ugly, perhaps.  It`s getting ugly if you`re long this market.  Welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  Coming up, Hewlett-Packard`s CEO prepares to face the COMDEX 2000 crowd after her company misses earnings estimates, dragging down techs.  We`ll have a live report. 

 TUCKER:  Plus, we`ll also have a live report on the Florida recount. But first, here`s a look at what the markets are doing at this hour. 

 SALAMA:  The Dow is off about 1 1/2 percent, 15 points off its low for the morning, but market breadth negative by a two to one margin.  You think that`s negative, talk about four to one market breadth negative on the Nasdaq.  That index fell as low as 2,895, so just five points off that low. Some of the drags on the Dow, of course Hewlett-Packard down 6. Interestingly, IBM is up 1 1/2 point.  J.P. Morgan down more than 4. 

 And let`s check the credit markets real fast.  The 30-year is seeing a bit of a flight to quality here, up 1/2 point, the yield 5.83.  The 10-year up about 1/4 point, 5.76. 

 TUCKER:  And now that we`ve seen where at least some of that money is going besides equities, let`s head right on down to our market reporters, Jennifer Westhoven at the New York Stock Exchange, Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq MarketSite.  They`re following the action.  And, Jennifer, what are they talking about on the floor? 

 WESTHOVEN:  Well, one of the things they`re saying here is that even though we`re low for the day and looks bad, it`s still not as bad as the Nasdaq and it`s also the kind of thing you see in the stock to trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  So, for example, although there are techs who like the trade area, it`s not the same way technology weighted as the Nasdaq, so that`s why you see the bigger losses there.  Also, we`re seeing a lot of losses in biotech stocks today, and that`s across the board, but they do have more over there on the Nasdaq, who do need to take charge there. See, people, we`ve got a little bit of false courage this morning when we came up off that Hewlett-Packard low, came up a bit, but then we`ve just been trenching down till then.  Another sector that`s really taken on the chin this morning is biotech.  There was very negative article in "Barron`s" over the weekend, saying are they the next dot-coms.  And I`ll just touch on a few. PE Biosystems (URL: http://www.pecorporation.com/) trades here.  It`s off nearly 14.  DNA (URL: http://www.gene.com/) and CRA (URL: http://www.celera.com/) are also lower. Financials, as you mentioned, also on the downside. 

 Let`s check in with Charles Molineaux over at the Nasdaq MarketSite. 

 MOLINEAUX:  Yeah, Jennifer, we`re looking at a continued negative day, four to one ratio in favor of declining issues.  And actually, we`ve hit us a new session low.  We`re down to 2,895, off by 133 points, so we`re looking at a very negative performance. 

 Take a look at what this market has done over the course of the day because even at the best we were down by 66 points at 2,9623 and that was about 10:15 this morning.  It just got worse from that point, continued to lose ground, keeping in mind that every new intraday low we hit is a intraday low for this year for 21st century.  We actually got all the down to 2,894, a loss of 134 points before we picked up ever so slightly just a couple of minutes ago, but it has been ever since October of 1999 that we even saw the Nasdaq trading below the 2,900 level.  So, we continue to see very negative performance here.  And, yeah, you mentioned the biotechs.  They are off by 7 1/2 percent.  Computers are down by 5 percent. Telecoms down by 4 percent. Industrials down by 3 1/2.  The chip stocks are the one shining light of this market.  They are still up, but only fractionally right now.  Well, we see the Goldman Sachs Internet Index is now down by 4 percent and a lot of our big caps are continuing to lose ground as well. 

 So, the selling does continue for these technology names.  Again, we`re looking at declining - issuers outnumbering advancers by four to one on 771 million shares traded - Bill, Sasha. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Charles, thank you.  Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq MarketSite.  Well, let`s find out if Hewlett-Packard is also going to be the talk of the day out at the COMDEX trade show.  I would assume that`s a fairly ... 

 SALAMA:  Probably. 

 TUCKER:  ... good bet since Ms. Fiorina is going to be talking today. And that`s the company`s CEO will give a speech in just few minutes. Microsoft founder Bill Gates opened the show last night with an outline of his vision of the future. 

 SALAMA:  And joining us now from COMDEX Fall 2000 in Las Vegas is our very own Bruce Francis.  And, Bruce, we would imagine the buzz has to do with Hewlett-Packard today. 

 BRUCE FRANCIS, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely, Bill and Sasha.  That is exactly the case.  Of course, a big company like HP is supposed to have very, very detailed and tight reporting procedures.  It`s very notable that they made such a big - such a wide miss in their numbers. They cited a number of factors, as you`ve been reporting all morning, including product mix, currency, other things.  I`m going to be talking to CEO Carly Fiorina in just a couple of hours.  We`ll get detailed information on just why they missed so badly, what happened and what`s being done to correct this situation.  That`s absolutely the buzz of the show.  It`s been a very tough period for a lot of computer manufacturers.  Dell had a tough quarter. Of course, that rattled the market.  And this is very much a cloud over the show as we open up here this morning.  Of course, the show not quite open. 

 But let`s take at some of the themes that we`re going to hear about when the show does - actually we should say the show did open last night.  We did hear from Bill Gates.  He was talking about some of the valuations and how a lot of this market has corrected so badly.  A lot of people have lost a lot of money, Gates, of course.  He`s been one of the biggest loser. Microsoft stock is off sharply this year, opening the year about $119 a share and is way off from that level. 

 Gates, although, talking about Internet valuations last night, said that the new change here, the much lower level that we`re seeing, that might be a good thing. 

 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 

 BILL GATES, CHAIRMAN, MICROSOFT:  For me personally, it was a great year because I got to take on the new role.  Being chief software architecture allowed me to spend the vast majority of my time thinking about where software needs to go, what is the next evolution that takes place.  And a lot of the big success, the advances in this industry, are being we`ve seen something like that, whether it`s graphical interface, the PC itself, and really betting on not only Microsoft`s resources but getting other partners involved in those things.  So, my goal is to make sure that we`re headed in the right direction. 

 (END VIDEO CLIP) 

 FRANCIS:  Actually, that wasn`t the bit of Mr. Gates speech that we hoped to get to you.  But what he did say about valuations is that they have come down so much, but it was probably a very healthy process for the market to sort out what will work and what won`t work. 

 Still, let`s take a look at some of the themes here at COMDEX 2000 this year.  We`re going to see a mix of old and new certainly.  One thing that we`re seeing right now a lot of handheld hybrids.  Palm (URL: http://www.palm.com/) and Handspring (URL: http://www.handspring.com/) have started this off with handheld computers that can do a lot of other things. A lot of other companies are coming out with handheld computers that combine MP3 players, digital cameras and handheld computing.  Very interesting.  We`re going to see a lot of that this year.  Internet appliances, just on Friday, Gateway and America Online (URL: http://www.aol.com/) finally unveiled their Internet appliance.  Microsoft has a competing model.  There`s an entire pavilion here dedicated to the Internet appliance.  That will definitely yield some innovation as well.  And in old idea new again, tablet computing. We used to call it hand computing.  That`s something we`re seeing, computers about the size of a sheet of paper, a little bit thicker.  They`re wirelessly connected to it an Internet.  Microsoft showed off a demo version of one last year.  We`re going to show you some pictures of it right now.  A very exciting concept.  It`s a concept PC.  Here it is being shown off in a demonstration.  You can operate it with a pen, show a - connect it wirelessly to a network.  It`s got great resolution.  This is a prototype but let`s see who actually takes a ball and run with it.  No availability on this one.  This is just sort of a concept. 

 And as we get closer to the opening of the show, let`s take one last look at the preparations.  The show will open up here in just a little bit. Companies are making their final spiffing up and plugging things in and getting things all ready to go for what should be a very interesting and challenging COMDEX 2000. 

 Bill and Sasha, back to you. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Bruce, thank you.  Bruce Francis drawing a Vegas duty. Not bad.  Not bad at all. 

 Just ahead on IN THE MONEY, more of today`s top business headlines. 

 SALAMA:  Susan Lisovicz will be with us for the day`s world and national headlines, including the latest on the recount in Florida.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq right near its low, down 4 2/3 percent. 

 TUCKER:  New low right now. 

 SALAMA:  Come right back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  Well, while we were in a commercial break, we hit a new low on the Dow at 10,292. And as we were going to break, as Sasha noted, we were smacking in to new lows on the Nasdaq as well.  Breadth in this market - you were talking about earlier - is just terrible. 

 SALAMA:  Really negative.  More than four to one negative now on the Nasdaq and nearly three to one negative on the big board.  Of course, the catalyst for a market that some would say was already shaky, at least in tech, was Hewlett-Packard missing its number by 10 cents ... 

 TUCKER:  By a mile. 

 SALAMA:  ... bringing in 41 cents. 

 TUCKER:  That`s a big miss.  In a market where you see when a company misses by a penny the selling hit it. To miss by a dime is pretty disturbing to the market. 

 SALAMA:  That`s right.  And Carly Fiorina, the CEO of Hewlett-Packard saying the buck stops here, taking responsibility here, but that is just getting the stock killed.  HWP down 6 right now to $33 and change. That`s a new 52-week low. 

 TUCKER:  Yeah.  Now, they`ve had their conference call already, but Carly Fiorina will be speaking out of COMDEX in Vegas.  Bruce Francis will be around for that, so if anything new comes up we`ll check back with him for news on Hewlett-Packard.  But in the meantime, it is time for a check on world and national headlines. 

 SALAMA:  Including the Florida recount as it goes before a federal judge. For that and more on this unfolding drama that is our country, Susan Lisovicz. 

 SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  And you`re not hyping it up when you call it a unfolding drama.  Good morning, Sasha and Bill.  Good morning, everyone. 

 Well, the hands vote counting isn`t over in Florida, but the Bush camp is in court trying to put an end to it.  And now it appears that a 5:00 p.m. Tuesday deadline for getting votes in will hold.  For more on this rapidly changing story, here`s CNN`s Sean Callebs. 

 Hi, Sean. 

 SEAN CALLEBS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Susan, indeed it`s very difficult to say exactly what`s going to happen here in the next 24 hours.  People here at Palm Beach County courthouse, after really navigating through unchartered waters for the past 72 hours admit at this point they are perplexed. They have to recount - they want to recount 425,000 votes by hand.  They say, at this point, there is no way they are going to finish by 5:-00 Eastern Time on Tuesday.  That is a state mandated deadline.  A couple of hours ago we heard the secretary of state from Florida.  She came out and said that she cannot and will not extend the deadline and that could affect four counties down here.  Palm Beach County, Volusia County, Miami-Dade and Broward are considering - all pursuing recounting ballots by hand.  The Democrats are supporting that.  Al Gore`s camp says that if indeed they are able to go through and count every paper ballot by hand, they will be able to see if indeed some people punched ballots incorrectly or some people tried to punch their ballots but simply the paper wasn`t torn all the way and, therefore, the computer couldn`t` read it.  So, now Palm Beach is going to state court.  They are trying to get an extension of some kind. They say it will take them six days working 14 hours a day to count all 425,000 votes here. 

 LISOVICZ:  Sean, question, though.  If in fact that deadline holds, wouldn`t it make it invalid if the votes weren`t complete?  It would be just a useless exercise, wouldn`t it? 

 CALLEBS:  Well, we`ve had two recounts.  We`ve had one recount and one count here already.  The Bush camp maintaining that that should be the final figures, showing George W.  Bush becoming the next president by winning Florida by just fewer than 300 votes.  So, they are supporting this effort.  They want it to move ahead.  But, of course, the Gore camp -the Democrats have been fighting this for some time.  It is now down in federal court, so everything that is going on up here could be moot by the end of the day.  We`re just waiting to hear what the federal judge does in Miami. Of course, the Bush camp is trying to have them stop the manual counts. And the judge can do one of three things, stop all hand counts, he can let them go on, or the judge can allow hand counting to go on with a reservation that he is allowed to stop it in the coming days ahead. 

 LISOVICZ:  OK, we`ll just have to wait till that decision comes down. Sean Callebs in Florida, thanks so much. 

 So, what do the American people think about the issue of hand counting ballots?  According to some recent CNN/"USA Today" Gallup polls, 42 percent of respondents say they`re opposed to a hand recount in some Florida counties.  However, 55 percent of those polled say they support the idea. And when the election is finally decided, whenever that is, an overwhelming majority of respondents say they`d accept either candidate as the legitimate president.  Eighty two percent of those polled said they would accept Vice President Gore, 79 percent said they would accept Texas Governor George W. Bush. And I guess dead even, as would be appropriate. 

 Rescue teams in the Austrian Alps are trying to recover bodies from a cable car disaster over the weekend.  So far, 46 bodies have been recovered. At least 159 people died, including eight Americans, when a train carrying skiers through a mountain tunnel suddenly caught fire. The cause of the blaze not yet known. 

 And that`s a quick check on world and national headlines.  Back to you, Bill and Sasha. 

 SALAMA:  Thanks very much. Susan Lisovicz. 

 TUCKER:  All right, coming up next on IN THE MONEY, well, it could be a case of what you might say Mr. Smith goes to Arkansas. 

 SALAMA:  He`s talking about the CEO of FedEx (URL: http://www.fedexcorp.com/) making a new acquisition. We`ll have the details right after this. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 SALAMA:  FedEx, the world`s largest express delivery firm, announcing it`s buying American Freightways.  FedEx agreeing to pay $950 million in cash and stock, plus about $250 million in debt for that trucking company based in Arkansas.  That breaks down to $28.13 a share and that`s roughly a 60 percent premium over Friday`s closing price of $17 and change.  The deal expanding FedEx`s and next day regional freight service. 

 TUCKER:  Joining us now to talk about this deal is FedEx`s CEO, Fred Smith. He joins us now from company headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. 

 Mr. Smith, good morning. 

 FREDERICK SMITH, CHAIRMAN, CEO, FEDEX:  Good morning.  How are you? 

 TUCKER:  I`m good, thank you.  Explain why you did this.  You already have a bunch of FedEx.  Why do you need a trucking company to go along with them? 

 SMITH:  Well, increasingly what our customers want us to do is to handle a lot of different service needs for them across the supply chain spectrum. We have our express company, as you noted in the lead in, which is a huge worldwide integrated, air-ground system that carries packages, documents and freight on a time certain basis.  We have FedEx ground, which is the second largest ground parcel delivery company in the country and we`ve had, for over 2 1/2 years, an outstanding regional less than truckload freight carrier in the west, Viking Freight.  And American Freightways` service area and Viking Freight`s service area are perfectly complementary and it gives us a whole new dimension in serving our customers` broad supply chain needs. 

 SALAMA:  So, geographically it`s a plus for you.  Give us an idea of how you think it`ll help your bottom line. 

 SMITH:  Well, we`ve announced this morning that the acquisition will be accretive from the get go.  We`ll start, assuming the transaction goes forward, reporting the results of American Freightways as part of FedEx beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter.  I think we actually consolidate on a minority basis, assuming the transaction goes forward as planned beginning January 1st.  But the transaction should be accretive in our next fiscal year, which ends next June, some place between three and five percent. 

 TUCKER:  You`ll add three and five percent to your bottom line? 

 SMITH:  Right. 

 TUCKER:  All right. 

 SMITH:  That`s without any synergies.  That`s what we just see just on the basic raw numbers. 

 TUCKER:  Just a straight carry down, no accounting for any expense savings or anything else.  All right, Mr. Smith ... 

 SMITH:  Exactly. 

 TUCKER:  ... thank you.  Fred Smith, the Chairman and CEO of ... 

 SMITH:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  ... FedEx Corporation. 

 SALAMA:  The national media, meanwhile, weighing with its reaction to the electoral events of the past week.  And that includes "Time" magazine coming out with its election issue today. 

 TUCKER:  Joining us now for a look at not only the Florida recount but how we got here in the first place is writer Andrew Goldstein. 

 Andrew, hi. 

 ANDREW GOLDSTEIN, "TIME":  Morning. 

 TUCKER:  Good morning.  That`s a bit of a big mission of how we got here in the first place, but you used to teach, so maybe you could explain it in a little more understandable terms.  How did we get here? 

 GOLDSTEIN:  Well, we got here - we got to Florida, in part, because both campaigns saw Florida as the keystone to their campaigns. In the beginning the Bush team saw Florida as a sure thing and if it did not go into their column, that that would be a symbol of Bush losing all over the country. 

 But as the election moved on, as Bush started picking up ground in other states, the Gore team began to see Florida as their key. And so, you ended up having both campaigns keying out on the same state, spending huge amounts of time, both Cheney, Bush, Gore and Lieberman, all spending their time there.  And it`s no surprise that it`s the closest state in the nation.  Well, maybe besides New Mexico right now.  And given our electoral college system, it makes sense that we are in a divided country.  The one state where they both spend all their time on is also divided. 

 SALAMA:  That said, how would you rate how each of these candidates is handling the situation?  Are they both so far into the mud at this point that - is that how you would characterize it? 

 GOLDSTEIN:  I think that`s a pretty fair description.  I think that both candidates are not doing themselves a favor when it comes to what`s going to happen when they actually have to govern.  For a while last week it looked like Bush was getting a little bit of the upper ground as Gore`s team was talking about lawsuits.   And then the Bush team turns around over the weekend and files the first big lawsuit.  So, I think that the American people are not going to be very excited about either candidate when it comes down to it, when we do actually have a winner. 

 TUCKER:  I think a lot of people are wondering, too, if, in fact, we`re in some sort of constitutional crisis.  What happens next if it - not a crisis.  It certainly is a mess.  What`s next here, Andrew? 

 GOLDSTEIN:  Well, mess is definitely word than crisis.  We are not in a crisis.  There is several months before this actually has to be resolved. And what happens next is the first big date is when the electoral college has to actually vote in December. And it looks like, unless there`s really drawn out lawsuits in Florida, we will have some sort of decision by then. So, it`s a matter of - the country has to be a little bit patient.  We have had this before in the other elections in which we`ve had electoral college closeness like this. There had been times when it`s actually gone - one time it actually went into March beyond inauguration day.  And we still had a president.  There still wasn`t a problem. And so, I don`t think media, who throws around the word crisis, are being very responsible on that. 

 SALAMA:  Andrew Goldstein of Time, Incorporated, "Time" magazine. Thanks for joining us. 

 GOLDSTEIN:  Thank you. 

 TUCKER:  Thanks. 

 Well, we got more market coverage straight ahead.  We`ve got a big sell off we talked about a little of.  And we`ll be right back. 

 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) 

 TUCKER:  OPEC has increased oil production four times this year, but not as it`s meeting over the weekend. 

 SALAMA:  The oil ministers meeting in Vienna have decided not to pump any additional oil this year.  They also suggested they may cut output when they meet again in January. 

 Let`s take a look at where light sweet crude`s trading.  It`s up 30 a barrel to $34.32. 

 TUCKER:  All right, Kitty Pilgrim joins us now with more on the story and what`s behind - didn`t they say they would and now they said they won`t. 

 KITTY PILGRIM, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT:  That`s right.  You remember correctly. They triggered this mechanism that puts 500,000 a day into the market if the prices didn`t drop below a certain point.  Guess what, at this meeting they stopped it.  They said that`s it to that.  They don`t want to overdo it.  That`s what Rilwanu Lukman, the secretary general of OPEC, said. It puts 3.7 million barrels a day into the market.  The OPEC target price range is $22 to $28 a barrel and they believe with the amount of supply that`s going into the market at this point they will achieve that.  So, they have suspended the 500,000-barrel a day trigger. Now, they won`t achieve it right away, but there is a buildup in stockpiling and they do think that by the spring there will be a backlog of oil.  The finger pointing was still in evidence in OPEC and they did say that the real problem is the shrinking capacity for the United States to refine the oil, not their output. 

 SALAMA:  Thank you so much.  Kitty Pilgrim. 

 And as we leave you, the Nasdaq down more than 5 percent now at its low for the day so far. 

 TUCKER:  Keep watching.  More MARKET COVERAGE straight ahead right here on CNNfn.

        Heavy losses in the discount and variety stores subindex was to blame
for much of the index's loss.  Shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. skidded 7.3%,

following Best Buy Co.'s Thursday profit warning.  The subindex dropped
5.27%, or 15.6 points, to close at 280.93.
        Shares of Best Buy dropped 2.7%, or 0.88, to 32.94.  The company's
shares tumbled about 39% Thursday when the company said third quarter
earnings would miss estimates by 17 cents and fourth quarter earnings would
fall 12 cents short of current estimates.
        Circuit City Group's shares dropped 6.8%, or 0.88, to 12.06 on
Thursday, while RadioShack Corp.'s shares slumped 10%, or 5.44, to 49.
        Home Supply and building materials companies also fell Friday.  Home
Depot's shares shed 6.6%, or 2.56, to 36.25, leading the subindex down 6.26%,
or 70.6 points, to finish at 1056.88.  Also, shares of Lowe's Cos. fell 5.5%,
or 2.31, to 39.94.
        Wal-Mart's and Home Depot's losses weighed in on the Dow Jones
Industrial Average Friday, as it fell 231.3 points, to 10602.95.  The Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 171.36 to 3028.99, while Standard & Poor's 500 fell

*Jo-Ann Stores Inc.'s earnings estimates are the fiscal years 2001 and 2002.
Notes:
Guess? expects fourth quarter operating earnings of 8 cents to 10
cents a share because of continuing inventory clearance activity. The apparel
maker plans to post charges in the coming quarter of up to $10 million for
closing several under-performing stores. A First Call/Thomson Financial
survey of seven analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 36 cents a
diluted share.   Guess projects 2001 earnings of 95 cents to $1.05, on an
operating basis, and revenue growth of 8% to 12%.
Jo-Ann Stores said reaching its fourth quarter earnings estimate is dependent
on a same-store sales increase comparable to the 4.3% same-store sales
increase attained in the year-ago fourth quarter. Jo-Ann Stores said it's
"unlikely" that it would reach its fourth quarter estimate if sales remain at
current levels, which are currently below plan.
Hollywood Entertainment said same-store sales rose 1% in the third quarter.

Guitar Center said it expects its comparable-store sales to increase 5% to 7%
in fiscal 2001 and expects earnings between $1.20 a share and $1.26 a share
Guitar Center also said it sees net sales for 2001 between $945 million and
$955 million, and net earnings between $27 million and $28.3 million.  For
the company's first quarter it expects earnings of 19 to 21 cents a share,
compared with estimates of 23 cents a share; 21 cents to 23 cents a share for
its second quarter, compared with estimates of 23 cents a share; 21 cents to
23 cents a share for its third quarter, compared with 24 cents a share
expected by analysts; and between 57 cents and 61 cents a share for its
fourth quarter, a boost from analysts' expectations of 55 cents a share.
Guitar Center also said it plans to open 11 to 14 new stores in 2001.
According to the filing, the retailer expects fiscal 2001 capital
expenditures to be between $23 million and $25 million.

Once-mighty Best Buy abruptly ends reign; S&P 500 darling loses 39% of its value in one day after  profit warning

Best Buy Co. was one of the mightiest members of the Standard & Poor's 500 index in the 1990s. Now it's joined the ranks of the fallen.

Shares of the largest U.S. consumer-electronics retailer had their biggest one-day decline ever -- 39% -- in trading Thursday after the company said second-half profit would be lower than analysts' projections.

The stock rose 88 cents Friday to close at $32.94. At the close of trading for the week, Best Buy shares were down 34.45% for the year. That performance contrasts with an average annual gain of about 59% for the prior decade, when Best Buy was the fourth-best performer among the S&P 500's current members.

Three other companies among the decade's top five also have dropped in 2000: Dell Computer Corp., the world's largest direct seller of personal computers; Microsoft Corp., the largest maker of software; and Tellabs Inc., the biggest provider of equipment for managing traffic on telecommunications networks.

Only EMC Corp., the No. 1 provider of data-storage systems for corporations, has extended its gains. And even that company's shares have faltered lately, reflecting the relatively high value investors had placed on them.

The four decliners have played a major role in the S&P 500's 7% decline this year for a couple of reasons. First, the benchmark index is "capitalization-weighted," so companies with greater market value have more effect on its performance.

Second, the companies account for almost 4% of the total market value of the S&P 500 stocks, according to Bloomberg calculations. Microsoft, the third-most valuable company in the world behind General Electric Co. and Cisco Systems Inc., single-handedly represents 3%.

Best Buy was the smallest of the four even before its plunge. The Minneapolis-based company is now valued at $6.8 billion. Microsoft's market value, by contrast, is $356 billion.

The retailer's shares tumbled after it said third-quarter earnings would drop from a year earlier, rather than rising as analysts had expected, and fourth-quarter earnings growth would be less than forecast. Best Buy blamed these shortfalls on increased price-cutting amid a slowing U.S. economy.

That explanation echoed Best Buy's remarks in December 1991, when the stock set its prior record for the biggest one-day loss: 34%. Less than a week before Christmas, the company said December sales at stores open a year or more had dropped -- and discounting had hurt profit.

Nevertheless, the shares almost tripled that year. They more than tripled in 1997 and 1998 as consumers flocked to buy digital products, such as video-disc players and cameras.

Performances such as those enabled Best Buy to end the 1990s with a 9,937% gain, the fourth-largest among the S&P 500's current members.

One doesn't have to look back all that far, though, to see a time when investing in the company wasn't rewarding. In 1995, the stock declined 48% as slow holiday sales, PC discounts and increased promotional spending cut into earnings. It fell another 35% in 1996 as profit declined outright.

RENTRAK: The September shareholder coup that replaced Rentrak Corp.'s management brought millions of dollars in costs, leading to big losses in the quarter that ended Sept. 30.

The Portland-based distribution company Thursday reported a net loss of $9.56 million, or 77 cents a share, on revenue of $24.48 million in its fiscal second quarter. That compares with a net profit of $605,108, or 6 cents a share, on $27.1 million in revenue in the year-ago quarter.

Rentrak blamed the lower revenues on a decrease in video rentals, caused by a weak slate of new releases during the quarter and competition for viewers from the Olympics.

The loss was largely caused by a $12.8 million year-over-year increase in Rentrak's selling, general and administrative expenses. The company took a $6.1 million charge to end a program that extended loans to help some customers expand. It also wrote off $2.8 million in assets and accounts receivable and lost $500,000 by selling stock in Hollywood Entertainment Corp.

The charges also included a $1.3 million severance payment to Rentrak's founder and former chairman, Ron Berger, whom stockholders ousted in the proxy fight. The battle itself cost Rentrak $1 million: $600,000 for the company's legal and proxy costs and $400,000 to reimburse dissident shareholders. The leader of the dissidents, Paul Rosenbaum, is Rentrak's new chairman.

On Thursday, Rosenbaum predicted "an extremely successful third and fourth quarter." In 2001, he said, Rentrak will press ahead with plans to split its 3PF.com subsidiary, which fulfills orders for Internet companies, from the core video distribution business. Rosenbaum also said he will try to attract new investors, increase Rentrak's stock price and find new customers for Rentrak's accounting and tracking software.

HOLLYWOOD ENTERTAINMENT: Hollywood Entertainment Corp. capped a turbulent third-quarter Thursday by announcing earnings that hit lowered expectations.

The Wilsonville company, parent of Hollywood Video stores, reported a net profit of $716,000, or 2 cents a share, on sales of $306.53 million for the three months ended Sept. 30. That's an improvement from the net loss of $11.62 million, or 25 cents a share, on sales of $266.32 million in the third quarter of 1999.

But the quarter's earnings are down from the 28 cents a share analysts had expected before Hollywood's Oct. 17 warning that it would miss sales and profit targets. Analysts lowered their target to about 3 cents a share after the warning.

Company Chairman Mark Wattles said competition from the Olympics and a relatively weak lineup of new releases dragged down sales in the quarter. Although the fourth quarter promises a better film lineup, it has already brought the company troubles, including the resignation of its president and chief operating officer, Jeffrey Yapp, and two bomb threats at Hollywood's headquarters.

The company also said Thursday that it should be able to meet a $37.5 million debt payment due Dec. 5. The company said it has cut the debt from $300 million to $280.5 million. To increase its cash flow and pay down the debt, Hollywood cut its store building plans last year and closed a money-losing Internet subsidiary this year.

DELL COMPUTER: Dell Computer, the leading U.S. personal computer-maker, said its net income was $674 million, or 25 cents per share, up from $289 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. The year-ago figures include a charge of $194 million, or 7 cents a share, from the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies Inc.; excluding the charge, Dell had operating earnings of $483 million, or 18 cents per share.

Revenue in the three months ended Oct. 27 rose 22 percent to $8.26 billion from $6.78 billion a year earlier. About half came from enterprise products, such as servers, workstations and storage units, and from notebooks.

The results met the lowered projections of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Last month, Dell said it would meet earnings expectations but that revenue would be slightly below analysts' expectations of $8.5 billion.

In trading Thursday before release of the earnings report, Dell shares fell $1.94 to $28.38 on the Nasdaq stock market. During the after-hours session, Dell was trading slightly higher at $29.

WALT DISNEY: Walt Disney said it had a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as television advertising sales rose. Its shares fell 16 percent on concern that ad sales growth will slow.

Net income was $167 million, or 11 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, including losses from Disney's Internet group. That exceeded the average estimate of 7 cents from analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Disney had a loss of $126 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier.

Shares of Burbank, Calif.-based Disney fell $5.50 to $31.38 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

Disney's revenue rose 5.8 percent to $6.12 billion from $5.78 billion a year ago, assuming certain purchases and sales took place at the start of the previous fiscal year.

Excluding its interest in Disney Internet Group and prior-year restructuring charges, Disney said profit would have increased 77 percent to $417 million, or 20 cents a share. That was in line with analysts' forecast of 18 cents from First Call/Thomson Financial.

Walt Disney

Walt Disney said it had a fiscal fourth-quarter profit as television advertising sales rose. Its shares fell 16 percent on concern that ad sales growth will slow.

Net income was $167 million, or 11 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, including losses from Disney's Internet group. That exceeded the average estimate of 7 cents from analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Disney had a loss of $126 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier.

Shares of Burbank, Calif.-based Disney fell $5.50 to $31.38 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

Disney's revenue rose 5.8 percent to $6.12 billion from $5.78 billion a year ago, assuming certain purchases and sales took place at the start of the previous fiscal year.

Excluding its interest in Disney Internet Group and prior-year restructuring charges, Disney said profit would have increased 77 percent to $417 million, or 20 cents a share. That was in line with analysts' forecast of 18 cents from First Call/Thomson Financial.

 TROY, Michigan -- ArvinMeritor Inc., a vehicle-parts supplier, said it will eliminate 1,500 jobs, or about 4% of its work force, and take a $90 million (105.2 million euros) pretax restructuring charge blamed on declining demand that is hammering profits. 

 Larry Yost, ArvinMeritor's chairman and chief executive, said he remains comfortable with current analyst consensus estimates that the company would earn $3.57 a share in fiscal 2001 but said he expected a rough year because of a severe downturn in commercial truck production and weak demand for replacement parts. ArvinMeritor will report the charge for the 2001 first quarter. 

 Mr. Yost made his comments during a conference call to review fiscal fourth-quarter results. 

 ArvinMeritor, created in July by the merger of Meritor Automotive Inc. and Arvin Industries Inc., reported that pro-forma fourth-quarter net income, reflecting what the companies would have reported if combined last year, fell 65% to $29 million, or 43 cents a share, from $84 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. 

 Pro-forma revenue in the period, which ended Sept. 30, was $1.7 billion, down 11% from a year earlier. 

 The results were two cents a share ahead of the consensus projection by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Analysts had already lowered their estimates after a profit warning on Sept. 15. ArvinMeritor shares fell 50 cents to $15.06 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday after the announcement, and in early trading Thursday had declined another 31 cents to $14.75. 

 Mr. Yost said he expected the slowdown in the commercial truck and replacement-parts industries to continue into next year, and that the company could also face dwindling orders for parts from U.S. auto makers. ArvinMeritor plans to continue to cut costs to bring expenses in line with the weak markets, he said.

 BRUSSELS, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Shares in IT services group Real Software plummeted over 17 percent on Friday to a more than 2-1/2 year low as U.S. fund managers bailed out of the stock due to renewed fears about the technology sector, dealers said. 

 Real Software shares, which had been off five to six percent in morning trade, sharply accelerated losses in the afternoon as futures trade indicated a sharply lower opening in U.S. technology shares, dealers said. 

 Dell Computer Corp late on Thursday cut its sales growth forecast for next year. 

 "American fund managers just sell with their eyes closed, without looking at the price or whether there is enough liquidity," one fund manager said. 

 Dealers said the announcement on Thursday by Belgian voice recognition group Lernout & Hauspie that it would restate prior year financial results and trim forecasts for third-quarter revenues also weighed heavily on Real Software. 

 "The L&H story made investors turn away from Belgian technology stocks," one fund manager said. "All Belgian technology companies will go through a difficult period," one trader said. 

 Real Software nosedived more than 17 percent to 15.10 euros, its lowest point since March 1998, before edging up slightly to 15.50 euros at 1436 GMT. Volume was heavy with 62,223 shares changing hands. 

 The stock has lost 72 percent of its value since it announced a profit warning on September 14. It is off 83 percent from a year high of 93.40 euros reached last January. 

 "The next target price is 12.5 euros," one trader said.

*Jo-Ann Stores Inc.'s earnings estimates are the fiscal years 2001 and 2002.
Notes:
Guess? expects fourth quarter operating earnings of 8 cents to 10
cents a share because of continuing inventory clearance activity. The apparel
maker plans to post charges in the coming quarter of up to $10 million for
closing several under-performing stores. A First Call/Thomson Financial
survey of seven analysts produced a mean earnings estimate of 36 cents a
diluted share.   Guess projects 2001 earnings of 95 cents to $1.05, on an
operating basis, and revenue growth of 8% to 12%.
Jo-Ann Stores said reaching its fourth quarter earnings estimate is dependent
on a same-store sales increase comparable to the 4.3% same-store sales
increase attained in the year-ago fourth quarter. Jo-Ann Stores said it's
"unlikely" that it would reach its fourth quarter estimate if sales remain at
current levels, which are currently below plan.
Hollywood Entertainment said same-store sales rose 1% in the third quarter.

Guitar Center also said it sees net sales for 2001 between $945 million and
$955 million, and net earnings between $27 million and $28.3 million.  For
the company's first quarter it expects earnings of 19 to 21 cents a share,
compared with estimates of 23 cents a share; 21 cents to 23 cents a share for
its second quarter, compared with estimates of 23 cents a share; 21 cents to
23 cents a share for its third quarter, compared with 24 cents a share
expected by analysts; and between 57 cents and 61 cents a share for its
fourth quarter, a boost from analysts' expectations of 55 cents a share.
Guitar Center also said it plans to open 11 to 14 new stores in 2001.
According to the filing, the retailer expects fiscal 2001 capital
expenditures to be between $23 million and $25 million.

 ArvinMeritor to  Cut  Jobs, Post Charge, Citing Failing Demand for Vehicle Parts

 TROY, Mich. -- ArvinMeritor Inc., a vehicle-parts supplier, said it will eliminate 1,500 jobs, or about 4% of its work force, and take a $90 million pretax restructuring charge as declining demand hammers profits. 

 Larry Yost, ArvinMeritor's chairman and chief executive, said he remains comfortable with current analyst consensus estimates that the company would earn $3.57 a share in fiscal 2001, but said he expected a rough year because of a severe downturn in commercial truck production and weak demand for replacement parts. ArvinMeritor will report the charge for the 2001 first quarter. 

 Mr. Yost made his comments during a conference call to review fiscal fourth-quarter results. 

 ArvinMeritor, created in July by the merger of Meritor Automotive Inc. and Arvin Industries Inc., reported that pro-forma fourth quarter net income, reflecting what the companies would have reported if combined last year, fell 65% to $29 million, or 43 cents a share, from $84 million, or $1.10 a share, a year earlier. 

 Pro-forma revenue in the period, which ended Sept. 30, was $1.7 billion, down 11% from the year-earlier quarter. 

 The results were two cents a share ahead of the consensus projection by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. Analysts had already lowered their estimates after a profit warning on Sept. 15. ArvinMeritor shares fell 50 cents to $15.06 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

 Mr. Yost said he expected the slowdown in the commercial truck and replacement-parts industries to continue into next year, and the company could also face dwindling orders for parts from U.S. auto makers. ArvinMeritor plans to continue to cut costs to bring expenses in line with the weak markets, he said. 

 "The key is to get the tough time behind us and distinguish ArvinMeritor from our peers -- to be a top player in a down market," he said.

 News Corp. Profit Falls 10% Amid Lower Audience Ratings at Fox TV

 SYDNEY, Australia -- News Corp., the media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said Wednesday that its fiscal first-quarter profit fell 10% because of lower audience ratings at Fox Television Network. 

 Profit from operations fell to $149 million, or 14 cents per American depositary receipt, from $165 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.6% to $3.24 billion. The profit matched the average estimate of eight analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Fox, the No. 4-rated U.S. TV network, was less attractive to advertisers amid competition from the broadcast of the Summer Olympics on General Electric Co.'s NBC network and hit shows such as "Survivor" on Viacom Inc.'s CBS. The weakness offset higher cash flow at the filmed entertainment unit, which benefited from such box-office successes as "X-Men." 

 News Corp. President Peter Chernin said he expects "softening" in the U.S. advertising market in its fiscal second quarter, which ends Dec. 31. He hopes improved ratings at Fox will offset the expected industrywide slowing of ad sales, Chernin said during a conference call with reporters. 

 The Fox network posted a cash-flow loss of $31 million, contrasted with cash flow of $20 million a year ago. Cash flow--or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization--is widely used by analysts and investors to measure the performance of indebted, acquisitive media companies because it excludes interest payments and noncash charges such as amortization. 

 Cash flow was reduced in part because of higher marketing expenses to promote new shows at the Fox network. 

 At Fox Entertainment Group Inc., Sydney-based News Corp.'s U.S. media arm that includes the Fox network and 20th Century Fox studio, profit from operations fell 16% to $36 million, or 5 cents a share. Revenue at Fox rose 1.5% to $1.83 billion. 

 At a Glance 

 Other earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges unless noted: 

 * AnnTaylor Stores Corp. said its fiscal third-quarter profit rose 11% to $23.9 million, or 78 cents a share, from $21.4 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier. Earnings matched estimates. Sales rose 12% to $305.9 million from $272.3 million, the company said. 

 * ArvinMeritor Inc., the largest maker of heavy-truck axles, said it will cut about 1,500 jobs, or 4% of its work force, to reduce costs as North American heavy-truck and automobile production slows. ArvinMeritor announced the move along with a 56% decline in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. The company, which now has about 36,500 employees, said it expects a first-quarter charge for the cuts of $39 million, or 57 cents a share. It sees pretax savings from the move of about $25 million in its fiscal 2001 and $50 million the next year. 

 During the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income fell to $29 million, or 43 cents a share, from profit from operations of $66 million, or 86 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell 11% to $1.68 billion. 

 * Cable-TV operator Cablevision Systems Corp. said its third-quarter loss narrowed as it gained more customers for high-speed Internet service. Net loss narrowed to $40.1 million, or 23 cents a share, from $178.1 million, or $1.17, a year earlier. Sales rose 15% to $1.04 billion. 

 * Federated Department Stores Inc. said its fiscal third-quarter profit fell 58%, hurt by an increase in late credit card payments and other problems at the company's Fingerhut catalog business. Profit from operations at the owner of Bloomingdale's, Macy's and other chains fell to $51.6 million, or 26 cents a share, from net income of $123 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. That beat expectations of 20 cents. Revenue rose 1.4% to $4.19 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9%. 

 * Imax Corp., whose profit warning last month prompted its stock to plunge 70%, reported a third-quarter loss and blamed it partly on tough financial conditions in the North American movie screening industry. Toronto-based Imax posted a net loss of $1.2 million, or 4 cents a share, on revenue of $53.6 million. That contrasts with earnings of $3.2 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $42.5 million at year ago. Analysts had forecast a loss of 2 cents. 

 * Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. said its fiscal second-quarter profit fell 12% because of a planned delay in reporting results from its European business and the timing of shipments to department stores. Profit from operations fell to $48.8 million, or 50 cents a share, from net income of $55.3 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Sales at the maker of Ralph Lauren, Polo Sport and Chaps clothing rose 7.8% to $586.2 million.

 MINNEAPOLIS -- Best Buy Co. Inc.'s shares fell sharply after the consumer-electronics retailer lowered its earnings outlook for the second half of the fiscal year, blaming the softening economy and increasing competition for driving promotional costs higher. 

 In 4 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Best Buy slid $20.125, or 38%, to $32.25. 

 The company now expects earnings of about 27 cents a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ends in November, and 90 cents a share for the fourth quarter, ending in February. 

 Analysts were looking for earnings of 44 cents a share for the third quarter and $1.02 a share for the fourth, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Best Buy said in September that it was comfortable with the third-quarter estimate of 44 cents a share, and that $1.03 a share, the estimate at the time for the fourth quarter, was "in the range." 

 Last year, the retailer earned 37 cents a share in the third quarter, excluding accounting charges, and 78 cents a share in the fourth quarter. 

 Best Buy issued a statement Thursday saying that store traffic remains strong and same-store sales -- sales in stores open at least a year -- are at 5%, as it had expected. However, the company said, increased promotional activity will lead to reduced profitability and lower gross margins as "retailers fight to gain market share in a more cautious consumer environment." 

 Best Buy sells personal computers and entertainment software and appliances, and said it remains confident that its operating model, market position and employees will help it "take the appropriate actions to respond to current market conditions." 

 Rival consumer-electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc., a unit of Circuit City Group, said late last month that soft sales in virtually all of its product categories would lead to lower same-store sales.

 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Becton Dickinson and Co. on Wednesday posted a 10 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits and set similar profit growth goals for 2001. 

 The Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based firm, which said in October it will cut 4 percent of its work force and warned that quarterly profits would miss forecasts because it is eliminating most of its discount promotions to distributors, reported net income of $84 million, or 32 cent per share in the period after items. Excluding those items, Becton said it earned 39 cents a share. 

 A year-ago, the company reported a profit of $76.3 million, or 29 cents per share. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial lowered their fourth-quarter estimate to 39 cents per share from 46 cents a share after the October warning. 

 Becton Dickinson, the nation's largest maker of syringes through its medical systems segment, said revenue rose 2 percent to $920 million. 

 "In 2001 we expect to achieve revenue growth of approximately 7 percent, or 5 percent on a reported basis that would reflect an estimated 2 percent unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, President and Chief Executive Officer Edward Ludwig said in a release. "Based on that forecast, we should achieve an increase in net income of approximately 10 percent in 2001." 

 Ludwig added that results were consistent with guidance and reflected previously announced strategic actions. "The steps we have taken set the stage for better, more consistent performance going forward," he said. 

 Shares of Becton Dickinson closed up 3/16 at $33-1/4, off a 52-week high of $34-7/16, up from a year low of $22-3/8.

 For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the medical-supplies and diagnostic-products maker had net income of $84 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $76.3 million, or 29 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 

 Excluding a variety of items, Becton (BDX) said it would have earned 39 cents a share, matching its late September profit warning, compared with 42 cents a share a year earlier. Before the warning, the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial was for earnings of 46 cents a share. 

 Revenue inched ahead by 1.9% to $919.9 million, with U.S. revenue falling 1.4% to $474 million. International sales rose by 5.8% to $445.9 million. 

 Becton noted that currency impacts cut earnings by two cents a share, primarily because of the weak euro. 

 The already-disclosed elimination of certain incentive programs with distributors cut earnings by six cents a share and lowered revenue by about $50 million. The programs were killed, Becton said in late September, so the company could improve supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies, cut costs and establish closer links with customers. 

 The company said medical-systems revenue fell 3.4% to $501.9 million, while preanalytical-solutions revenue rose 2.2% to $130.5 million. Both segments were impacted by the incentive program's dissolution. Meanwhile, biosciences revenue jumped 13% to $287.5 million 

 Becton expects earnings to grow by 10% in fiscal 2001, which began Oct. 1, on a 5% increase in revenue. The latter includes revenue being hurt by 2% from currency impacts. For fiscal 2000, the company earned $1.49 a share on revenue of $3.62 billion. The First Call estimate is for fiscal 2001 earnings of $1.65 a share. Becton said currency impacts cut earnings by an estimated six cents a share in fiscal 2000, while revenue was hurt by about 2%.

 NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Medical device maker Becton Dickinson and Co. on Wednesday posted a 10 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits and set similar profit growth goals for 2001. 

 The Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based firm, which said in October it will cut 4 percent of its work force and warned that quarterly profits would miss forecasts because it is eliminating most of its discount promotions to distributors, reported net income of $84 million, or 32 cent per share in the period after items. Excluding those items, Becton said it earned 39 cents a share. 

 A year-ago, the company reported a profit of $76.3 million, or 29 cents per share. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial lowered their fourth-quarter estimate to 39 cents per share from 46 cents a share after the October warning. 

 Becton Dickinson, the nation's largest maker of syringes through its medical systems segment, said revenue rose 2 percent to $920 million. 

 "In 2001 we expect to achieve revenue growth of approximately 7 percent, or 5 percent on a reported basis that would reflect an estimated 2 percent unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, President and Chief Executive Officer Edward Ludwig said in a release. "Based on that forecast, we should achieve an increase in net income of approximately 10 percent in 2001."

 LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Shares in Britain's MTL Instruments Group slid 30 percent on Tuesday after the maker of electronic explosion protection devices warned its profits this year would be significantly below what it had anticipated. 

 Shares in the group, which have outperformed its sector by almost 38 percent this year but are well down from a high of 425 pence seen last month, fell 125p to 290p at 0830 GMT. 

 At that price MTL is valued at around 53 million pounds by market capitalisation. 

 MTL said its traditional intrinsic safety business continued to be affected by a lack of project activity in the oil and gas sector. Also, recent merger activity between MTL's OEM (orginal equipment manufacturer) partners had pushed back expected sales growth of its new 8000 control systems back to first half 2001. 

 The group is restructuring its operations to focus on growth areas and said it had paid $20 million for U.S. control software maker Standard Automation. 

 The acquisition was seen as an important move in MTL's strategy to evolve its intrinsic safety business into a broader based process control operation. 

 The deal was expected to be dilutive in 2001 but to become accretive thereafter.

 US Corp Bonds-Lower drift amid election uncertainty.

 NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market opened weaker on Tuesday, though signs of life were emerging in the investment-grade primary market, with several companies hoping to raise cash. 

 In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between corporate bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, weakened about one basis point, while high-yield, or junk, bond prices fell about one-half point, traders said. 

 AT&T, LEVEL 3 WEAKEN 

 Traders said AT&T Corp.'s debt weakened marginally, one day after Standard & Poor's cut its long-and short-term ratings two and one notches each, to "A" and "A-1." Cuts were expected. 

 Level 3 Communications Inc.'s junk-rated notes fell about two points after the telecommunications provider's chief executive said in a letter to stockholders he remains "very comfortable" with the company's $320 million fourth quarter revenue estimate. 

 The Broomfield, Colo.-based company's 9.125 percent notes maturing in 2008 were bid at about 75 cents on the dollar, while its 11 percent notes maturing the same year were bid around 85 cents on the dollar, traders said. 

 Meanwhile, PSINet Inc.'s notes extended a recovery less than one week after the Internet access and Web-hosting services company issued its second profit warning in two months and warned of cash-flow problems. Its 10.5 percent notes maturing in 2006 were bid Tuesday at about 39 cents on the dollar, up from about 33 cents at their trough last week. 

 UNITED WE FALL, DIVIDED WE RISE 

 With voting for the U.S. presidential and congressional elections under way, many investment banks and economists have been weighing in on how bond markets and investors will react to various election scenarios. 

 A Republican sweep of the White House and Congress, they said, could trigger deep tax cuts, leading to a cut in the U.S. budget surplus, a need for the government to sell more debt or retire less, and lower bond prices. 

 A Democratic sweep, they said, could trigger smaller tax cuts but more spending, leading to a cut in the U.S. budget surplus, a need for the government to sell more debt or retire less, and lower bond prices. 

 Divided government, which has existed in the United States for all but two of the last 20 years, would make it harder for either party to fully enact its economic plans, perhaps putting less pressure on the surplus. 

 As UBS Warburg LLC put it in a new report, "the more control the winner achieves of Congress, the greater will be the reaction." 

 MORE SUPPLY 

 Investment-grade bond sales on the forward calendar come from Consumers Energy , $250 million; Energy East Corp. , $500 million; Motorola Inc. , $1 billion, Navistar Financial Securities Corp. , $400 million, and NiSource Finance Corp. , $2 billion. 

 Junk bond sales are expected from Hercules Inc. , $375 million; Resolution Performance Products LLC, $150 million, and TravelCenters of America Inc., $200 million. 

 Ten-and 30-year Treasuries rose 1/32 and 2/32, respectively. Their yields were 5.840 and 5.881 percent.

2:00 (Dow Jones) Despite the erosion of fiscal discipline that is
likely to ensue from virtually any election outcome, the budget surplus
is unlikely to fall below $200 billion before fiscal 2004, barring a
recession, say J.P. Morgan economists. (SV)



01:46 (Dow Jones) Gerard Klauer Mattison analyst John Bauer predicts
Teligent (TGNT) will announce it has received additional funding with
Wednesday's 3Q results. "Hand in hand with an announcement that they've
received additional financing, we think the company will announce a
moratorium on growth into new markets and will make some cutbacks in
existing markets," says Bauer. Analysts have questioned the company's
ability to continue without the funding. (JAW)



1:40 (Dow Jones) Investors should bulk up on shares of Bally Total
Fitness (BFT), Merrill Lynch says. The fitness club operator "has
dominant market share and the potential for upside earnings based on
dramatically improving margins," said analyst Burke Koonce. Besides
that, management is "strong," Koonce said. He didn't indicate whether he
meant from a business savvy or physical fitness standpoint. (KJT)



1:28 (Dow Jones) Fed funds futures contract is now implying a 34%
chance of a 25 bp Fed rate cut by the end of March, compared to 70% just
a few weeks ago. Market is said to be bracing for a Republican sweep,
with eventual tax-cuts that could stimulate the economy and prevent the
Fed from easing any time soon. (SV)



1:23 (Dow Jones) One sign that the market is looking for a Bush
victory: of the top 14 industry groups ranked by six-month price
performance, nine are medical or related to medical, says Mark
Minervini, of Quantech Research. (TG)



1:14 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD is moving up slightly as Bundesbank President
Ernst Welteke says euro exchange rate poses a risk for the world economy
and that euro is undervalued given economic fundamentals. EUR/USD is at
$0.8577, off recent intra-day low of $0.8557. (CSE)



1:05 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near session highs in another attempt
to take out 1449. However, floor traders say that the low volume could
thwart a big move to the upside. "There's not anyone here to really push
it higher," one trader says. The trading pit is emptier than usual, with
a lot of traders using the light volume to get lunch. (DMC)



1:00 (Dow Jones) Whatever happens in the Presidential and
Congressional elections, any knee-jerk reaction seen in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology investors is short-sighted, according
to some Wall Street experts. No matter who wins, a prescription drug
benefit for the elderly is coming, and Democrats and Republicans are
going to have to work together. (BMM)



12:55 (Dow Jones) Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson economist Brian
Wesbury says the more it looks like Bush will be the victor Tuesday, the
more it seems the Fed will not cut rates. This perception, he says, is
behind much of the downtick in Treasurys; however, Wesbury reminds that
the Reagan tax cuts coincided with one of the biggest bond market
rallies in history. "Interest rates came down at the same time tax rates
did," Wesbury notes. (CMN)



12:29 (Dow Jones) Merrill Lynch Chief Economist Bruce Steinberg sees a
soft landing "with no recession in sight." Although he sees 3.7% GDP
growth for calendar 2001 - down from 5.2% in 2000 - and an earning
slowdown, he still expects S&P 500 operating EPS to rise 10% for 2001.
Steinberg also sees capital expenditures slowing but remaining strong.

12:05 (Dow Jones) Stocks mixed at midday, with blue-chips staging a
decent rally while Nasdaq slips. Cisco off 2% in front of tonight's
earnings and techs soft in general. Alcoa, GM and United Technologies
leading the DJIA higher, with Disney the biggest loser. DJIA up 165 at
10980, hasn't hit 11000 since mid-September. Nasdaq Composite down 4 at
3447 and S&P 500 up 9 at 1436. (TG)



12:00 (Dow Jones) Geoffrey Boisi, Chase Manhattan Corp. (CMB) vice
chairman and head of investment banking, was recently singing the
praises of the bank's planned acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. (JPM) at
the BancAnalysts Association meet in Boston. Boisi said Chase and Morgan
have made 70 joint pitches to clients and have won business 40% of the
time - more than either bank was winning pre-merger, noted David Berry,
director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Boisi also said the
post-merged entity's expected cost savings of $1.5 billion will be
"significantly exceeded," as will the $1 billion in anticipated gross
incremental revenue. (TAS)



11:55 (Dow Jones) Some of Staples Inc.'s (SPLS) woes may be related to
Office Depot Inc.'s (ODP) same-store sales warning and some may be
related to a firm lowering estimates on Staples itself. Merrill Lynch &
Co. analyst Peter Caruso cut his third-quarter Staples earnings estimate
to 20 cents a share from 21 cents, 2000 to 68 cents a share from 70
cents and 2001 to 85 cents a share from 90 cents. Staples shares were
recently off about 5%. (PAP)



11:49 (Dow Jones) VA Linux's (LNUX) profit warning comes at a bad time
for IPOs. Few companies have filed offerings in the past few weeks, but
two of those, Lynuxworks Inc. and TurboLinux Inc., are Linux-related
issues. Also, the collapse in the stock for what had been history's best
first-day performer could temper aftermarket trading for IPOs in the
rest of the year. That, of course, assumes investors think about issues
like valuation when bidding up shares of new stock. (RJH)



11:33 (Dow Jones) Selling in Treasurys is tapering off, say traders,
but the market lingering near its lows with no bounce to speak of. The
trepidation on the part of buyers comes from the new wave of five- and
10-year supply over the next two days, and nervousness over the
presidential and congressional elections and what they will mean for the
budget surplus, the stock market, and the economy in general. (SV)



11:30 (Dow Jones) Most retail investors are all too familiar with the
carnage going on in the sector, but few groups within retail have
suffered through what the office-supply names have recently. Now, Office
Depot (ODP) provides the group more misery, projecting negative
same-store sales on softness in many categories. ODP halted, was off
1.6%, Staples (SPLS) drops 5%, and OfficeMax (OMX) down 2%. (PAP)



11:25 (Dow Jones) Cisco Systems (CSCO) might not be as exposed to the
capital spending slowdown in the telecom sector as some people suspect.
ABN Amro analyst Kenneth Leon says Cisco's enterprise business, or
equipment used in corporate networks, represents about 75% to 80% of its
total revenue if you include indirect sales through telecom carriers and
other service providers. On a direct sales basis, most analysts put
enterprise at about 45% of Cisco's sales. Leon expects Cisco to post
earnings of at least 16 cents a share on revenue of $5.9 billion for its
first quarter. (PDL)



11:20 (Dow Jones) Look for insurance stocks, so strong recently, to
suffer if the tech group stages a comeback, Banc of America Securities
says. "If technology gets hot again we fear the momentum money tied up
in the insurance sector could bring the group down quickly," said
analyst Jason Zucker. He reduced shares of AFLAC (AFL) and MetLife to
buy from strong buy, and shares of John Hancock (JHF) and UnumProvident
(UNM) to market performer from buy. (KJT)



11:09 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near key resistance of 1449, a level
many technical traders say could get bulls excited. One trader says a
move and close above there could push the market to the 1470s, as the
1449 area roughly represents the halfway area between the Oct. low
around 1324.80 and the Sept. high around 1556. (DMC)



11:05 (Dow Jones) After the bell, most eyes will be on Cisco Systems
(CSCO), but some will be looking for price terms on Transmeta's IPO. The
range was hiked at the end of last week, and talk is the deal, led by
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, is heavily oversubscribed.
Many analysts see Transmeta as the IPO market's last hurrah in an
otherwise flaccid 2000. (RJH)

1:40 (Dow Jones) Investors should bulk up on shares of Bally Total
Fitness (BFT), Merrill Lynch says. The fitness club operator "has
dominant market share and the potential for upside earnings based on
dramatically improving margins," said analyst Burke Koonce. Besides
that, management is "strong," Koonce said. He didn't indicate whether he
meant from a business savvy or physical fitness standpoint. (KJT)



1:28 (Dow Jones) Fed funds futures contract is now implying a 34%
chance of a 25 bp Fed rate cut by the end of March, compared to 70% just
a few weeks ago. Market is said to be bracing for a Republican sweep,
with eventual tax-cuts that could stimulate the economy and prevent the
Fed from easing any time soon. (SV)



1:23 (Dow Jones) One sign that the market is looking for a Bush
victory: of the top 14 industry groups ranked by six-month price
performance, nine are medical or related to medical, says Mark
Minervini, of Quantech Research. (TG)



1:14 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD is moving up slightly as Bundesbank President
Ernst Welteke says euro exchange rate poses a risk for the world economy
and that euro is undervalued given economic fundamentals. EUR/USD is at
$0.8577, off recent intra-day low of $0.8557. (CSE)



1:05 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near session highs in another attempt
to take out 1449. However, floor traders say that the low volume could
thwart a big move to the upside. "There's not anyone here to really push
it higher," one trader says. The trading pit is emptier than usual, with
a lot of traders using the light volume to get lunch. (DMC)



1:00 (Dow Jones) Whatever happens in the Presidential and
Congressional elections, any knee-jerk reaction seen in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology investors is short-sighted, according
to some Wall Street experts. No matter who wins, a prescription drug
benefit for the elderly is coming, and Democrats and Republicans are
going to have to work together. (BMM)



12:55 (Dow Jones) Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson economist Brian
Wesbury says the more it looks like Bush will be the victor Tuesday, the
more it seems the Fed will not cut rates. This perception, he says, is
behind much of the downtick in Treasurys; however, Wesbury reminds that
the Reagan tax cuts coincided with one of the biggest bond market
rallies in history. "Interest rates came down at the same time tax rates
did," Wesbury notes. (CMN)



12:29 (Dow Jones) Merrill Lynch Chief Economist Bruce Steinberg sees a
soft landing "with no recession in sight." Although he sees 3.7% GDP
growth for calendar 2001 - down from 5.2% in 2000 - and an earning
slowdown, he still expects S&P 500 operating EPS to rise 10% for 2001.
Steinberg also sees capital expenditures slowing but remaining strong.
(MER)



12:05 (Dow Jones) Stocks mixed at midday, with blue-chips staging a
decent rally while Nasdaq slips. Cisco off 2% in front of tonight's
earnings and techs soft in general. Alcoa, GM and United Technologies
leading the DJIA higher, with Disney the biggest loser. DJIA up 165 at
10980, hasn't hit 11000 since mid-September. Nasdaq Composite down 4 at
3447 and S&P 500 up 9 at 1436. (TG)



12:00 (Dow Jones) Geoffrey Boisi, Chase Manhattan Corp. (CMB) vice
chairman and head of investment banking, was recently singing the
praises of the bank's planned acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. (JPM) at
the BancAnalysts Association meet in Boston. Boisi said Chase and Morgan
have made 70 joint pitches to clients and have won business 40% of the
time - more than either bank was winning pre-merger, noted David Berry,
director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Boisi also said the
post-merged entity's expected cost savings of $1.5 billion will be
"significantly exceeded," as will the $1 billion in anticipated gross
incremental revenue. (TAS)



11:55 (Dow Jones) Some of Staples Inc.'s (SPLS) woes may be related to
Office Depot Inc.'s (ODP) same-store sales warning and some may be
related to a firm lowering estimates on Staples itself. Merrill Lynch &
Co. analyst Peter Caruso cut his third-quarter Staples earnings estimate
to 20 cents a share from 21 cents, 2000 to 68 cents a share from 70
cents and 2001 to 85 cents a share from 90 cents. Staples shares were
recently off about 5%. (PAP)



11:49 (Dow Jones) VA Linux's (LNUX) profit warning comes at a bad time
for IPOs. Few companies have filed offerings in the past few weeks, but
two of those, Lynuxworks Inc. and TurboLinux Inc., are Linux-related
issues. Also, the collapse in the stock for what had been history's best
first-day performer could temper aftermarket trading for IPOs in the
rest of the year. That, of course, assumes investors think about issues
like valuation when bidding up shares of new stock. (RJH)



11:33 (Dow Jones) Selling in Treasurys is tapering off, say traders,
but the market lingering near its lows with no bounce to speak of. The
trepidation on the part of buyers comes from the new wave of five- and
10-year supply over the next two days, and nervousness over the
presidential and congressional elections and what they will mean for the
budget surplus, the stock market, and the economy in general. (SV)



11:30 (Dow Jones) Most retail investors are all too familiar with the
carnage going on in the sector, but few groups within retail have
suffered through what the office-supply names have recently. Now, Office
Depot (ODP) provides the group more misery, projecting negative
same-store sales on softness in many categories. ODP halted, was off
1.6%, Staples (SPLS) drops 5%, and OfficeMax (OMX) down 2%. (PAP)



11:25 (Dow Jones) Cisco Systems (CSCO) might not be as exposed to the
capital spending slowdown in the telecom sector as some people suspect.
ABN Amro analyst Kenneth Leon says Cisco's enterprise business, or
equipment used in corporate networks, represents about 75% to 80% of its
total revenue if you include indirect sales through telecom carriers and
other service providers. On a direct sales basis, most analysts put
enterprise at about 45% of Cisco's sales. Leon expects Cisco to post
earnings of at least 16 cents a share on revenue of $5.9 billion for its
first quarter. (PDL)



11:20 (Dow Jones) Look for insurance stocks, so strong recently, to
suffer if the tech group stages a comeback, Banc of America Securities
says. "If technology gets hot again we fear the momentum money tied up
in the insurance sector could bring the group down quickly," said
analyst Jason Zucker. He reduced shares of AFLAC (AFL) and MetLife to
buy from strong buy, and shares of John Hancock (JHF) and UnumProvident
(UNM) to market performer from buy. (KJT)



11:09 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near key resistance of 1449, a level
many technical traders say could get bulls excited. One trader says a
move and close above there could push the market to the 1470s, as the
1449 area roughly represents the halfway area between the Oct. low
around 1324.80 and the Sept. high around 1556. (DMC)



11:05 (Dow Jones) After the bell, most eyes will be on Cisco Systems
(CSCO), but some will be looking for price terms on Transmeta's IPO. The
range was hiked at the end of last week, and talk is the deal, led by
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, is heavily oversubscribed.
Many analysts see Transmeta as the IPO market's last hurrah in an
otherwise flaccid 2000. (RJH)

Office Depot Inc.'s (ODP) same-store sales warning and some may be
related to a firm lowering estimates on Staples itself. Merrill Lynch &
Co. analyst Peter Caruso cut his third-quarter Staples earnings estimate
to 20 cents a share from 21 cents, 2000 to 68 cents a share from 70
cents and 2001 to 85 cents a share from 90 cents. Staples shares were

11:49 (Dow Jones) VA Linux's (LNUX) profit warning comes at a bad time
for IPOs. Few companies have filed offerings in the past few weeks, but
two of those, Lynuxworks Inc. and TurboLinux Inc., are Linux-related
issues. Also, the collapse in the stock for what had been history's best
first-day performer could temper aftermarket trading for IPOs in the
rest of the year. That, of course, assumes investors think about issues
like valuation when bidding up shares of new stock. (RJH)



11:33 (Dow Jones) Selling in Treasurys is tapering off, say traders,
but the market lingering near its lows with no bounce to speak of. The
trepidation on the part of buyers comes from the new wave of five- and
10-year supply over the next two days, and nervousness over the
presidential and congressional elections and what they will mean for the
budget surplus, the stock market, and the economy in general. (SV)



11:30 (Dow Jones) Most retail investors are all too familiar with the
carnage going on in the sector, but few groups within retail have
suffered through what the office-supply names have recently. Now, Office
Depot (ODP) provides the group more misery, projecting negative
same-store sales on softness in many categories. ODP halted, was off
1.6%, Staples (SPLS) drops 5%, and OfficeMax (OMX) down 2%. (PAP)



11:25 (Dow Jones) Cisco Systems (CSCO) might not be as exposed to the
capital spending slowdown in the telecom sector as some people suspect.
ABN Amro analyst Kenneth Leon says Cisco's enterprise business, or
equipment used in corporate networks, represents about 75% to 80% of its
total revenue if you include indirect sales through telecom carriers and
other service providers. On a direct sales basis, most analysts put
enterprise at about 45% of Cisco's sales. Leon expects Cisco to post
earnings of at least 16 cents a share on revenue of $5.9 billion for its
first quarter. (PDL)



11:20 (Dow Jones) Look for insurance stocks, so strong recently, to
suffer if the tech group stages a comeback, Banc of America Securities
says. "If technology gets hot again we fear the momentum money tied up
in the insurance sector could bring the group down quickly," said
analyst Jason Zucker. He reduced shares of AFLAC (AFL) and MetLife to
buy from strong buy, and shares of John Hancock (JHF) and UnumProvident
(UNM) to market performer from buy. (KJT)



11:09 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near key resistance of 1449, a level
many technical traders say could get bulls excited. One trader says a
move and close above there could push the market to the 1470s, as the
1449 area roughly represents the halfway area between the Oct. low
around 1324.80 and the Sept. high around 1556. (DMC)



11:05 (Dow Jones) After the bell, most eyes will be on Cisco Systems
(CSCO), but some will be looking for price terms on Transmeta's IPO. The
range was hiked at the end of last week, and talk is the deal, led by
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, is heavily oversubscribed.
Many analysts see Transmeta as the IPO market's last hurrah in an
otherwise flaccid 2000. (RJH)

1:05 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near session highs in another attempt
to take out 1449. However, floor traders say that the low volume could
thwart a big move to the upside. "There's not anyone here to really push
it higher," one trader says. The trading pit is emptier than usual, with
a lot of traders using the light volume to get lunch. (DMC)



1:00 (Dow Jones) Whatever happens in the Presidential and
Congressional elections, any knee-jerk reaction seen in the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology investors is short-sighted, according
to some Wall Street experts. No matter who wins, a prescription drug
benefit for the elderly is coming, and Democrats and Republicans are
going to have to work together. (BMM)



12:55 (Dow Jones) Griffin Kubik Stephens & Thompson economist Brian
Wesbury says the more it looks like Bush will be the victor Tuesday, the
more it seems the Fed will not cut rates. This perception, he says, is
behind much of the downtick in Treasurys; however, Wesbury reminds that
the Reagan tax cuts coincided with one of the biggest bond market
rallies in history. "Interest rates came down at the same time tax rates
did," Wesbury notes. (CMN)



12:29 (Dow Jones) Merrill Lynch Chief Economist Bruce Steinberg sees a
soft landing "with no recession in sight." Although he sees 3.7% GDP
growth for calendar 2001 - down from 5.2% in 2000 - and an earning
slowdown, he still expects S&P 500 operating EPS to rise 10% for 2001.
Steinberg also sees capital expenditures slowing but remaining strong.
(MER)



12:05 (Dow Jones) Stocks mixed at midday, with blue-chips staging a
decent rally while Nasdaq slips. Cisco off 2% in front of tonight's
earnings and techs soft in general. Alcoa, GM and United Technologies
leading the DJIA higher, with Disney the biggest loser. DJIA up 165 at
10980, hasn't hit 11000 since mid-September. Nasdaq Composite down 4 at
3447 and S&P 500 up 9 at 1436. (TG)



12:00 (Dow Jones) Geoffrey Boisi, Chase Manhattan Corp. (CMB) vice
chairman and head of investment banking, was recently singing the
praises of the bank's planned acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. (JPM) at
the BancAnalysts Association meet in Boston. Boisi said Chase and Morgan
have made 70 joint pitches to clients and have won business 40% of the
time - more than either bank was winning pre-merger, noted David Berry,
director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Boisi also said the
post-merged entity's expected cost savings of $1.5 billion will be
"significantly exceeded," as will the $1 billion in anticipated gross
incremental revenue. (TAS)

10:53 (Dow Jones) Strong box-office open for Sony's (SNE) "Charlie's
Angels" may portend healthy Thanksgiving season. UBS Warburg's Chris
Dixon says in note Monday holiday box office along with close of AOL/TWX
deal are among key near-term factors for entertainment and media sector.
Dixon likes VIA, DIS, Liberty Media and, once deal closes, AOL/TWX. (GC)



10:48 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD has bounced off an intraday low of $0.8607
to trade around $0.8622. Window for further intervention Monday is
closing rapidly, say traders. Market has come way off $0.8732 high hit
after intervention. (CSE)



10:41 (Dow Jones) Cummins Inc. (CUM) keeps on truckin' on the job-cut
front, saying it'll reduce workforce by another 350 over the next month,
taking unspecified charge in 4Q. Diesel-engine maker also says it's
rethinking how it participates in heavy truck engine market. That may
sound spooky, but remember that Cummins now makes a lot of its money
from power generation and filtration. Street seems to understand: CUM up
slightly, as is the other heavy engine maker and Dow component,
Caterpillar (CAT). (GC)



10:30 (Dow Jones) With C.I. Fund, the big Canadian mutual fund
company, launching a hostile, C$3.9 billion bid for rival Makenzie
Financial (MKFCF), AIC Ltd., another big Canadian fund company, will
likely play a deciding role in the deal's completion. AIC owns 18% of
C.I. and 19% of Mackenzie. (BED)



10:28 (Dow Jones) October served up more tricks than treats to
convertible investors, Merrill Lynch convertibles vice president Anne
Cox says. The All U.S. Convertibles Index slipped 3.9% over the month,
in response to a 5.1% decline in the underlying shares, according to
Merrill. (JA)



10:20 (Dow Jones) Both Dec. bonds and 10-years continue to extend
bottom of session range, with election outcome concerns causing some
participants to put on bearish plays. Trader says thought is win by W.
Bush would be good for stock market, and therefore cause money to be
pulled out of Treasury. (CMN)

   MARKET TALK can be found using code N/DJMT
  12:29 (Dow Jones) Merrill Lynch Chief Economist Bruce Steinberg sees
a soft landing "with no recession in sight." Although he sees 3.7% GDP
growth for calendar 2001 - down from 5.2% in 2000 - and an earning
slowdown, he still expects S&P 500 operating EPS to rise 10% for 2001.
Steinberg also sees capital expenditures slowing but remaining strong.
(MER)



12:05 (Dow Jones) Stocks mixed at midday, with blue-chips staging a
decent rally while Nasdaq slips. Cisco off 2% in front of tonight's
earnings and techs soft in general. Alcoa, GM and United Technologies
leading the DJIA higher, with Disney the biggest loser. DJIA up 165 at
10980, hasn't hit 11000 since mid-September. Nasdaq Composite down 4 at
3447 and S&P 500 up 9 at 1436. (TG)



12:00 (Dow Jones) Geoffrey Boisi, Chase Manhattan Corp. (CMB) vice
chairman and head of investment banking, was recently singing the
praises of the bank's planned acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. (JPM) at
the BancAnalysts Association meet in Boston. Boisi said Chase and Morgan
have made 70 joint pitches to clients and have won business 40% of the
time - more than either bank was winning pre-merger, noted David Berry,
director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Boisi also said the
post-merged entity's expected cost savings of $1.5 billion will be
"significantly exceeded," as will the $1 billion in anticipated gross
incremental revenue. (TAS)



11:55 (Dow Jones) Some of Staples Inc.'s (SPLS) woes may be related to
Office Depot Inc.'s (ODP) same-store sales warning and some may be
related to a firm lowering estimates on Staples itself. Merrill Lynch &
Co. analyst Peter Caruso cut his third-quarter Staples earnings estimate
to 20 cents a share from 21 cents, 2000 to 68 cents a share from 70
cents and 2001 to 85 cents a share from 90 cents. Staples shares were
recently off about 5%. (PAP)



11:49 (Dow Jones) VA Linux's (LNUX) profit warning comes at a bad time
for IPOs. Few companies have filed offerings in the past few weeks, but
two of those, Lynuxworks Inc. and TurboLinux Inc., are Linux-related
issues. Also, the collapse in the stock for what had been history's best
first-day performer could temper aftermarket trading for IPOs in the
rest of the year. That, of course, assumes investors think about issues
like valuation when bidding up shares of new stock. (RJH)



11:33 (Dow Jones) Selling in Treasurys is tapering off, say traders,
but the market lingering near its lows with no bounce to speak of. The
trepidation on the part of buyers comes from the new wave of five- and
10-year supply over the next two days, and nervousness over the
presidential and congressional elections and what they will mean for the
budget surplus, the stock market, and the economy in general. (SV)



11:30 (Dow Jones) Most retail investors are all too familiar with the
carnage going on in the sector, but few groups within retail have
suffered through what the office-supply names have recently. Now, Office
Depot (ODP) provides the group more misery, projecting negative
same-store sales on softness in many categories. ODP halted, was off
1.6%, Staples (SPLS) drops 5%, and OfficeMax (OMX) down 2%. (PAP)



11:25 (Dow Jones) Cisco Systems (CSCO) might not be as exposed to the
capital spending slowdown in the telecom sector as some people suspect.
ABN Amro analyst Kenneth Leon says Cisco's enterprise business, or
equipment used in corporate networks, represents about 75% to 80% of its
total revenue if you include indirect sales through telecom carriers and
other service providers. On a direct sales basis, most analysts put
enterprise at about 45% of Cisco's sales. Leon expects Cisco to post
earnings of at least 16 cents a share on revenue of $5.9 billion for its
first quarter. (PDL)



11:20 (Dow Jones) Look for insurance stocks, so strong recently, to
suffer if the tech group stages a comeback, Banc of America Securities
says. "If technology gets hot again we fear the momentum money tied up
in the insurance sector could bring the group down quickly," said
analyst Jason Zucker. He reduced shares of AFLAC (AFL) and MetLife to
buy from strong buy, and shares of John Hancock (JHF) and UnumProvident
(UNM) to market performer from buy. (KJT)

suffer if the tech group stages a comeback, Banc of America Securities
says. "If technology gets hot again we fear the momentum money tied up
in the insurance sector could bring the group down quickly," said
analyst Jason Zucker. He reduced shares of AFLAC (AFL) and MetLife to
buy from strong buy, and shares of John Hancock (JHF) and UnumProvident
(UNM) to market performer from buy. (KJT)



11:09 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps are near key resistance of 1449, a level
many technical traders say could get bulls excited. One trader says a
move and close above there could push the market to the 1470s, as the
1449 area roughly represents the halfway area between the Oct. low
around 1324.80 and the Sept. high around 1556. (DMC)



11:05 (Dow Jones) After the bell, most eyes will be on Cisco Systems
(CSCO), but some will be looking for price terms on Transmeta's IPO. The
range was hiked at the end of last week, and talk is the deal, led by
Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, is heavily oversubscribed.
Many analysts see Transmeta as the IPO market's last hurrah in an
otherwise flaccid 2000. (RJH)



10:53 (Dow Jones) Strong box-office open for Sony's (SNE) "Charlie's
Angels" may portend healthy Thanksgiving season. UBS Warburg's Chris
Dixon says in note Monday holiday box office along with close of AOL/TWX
deal are among key near-term factors for entertainment and media sector.
Dixon likes VIA, DIS, Liberty Media and, once deal closes, AOL/TWX. (GC)



10:48 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD has bounced off an intraday low of $0.8607
to trade around $0.8622. Window for further intervention Monday is
closing rapidly, say traders. Market has come way off $0.8732 high hit
after intervention. (CSE)



10:41 (Dow Jones) Cummins Inc. (CUM) keeps on truckin' on the job-cut
front, saying it'll reduce workforce by another 350 over the next month,
taking unspecified charge in 4Q. Diesel-engine maker also says it's
rethinking how it participates in heavy truck engine market. That may
sound spooky, but remember that Cummins now makes a lot of its money
from power generation and filtration. Street seems to understand: CUM up
slightly, as is the other heavy engine maker and Dow component,
Caterpillar (CAT). (GC)



10:30 (Dow Jones) With C.I. Fund, the big Canadian mutual fund
company, launching a hostile, C$3.9 billion bid for rival Makenzie
Financial (MKFCF), AIC Ltd., another big Canadian fund company, will
likely play a deciding role in the deal's completion. AIC owns 18% of
C.I. and 19% of Mackenzie. (BED)



10:28 (Dow Jones) October served up more tricks than treats to
convertible investors, Merrill Lynch convertibles vice president Anne
Cox says. The All U.S. Convertibles Index slipped 3.9% over the month,
in response to a 5.1% decline in the underlying shares, according to
Merrill. (JA)



10:20 (Dow Jones) Both Dec. bonds and 10-years continue to extend
bottom of session range, with election outcome concerns causing some
participants to put on bearish plays. Trader says thought is win by W.
Bush would be good for stock market, and therefore cause money to be
pulled out of Treasury. (CMN)



10:03 (Dow Jones) Dec. DJIA is attempting to keep modest gains.
Support for contract seen at 10853 and 10812, according to Technical
Analytics, Inc. Resistance is seen at 10920 and 10964. Cash index up 20
at 10837. (DMC)



10:00 (Dow Jones) Lehman's Jeff Applegate says it's time for growth
stocks again. Over the past two quarters, value has outperformed growth.
The profitability of growth stocks hasn't changed, though, while
valuation has, particularly for tech names. "Given those adjustments,
plus our forecast of slowing global growth and flat EPS momentum, now
should be the time for growth," Applegate says. (TG)



9:57 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD spiked to $0.8700 from around $0.8660 but has
come off to $0.8653. Traders cite a large order in a thin market. No
signs of central banks. (CSE)



9:50 (Dow Jones) A trading manager says he's seen very little buying
in cash Treasurys, and has seen some light overseas and foreign central
bank selling. Treasury prices are fading in the face of stocks' positive
opening. (MSD)



9:48 (Dow Jones) EUR/USD has rebounded back up to 0.8665 after testing
0.8650, its lowest level since the ECB intervened overnight. Traders see
no signs of central banks. Head trader at a major N.Y. bank says the ECB
may come back in around overnight low of 0.8620. (RTB)



9:44 (Dow Jones) Dec. Nasdaq is testing support as the contract pares
early gains. Support seen at overnight low of 3353, then the pivot level
of 3345. Floor technical trader says if the contract breaks support at
3323, a test of 3295 is possible. Resistance is seen at session high of
3378, with a test of Friday's high of 3388 a target for bulls. (DMC)



9:40 (Dow Jones) Communications chip maker Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)
announced yet another acquisition Monday. This time Broadcom will
acquire SiByte Inc., a Santa Clara processor chip developer for roughly
$2 billion. But this deal, said the company's President and Chief
Executive Henry Nicholas, is the "most significant" in its history.
(DLF)



9:36 (Dow Jones) More dot-com employees had the chairs pulled out from
under them, as the Internet bust claimed another victim: Furniture.com.
The company said Monday it would end operations, and get rid of most of
its 88 employees. (RJH)



9:33 (Dow Jones) Dec. S&Ps and Nasdaq are firmer, following overnight
gains. A quiet session of two-sided trade is expected Monday, with
participants looking ahead to Tuesday's election and earnings from CSCO
this p.m. Support comes from firm technicals. (DMC)



9:29 (Dow Jones) Oh, how the mighty have fallen. VA Linux Systems
(LNUX) made its mark in IPO almost a year ago when it soared 697.5%
above its $30 offering price in the best first-day gain ever for a new
stock. After saying 1Q results will be worse than expected, the stock
has sold off in the premarket, recently changing hands at $18.38. (RJH)

The Trader
 MARKET WEEK -- Stocks 
 Buyers Outvote Sellers in Pre-Election Trading

 An unusual mix of Old and New Economy stocks enjoyed solid advances last week, helping both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite in pre-election trading. 

 The Dow gained 227 points, or 2.1%, in the five sessions, to 10,817, while the Nasdaq advanced 173 points to 3451, a 5.3% rise. The Dow's big move came Monday, when it rose 245 points, as formerly depressed stocks such as International Paper, General Motors, Alcoa and Caterpillar came to life. Technology stocks rebounded on Tuesday, when the Nasdaq rose over 5%. 

 As has often been the case lately, large one-day moves weren't sustained. The economically cyclical stocks, for instance, barely budged after their advance Monday. 

 Technology bellwether Cisco Systems enjoyed a strong week, rising over six points to 56.75, ahead of its eagerly awaited profit report today. Cisco is expected to post earnings of 17 cents a share, up from 12 cents a year ago. Internet stocks generally were strong, led by Yahoo, as were the beaten-down Internet "incubators" such as CMGI and Internet Capital Group. WorldCom was the most notable loser last week, falling 4 to 18 after its profit warning. It's down 70% from its March peak of 61. 

 So far this year, the Dow is off 6%, and the Nasdaq is down 15%. The S&P 500, which rose 3.4% last week to 1426, has declined 2.9% in 2000. 

 -- This week's trading could be dominated by reaction to Tuesday's presidential election. Judging from the movement in various industry groups lately, the stock market seems to be anticipating a victory by George W. Bush because industries that stand to do well under a Bush administration, including drugs, defense, tobacco and HMOs, generally have been strong. It should be noted that these groups did decline Friday, perhaps reflecting concerns that the revelation of Bush's drunk-driving citation in 1976 may hurt his chances on Tuesday. 

 Tom Gallagher, the political analyst at ISI Group in Washington, says stocks generally don't fully discount political developments. So there could be some sizable moves in tobacco, defense, drug and HMO stocks on Wednesday, especially if Al Gore, who has railed against those industries in the campaign, does prevail. Other beneficiaries of a Bush win could be Microsoft, which has been under assault from Bill Clinton's Justice Department, and USA Education, the former Sallie Mae, whose growth has been crimped by the government's direct student-lending program, a pet project of Clinton. Producers of fuel cells and other alternative energy sources could get a boost from a Gore win. Ditto for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are close to the Democrats. 

 The beleaguered companies facing mounting asbestos liabilities also could be helped by a Bush win and continued Republican control of Congress, because Bush may support the now-stalled bill in the House of Representatives that would provide them with tax relief. 

 Owens Corning filed for bankruptcy last month after getting swamped by asbestos claims. Its shares, at 1.44, are down 93% this year. Other affected companies include Armstrong Holdings, USG, Owens-Illinois, Federal-Mogul and W.R. Grace. Armstrong is down 91% this year to 2.81; USG has fallen 63% to 17.31; Federal-Mogul has dropped 85% to 3; Owens-Illinois is off 76% to 6 and Grace has plunged 73% to 3.81. Some institutions have been investing in the debt and preferred of these companies, which often yield more than 20%. Owens-Illinois, for instance, has Big-Board-listed preferred stock that finished Friday at 13, yielding 17%. 

 Gallagher cautions that asbestos relief may be tough to achieve because the issue is political dynamite on Capitol Hill. The GOP, he says, got spooked when some Democrats in Montana got a big boost from their opposition to any breaks for former asbestos makers. 

 -- Third-quarter operating profits for the companies in the S&P 500 index are expected to show a solid 18% gain once the last of them report their results in coming weeks. But the fourth quarter isn't shaping up so strongly, according to Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call. 

 Hill says that since October 1, the estimated S&P earnings growth for the fourth quarter has dropped to 11.8% from 15.6%, led by profit reductions for technology companies. First-quarter profit projections for the S&P also have been coming down. The current consensus is for 10.9% growth, down from 14.9% a month ago, based on analysts' estimates for the 500 companies in the index. 

 -- Don't expect Wall Street analysts to warn of impending trouble at companies that are big investment-banking clients. Take WorldCom, whose stock has collapsed this year because of steady reductions in revenue and profit estimates. The company, which became a telecom colossus through dozens of acquisitions, was one of the biggest meal tickets for Wall Street. 

 After WorldCom's latest warning last week, analysts cut their estimates for the company's 2001 "cash" earnings before goodwill amortization to around $1.60 a share from $2.42. 

 Back in August, Jack Grubman, the Salomon Smith Barney telecom analyst who's close to Ebbers, was telling clients that the stock, then at 36, could double after it separated its slow-growth consumer long-distance operations from its fast-growing business and data operations. That split is looming, but it hasn't helped the stock. 

 This illustrates one of the lessons from the WorldCom fiasco: Be wary of breakup stories. The bullish story behind innumerable companies is that the sum of the parts is worth more than the whole, and that once a breakup happens, investors will reap large gains. Sometimes these stories do pan out. But in many cases, weakening business conditions swamp any benefits from a breakup. And the breakup stories also assume that markets are totally inefficient and don't discount an expected event. Yet with the WorldCom and AT&T situations, the markets correctly showed skepticism about the potential benefits of split-ups. 

 Also be careful about stocks touted based on "growth at a reasonable price," or GARP, analysis. These companies have high expected profit growth relative to their price/earnings multiples. Yet it often turns out, as in the case of WorldCom, that the projected earnings growth is overstated. WorldCom was a prime GARP stock in the summer, when Grubman and others saw the company capable of generating 20% annual profit growth for five years. That estimate now looks far too optimistic. 

 -- Quaker Oats may have made a mistake when it reportedly turned down an offer of over $100 a share last week from PepsiCo, which was seeking control of Quaker's prized Gatorade business. 

 Quaker rallied 7.38 to 89.63 Friday following news of the rebuffed Pepsi offer amid speculation that Pepsi will sweeten the bid or that Nestle will come along and make an all-cash offer. 

 Yet Pepsi was willing to pay a pretty generous price for Quaker, which is expected to show low double-digit profit growth in the next few years. Pepsi offered to pay 30 times projected 2000 profits and 27 times estimated 2001 earnings of $3.75, a premium to most food companies, which fetch 15-20 times estimated 2000 profits. 

 John O'Neil, the food analyst at UBS Warburg, points out that Pepsi's offer amounted to 16.5 times estimated 2000 cash flow, a premium to the takeover prices of Bestfoods and Nabisco Holdings. The offer was especially lush since Gatorade accounts for just 40% of Quaker's profits. The rest comes from slower-growth cereals and snacks. He calculates Pepsi was effectively offering 20 times cash flow for Gatorade. 


O'Neil is bullish on Quaker, arguing that Pepsi will come back with
another bid or that another acquirer will emerge. But if Pepsi was
serious about its offer being final, Quaker may wish it had accepted the
deal.
-- Internet companies are finding that any setback can be fatal because
disappointments clobber their stocks, and stocks are the glue that
holds them together.



Just look at the implosion at Priceline.com. It reported more bad
news last Thursday, including a drop in October airline ticket sales;
the resignation of its chief financial officer, Heidi Miller; a layoff
of 16% of its employees, and importantly, the repricing of warrants
granted to Delta Air Lines, the company's earliest airline partner.



Priceline, whose shares hit 104 in the spring, fell 2.13 to 4.75, the
stock's lowest closing price ever.



Henry Blodget, the Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch, called the
warrant repricing "particularly worrisome." Last November, Priceline
issued 20 million warrants struck at $56 a share to various airlines to
secure their participation in its system.



Delta got 5.5 million warrants, as did United Airlines. On Thursday,
Priceline said the Delta warrants will be repriced to around $5 from
$56. Priceline's problem is that other airlines are likely to demand a
similar deal, resulting in further potential dilution. Blodget says the
repricing of the Delta warrants "lends credence" to the view held by
Priceline's critics that airlines have the upper hand with the company
and that Priceline effectively has to "buy inventory with equity." This
also suggests that Priceline's reported gross margins are overstated
because of the warrant costs.



The airlines, meanwhile, are set to roll out a competing Website
called Hotwire.com, which could hurt Priceline.



Priceline may survive, but as Blodget put it Friday, "This is a much
smaller business opportunity than we initially hoped."



-- Washington Post possesses an impressive array of media properties
beyond its flagship newspaper. But its stock has barely budged in the
past 2 1/2 years because its reported profits have been stagnant, partly
due to investments in newer businesses, including various Internet
initiatives like Washingtonpost.com and BrassRing, an online hiring
service.



The Post, headed by the 55-year-old Donald Graham, son of the
legendary Katharine Graham, has maintained a very low profile on Wall
Street, reflecting the influence of longtime shareholder Warren Buffett,
whose Berkshire Hathaway owns an 18% stake. The stock ended Friday at
535, down 3% this year. The Grahams, following Buffett's example, refuse
to split the Post's stock.



Perhaps frustrated by the stock price, the Post will hold its first
Shareholders Day on Friday in Washington to showcase some of the newer
businesses. Graham and several of his top managers will discuss the
Post's cable TV operations, Internet ventures and fast-growing
educational division, including the Stanley Kaplan test-preparation
unit. Graham's aim presumably is to highlight their prospects and
ultimate value to the company despite some current losses.



The meeting may lift the Post's share price by emphasizing the asset
value within the company, which some have put at more than $750 a share.
The Post now is valued at around $5 billion. There's also nearly $1
billion in debt.



The Post's strategy in recent years has been to milk its mature
businesses, like the newspaper, and invest in highergrowth areas. The
Post, for instance, waited until 1998 to replace certain newspaper
presses dating back to 1949.



"The Post has a great management team and the best board of directors
in the country," says Larry Pitkowsky, an analyst at Fairhome Capital, a
New Jersey investment manager. The all-star board includes Buffett, Don
Keogh, the former Coca-Cola executive; Daniel Burke, the former head of
Capital Cities/ABC, and Bill Ruane, an old friend of Buffett and the
chairman of Ruane Cuniff, the investment firm, whose astute management
of much of the Post's pension funds has resulted in significant
overfunding of nearly $800 million at yearend 1999. Media mogul Barry
Diller recently joined the board.



Looking at the Post's assets, the cable systems, which have 735,000
subscribers, could be worth $2.5 billion, based on a value of $3,500 per
subscriber. The TV stations, which include strong NBC affiliates in
Detroit and Houston, could fetch $3 billion at 15 times operating
profits. This suggests that investors are getting the rest of the Post
for nothing.



The problem with this analysis is that the Post has shown no
willingness to sell any of its major businesses. And the Graham family
is highly unlikely to consider a sale of the company. Parroting Buffett,
Don Graham says the company invests for the long term and is
uninterested in smooth quarterly results.



The Post's results have hardly been stellar in recent years,
reflecting the slow growth at its newspaper, magazine and broadcast
properties. Operating income grew 3% in 1998 and 2% in 1999. The
company's third-quarter profits fell 33% to $3.51, reflecting investment
spending, higher interest costs and weaker results at Newsweek.



Lauren Rich Fine, a Merrill Lynch newspaper analyst, recently cut her
2000 profit estimate to $15.50 from $17.05 and her 2001 estimate to
$18.55 from $20.90. This suggests the Post is expensive at almost 30
times projected 2001 profits, a premium to the newspaper group. But the
Post trades at a discount to its peers based on cash flow, fetching
around eight times estimated 2001 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.



Fine wrote recently that the Post is an "excellent value." Investors,
however, are frustrated, because "it has been years since the Post sold
an asset and it has also been awhile since it delivered strong operating
results."



Fine has a price target of $600 a share. Pitkowsky values the Post at
around $600 based on its future cash flows. He'd be happy to see the
Post monetize some assets, but isn't assuming that will occur.



The Graham family owns an estimated 30% of the stock, including
super-voting shares that give it control of the company. Institutions
generally won't bother with the stock because of low liquidity. Volume
Friday, for instance, was just 2,600 shares.



The Post believes its stock is undervalued, having bought back about
6% of its shares last December in a tender offer at $575 a share.
Potential buyers can take comfort in the company's asset value and
management, but patience may be required for a sizable payoff.

 Stock dives by 13 per cent in a materials world.

 Chairman won't be deflected from strategy. 

 Shares in building materials company Heywood Williams slumped almost 13 per cent yesterday after a profit warning. 

 The company said the usual second-half upturn in its UK markets had not happened and markets had weakened in the US. 

 Huddersfield-based Heywood Williams had been expected to report taxable profits this year of between #33m and #36m. Analysts are now looking at a range between #27m and #29m. 

 The company's shares have underperformed the construction and building sector by some 26 per cent so far this year. 

 Last night they were off 23p at 159.5p. 

 Two months ago Heywood Williams outlined a plan to sell off more than half its businesses and return cash to shareholders. Yesterday chairman Hamish Bryce insisted there would be no change to that strategy and said current performance "completely confirms the validity of the decision". 

 "The action we are taking, which is a mix of corporate and organic action, is absolutely the right thing to do given our circumstances," he said. 

 "We will not be deflected by short-term market conditions." 

 In April the company rejected an unsolicited takeover approach. Mr Bryce said yesterday: "There's absolutely no talks going on right now. Nobody's beating a path to our door." 

 The disposal programme will mean the sale of all the US businesses, which account for 55 per cent of group sales, as well as the sale of peripheral UK and European operations. Heywood Williams wants to concentrate on the UK windows and doors market. 

 Mr Bryce claimed this focus would improve the City's perception of the company as well as boost day to day operations. "Getting focus is what we're all about and this will crystallise the inherent value in the business," he said. 

 The main US businesses are fittings for manufactured housing - factory built and transported to the site - and recreational vehicles like campers and pick-ups. The company also has a business making pipes for builders' merchants. 

 Analysts estimate these could be sold for up to #150m, which could mean investors receiving about #1 per share. 

 Yesterday Heywood Williams said the pipe and recreational vehicle markets had softened and the market for manufactured housing remained depressed. 

 But it insisted the disposal of these businesses was progressing. 

 The sale of non-core UK and continental European operations was "advancing satisfactorily", it said. 

 "None of our businesses is losing money - we've got good businesses," Mr Bryce claimed. 

 He repeated: "The board continues to be committed to realising full value for shareholders and is pursuing all options to that end." 

 Heywood Williams has cut almost half the jobs at its head office, taking the total down to 19. It also recently completed a buyback of 10 per cent of its shares.

 US Corp Bonds - Open mixed - PSINet drags telecoms down.

 NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market opened Friday's session mixed in light trading while the spotlight shifted to new supply, traders said. 

 "We opened up a tad wider in front of the numbers but then we came back in and even traded a few tighter," said one high-grade trader, referring to Friday morning's jobs data 

 The U.S. Labour Department said the U.S. unemployment rate held at 3.9 percent in October while average hourly earnings, a gauge of wage-level inflationary pressures, rose by 0.4 percent. Non-farm payrolls increased by 137,000 in October. 

 Spreads to U.S. Treasuries were quoted one to two basis points tighter across the board in light volume, while junk bond prices were quoted flat, with the exception of telecoms issues, which weakened by 1/2 point, traders said. 

 "There's a bit of a negative tone in the market, but for the most part it's been quiet," one trader said. "Telecoms are under pressure, people are still focused on PSINet which has been very volatile," he added. 

 PSINET 

 PSINet Inc.'s bonds sank after the Internet access and Web-hosting service provider reported a big loss, cut its outlook and said it was mulling its options on Thursday. 

 The company's bonds fell by about one-third after the company issued its second profit warning in two months. It lost $1.4 billion in the third quarter, largely because of writedowns. Its 10.5 percent notes maturing in December 2006 which were bid at between 32 cents and 34 cents on the dollar, down about 17 cents from Wednesday. PSINet sold them last Nov. 24 at 100. 

 The Ashburn, Va.-based company said cash on hand slipped to $1 billion at the end of the third quarter from $1.5 billion at the end of June, and added that Chief Operating Officer Harold (Pete) Wills resigned as part of a management reorganization. 

 PSINet warned that fourth-quarter results would be worse than previously expected, with company executives citing slowdowns in its Internet access and consulting businesses. 

 DEBT SALES 

 Two companies sold debt Friday morning. 

 Allegheny Energy Inc. sold $135 million in debt in a reopening of an existing issue, said lead manager Goldman Sachs on Friday. The firm issued 7.75 percent in A3/A rated five-year notes at a spread of 170 basis points. 

 In addition, fiber optic maker Corning Inc. said on Friday it had priced its 30 million share offering of common stock at $71.25 per share. Underwriters of the offering were granted an overallotment option of up to 4.5 million of Corning shares. 

 Corning also said it had priced the offering of approximately $2.7 billion in convertible debentures due Nov. 8, 2015 at an initial price of $741.923 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. 

 Combined net proceeds of the two offerings will result in about $4.1 billion for Corning. The company plans to use a portion of the proceeds to fund the purchase of up to $3.6 billion previously announced acquisition of Pirelli S.p.A.'s 90 percent interest in Optical Technologies USA Corp. 

 Both offerings were underwritten and lead-managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

 UPCOMING HIGH-GRADE DEALS 

 Southern California Edison will sell $1.35 billion of a two-part debt sale as early as Friday, dealers said. The private sale is expected to include about $1 billion of three-year fixed-rate notes and $350 million of one year floating-rate notes, dealers said. 

 Chase Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Inc. are arranging both sales, market sources said. 

 NiSource Inc. , a Merrillville, Ind.-based utility company, also plans to privately sell $2 billion to $2.5 billion of debt next week via Credit Suisse First Boston, market sources said. The firm completed its merger with Columbia Energy Group eight months after the $6 billion combination was first announced. 

 HIGH-YIELD ISSUES 

 Two deals remain on the calendar for this week's business: CanWest Media Inc. , C$800 million equivalent (US$523 million) and Grohe Holdings GmbH, 200 million euros ($172 million), dealers said. 

 Meanwhile, for the latest measured week, the sector saw investors pull $69.1 million cash from U.S. junk bond mutual funds, said sources citing AMG Data Services.

 Gap Inc. on Wednesday issued another profit warning, saying same-store sales in October dropped 2% as it discounted back-to-school and other slow-selling items to make way for holiday merchandise. But investors bid the stock higher in late trading, suggesting belief that the worst is over for the retailer. 

 October was a "big clearance month" for the nation's largest apparel chain, which expects a "significant" decline in gross margin for the third quarter ended Oct. 28, Chief Financial Officer Heidi Kunz said. As a result, earnings are expected to be 20 to 22 cents a share, she said. 

 San Francisco-based Gap, owner of Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, was expected to earn 23 cents a share, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. The estimate once was 41 cents, before Gap lowered its expectations in August. 

 Forecasts for October sales at stores open at least a year ranged from a gain of 1% to a decline of 3%. 

 Gap made its announcement after the close of regular U.S. trading. Its shares fell $1.38 to close at $24.44 on the New York Stock Exchange in regular trading, but rose to $25.75 in after-hours activity. The stock has fallen 47% year to date.

 AMSTERDAM, Nov 2 (Reuters) - F. van Lanschot Bankiers said on Thursday it had downgraded its recommendation on temporary employment agency Randstad NV to "Underperformance" from "Marketperformance," following Wednesday's profit warning. 

 "This is not a sector specific problem, but a company specific problem," Van Lanschot said. 

 "Perhaps the worst effect of the profit warning is the loss of confidence in management...The management of Randstad has always had a strong track record, but after disappointing first half 2000 results and now with a profit warning, its image is damaged," it added. 

 Van Lanschot also cut its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for 2000 to 1.22 euros from 1.83 euros, and for 2001 to 1.39 from 2.34 euros. 

 "We expect that not all the negative news has past yet," the bank said.

 (updates, recasts lede, adds bond comments, updates stock price, moves up resignation in paragraphs 3,4,13,14) 

 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - PSINet Inc.'s stock and junk bonds sank on Thursday after the Internet access and Web-hosting services provider posted third-quarter results that disappointed Wall Street and said it would sell many of the assets from its $1.9 billion purchase of Metamor Worldwide. 

 While the Ashburn, Va.-based PSINet posted a third-quarter operating loss that was lower than expected, revenues of $352.5 million missed analysts' estimates by about 22 percent. 

 PSINet also delivered its second profit warning in two months, saying that fourth-quarter results would fall below expectations amid a slowdown in demand for Internet services. 

 It also said President and Chief Operating Officer Harold Wills resigned as part of a company reorganization. 

 Excluding items and charges, the company posted a third-quarter operating loss of $182 million, or 95 cents a share, beating average Wall Street estimates of a loss of $1.28 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 "PSINet had an absolutely horrible quarter showing that the Metamor Worldwide acquisition has been a complete mistake," said Fred Moran, analyst at Jefferies & Co. "Management has very little understanding of what they bought and failed to communicate to Wall Street just how sensitive these numbers could be." 

 Shares of PSINet shares tumbled over 56 percent on the day to a fresh 52-week low closing price of $2-15/16, and are now down more than 95 percent from their year high of $60-15/16. The stock was the day's third most actively-traded share and the biggest percentage loser on the Nasdaq. 

 PSINet's "distressed" 10.5 percent senior notes maturing in December 2006 were bid late Thursday at about 33 cents on the dollar, down from 49 on Wednesday. 

 Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers both cut their ratings on the company. 

 ASSETS ON THE BLOCK 

 PSINet, which completed the Metamor purchase this summer, said it has hired CS First Boston to pursue the sale of its 80 percent stake in electronic commerce software company Xpedior Inc., one of the assets from the Metamor deal. 

 It has also hired the investment banking firms of Lazard Freres & Co. and Daniels & Co. to assist with the valuation and sale of some of PSINet's consulting solutions businesses - also acquired as part of its Metamor deal. The purchase had been expected to bolster PSINet's consulting service business. 

 "If we don't see a clear path to positive cash flow in a reasonable period of time as a stand-alone company, our board will consider all strategic opportunities," said William Schrader, chairman and chief executive, during a conference call with analysts. 

 UBS Warburg LLC high-yield telecommunications analyst Aryeh Bourkoff said the company might put itself up for sale. 

 "Whether that happens in the near term or in a bankruptcy situation is up to the management team," he said. "Our opinion remains that a potential strategic partner could operate the company's business model more effectively than the current management team." 

 PSINet revenue more than doubled in the third quarter, driven by growth in Web-hosting service revenues, which rose about 45 percent to $204.1 million, while consulting services revenues totalled $100.2 million. 

 In a phone interview, Chief Financial Officer Larry Hyatt said revenue from its consulting services business "was somewhat softer-than-anticipated." 

 He also said the discounting of operations and asset writedowns hurt third-quarter results. He said there is a core of the Metamor business that is crucial to PSINet for providing integrated Web services. 

 "We are narrowing our focus on our core competency, on services customers are saying that they want - to provide integrated Web solutions for businesses," Hyatt said. 

 HOSTING BUSINESS 

 PSINet posted a third-quarter net loss, including extraordinary items such as the disposal of Expedior, writedowns and restructuring charges, of $1.4 billion, or $7.34 a share, compared with a loss of $88.7 million or 68 cents a share in the year-ago period. 

 It also said capital expenditure requirements for the remainder of 2000 and 2001 have been cut by $100 million to $200 million, primarily by delaying the construction of hosting centres scheduled to open after the end of 2001. 

 "We view that (the hosting business) as one of the bright spots for future prospects," Riyad Said, analyst at Friedman Billings & Ramsey, said about PSINet's capital expenditure cuts. "That's a little disconcerting." 

 The company said it would give further guidance for future quarters after a review of its operations is completed in February. Wall Street analysts on average expected the company to post a fourth-quarter loss of $1.23 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The provision for bad debts rose to 3.3 percent from 1.6 percent of total revenue in the second quarter, reflecting the combination of customers in the Internet industry hurt by recent market conditions, PSINet said. 

 "We are seeing general caution in the entire market place for services from suppliers in the telecom and Internet sector," Schrader said.

 By Jonathan Stempel 

 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - PSINet Inc. junk bonds sank along with its stock on Thursday after the provider of Internet access and Web-hosting services stunned investors with a $1.4 billion third-quarter loss and reported cash-flow problems that have its board mulling asset sales and other "strategic alternatives." 

 It was the second profit warning in two months for Ashburn, Va.-based PSINet, which also said its cash on hand slipped to $1 billion at the end of the third quarter from $1.5 billion at the end of June. It added that Chief Operating Officer Harold (Pete) Wills resigned as part of a management reorganization. 

 "It is frustrating for investors to keep having to track the turmoil at PSINet," said Aryeh Bourkoff, high-yield telecommunications analyst at UBS Warburg LLC. 

 "The company has experienced a lot of difficulty in executing on its operating business model," he added. "Given the pricing pressures...it is difficult for (PSINet) to generate sufficient cash flow to fund operations internally." 

 Including a $504 million write-down, PSINet's third-quarter net loss mushroomed to $1.4 billion this year from $89 million in 1999. The net loss per share was $7.34. Excluding items and charges, PSINet said it posted an operating loss of $182 million, or 95 cents per share. Analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial expected a $1.28 per share loss. 

 Third-quarter revenue totalled $352.5 million, up from $140.6 million a year earlier but short of many analysts' estimates of $420 million to $430 million. 

 The company also warned that fourth-quarter results would be worse than previously expected, with company executives citing slowdowns in PSINet's Internet access business and in its consulting business. 

 PSINet's 10.5 percent notes maturing in December 2006 were bid Thursday at about 33 cents on the dollar, down 16 cents from Wednesday. PSINet sold them last Nov. 24 at 100. 

 Its shares closed on Nasdaq at at $2-15/16, down $3-51/64, or 56 percent, the biggest percentage loser in U.S. stock markets. They are down more than 97 percent on a split-adjusted basis this year. 

 Chief Executive William Schrader said in a conference call the board would consider all strategic options "if we don't see a clear path to positive cash flow as an independent company within a reasonable period of time." 

 Schrader said the company is "focused on shareholder and bondholder value." 

 "UNREALIZED POTENTIAL" 

 Bourkoff said PSInet might put itself up for sale. 

 "Whether that happens in the near term or in a bankruptcy situation is up to the management team," he said. "Our opinion remains that a potential strategic partner could operate the company's business model more effectively than the current management team." 

 Bourkoff said PSINet's bonds have "a significant amount of value even in a worst case, liquidation scenario." He said Exodus Communications Inc.'s $6.5 billion purchase in September of Global Crossing Ltd.'s Web hosting unit shows "the unrealized potential of PSINet." 

 Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service rates PSINet's senior debt "B3," its sixth highest junk grade. Another rating agency, Standard & Poor's, rates it a roughly equivalent "B-minus." 

 BIG WRITE-DOWN 

 Excluding items and charges, PSINet said it posted an operating loss of $182 million, or 95 cents per share. But it took a big write-down related to many assets it acquired through its Metamor Worldwide $1.9 billion stock deal which have failed to perform as expected. 

 PSINet said it will cut capital spending up to $200 million. Its review of strategic options includes a possible sale of some assets acquired in the Metamor deal. These include its 80 percent in electronic commerce software company Xpedior Inc., which it now classifies as a discontinued operation. It said it expects to finish its strategic review by February.

 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL / NEW ENGLAND 
 Heard in New England: Investment Pros Put Their Chips On Semiconductor-Supply Stocks

 Like many technology shares, semiconductor-equipment stocks have been gutted amid angst about a spending slowdown for electronics such as computers and wireless phones and about the overall economy. 

 Can you say: buying opportunity? 

 Some investors see the current environment for suppliers to the semiconductor industry -- many of which are in New England -- as a bargain hunter's dream. The pros argue that the industry is so cyclical that the stocks are sure to explode again at the next sign of recovery. "You buy these companies when everybody's so pessimistic," says Bernard Horn Jr., who runs Polaris Global Value Fund in Boston. "Whenever I've done that, I've done very well." 

 On the other hand, even the pros acknowledge that there could be more bad news on the way, which could knock the stocks a lot further down before they climb back up. Just recently, industry giants Intel, Motorola and Nortel Networks all reported weaker-than-expected results and slackening demand. That's signaling one of two things: either technology stocks are adjusting to significantly lower growth rates, or they're headed into an outright downturn. Right now, investors aren't sure which. So the risk is the stocks will sink deeper as more information is made public. 

 Why invest in the sector at all at this point? Some pros argue that when the stocks bounce back, they'll climb so high that it won't necessarily matter if you timed the bottom exactly right. 

 At this point, the momentum has gone completely out of the sector. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index is 45% the high it set at the beginning of the year, but many equipment suppliers have been hit even harder. Teradyne, Boston, MKS Instruments, Andover, Mass., and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Gloucester, Mass., are down about 70% or more from their recent highs. On a price-to-sales basis, some stocks are now approaching the lows set in 1998. 

 "We've taken advantage of the correction to buy" semiconductor-equipment stocks, says Peter Higgins, a portfolio manager for Boston Co. Asset Management. In addition to Teradyne, MKS and Varian, Mr. Higgins cited PRI Automation, Billerica, Mass., and Brooks Automation, Chelmsford, Mass., as companies he has bought recently or is considering. He declines to disclose the size of his holdings. 

 But he adds an important caveat: "The only issue is timing." The stocks could still go down, and the bargain you bought today could be a dog in a few weeks. 

 "I don't think all the bad news is out," says Neil Wagner, a portfolio manager at Boston mutual-fund giant Massachusetts Financial Services. Mr. Wagner says many semiconductor companies have yet to reduce capital-spending targets for 2001 to account for the recent slowdown. If and when they do that, the lower numbers could cause another rout. 

 Even more bullish investors are treading carefully. Duncan Richardson, who manages the technology-oriented Information Age Fund for Eaton Vance in Boston, says, "I would not bet the farm on this idea they've found the bottom." 

 But down the road the pros see a big payoff. Mr. Wagner has done research that suggests investors would still do well in the long run even if the stocks fall again over the next six months, as he believes they will. In past cycles, semiconductor-related stocks typically plunged several times before bottoming out. In years past, if you bought before the bottom, Mr. Wagner says, on average, the stocks still tripled in value when the cycle turned up and the market rushed back into the sector. 

 So despite his efforts to time the bottom of this current cycle, Mr. Wagner says, other investors shouldn't lose hope if they buy stocks now that drop in the next few months. "The real question isn't, are you going to make money from here?" he says. "It's, how long do you have to wait?" 

 Meanwhile, Mr. Richardson and others say the industry's long-term health is secure. Demand for the latest electronic devices isn't going to disappear. What's more, the industry is on the verge of major technological upgrades, such as moving to wider wafers that increase chip production, which will require billions of dollars of new capital spending. 

 "If you're patient enough," says Mr. Horn, "eventually the market's going to recognize these companies will grow again at some reasonable rates," just not the torrid numbers of the past 18 months. 

 He and Mr. Richardson have been selectively buying stocks -- such as Teradyne, when it hit the $25 to $27 range after warning two weeks ago that shipments for the fourth quarter would be 2% to 4% below third-quarter levels. Mr. Richardson notes the stock is trading near 1999 levels, but that now "I think the fundamentals" of Teradyne's business "are much more sound." 

 Tom Newman, vice president of corporate relations for Teradyne, says the stock valuations "don't make sense" given Teradyne's business, even under reduced forecasts. Teradyne is diversifying away from the semiconductor industry, and is seeing explosive growth testing newly built telecommunications and data networking equipment. So even with a softening in semiconductors, Teradyne is still looking at healthy growth for next year. 

 Though the company has yet to issue its own prediction for next year, Mr. Newman is comfortable with one analyst's estimate that revenue will climb 20% to $3.6 billion. Meanwhile, after the warning two weeks ago, analysts drastically cut their estimates for Teradyne profit next year by 28%. So even though the stock has ticked back to about $31 a share, Teradyne's multiple is less than 11 times the $2.95-a-share consensus estimate compiled by First Call/Thomson Financial. The recent price surge has made Teradyne a little bit more pricey for some fans. But that doesn't mean other investors have missed out on a bargain. 

 Indeed, some investors expect the continued uncertainties about technology spending to produce a series of dips in stock prices over the coming weeks. Teradyne "could still get down to $19 a share," says Mr. Horn. "At that point, you just back the truck up and buy as much as you can." 

 Among other stocks, Mr. Higgins and Scott Black, a value investor who heads Delphi Capital Management in Boston, both like Varian Semiconductor, which makes heavy-duty implantation machines and other devices for chip making. Mr. Higgins, for example, likes the stock below $20 a share. It rallied recently to $23, but even at the higher level, it's still a steal -- less than six times the $4.01 a share analysts expect for the fiscal year ending September 2001. 

 Another favorite name is MKS, which makes instruments to measure and control gases used in semiconductor and other industrial production. Even Mr. Wagner of MFS marvels at MKS's record: The company hasn't posted an annual loss in the past 30 years, a rare feat in such a cyclical business.

 Dutch Randstad's Profit Woes No Guide To Sector Weakness

 AMSTERDAM -(Dow Jones)- Dutch temporary staffing agency Randstad Holding NV (N.RND) stunned the market Wednesday with news that full-year profits were likely to be 15% off 1999 levels, although market watchers said this shouldn't be taken as a sign the whole sector is weak. 

 At 1311 GMT, Randstad shares had fallen 28% to EUR18.70. In the wake of the news Dutch peer Vedior NV (N.VDR) slid 10% to EUR15.75, and ripples even reached Switzerland's Adecco SA (ADO), down 2.3% at CHF1,214, although analysts said Adecco and Vedior aren't likely to suffer from Ranstad's woes, primarily because they operate in stronger markets. 

 "Randstad's problems are due to internal problems, problems integrating recent acquisitions," said Quirin Mulder of ING Barings. "The lesson is, this is a growth market, and companies are better off going for internal growth than trying to merge. They need to look out of the window and say: 'There! That's where the growth is."' 

 Randstad's third-quarter sales growth came in at just 7% in the fast-growing German market, where Randstad recently acquired Time Power. Sales actually declined 1% in the U.S., after having been up 7% in the second quarter. 

 The company didn't issue a separate breakdown of results for the third quarter, but its nine-month profit was EUR107.7 million, down from EUR134 million in the same period of 1999. Full-year profits in 1999 were EUR207 million. 

 Randstad wasn't immediately available for further explanation and comment on its profit warning but in a statement the company said that it plans to cut an unspecified level of overhead costs to improve future results. 

 "Randstad is restructuring and has problems that Adecco doesn't have," said Bank Sarasin Analyst Britta Simon. "Adecco (by contrast) has plenty of cash so it can open lots of new offices, and is likely to continue to grow." 

 In an interview with Dow Jones last Thursday, Adecco chief financial officer Felix Weber said the group is on track to report double-digit net profit growth before goodwill amortization for the full year. 

 Mulder of ING Barings said that Vedior has a different geographic distribution of activities than Randstad and is unlikely to suffer the same problems, as its acquisitions are further behind it. 

 "The Netherlands and the U.S. (where Randstat has a large presence) have low unemployment, and they are markets with high penetration of staffing firms," he said. "Countries like France, Germany and Italy, with higher unemployment and lower penetration, will continue to grow quite strongly." 

 He said a ballpark estimate of overall growth in 2000 in France and Italy is 20% or higher, in Germany is between 15% and 20%, and in the U.S. and Netherlands is 0% to 5%. 

 He was opportunistic about the decline in Vedior's share price: "It's wonderful if Vedior has fallen that much," he said. "A moment like this can be a nice time to buy."

 Procter & Gamble shares continue slide.

 CHICAGO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Shares of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co. fell again on Wednesday as investors continued to react negatively to a warning that already sluggish sales could be weaker than analysts expected in the fiscal second quarter. 

 The warning, issued when the company reported profits for the fiscal first quarter on Tuesday, reminded investors too much of the series of profit warnings the company had made earlier this year, money managers said. 

 Cincinatti-based Procter & Gamble's shares fell $2-7/16, or 3.41 percent, on Wednesday, closing at $69 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "I really think the fundamental circumstance is 'I can't trust you anymore'," Cummins Catherwood, managing director of money manager and brokerage firm Rutherford, Brown and Catherwood in Philadelphia, said of the flow of funds out of Procter & Gamble stock. The firm owns a small number of Procter & Gamble shares in several accounts. 

 The stock has lost about 10 percent of its value since the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. That report showed that sales grew only 1 percent in the quarter and the company said that second-quarter sales would be up slightly, while sales volume would decline. 

 Analysts said on Tuesday that the sales outlook was worse than the estimates. 

 At the same time, consumer stocks in general have declined, reversing some recent gains made as investors rotated out of technology stocks. 

 "The market, which had been interested in consumer stocks like Colgate-Palmolive and Gillette, is backing off," Fred Taylor, chief investment officer at U.S. Trust Co. in New York, said. 

 Taylor oversees $90 billion in assets, including some Procter & Gamble shares.

 NEW YORK, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Technology stocks dipped on Wednesday, shaken by sales warnings from telecom giant WorldCom Inc. and speciality chip maker Altera Corp.. 

 "Investors are looking at the fourth quarter, saying it is not going to be particularly pretty," said Stanley Nabi, vice chairman at DLJ Asset Management. 

 Blue-chips were also hurt, struggling off session lows as consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co. continued to suffer from Tuesday's profit warning and brokerage stocks slipped on negative analyst comments. 

 The technology-packed Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled more than 2 percent early in the session, popped briefly into positive territory, but then fell again. 

 By the close of the session, the Nasdaq slid 36.23 points, or 1.07 percent, at 3,333.41, on latest available figures, after notching its tenth largest percentage gain ever Tuesday. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 71.67 points, or 0.65 percent, to end at 10,899.47, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index lost 8.2 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,421. 

 WorldCom, the most actively traded issue on Nasdaq on Wednesday, fell $4-13/16, or just over 20 percent, to $18-15/16, after cutting its profit and revenue growth outlook through 2001 in the face of increased competition and higher spending. WorldCom's decline weighed on other telecom shares and sent the North America Telecom Index down 4.5 percent to 1246.97. 

 WorldCom's stock has fallen more than 55 percent this year as the one-time Wall Street darling has been hit with the same competitive pressures that have plagued its long-distance telephone rivals. 

 Long-distance and cable television heavyweight AT&T Corp. lost 5 percent, or $1-3/16, to end at $22, just above a 52-week low of $21-3/8. Local phone company SBC Communications Inc slid $1-5/8 to $56-1/16. Both stocks dragged down the blue-chip Dow index. 

 Meanwhile, Altera skidded $8-6/16 to $32-9/16, a drop of 20 percent, after saying quarter-over-quarter sales growth would land at the low end of its targeted 12 percent to 15 percent range. 

 Procter & Gamble lost $2-7/16, or 3.4 percent, to end at $69.

 AMSTERDAM, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Employment agency Randstad NV issued a profit warning on Wednesday, sending its shares plunging to their lowest level in three years. 

 The world's third-largest temp agency in terms of sales also reported first nine-month 2000 net profits of 107.7 million euros ($92.21 million) versus 134.2 million in the same period of 1999. 

 Randstad said it saw full-year net profits dropping sharply to 160-170 million euros from 207 million in 1999, due to additional investments in new offices, automation and the introduction of new products and services. 

 The results and outlook, in sharp contrast to positive results and outlook from sector peers, startled the market. 

 Shares fell 32 percent to 17.70 euros, their lowest level since April 1996, but recovered slightly, to close at 18.70 euros, down 28.2 percent in a weak midcap market, which was also pressured by shares of office products firm Buhrmann. 

 Analysts were critical of Randstad's focus on growth at the expence of profits. 

 "Randstad focused on internal affairs instead of on competition," said Erwin Kooij, sector analyst at ABN AMRO. 

 The company opened more than 100 new offices in Germany, the United States, Spain and Italy in the first half and spent heavily on IT, including its joint venture with Dutch publisher VNU, Newmonday.com. 

 "Randstad is investing in Internet applications, but when will that start paying back?" asked analyst Anne-Marie Munnik at Bank Insinger de Beaufort. 

 "I expect problems to continue in the near future." 

 EARNINGS HIT BY SLOW MARKET 

 The company forecast full-year earnings per share of 1.31-1.40 euros, a drop of 19-24 percent from last year's 1.72 euros, having previously forecast full-year earnings per share growth of over 10 percent this year. 

 "The problem we are finding is that market growth is less than expected," spokesman Maarten den Ottolander told Reuters. 

 "Normally, turnover goes up after the summer, but it did not happen this year. We don't know why," he added. 

 Growth in Germany lagged behind expectations and sales in the third quarter grew seven percent compared to 20 percent in the previous quarter. Sales in the Netherlands fell three percent in the third quarter versus a growth of one percent in the second quarter. 

 "Results are very disappointing, especially for Germany and America, where first half 2000 problems seemed to have worsened. This is due to Randstad's recent acquisitions, and integration of new companies," said Munnik. 

 Some analysts were critical of the company's strategy, noting that sector peers such as Adecco and Manpower posted positive results. 

 "Randstad invested heavily in Germany. But in Germany Randstad's employees are on the payroll. So Randstad hired people and has to pay them, but is not able to outplace them," said ABN AMRO's Kooij. 

 In the Netherlands strong economic growth has cut the demand for temp labourers as employers bring staff on the payroll. 

 The profit warning made Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on Vedior to "Neutral" from "Strong Buy", but other analysts stressed the differences between Randstad and Vedior, which posts third quarter results next week. 

 "Randstad's results are strongly related to Dutch and U.S. market developments, while Vedior is highly represented in France," said Petra Rinsma, analyst at SNS Securities, cutting SNS's rating on Randstad, a move made by several brokerages. 

 Vedior shares closed 10 percent lower at 15.80 euros. 

 COST COSTING MEASURES 

 Randstad said its board was preparing several measures, looking to cut overhead costs significantly. It said there would be no forced lay-offs, but declined to give details. 

 "We are not communicating that externally. Internal targets have been set and they are substantial," said Randstad's Den Ottolander, adding there would only be "changes in jobs". 

 The company also said it would focus on growth markets and cut costs not directly linked to market growth. 

 Analysts said it was difficult to judge if the measures would help, and would wait for an analyst call on Thursday. 

 "Randstad should actively focus on future growth markets, such as Japan, Scandinavia or Latin America, instead of chasing growth in current growth markets, where they are already positioned," ABN AMRO's Kooij said. 

 Randstad said it would continue to invest in the growth markets in Spain, Italy, Germany and Britain.

 AMSTERDAM, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Dutch shares in temporary employment agencies slid on Wednesday after sector peer Randstad issued a profit warning and posted weak nine-month results. 

 The weak temp firm shares weighed on the Dutch AEX support services index , which shed 5.9 percent by 1514 GMT. 

 Randstad dived 28 percent to 18.75 euros, while Vedior traded 10.03 percent lower. Small cap Unique fell five percent. 

 Shares in Swiss sector peer Adecco fell 2.4 percent, while U.S. Manpower traded only slightly lower. 

 Randstad said earlier on Wednesday it expected full year 2000 net profits to fall to 160-170 million euros from 207 million in 1999 due to investment in new offices, automation and the introduction of new products and services. 

 Nine-month profits fell 20 percent to 107.7 million euros. 

 Traders and analysts said sector sentiment had turned negative after the profit warning but noted the results and outlook were limited to Randstad. 

 "For Unique the slide is only temporary. The company posted strong results last week. Vedior results are uncertain, as it posts results next week," a trader said. 

 Unique said on October 20 it saw full year earnings per share up 20 percent, after it posted a rise in nine-month profits before goodwill of more than 24 percent. 

 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter on Wednesday cut its rating on Vedior to "Neutral" from "Strong Buy" after Randstad's warning. 

 But other analysts expected Vedior to post strong third quarter results next week. 

 "Randstad results are strongly related to the Dutch and U.S. market developments, while Vedior is highly represented in France," said Petra Rinsma, analyst at SNS Securities. 

 Brokerage Amstgeld, which cut its rating on Randstad to "Neutral" from "Outperformer" said it maintained its outperformer ratings on Unique and Vedior. 

 "The disappointing sales growth in the different countries in which Randstad operates is mainly the result of internal problems. Therefore, we see no reason to adjust our estimates for other staffing companies," Amstgeld said in a research note.

Equities

Major stock indices gave way yesterday after a mixed session on Wall Street, with media giant News Corp losing ground despite a solid gain of more than 2 per cent in its American Depositary Receipts in New York trading on Monday.

News Corp's ADRs were lifted by talk of Microsoft's interest in its Sky Global arm. But locals were reluctant to drive the stock further after Monday's hefty upswing of more than 4 per cent.

The media heavyweight ended yesterday 40¢ lower at $20.18.

In the broader market, the S&P/ASX 200 closed at 3254.6, down 9.8 points, and the All Ordinaries Index finished at 3203.9, down 9.1 points.

Monday's US market session reinforced the widening gap between the shattered technology sector and blue-chip shares.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 2.31 per cent, adding to last week's advance of more than 3 per cent, but the Nasdaq slid 2.65 per cent, extending the misery from its almost 6 per cent dive last week.

Deutsche Bank's senior economist, Mr Mark Jolley, said the composition of US investment would be the dominant theme this month.

"The push to defensive stocks was reflected in the strongly disparate performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq," he said.

"Basic materials, drugs and consumer stocks are doing well, as are transport and airline stocks, on hopes the OPEC output increase will lower energy prices."

Back home, the resources sector continues to bask in its old-economy status as investors shun tattered technology issues. Yesterday it put in healthy gains, with the ASX/S&P 200 resources index rallying 1.15 per cent. Rio Tinto raced ahead with a 53¢ rise to $26.48 after scoring an increase of more than 4 per cent in its London-traded issues.

BHP rose 23¢ to $18.70, MIM advanced 4¢ to $1.07 and WMC climbed 5.5¢ to $7.37.

But a clear outsider was Smorgon Steel, which sank to a record intraday low after warning on Monday that its profit for the current financial year would fall due to the slump in the housing sector.

Its shares ended down 5¢ at $1.03 after plumbing a low of 97¢.

Banks, another starring sector of late, were mixed ahead of this week's keenly awaited earnings reports from National Australia Bank and Westpac.

NAB was 14¢ lower at $26.80, Commonwealth Bank rose 12.9¢ to $28.70, Westpac was little changed at $13.17 and ANZ rose 6¢ to $14.25.

Trading in the overall market was wary after the US session and ahead of the bank results.

Investors are also cautious about the earnings outlook domestically and in the US.

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar staggered to a record low of US51.1¢ yesterday after the stockmarket closed.

The currency was fragile throughout the day, threatening the previous record low of US51.32¢. The $A's slide is keeping offshore investors shy of the Australian market.

"This played a key role in supporting the resource sector despite a weakening commodity price outlook," said ABN Amro strategist Mr Glen Mumford of the $A's losses in the past week.

Mr Mumford's sector recommendations this week include adding to bank and insurance holdings, with CBA and QBE the top picks.

Telstra is seen as a good buy, as is Woolworths, which is termed "cheap". In resources, BHP and Newcrest head the buyer's list.

Telstra gained 8.6¢ to $6.30 and Woolworths put on 3.6¢ to $7.68.

Insurance stock HIH extended its woeful performance, shedding 1¢ to 30.5¢.

The stock lost a whopping 36.5 per cent over October, one of the 10 worst performers that month. The tech sector was 1.4 per cent lower yesterday.

On a similar note, favourite tech punching bag Solution 6 was down 4¢ to 97¢ after sinking as low as 84¢, 95 per cent off its $18.35 intraday high struck in December last year.

But as fretting about the slowing US economy eats into earnings expectations, local economic data yesterday pointed to decent growth in the September quarter, albeit at a gentler pace than economists had expected.

Retail trade data due on Thursday will provide further insight into third-quarter growth.

The trade balance hit a higher than expected surplus of $677 million in September, the first surplus since November 1997.

The move into the black was largely Olympics-related, but even without that one-off effect, economists said the underlying trend was improving.

"Together with [yesterday's] September credit data, the implication is that the economy retains a fair amount of momentum at present," said Mr Michael Blythe, the chief research economist at Commonwealth Bank.

"But the risks which had favoured an acceleration in growth now look more evenly balanced."

Private-sector credit rose 0.6 per cent in September after August's 1.1 per cent increase.

MIM and Telstra were among the most heavily traded shares yesterday. Of a total 1,336 shares traded, declining stocks outpaced advancers by 531 to 493, and 312 stocks were unchanged.

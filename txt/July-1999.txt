 MONTREAL, July 29 (Reuters) - Shares of Teleglobe Inc. , the fourth-largest U.S. long-distance telecommunications provider, lost about one-quarter of their value on Thursday on a profit warning it issued after markets closed on Wednesday. 

 Teleglobe shares plunged C$10.60 at C$31.75 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on a brisk volume of more than 1.4 million shares. On the New York Stock exchange they were down $5.56 to $22.25 after opening at a day's low of $21. The decline came after the company's announcement on Wednesday that it expected second-quarter net income of 10 cents a share instead of the 15 cents a share forecast earlier. 

 "It was reasonable to expect the stock to trade down," Glen Campbell, analyst at Merrill Lynch. 

 Citing continued price pressure in the North American wholesale long-distance market and losses on the conversion of foreign currencies, Montreal-based Teleglobe on Wednesday also lowered its outlook for net income for the year to 70 to 80 cents a share, instead of the $1 a share predicted earlier. 

 "We also are looking at a sequential decline in revenues in their core business. The wholesale voice business had been ticking along quite nicely, now pricing pressure has caused some trouble there," Campbell added. 

 In a conference call early on Wednesday evening, Teleglobe Chief Financial Officer Claude Seguin said the company is rearranging routing arrangements to lower costs at the end points of certain long-distance telephone call routes.

 * Toronto stocks slumped under the pressure of unexpectedly 

 strong U.S. employment data released on Thursday, even as the 

 gold sector surged more than 4 percent.* 105.5 million shares 

 traded worth C$1.9 billion. 

 TORONTO, July 29 (Reuters) - Toronto stocks slumped under the pressure of unexpectedly strong U.S. employment data released on Thursday, even as the gold sector surged more than 4 percent. 

 The U.S. Employment Cost Index, a broad measure of costs associated with labour, including wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, its biggest increase in eight years. 

 The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index swooned as a result, dropping 60.86 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7050.33 points at the close with 105.5 million shares worth C$1.9 billion traded. Decliners outstripped advancers 573 to 390 with another 286 issues unchanged. 

 The blue-chip S&P/TSE 60 index ended 4.09 points, or 0.98 percent, lower at 412.55. 

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York fell 180.78 points, or 1.65 percent, at 10,791.29 while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite was down 65.83 points, or 2.4 percent, at 2640.01. 

 The increase in the Employment Cost Index has fuelled fears the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates for a second time this summer, following last month's quarter percent hike, to combat inflation. 

 "That's the number that (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan has cited time and time again as being a number they watch closely for indications of building inflationary pressure," said Rick Hutcheon, president of CentrePost Mutual Funds. "Given that it was a much stronger number than people had expected, it tips the odds a little more in favour of Greenspan acting at the August meeting and I think that's got people a little bit spooked." 

 Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of only 0.8 percent, compared with the rise of 0.4 in the first quarter. 

 Analysts said a fall in the value of the U.S. dollar was also hurting North American markets. 

 Overall, 11 of the TSE 300's 14 subindexes closed lower led by a 2.08 percent drop in the utilities sector. That group was hurt both by the fear of interest rates and the dismal fortunes of long-distance provider Teleglobe Inc . 

 Teleglobe shares lost about a quarter of their value on Thursday following a profit warning issued by the company late on Wednesday, plummeting C$9.35 to end at C$32.75. 

 Nine other sectors lost more than 1 percent on the day. 

 In the industrial products group, down 0.74 percent, heavyweight Nortel Networks  declared a one-for-one stock dividend for its shareholders, in effect providing a two-for-one stock split after the market's closed on Thursday. 

 Gold shone brightly among Toronto's subindexes, surging more than 4 percent at the close, as investors bought mining issues to hedge against the U.S. currency decline. 

 "The gold sector obviously made a contribution to the softening of the drop here," said Fred Ketchen, director of equity trading at ScotiaMcLeod Inc. 

 "But is this the end of the bull market? Good grief, no. Any market doesn't go straight up, trees don't go straight to heaven, they bend in the wind sometimes. Today was a little bit of a breeze." 

 In New York, COMEX December gold rose $2.90 to $259.70 for an ounce. 

 The oil and gas and merchandising groups capped off the gainers on the TSE.

 (All amounts in U.S. dollars unless noted) 

 MONTREAL, July 29 (Reuters) - Shares of Teleglobe Inc. , which owns the world's third-largest international telecommunications network, lost about a quarter of their value on Thursday following a profit warning issued by the company after markets closed on Wednesday. 

 Teleglobe shares plunged C$9.40 at C$32.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on a brisk volume of almost 5 million shares. The stock dipped to C$31.75 early in the trading session. On the New York Stock Exchange they were down $6 to $21.81 after opening at a day's low of $21. 

 The decline came after the company's announcement on Wednesday that it expected net income for the second quarter and full year to fall short of expectations because of pricing pressures in the wholesale long-distance telecom market. 

 "It was reasonable to expect the stock to trade down," said Glen Campbell, analyst at Merrill Lynch. 

 Citing continued price pressure in the North American wholesale long-distance market and losses on the conversion of foreign currencies, Montreal-based Teleglobe on Wednesday lowered its outlook for second-quarter net income to 10 cents a share from the 15 cents forecast earlier this year. 

 Teleglobe also said it was lowering its forecast net income for the year to 70 to 80 cents a share, instead of the $1 a share predicted earlier. 

 Analysts said the markets were reacting to indications that Teleglobe is facing stiff pricing competition in its core business - wholesale long distance telecom services - especially in the U.S. market. 

 "We also are looking at a sequential decline in revenues in their core business. The wholesale voice business had been ticking along quite nicely, now pricing pressure has caused some trouble there," Campbell said. 

 Through its Teleglobe Communications Corp. (TCC) division, the company owns and operates a far-reaching web of satellites and submarine cables that make it the world's third-largest international telecom network. TCC also has licenses to sell or resell facility-based telecom services in 26 countries. 

 Lehman Brothers analyst Dan Fletcher said Teleglobe's "near-term earnings visibility remains very cloudy," in part because of the tougher wholesale market. 

 "The numbers have come down a good deal since the beginning of the year and there needs to be a credible case for a turnaround in those earnings for the stock to perform in the medium term," he said. 

 In a conference call with analysts early on Wednesday evening, Teleglobe Chief Financial Officer Claude Seguin said the company is rearranging routing arrangements to lower costs at the end points of certain long-distance telephone call routes. 

 "We were able to replace some of the destinations with other destinations that were not under the same pricing pressure," he said. 

 Since Teleglobe's $7 billion takeover and merger with Dallas-based Excel Communications Inc. group last year, analysts have been focusing of the company's efforts to reorganize and turn around that business. 

 Excel uses a technique called "networking marketing " to sell long-distance services to retail customers in the United States and Canada. Its sales force consists of a large network of independent representatives, many of whom work out of their homes. 

 Excel's revenues and profits dropped quickly after the merger as the company had trouble retaining both customers and independent sales representatives. But during the conference call, Teleglobe said it is seeing a rebound in margins at Excel. 

 Seguin told analysts he expects Excel to post a second-quarter pretax operating income similar to the $30 million recorded in its most recent first quarter.

 PITTSBURGH, July 29 (Reuters) - Respironics Inc. reported on Thursday a 69 percent decrease in fiscal fourth-quarter net income and said it would close several facilities as part of its previously-announced restructuring plan. 

 The maker of respiratory medical devices said net income in the quarter fell to $1.1 million, or 4 cents per diluted share, from $3.6 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier. 

 In the quarter, the company took a restructuring charge of $2.4 million, or 4 cents a share, and said an additional $22.6 million in charges would be recorded over the next several quarters. 

 Earlier this month Respironics said it expected pre-tax charges of $30 million spread over the fourth and subsequent quarters. 

 The fourth quarter also included charges related to the company's merger with Healthdyne Technologies Inc. 

 Shares of Respironics closed Wednesday at $10.875, down 19 cents on the day. The stock's year low is $9.625. 

 The restructuring, which includes a 10 percent cut in a worldwide workforce of 2,000, is aimed at putting more focus on research and development, reducing costs, and streamlining product lines. 

 Under the realignment of its business, spelled out in the earnings release, Respironics said it would close its Westminster, Colo., manufacturing facility and its 19 customer-satisfaction centres in the United States. Its Marietta, Ga., manufacturing facility will be downsized. 

 In addition, Respironics named Craig Reynolds as chief operating officer. He will be in charge of four major operating divisions - homecare, hospital, asthma/allergy and international. 

 "I believe we will emerge from this challenge stronger than ever and more determined to excel for our shareholders," Dennis Meteny, Respironics chief executive, said in a statement. 

 On an operating basis, excluding all special charges and gains, Respironics said it earned 18 cents per share in the fourth quarter, up from 17 cents a year earlier. 

 The results matched the consensus estimate of analysts polled by First Call Corp. 

 Analysts originally expected earnings of 28 cents a share, but they cut their estimates after the company issued a profit warning when it announced its restructuring on July 6. At that time, Meteny said a number of factors, including cost containment initiatives in both domestic and international health care markets, had put "significant pressure" on Respironics's traditional rate of sales growth. 

 Respironics said sales rose 6 percent in the fourth quarter, to $90.1 million from $85.2 million a year earlier. ((-Laney Salisbury, Health Desk 212-859-1631)).

 Fleetwood Posts Record First Quarter Sales, Reiterates  Profit Warning

 RIVERSIDE, Calif., July 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: FLE), the nation's largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles and a leading producer and retailer of manufactured housing, today announced record sales for the quarter ended July 25, 1999.  At the same time, the Company reiterated its belief that first quarter earnings would not compare favorably with prior year results. 

 Preliminary sales for the first quarter reached $955 million, a 14 percent increase over last year's $840.2 million.  The Company attributed the revenue gain to continuing strong sales growth in its recreational vehicle segment and the addition of retail sales from its recently formed manufactured housing retail business. 

 Healthy demand for the Company's motor home products drove recreational vehicle revenues up 13 percent to approximately $484 million in the July quarter compared to $428.8 million a year earlier.  Motor home revenues reached a first quarter record, rising 18 percent to $306 million.  This reflects excellent sales growth for both Class A and Class C product types. Both of the Company's towable divisions also achieved record sales for the first quarter.  Travel trailer sales rose six percent to $148 million and folding trailers rose less than one percent to $30 million. 

 President Nelson W. Potter commented on the RV sales gains saying, "All of our RV divisions performed very well this quarter, but motor homes were particularly strong.  This reflects the popularity of our full-size Class A models and our success in securing a large portion of the Class C rental market.  RV market conditions continue to be excellent, driven by the healthy economy and a high level of consumer confidence.  We are entering the second quarter with a strong sales order backlog," Potter said. 

 Manufactured housing sales in the first quarter increased 15 percent to approximately $460 million compared to $400.8 million a year ago.  Housing revenues include net sales of $304 million from manufacturing operations and $156 million from the Company's retail business, which was just commencing operation a year ago.  Retail sales in last year's first quarter were only $1.9 million.  Gross manufacturing operations, including intercompany sales of $81 million to Company-owned retail stores, totaled $385 million in the first quarter, four percent below last year's sales. 

 Potter said, "Significant industry growth in recent years has encouraged the rapid development of retail distribution points, and this has driven up inventories across the country to historically high levels.  The retail inventory imbalance has resulted in a softening of wholesale factory shipments in recent months.  This notwithstanding, the overall industry dynamics remain positive.  The factors that drive the business, such as a healthy economy, strong consumer confidence and financing availability at moderate interest rates, continue to be favorable.  We remain optimistic about the longer term prospects for the industry," Potter concluded. 

 Fleetwood's supply operations contributed estimated revenues of $11 million for the first quarter compared to $10.6 million last year. 

 Final sales and earnings for the July quarter will be reported by the Company in about four weeks.  Regarding earnings expectations, Potter said, "We stated in our May 26 fourth quarter earnings announcement that it was highly unlikely that we could achieve first quarter results that would compare favorably with the prior year.  We now expect that weakening demand in our key manufactured housing markets and tighter housing margins will lead to a 20 to 30 percent decline in first quarter earnings versus last year's strong quarter.  Earnings pressure is likely to continue until the current industry inventory imbalance is resolved," Potter concluded. 

 This press release contains certain forward-looking statements and information based on the beliefs of the Company's management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, the Company's management.  Such statements reflect the current views of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including risk factors identified in the Company's SEC filings.

 Pacificare Health's 2nd-Quarter Earnings Rose 41% On Steady Growth

 (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Pacificare Health Systems Inc. said Wednesday that second-quarter net income rose nearly 41%, generally in line with analysts' estimates. 

 The Santa Ana, Calif.-based managed-care concern reported net income of $68.9 million, or $1.49 a diluted share. In the year-ago second quarter, the company earned $48.9 million, or $1.06 a share, after payment of preferred dividends of $2.6 million. 

 The mean estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by First Call was for earnings of $1.48 a share in the latest second quarter. 

 Revenue rose 2% to $2.45 billion. 

 Pacificare (PHSY) shares shot higher on the news. At the close, the Nasdaq-listed shares were up $6.063, or 9.8%, at $68.125. 

 Pacificare's medical-care ratio, or total health-care costs as a percentage of premium revenue, fell slightly to 85.0% from 85.1% in the year-ago period, as lower costs from its commercial plans outweighed higher costs connected to its Medicare and Medicaid plans. 

 Pacificare said it expects per-share earnings to continue to grow at the rate of 40% to 45% during the second half, compared with the year-ago period. 

 The mean estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by First Call is for 1999 earnings of $6.14 a share. In 1998, the company earned $202.4 million, or $4.50 share, on revenue of $9.52 billion. 

 Pacificare, the largest Medicare health-maintenance organization, said it expects its Medicare membership to grow 1% to 3% for 1999, and commercial membership to grow 1% to 2%. 

 Membership as of June 30 was 2% below that of a year ago after the company sold its Utah Health Maintenance Organization plan. 

 Analysts covering the company appeared upbeat about the figures. 

 "The quarter is as good as can be expected given the tough environment they are in," said Peter Costa, an analyst at ABN AMRO Inc., referring to the havoc that dwindling Medicare reimbursements have been playing on the managed-care industry. 

 Analysts said the numbers were in line with revised estimates Pacificare released last month when it warned the Street that estimates were too high. The company lowered its estimates to between $1.45 a share and $1.50 a share. 

 At the time, Pacificare's caution left some wondering whether it was simply being cautious in preventing market overexuberance or issuing a profit warning. As a result, the stock price - which hit a high of over $100 a share in early May - fell over the course of several days. 

 Pacificare's profit warning came as a surprise to many, since the company had been touting its growth prospects. 

 "Look at what the company reported last year," said Bank of America Securities LLC analyst Todd Richter. "Here is a company that reported earnings that were up 40% year-over-year. I think the concerns people had was that the company was talking very optimistically and people's estimates got up." 

 But analysts warned that given Pacificare's huge position in Medicare - the company derives 60% of its business from Medicare - serious questions remain to be answered about federal regulatory issues. 

 "It is not an easy company to get your hands around," Richter said. "What earnings are at a moment in time are only part of what people should look at." 

 Pacificare has largely escaped the negative effects of dwindling Medicare reimbursements, a problem that has ravaged the medical services and managed-care industries. But its solution has been to shift financial risk to the doctors by paying set fees per patients, a process known as capitation. 

 But the company could become vulnerable if doctors are successful in demanding higher rates from the company, analysts said. 

 Pacificare said it has studied the Medicare-reimbursement issue to define methods for maintaining adequate profit margins. As a result, nearly all Medicare members will see some combination of member-paid premium increases, increased co-payments or reductions in benefits. 

 But with costs far outpacing increases in reimbursement for Medicare - which covers the nation's elderly - analysts said questions still loom as to how long Pacificare can remain profitable. 

 "They are doing an amazing job considering they are 60% in Medicare," said Joseph France, analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. 

 "Still, you can charge these extra premiums and reduce benefits, but it eventually becomes hard to maintain profitability if repayments continue to be inadequate," he added.

 Analysts Bullish On Danka Spark A Run-Up In Its Shares

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Just five months after laying the groundwork for its cost restructuring program, Danka Business Systems PLC is seen surging ahead by analysts. Investors on Monday agreed, pushing the company's U.S.-listed shares up 15%. 

 Danka's Nasdaq Stock Market-traded American depositary receipts (DANKY) rose $1.344, or 16%, to end at $9.969 on volume of 3.44 million shares, more than three times the average daily volume of 945,000. 

 Danka, a supplier of office-imaging equipment, has "turned a corner and should experience dramatic improvement through fiscal 2000 and beyond," said a Prudential Securities research note. Just last November, a Prudential analyst had remarked that the company might need to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 

 According to Prudential analyst B. Alex Henderson, who reiterated a "strong buy" rating for Danka, cost savings from restructuring and the rollout of digital products are driving the bullish attitude. 

 Brian Merriman, Danka's president and chief operating officer, said the company has reoriented its product line to embrace the digital environment in office equipment while maintaining its analog-copier business. 

 "Our digital business is up quarter over quarter," said Merriman. Although the analog-copier business comprises "a huge part" of Danka's business, as the company restructures, "the emphasis has to be (placed on) digital because that is where the business is heading." 

 The company, which has headquarters in both St. Petersburg and London, has agreements with Canon Inc. (CANNY), Toshiba Corp., both of Japan, and German manufacturer Heidelberg Digital LLC. Danka Business recently began shipments of the Kodak Digisource 9110 network imaging system, a high-volume digital product that is assembled by Heidelberg Digital. 

 Merriman said Heidelberg's system will enable Danka to compete with Xerox Corp. (XRX) in an arena "where we haven't been a player before." 

 He added the agreements with Canon and Toshiba allow Danka to go after and secure the "largest accounts in the U.S." 

 Danka expects earnings for its first quarter ended June 30 to be substantially more than the nine cents an ADR it earned a year ago. Merriman said he couldn't comment on the upcoming results because the company is "in a quiet period." 

 Merriman said his company intends to increase its sales force to 1,300 from 1,100. Factoring in the cost-cutting plans, digital-product focus, amended credit agreements and increased sales force, Henderson thinks the first quarter "is just the start for multiquarter improvement, which will ultimately lead to significantly higher earnings." 

 However, Prudential's Henderson thinks that when Danka posts its first-quarter results during the first week of August, the "stock is going to get a pop." Henderson added, "now is the time to step up to the plate on these shares." 

 In a research note, Prudential estimated Danka to report earnings per share of nine cents. This "overly conservative" figure, the research note said, is based upon Danka's management assessment that "sales should come in around $630 million; selling, general and administrative expenses around 30% of revenues; and a 30% tax rate." 

 Cost savings from Danka's restructuring initiatives are expected to contribute to first-quarter results. Henderson said these cost savings are "creating a positive variance." 

 Prior to implementing the initiatives, Danka was losing about 30 cents to 55 cents an ADR depending on the quarter, said Henderson. In addressing the cost structure, Henderson said Danka had to adopt an aggressive strategy. 

 In February, Danka said it expects to generate about $100 million in savings after fully implementing its world-wide cost-reduction program. As part of this program, Danka would reduce its work force by 1,400 positions by 2000; close and consolidate some facilities; eliminate certain advertising and information technology projects; and reduce discretionary spending. Certain initiatives began in the third quarter. 

 These cuts were "across the board, and were well delineated in bank plans," added Merriman. The cost-cutting plan paved the way for amendments to existing credit agreements with the lenders, and provided a "comfort level" for additional financing. 

 Earlier this month, Danka's lenders agreed to extend Danka's credit agreement through July 31, 2000, committing $995.6 million, and allowing the company to borrow up to $40 million to finance the purchase of high-volume digital copiers. 

 The credit pact effectively expired late last month with the collapse of Danka's deal to sell its outsourcing division to Schroder Ventures International Investment Trust PLC. Danka had planned to sell the business to Schroder for $300 million and to use most of the proceeds to reduce bank debt and for working capital. When the deal fell through in late June, Danka said the credit agreement wouldn't be effective, since it depended on the sale of the division, but added that it would continue discussions with lenders. 

 Several weeks ago, Danka made good on a warning that it would post a fiscal fourth-quarter loss and a sharp decline in revenue. For the period ended March 31, the company posted a net loss of $12.4 million, or 22 cents per American depositary share, compared with profit of $14.4 million, or 25 cents an ADR, in the year-earlier period. Revenue dropped nearly 20%, to $674.1 million, from $839.7 million. 

 Danka, a supplier of photocopiers, fax machines and related automated office equipment, also provides customer-related support services, maintenance and supply contracts, training and technical support. The company Danka bought Kodak Office Imaging in 1996, but has had trouble integrating the business. Danka said last November that it might have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 

 On June 18, Danka announced an agreement to sell its Omnifax facsimile division to Xerox Corp. for $45 million cash, ending weeks of speculation about steps the troubled company might take to lighten its debt load.

 Quantum Delivers Promised Poor Q1 Results.

 Quantum Corp, The Milpitas, California-based provider of data storage products, has reported first-quarter net income up 175% at $8.3m on revenue down 1.8% at $1.08bn. Earnings per share for the quarter amounted to $0.05 per share, when analysts surveyed by First Call were looking for $0.10. The poor earnings fell at the bottom of the range that Quantum set out when it issued a profit warning last month. Before the warning, analysts had been expecting earnings of $0.31. 

 The company blamed the shortfall on overall pricing pressure in the desktop hard disk drive market, with the sequential rate of price decline roughly double that of the prior two quarters. Although Quantum insists demand for both PC hard drives and high- end tape drive remains strong, the boom in low-cost machines and aggressive price cuts by rival Seagate Technology Inc have hit the company hard. 

 For the quarter, hard disk drive revenue was $752m on unit shipments of 6.6 million, down from $847m on shipments of 5.6 million in the year-ago period. The business reported a net loss of $43m. The DLT and storage systems group, meanwhile booked revenue up 29% year-over-year at $331m and net income up 18% at $51m. Gross margin for the business was 46%. 

 Quantum's two main businesses, hard drives and tape storage systems, may soon be separated, as shareholders are set to vote today on a plan to create individual tracking stocks. Assuming the approval of such a plan, pro forma earnings per share for the DLT and storage systems group would have been $0.30 for the first quarter.

 Air Products third quarter hurt by lower equipment sales.

 ALLENTOWN, Pa., July 23 (Reuters) - Air Products and Chemicals Inc., one of the world's top industrial gas suppliers, said reduced sales of cryogenic and other process equipment trimmed profits in the third quarter. 

 It added that it expected the situation to improve in the months ahead. 

 Net income from operations declined to $104 million, or 48 cents per diluted share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $123 million, or 56 cents per share, in last year's third quarter. Special items made the swing in net income greater as a charge for cost reduction efforts reduced earnings in the latest quarter $9 million, or 4 cents per share, while a gain on a restructured power contract added $15.4 million, or 7 cents a share, a year ago. 

 Sales rose 1 percent to $1.24 billion on flat industrial gas sales and a 6 percent increase in chemicals sales. 

 Chemical operating profit declined as several businesses experienced margin pressure, the company said, reiterating last Friday's profit warning that third quarter earnings would trail expectations. 

 "We fully expect next quarter's results to improve sequentially," said Harold Wagner, chief executive. 

 "This year we weathered an expected decline in our equipment business from record performance last year. We have endured difficult times in key markets and operating problems and outages from some large customers." he noted. 

 "As we enter the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by signs of recovery," he concluded. ((-New York Equity News 212 859-1700, or nyc.equities.newsroom@reuter.com)).

 Earnings Fall at SmithKline, American Home Products --- But Johnson & Johnson's Net Exceeds Forecasts

 American Home Products Corp. and SmithKline Beecham PLC posted lower second-quarter earnings due to special charges, but Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected results on strong sales of drugs for anemia and schizophrenia. 

 American Home Products of New Jersey said its net income dropped 24% to $398.7 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, from $523.5 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. In a surprise development, the company also announced a charge of $53 million, or four cents a diluted share, related to the suspension of shipments of its rotavirus vaccine RotaShield. 

 The charge will cover the costs of returns and inventory in the event the product isn't returned to the market, the company said. 

 Last week, American Home Products said it would temporarily suspend shipments of the vaccine, following reports that 20 babies who were immunized with it developed bowel obstructions. Although all the infants recovered, 12 required surgery to fix the problem. Also last week, the U.S. federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that doctors stop giving the vaccine to infants until studies indicate whether it caused the bowel problems; these studies are likely to be completed in three or four months. 

 Because of the charge, American Home Products' net income came in four cents below analysts' expectations of 34 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. But even excluding the charge, net income declined 14% to $451.7 million, or 34 cents a share. 

 American Home Products' sales declined 1% to $3.32 billion from $3.34 billion a year earlier. The weakness reflected in part poor results in company's agricultural unit, which sells pesticides and herbicides. Sales of agricultural products fell 29% to $576.1 million. The company issued a profit warning early in the second quarter, saying that a weakness in the agricultural business would hold down overall profits, and stating that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the agricultural unit. 

 Although the company hasn't said what it plans to do, most analysts expect the company to try to sell the unit. "It is definitely a disappointing quarter for American Home," said David Saks, an analyst at Gruntal & Co. "Everyone is looking at American Home to be an underachiever this year" because of the problems in the agricultural unit and the lack of rapidly growing new drugs. 

 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading late morning on Tuesday, American Home Products shares rose $1.94 to $52.125, while Johnson & Johnson shares fell 50 cents to $95.94 and SmithKline Beecham's American depositary shares fell 56 cents to $60.812 a share. 

 Johnson & Johnson, also of New Jersey, reported better-than-expected profits due to robust sales of prescription drugs and medical devices. Net income increased 15% to $1.16 billion, or 84 cents a diluted share, from $1.01 billion, or 74 cents a share. The per-share increase was two cents above analysts' expectations, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The results reflected higher sales in all three of the company's major business segments. Overall, sales increased 19% to $6.85 billion from $5.78 billion. Revenue from the company's recently acquired DePuy unit, which makes orthopedic products, added about four percentage points to overall sales growth. 

 "It is the first time in several years that the drug (division) was bolstered by consumer and medical products," said Mr. Saks at Gruntal. "The biggest products had a phenomenal quarter." 

 Drug sales increased 25% to $2.71 billion, as several of the company's blockbuster drugs did very well. Sales of Procrit for anemia increased almost 54%, while sales of Risperdal for schizophrenia increased almost 37%, according to the company. 

 Moreover, the company's professional unit, which has struggled much of last year, rebounded strongly, with sales increasing 20% to $2.46 billion. The company said that sales increased even at the company's Cordis unit, which makes cardiac stents. In late 1997 and 1998, Johnson & Johnson lost most of its stent market share to competitors. 

 Johnson & Johnson also said it reached an agreement with Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. to co-market Pharmacia's experimental antidepressant drug Vestra in the U.S. Vestra is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Specifics of the deal weren't disclosed. 

 SmithKline Beecham posted a 3% decline in second-quarter pretax profit, reflecting one-time restructuring charges. But the London-based drug maker remained upbeat about prospects for continued buoyant sales growth, fueled by its new diabetes medicine Avandia. 

 SmithKline said group pretax profit slipped during the second quarter to GBP 350 million ($549.5 million) from GBP 362 million a year earlier -- despite an 11% increase in sales, to GBP 2.16 billion. Excluding a GBP 68 million one-time charge stemming from a trans-Atlantic cost-cutting blitz, profit before tax was up 15% during the second quarter, the company said. 

 SmithKline's flagship pharmaceutical division was the star performer during the latest quarter -- boosting operating profit by 16% to GBP 330 million. The division's sales climbed 19%, to GBP 1.3 billion. At the smaller consumer-health division, operating profit rose 5% to GBP 91 million, on a 2% rise in sales to GBP 601 million. 

 The drug division's second-quarter growth benefited from an inventory build-up by U.S. drug wholesalers ahead of price increases last month. Sales also were buoyed by initial wholesaler stocking of Avandia, which was approved by the FDA in late May and made its market debut almost immediately. Avandia sales during the second quarter totaled GBP 44 million, SmithKline said.

 In Profit Tailwind, Airline Stocks Rally

 The surprisingly strong profits reported earlier this week by several big U.S. airlines gave way on Wednesday to disappointing quarterly results at four other carriers, reflecting continuing softness in revenue. 

 Without hefty one-time gains from sales of shares in a computer-reservations system, results at UAL Corp. and US Airways Group Inc. would have been down. Both carriers issued profit warnings last month, blaming weaker revenue among other difficulties. AMR Corp., grappling with stormy weather and air-traffic control delays, posted a 35% decline in net, and Trans World Airlines, suffering from labor instability, posted a wider-than-expected loss. 

 Wall Street took the news in stride, however, bidding up most airline shares. UAL rose to $64.0625 (61.59 euros), up $1.5625 in New York Stock Exchange trading, while US Air closed down 50 cents at $40 and AMR rose 18.75 cents to $69.6875. Also on the Big Board, Delta Air Lines gained $1.50 to close at $63.125 and Continental Airlines added $2.0625 to end at $44.0625. Northwest Airlines rose 93.75 cents to $34.8125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 

 "It was a relief rally," said Glenn Engel of Goldman Sachs & Co. While profit declined 17% in aggregate for the 10 largest carriers, investors had feared the decline would be worse, he said. Moreover, June domestic revenue rose 4% and revenue per available seat-mile fell only 1% compared with 3% declines in April and May, Mr. Engel said. 

 UAL, parent of United Airlines, said it earned $669 million, or $5.78 a diluted share, including an after-tax gain of $428 million gain, or $3.88 a share, on a sale of a portion of its stake in Galileo International Inc. A year earlier, United earned $282 million, or $2.44 a share. Revenue rose 2.2% to $4.54 billion. 

 Because Chicago-based UAL is majority owned by employees, the company prefers to report its results on a fully distributed basis. That measure assumes all the shares to be allocated to workers by the year 2000 already have been released, and thus excludes that compensation expense. 

 By that measure, the largest airline in the U.S. earned $761 million, or $6.27 a fully distributed share. Without the gain, the carrier would have reported profit of $349 million, or $2.86 a fully distributed share, compared with $418 million, or $3.24 a fully distributed share a year earlier. After the profit warning, analysts had marked down their expectations to a First Call consensus of $2.66 a fully distributed share for the quarter. 

 Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said previously disclosed problems with a new yield-management system in April are now solved, but cost the carrier $23 million in revenue in the quarter. Overall revenue per available seat-mile was down 1% in the quarter, with an 11% decline in Atlantic routes. But Mr. Dutta said Pacific revenue was flat -- a good sign in itself -- and revenue at the carrier's low-fare Shuttle by United division was up 9%. 

 AMR, parent of No. 2 carrier American Airlines, said its earnings fell 35% to $268 million, or $1.70 a diluted share, from $409 million, or $2.30 a diluted share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 1.8% to $5 billion from $4.9 billion, with most of the increase coming from its Sabre Group Holdings Inc. technology subsidiary.

 J Sainsbury Loses 

 Ground to Rivals 

 As Sales Fall 1.9% 

 LONDON -- J Sainsbury PLC provided the latest indication that it is continuing to lag behind its rivals in the fiercely competitive U.K. supermarkets sector. 

 In a first-quarter trading update, the grocer said like-for-like sales in its core U.K. supermarkets chain fell 1.9% from a year earlier, as rivals such as Tesco PLC and Asda Group PLC made further inroads into its dwindling market share. 

 However, Chief Executive Dino Adriano said he was confident that recent price cuts, expanded product ranges and cost-saving measures would increase sales by early next year. 

 Mr. Adriano also unveiled plans to open new sources of revenue in the areas of convenience shops and banking services. 

 Sainsbury said that after successful trials of its Sainsbury's Local format at three pilot stores in London and the South East, it plans to open 200 convenience stores over the next three years, creating around 10,000 new jobs. 

 Sainsbury said it also plans to step up product development and marketing efforts at Sainsbury's Bank with the aim of making the business "a significant contributor" to group profit over the next three to four years. 

 Losses Continue at British Steel 

 LONDON -- British Steel PLC continues to incur losses due to the impact of the strength of sterling, particularly against the euro, Chairman Sir Brian Moffat told the annual shareholders meeting. 

 Sir Brian said steel demand is generally firm around the world, with some Asian economies now showing encouraging signs of recovery from the low point of early 1999. He said the company is continuing to pursue cost and efficiency improvements and expects to derive further significant benefits from this. 

 Sir Brian also updated shareholders on the proposed merger with Koninklijke Hoogovens, the steel and aluminum producer based in the Netherlands. He said the company plans to circulate documentation for shareholder approval in early August, with completion anticipated in early October. 

 Coats Viyella's Trading Results Fall 

 LONDON -- U.K. textiles manufacturer Coats Viyella PLC said overall trading results in the year's first half will be below those of 1998. 

 The group said the poor market conditions that affected the second half of 1998 have continued into the first half of 1999. "The U.K. high street has seen weak demand and aggressive competition. This contrasts with the first quarter of last year, which was a period of relatively buoyant demand in most of our markets," the company said. 

 The group said cash management remains strong and the group has benefited from the cash proceeds and exceptional profit from the sale of the precision engineering division, which was completed in April. 

 "The Coats businesses have suffered from weak demand in most thread markets, although conditions have improved lately," the company said. 

 The group said the Viyella businesses, despite operating in an adverse trading climate, have begun to show the benefit of radical management action. 

 Unigate Issues Profit Warning

 LONDON -- U.K. foods group Unigate PLC warned that its first-half profit will decline from a year earlier due to difficult trading conditions. 

 Unigate said trading conditions remain challenging and consequently some of its food businesses have had a difficult start to the current year, with overall profits well below last year's levels. 

 The company said the conditions were particularly noticeable at its Malton business, which continues to experience margin pressure, and its St. Ivel unit where volumes have been constrained. 

 In response to the difficult trading conditions, Unigate said it has embarked on a wide range of cost reduction and other initiatives to improve the underlying performance of our food businesses. 

 "In the light of these steps, we expect to see the current year as a year of two halves," Unigate said. "First-half profits will be lower. Performance in the second half on the other hand should show solid progress but it is too early to say whether the first half shortfall will be recovered by year-end." 

 Remy Cointreau's Revenue Rises 

 PARIS -- French drinks group Remy Cointreau SA reported a 12% rise in revenue to 1.44 billion French francs (219.5 million euros) from 1.29 billion francs for the quarter ended June 30. 

 The company said champagne sales saw record growth of 45% to 253.9 million francs from 175.2 million francs a year earlier, on the back of bumper sales for the Charles Heidsieck Brut Reserve Mis en Cave and Piper-Heidsieck brands. 

 Remy Cointreau also noted continued recovery in cognac sales for the quarter, up 14% at 377.2 million francs from 330 million francs a year earlier. The company attributed the rise to higher sales in the U.S., Taiwan and South Korea. 

 Briefly: 

 -- French car-parts maker Compagnie Plastic Omnium SA said that its revenues for the first half of 1999 rose 9.3% to 759.0 million euros from 694.4 million euros for the year earlier period. The company said that it expects a 7% rise in revenues to around 1.28 billion euros for the full year. Plastic Omnium said it won't include revenues of its Interior Automotive Components division, which it sold to Ford Motor Co.'s Visteon Automotive Systems parts unit in June, in the second-half figures.

 THE AMERICAS 

 Tyco's Earnings Beat Estimate 

 Tyco International Ltd., buoyed by acquisitions, internal growth and tax savings, reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter, excluding a hefty acquisition-related charge. 

 The company also announced a 2-for-1 stock split, payable Oct. 21 to stock of record on Oct. 1. 

 The conglomerate, based in Bermuda but managed from Exeter, New Hampshire, said net income was $193.5 million (186 million euros), or 23 cents a diluted share, compared with $399.1 million, or 49 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, which has been restated to reflect two pooling-of-interests mergers. The latest net figure includes an after-tax restructuring charge of $505.4 million related to the $11.9 billion acquisition of electrical-connector maker AMP Inc., Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in April, and a $500,000 extraordinary charge. 

 Excluding one-time items, the company reported income of $699.4 million, or 84 cents per share, for the quarter ended June 30, well above the 79 cents per share that analysts had been expecting, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 Separately, Tyco said it agreed to sell two of its pipe and valve operations to a unit of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. for nearly $1 billion. 

 Park Place Earnings Fall 13% 

 Park Place Entertainment Corp.'s earnings, weighed down by hefty pre-opening expenses for its new Paris casino and tougher competition in Las Vegas, fell 13% in the second quarter despite its booming casino business in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the Southern U.S. 

 In response to the Las Vegas competition, the company may spend as much as $200 million (192 million euros) to build high-roller suites at the Caesar's Palace casino once the company's purchase of that property is complete, said Park Place Chief Executive Officer Arthur Goldberg in an interview. The move would be in response to the Mansion, a series of opulent suites at MGM Grand Inc.'s MGM Grand casino. "We're maybe going to build something like the Mansion," said Mr. Goldberg. 

 Park Place's second-quarter earnings of $40 million, including $7 million in pre-opening expenses, were down from $46 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.9% to $739 million from $718 million. The Las Vegas-based gambling company, which was spun off by Hilton Hotels Corp. at the beginning of the year, adjusted its year-earlier figures on a pro forma basis to include its December acquisition of Grand Casinos Inc. as if that company had been owned for the entire year.

 Krosaki, Harima Agree to Merge 

 TOKYO -- Krosaki Corp. and Harima Ceramic Co. of Japan said they have reached an agreement to merge on April 1. 

 Both companies make firebricks and are affiliates of Nippon Steel Corp. Under the agreement, one Harima share will be exchanged for 0.672 Krosaki share, and Krosaki will be the surviving company. 

 Krosaki and Harima said that a weak steel industry, their major client, will keep a lid on growth in demand for firebricks. Also, competition is rising up with overseas companies. Krosaki and Harima decided to merge in a bid to unite each other's management resources and streamline operations. 

 For the year ended March 1999, Krosaki posted sales of 41.45 billion yen (334.8 million euros), with a pretax profit of 73 million yen. Harima recorded sales of 19.79 billion yen with a pretax loss of 637 million yen.

 Signs of Weakness in Four Airlines' Results

 The surprisingly strong profits reported earlier this week by several big airlines gave way yesterday to weaker quarterly results at four other carriers. 

 Without hefty one-time gains from sales of shares in a computer-reservations system, results at UAL Corp. and US Airways Group Inc. would have been down. Both carriers issued profit warnings last month, blaming weaker revenue among other factors. AMR Corp., grappling with stormy weather and air-traffic control delays, posted a 34% decline in net income, and Trans World Airlines, suffering from labor instability, posted a wider-than-expected loss. 

 Wall Street took the news in stride, however, bidding up most airline shares. UAL closed up $1.5625 to $64.0625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while US Air fell 50 cents to $40 and AMR climbed 12.5 cents to $69.625, both on the Big Board. Trans World Airlines fell 6.25 cents to $4.6875 in American Stock Exchange composite trading. 

 "It was a relief rally," said Glenn Engel of Goldman Sachs. While quarterly profit declined 17% in aggregate for the 10 largest carriers, investors had feared the decline would be worse, he said. Moreover, June domestic revenue trends were encouraging. "It now appears that airlines are in fact on track to meet third-quarter earnings estimates," added Susan Donofrio of BT Alex Brown Inc. 

 UAL, parent of United Airlines, said it earned $669 million, or $5.78 a diluted share, including a gain of $428 million, or $3.88 a share, on a sale of a portion of its stake in Galileo International Inc. A year earlier, United earned $282 million, or $2.44 a share. Revenue rose 2.2% to $4.54 billion. 

 Because Chicago-based UAL is majority owned by employees, the company prefers to report its results on a fully distributed basis. That assumes all the shares to be allocated to workers by the year 2000 already have been released. By that measure, the nation's largest airline earned $761 million, or $6.27 a fully distributed share. Without the gain, the carrier would have reported profit of $349 million, or $2.86 a fully distributed share, down from $418 million, or $3.24 a fully distributed share a year earlier. 

 After the profit warning, analysts had marked down their expectations to a First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of $2.66 a fully distributed share for the quarter. 

 Rono Dutta, UAL's president, said previously disclosed problems with a new yield-management system in April are now solved, but cost the carrier $23 million in revenue in the quarter. Overall revenue per available seat-mile was down 1% in the quarter, with an 11% decline in Atlantic routes. But Mr. Dutta said Pacific revenue was flat and revenue at the carrier's low-fare Shuttle by United division rose 9%. 

 AMR, parent of No. 2 carrier American Airlines, said its earnings fell to $268 million, or $1.70 a diluted share, from $409 million, or $2.30 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 1.8% to $5 billion from $4.9 billion, with most of the increase coming from its Sabre Group Holdings Inc. separately traded technology subsidiary. 

 The results were slightly better than analysts' forecast of $1.66 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 American said it has won back most of the high-fare business travel it lost as a result of a February sickout by pilots, but the recovery took longer than expected. Previously the carrier believed it won those travelers back by the end of March. But it later appeared that "we were undoubtedly still feeling the hangover" in April and May, said Gerard Arpey, AMR's chief financial officer. 

 The company said its operations were hampered in the quarter by air-traffic control delays and storms. While that drove costs marginally higher, the major cause of the lowered earnings was weaker pricing. American, Fort Worth, Texas, said its revenue per available seat-mile declined 4.5% in the second quarter, although the trend improved in June. 

 US Air, the nation's sixth-largest airline, reported profit of $317 million, or $4.26 a share, including gains of $181 million, or $2.43 a share. Without the items, the carrier's net would have been down 30% from year-ago profit of $194 million, or $1.95 a share. Revenue edged down to $2.29 billion. Per-share net, without Galileo and other items, met the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of $1.83 a share. The Arlington, Va., carrier said its unit revenue slipped 6.2% in the quarter. 

 TWA reported a net loss of $6.2 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with profit of $19.5 million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue at the nation's eighth-largest airline fell 2% to $866 million. First Call/Thomson Financial's consensus saw TWA posting a per-share loss of 11 cents in the just-ended period. The St. Louis airline said its revenue per available seat-mile fell 2%, partly due to a general softening in the industry and partly because of uncertainties surrounding its labor negotiations.

 Microsoft in $5.1b profit leap.

 MICROSOFT Corp, the world's largest company, has beaten analysts' expectations with a $US3.3 billion ($A5.1 billion) jump in profit for 1999. 

 Bill Gates's software juggernaut, which achieved market capitalisation of $US500 billion last week, made a net $US7.8 billion in the year to June 30, up from $US4.49 billion a year earlier. 

 It made that money on revenue of $US19.75 billion, compared with $US15.26 billion. 

 Revenues apparently got a huge boost from the June 8 launch of Office 2000, the upgrade to the desktop productivity package that is the company's single biggest money-maker. 

 Meanwhile, computing giant IBM also scored a big jump in second-quarter profit, but much of it came from asset sales. 

 IBM's second-quarter profit leapt 65 percent to $US2.39 billion after a $US700 million gain from the sale of the Global Network business to AT&T and other one-offs. 

 The result also reflected strength in personal computers and computer services. 

 IBM's revenue greatly exceeded expectations, as it surged 16 percent to $US21.91 billion from $US18.82 billion. 

 The result underscored how the company's broad portfolio of businesses, ranging from desktop computers to mainframes to advisory services, helps it weather downturns in individual product lines. 

 Microsoft's revenues from applications and developer products, which include Office, rose 48 percent to $US2.93 billion in the quarter. Revenue from platform products including Windows 98 and Windows NT rose 32 percent to $US2.25 billion. 

 Yet the company has stuck with its traditionally conservative outlook, warning that profit margins are flat and earnings in the current year may struggle. 

 Microsoft chief financial officer Greg Maffei warned that profit and revenues would grow far more slowly in the year ahead because of slowing demand for personal computers and concerns about the Year 2000 computer bug, among other factors. 

 Microsoft earned $US2.2 billion in the final quarter, more than 60 percent up on the $US1.4 billion of 1998. 

 "We had a very strong quarter with the Office 2000 launch," Mr Maffei said. 

 He added that results were boosted by increased penetration of the company's higher priced Windows NT operating system, now shipping in 27 percent of new personal computers, up from 20 percent a year ago. 

 In a statement and conference call with analysts, Mr Maffei warned the company's sales growth rate would slow to the "high teens" in fiscal 2000 from 29 percent in the year just ended. 

 And he said profit margins had peaked for now as Microsoft squeezed all the costs it could out of its business model by shifting to sales of licences instead of packaged software. 

 Analysts said they were not surprised by the company's cautious stance. 

 "Their comments about next year's results were characteristically cautious, citing familiar caveats - economic growth and PC demand," said analyst Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs. 

 Revenue in the latest quarter was boosted by several one-off factors, including a $US250 million reduction in estimated software returns reflecting the shift away from sales through retailers and other reseller channels.

 Ryder Sells School-Bus Unit To FirstGroup, Reports Drop In Earnings

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Ryder System Inc. on Wednesday announced the sale of its school-bus unit to United Kingdom transport concern FirstGroup PLC for $940 million in cash and posted an expected drop in second-quarter earnings. 

 Miami-based Ryder (R) said it plans to use the proceeds from the sale of Ryder Public Transportation Services Inc., the second-largest school-bus operator in the U.S. behind Laidlaw Inc, to buy back shares and to fund working capital and other capital investments. 

 Ryder Public Transportation Services, or RPTS, includes Ryder Student Transportation, which operates school bus transportation systems for public and private school districts with a fleet of 10,200 buses, and Ryder/ATE Inc., which provides management and maintenance services for public transit. The unit posted operating profit of $62.4 million in 1998 on revenue of $582 million, about 11% of Ryder's overall 1998 revenue of $5.2 billion. 

 The companies expect to close the deal in late summer or early fall. 

 For FirstGroup, the acquisition represents the company's first move into the U.S. bus market. FirstGroup will finance the transaction partly through a 238-million-British-pound ($373.7 million) rights issue of convertible, unsecured stock at a price of 275 pence a share, with the balance coming from a new banking facility. FirstGroup said RPTS will eventually comprise about 25% of group profit. 

 FirstGroup gets virtually all of its profits from U.K. operations, but Chief Executive Moir Lockhead said it could derive 50% of earnings from abroad within a couple of years. 

 Lockhead said FirstGroup had been working on the Ryder deal for about a year. "The great attraction is it gives us critical mass in a market growing organically and which is moving from public to private-sector management," he said. 

 The deal should give FirstGroup a springboard for other acquisitions in the U.S. as consolidation in the bus sector gathers pace, Lockhead said. FirstGroup wants to make use of its experience and the expertise it has gained during the privatization of the U.K. bus sector. 

 "The U.S. market is probably three to four times larger than the U.K. market was 10 years ago, and is more fragmented," said Lockhead. 

 FirstGroup said the deal should enhance earnings immediately. The company will take on all Ryder Public Transportation's 30,000 staff, and expects to create additional jobs through expansion of RPTS's operations. 

 Separately, Ryder System said that net income fell 33% in the second quarter because of lower margins in its integrated-logistics and truck-leasing businesses. Expenses for year-2000 issues also put a dent in earnings, as they had in last year's second quarter. 

 Ryder reported net income of $30.2 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, compared with $45.3 million, or 61 cents a diluted share, for the same period a year ago. 

 The latest-quarter's results included expenses of $7.3 million, or six cents a diluted share, for year 2000-related issues, compared with Y2K expenses of $9.7 million, or eight cents a diluted share, a year ago. Excluding those expenses, Ryder would have earned 49 cents a diluted share in the most recent quarter, compared with 69 cents a share a year ago. 

 The results beat the revised estimates of analysts who had lowered their second-quarter projection earlier this month to around 45 cents a share after Ryder issued a profit warning. At the time Ryder blamed start-up costs associated with new logistics contracts for the shortfall. 

 Ryder's second-quarter revenue rose 7% to $1.38 billion. 

 After Ryder announced the second-quarter results Wednesday, Stephens Inc. upgraded its rating to "outperform" from "neutral." 

 In addition to lower margins and Y2K expenses, Ryder blamed the decline in second-quarter earnings on increased costs from marketing, technology, employee health care and insurance. Also, Ryder said the logistics unit incurred a $3 million charge from a contract settlement, adding that the settlement will add long-term value to the company. 

 Ryder warned, however, that it expects continued "challenges" throughout the rest of the year, despite increased revenue in its logistics and transportation-services units. 

 In a conference call with analysts, Ryder Chief Executive M. Anthony Burns said the company expects to post full-year 1999 earnings of $1.80 a share, according to Greg Burns, an analyst for Lazard Freres who participated in the call. Previously, company watchers had expected Ryder to earn about $2 a share. The company earned $2.16 a share in 1998. The CEO also told analysts that he expects a tough third quarter because of restructuring moves and pressure on the margins of profit in Ryder's subsidiaries, Burns said.

 American Home, SmithKline Net Fell in 2nd Quarter --- Special Charges Are Cited; Johnson & Johnson's Results Top Estimates

 American Home Products Corp. and SmithKline Beecham PLC posted lower second-quarter earnings due to special charges, but Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected results on strong sales of drugs for anemia and schizophrenia. 

 American Home Products, Madison, N.J., said its net income dropped 24% to $398.7 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, from $523.5 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. In a surprise development, the company also announced a charge of $53 million, or four cents a diluted share, related to the suspension of shipments of its rotavirus vaccine RotaShield. 

 The charge will cover the costs of returns and inventory in the event the product isn't returned to the market, the company said. 

 Last week, American Home Products said it would temporarily suspend shipments of the vaccine, following reports that 20 babies who were immunized with it developed bowel obstructions. Although all the infants recovered, 12 required surgery to fix the problem. Also last week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that doctors stop giving the vaccine to infants until studies indicate whether it caused the bowel problems; these studies are likely to be completed in three or four months. 

 Because of the charge, American Home Products' net income came in four cents below analysts' expectations of 34 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. But even excluding the charge, net income declined 14% to $451.7 million, or 34 cents a share. 

 American Home Products' sales declined 1% to $3.32 billion from $3.34 billion a year earlier. The weakness reflected in part poor results in company's agricultural unit, which sells pesticides and herbicides. Sales of agricultural products fell 29% to $576.1 million. The company issued a profit warning early in the second quarter, saying that a weakness in the agricultural business would hold down overall profits, and stating that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the agricultural unit. 

 Although the company hasn't said what it plans to do, most analysts expect the company to try to sell the unit. "It is definitely a disappointing quarter for American Home," said David Saks, an analyst at Gruntal & Co. "Everyone is looking at American Home to be an underachiever this year" because of the problems in the agricultural unit and the lack of rapidly growing new drugs. 

 In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Home Products shares fell $1.9375 to $50.9375, while Johnson & Johnson shares rose 50 cents to $96.4375 and SmithKline Beecham's American depositary shares fell $1.625 to $61.375 a share. 

 Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., reported better-than-expected profits due to robust sales of prescription drugs and medical devices. Net income increased 15% to $1.16 billion, or 84 cents a diluted share, from $1.01 billion, or 74 cents a share. The per-share increase was two cents above analysts' expectations, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 

 The results reflected higher sales in all three of the company's major business segments. Overall, sales increased 19% to $6.85 billion from $5.78 billion. Revenue from the company's recently acquired DePuy unit, which makes orthopedic products, added about four percentage points to overall sales growth. 

 "It is the first time in several years that the drug {division} was bolstered by consumer and medical products," said Mr. Saks at Gruntal. "The biggest products had a phenomenal quarter." 

 Drug sales increased 25% to $2.71 billion, as several of the company's blockbuster drugs did very well. Sales of Procrit for anemia increased almost 54%, while sales of Risperdal for schizophrenia increased almost 37%, according to the company. 

 Moreover, the company's professional unit, which has struggled much of last year, rebounded strongly, with sales increasing 20% to $2.46 billion. The company said that sales increased even at the company's Cordis unit, which makes cardiac stents. In late 1997 and 1998, Johnson & Johnson lost most of its stent market share to competitors. 

 Johnson & Johnson also said it reached an agreement with <<Pharmacia & Upjohn>> Inc. to co-market Pharmacia's experimental antidepressant drug Vestra in the U.S. Vestra is currently under review by the Food and Drug Administration. Specifics of the deal weren't disclosed. 

 SmithKline Beecham posted a 3% decline in second-quarter pretax profit, reflecting one-time restructuring charges. But the London-based drug maker remained upbeat about prospects for continued buoyant sales growth, fueled by its new diabetes medicine Avandia. 

 SmithKline said group pretax profit slipped during the second quarter to 350 million ($553 million) from 362 million a year earlier -- despite an 11% increase in sales, to 2.16 billion. Excluding a 68 million one-time charge stemming from a trans-Atlantic cost-cutting blitz, profit before tax was up 15% during the second quarter, the company said. 

 SmithKline's flagship pharmaceutical division was the star performer during the latest quarter-boosting operating profit by 16% to 330 million. The division's sales climbed 19%, to 1.3 billion. At the smaller consumer health division, operating profit rose 5% to 91 million, on a 2% rise in sales to 601 million. 

 The drug division's second-quarter growth benefited from an inventory buildup by U.S. drug wholesalers ahead of price increases last month. Sales also were buoyed by initial wholesaler stocking of Avandia, which was approved by the FDA in late May and made its market debut almost immediately. Avandia sales during the second quarter totaled 44 million, SmithKline said.

 Tropical Sportswear Q3 profit beats revised forecasts.

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Tropical Sportswear International Corp. , which warned third quarter earnings would dip below estimates last week, posted a six percent rise in profits compared with a year ago on Tuesday. 

 The maker of Farah and other branded lines also said it expected fourth quarter earnings per share to be between $0.16 to $0.21 on sales of about $95 million. Wall Street analysts' estimates for the next quarter are 20 cents a share, according to First Call, a company that tracks forecasts. 

 The Tampa, Fla.-based company said the fourth quarter estimates reflect anticipated discounts to cut excess stocks and costs associated with system installation and facility construction at its Tampa distribution centre. 

 For the third quarter, the company reported profits of $3.3 million or 42 cents a share compared with $3.1 million or 40 cents for the same period last year. Analysts adjusted their expectations to 40 cents a share from 67 cents a share after the profit warning last week, according to First Call. 

 Executives blamed the shortfall on a rash of cancellations caused by delays at the company's Tampa distribution site. 

 Net sales jumped 58.3 percent to $110.5 million, compared with $69.8 million in the same period last year, due mainly to the inclusion of net sales attributable to the Savane/Farah subsidiary acquired in June 1998. 

 William Compton, the company's chairman and CEO, said in a release that gains made by the Savane/Farah branded business were offset partially, however, by lower international sales and a modest decline in its private brand business. 

 "We are aggressively addressing the systems and construction issues and expect to have them resolved by the end of October. We continue to be encouraged by our developing initiatives and expect sales for next year to increase about 15 percent and operating income to be about 10.0 percent of net sales," Compton added. 

 Shares of Tropical Sportswear closed on Monday at $17, up six cents on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.

 NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin said Tuesday that its third quarter earnings per share would be $0.45 to $0.50 and that its backlog should increase signficantly in the second half of the year. 

 The nation's largest defence contractor released its second quarter results on Tuesday morning with a loss of $41 million, or $0.11 a share, on sales of $6.2 billion. 

 The loss was $0.02 less than a First Call estimate, but a sharp decline from a profit of $289 million, or $0.76 a share in the 1998 second quarter. 

 Wall Street analysts have trimmed their third quarter profit forecasts for Lockheed to $0.51 a share, after the company issued a warning in June about a second quarter loss and halved its profit estimates into the year 2000. 

 Lockheed told analysts during a conference call that it continues to expect earnings of $1.50 a share for the full year 1999. 

 "For the third quarter of '99, we're expecting our earnings to be in the 45 cents to 50 cents range," Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Phil Duke said. 

 Lockheed's backlog fell to $45 billion at the end of the second quarter, compared with $45.3 billion at year-end 1998, but executives said they expect "a signficant increase to our backlog in the second half of 1999," particularly if the United Arab Emirates places an awaited order for fighter jets.

TARRANT SHARE PRICE TAKES HIT AS FIRM ISSUES  PROFIT WARNING  -

NEW YORK -- Shares of Tarrant Apparel Group fell 2 1/4 to 17  

13/16 in over-the-counter trading Friday after the private label  

apparel manufacturer said second-quarter per-share earnings  

probably would come in about 20 cents lower than expected due to  

production delays.  

The company also lowered its sales and earnings forecast for the  

full year and cited ``disappointing sales trends'' to Limited  

Inc. Tarrant issued the news after the close of the market  

Thursday. Earnings in the June quarter probably would fall in  

the range of 30 to 33 cents a share, the firm said. Last year,  

the company earned 51 cents a share in the second quarter. Sales  

are expected to be around $110 million, about $12 million lower  

than expected, Tarrant said. In the second quarter a year ago,  

sales were $100.1 million. Tarrant said production delays  

shifted into the third quarter more than $12 million shipments  

primarily to divisions of the Limited, which accounted for about  

two-thirds of Tarrant's sales last year. About $3 million to $4  

million of these delays were caused by an earthquake in Mexico  

in June, which reduced shipments from Mexico.  

Tarrant also said, based on early sales trends for the third  

quarter, that earnings for the year were expected to be $1.70 a  

share compared with $1.81 a year ago. Analysts had estimated the  

company would earn $1.99 this year.  

Sales are expected to be $415 million compared with a plan of  

$470 million stated earlier, due to an $80 million reduction in  

sales to divisions of the Limited. Offsetting the decline in  

sales to the Limited is a gain of $117 million in sales to  

non-Limited customers. Last year Tarrant posted sales of $378.2  

million.  

The company also said sales and apparel gross margins were  

affected by the devaluation of currency in Korea and Taiwan; as  

a result, the Limited ordered more casual bottoms from countries  

where Tarrant does not have operations, Tarrant said.  

``Despite disappointing sales trends to divisions of the  

Limited, we are optimistic that Tarrant will continue to be one  

of the Limited's top five suppliers,'' Gerard Guez, chairman and  

chief executive, said in a statement. ``In addition, we continue  

to expect sizable year-over-year growth in our other  

distribution channels.''  

In a phone interview, Guez said the company was working to widen  

its distribution and lessen its dependence on the Limited, which  

he said now accounts for about 40 percent of sales.  

He also said he didn't expect the production delays to have any  

long-term effects.  

After the news was released, Prudential Securities downgraded  

the stock to ``hold'' from ``accumulate.''  

Second-quarter earnings are scheduled to be reported on Aug. 12.

Here are recent brokerage-house and investment-advisory opinions affecting Pacific Northwest stocks. The Seattle Times neither advises against nor recommends purchase of these stocks. Stock symbols and stock quotations are listed in parentheses, the latter reflecting prices when reports were issued. Ratings definitions vary, but most companies have five rankings, which are, from highest to lowest:

-- Strong buy, buy or highest.

-- Neutral, hold, reasonably priced, average or market performer.

-- Mild sell, unattractive, below average or underperform.

-- Sell, lowest.

Starbucks (SBUX, $71) recently said its quarterly profit will fall because aggressive sales expectations fell short, ancillary businesses haven't grown as fast as expected and expenses to participate on the Internet have been mounting.

Ragen MacKenzie's Laurie Breidenbach initially retained her "hold" rating because of the uncertainty surrounding profit growth.

But after a talk with management, she was reassured of the strength of Starbucks' long-term profit outlook. She raised her rating to "buy," because the price weakness represented a buying opportunity.

(Report issued July 12) Value Line's Justin Hellman said his company's computerized rating system cut the stock a notch, to "above average," because the profit warning sent the stock price down so much. (7/9)

 PHOENIX AREA LACKS HIGH-TECH PLANNING: The message is unmistakable: Phoenix has some work to do if it wants to play in the big leagues of high technology in the 21st century. 

 The warning came in the form of a study released last week by the Milken Institute, a non-profit economic think tank studying the dynamics of world economic growth. 

 The major problem isn't that Phoenix ranked 12th or lower in many of the measures applied to its high-tech performance. As much as many of us would have like to believe otherwise, Greater Phoenix has struggled to live up to it hopes of earning a title such as "Silicon Desert" or "Digital Desert." All too often it has found itself under the long shadows of "Silicon Valley" or Boston or Austin or Boulder or Atlanta. The major problem is that not enough is being done to prepare for the changes that are coming the world of technology. 

 "Because of the growing role of high-tech industries in the national economy, metros that do not achieve some level of attainment in these critical industries will likely experience substandard economic growth in future," the Milken study says. 

 "High-tech industries are determining which metropolitan areas are succeeding or failing. Without growth in high-tech sectors, metros will be left behind." 

 I believe we have bit of overstatement there, because there still will be other industries making significant contributions to the so-called New Economy. However, high tech will be the driver in most metro areas, at least. 

 For the purpose of its study, the Milken Institute "applied a methodology that includes industries that spend an above-average amount of revenue on research and development and that employ an above industry-average number of technology-using occupations such as scientists, engineers, mathematicians and programmers." 

 Despite the attractiveness of high-technology industries, there is a danger in putting too much emphasis on a single sector of the economy. Anyone who was around the Valley in the late 1980s remembers how a real estate collapse cut the legs out of the economy. 

 The study recognizes the economic risk and warns that "if a synchronus shock were to spread across a number of related technol ogy industries, an economywide recession could occur." 

 Interestingly, Phoenix does not appear on the list of 50 metros most sensitive to high-tech recessions, because high-tech output does not represent a major portion of the total output in the metropolitan area. The metro Phoenix economy has become much more diversified than it was 10 year ago. 

 Jackie Vieh, director of the Arizona Department of Commerce, pointed out to me last week that a number of things have already been done to bolster the state's readiness for the change to a technology-driven economy. They include: lower corporate income tax; research and development tax credits; personal property tax reduction; funding for job training; workforce development; changes in technology tranfers regulations. 

 But there still seems to be little sense of urgency, not much focus and not much in the way of high-profile leadership from either the public or private sector. Other states are well ahead in this aspect. 

 The Milken Institute has some suggestions on economic-development policy. 

 For one, providing a readily available labor pool is probably the best investment that state or local governments can make. 

 Also, enhancing and reinforcing high-tech research capability both in basic and applied research (commercializing ideas and technology) can be a fruitful and effective public policy, especially during the growth state of high-tech industries. 

 And, research centers and institutions are undisputedly the most important factor in incubating high-tech industries. 

 Finally, cheap land and tax breaks are no longer enough. Today, quality-of-life issues are just as important -- if not more so. 

 There are no secrets revealed, no startling revelations in this study. There is a wake-up call of sorts -- if anyone is listening.

 Iomega Posts $20m Loss, $42m Charge as It Cuts Costs.

 Iomega Corp duly reported a second quarter net loss before restructuring charges of $19.8m yesterday, in line with the profitwarning it issued last month (CI No 3,686). Revenue for the quarter was $349m, down from revenue in the same quarter last year of $394m. Iomega recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $41.9m to cut 450 jobs and close facilities, making its total after tax loss for the period $47.1m. In its 1998 second quarter, the company posted a $39.9m loss, including restructuring charges of $9.4m. 

 Gross margins fell to 22% from 24% in the same period last year. But Iomega said its inventory, at $138m, was the lowest in 12 quarters, and said it had generated around $33m in positive cash flow during the quarter. "We are very comfortable with our liquidity" president and chief executive officer Jodie Glore said. The cost cutting measures would result in annual cost savings of $40m beginning next year, he said. 

 Shipments of Zip drives during the quarter rose 27% over the same period last year to 2.5 million. Zip disk sales grew 24% to 17.2 million. But Zip revenue still dropped 4% to $274m, and Iomega is still struggling with constraints on Zip drive components. Jaz drives sales dropped drastically by 24% and revenue dropped 25%, with a corresponding drop in Jaz disks. Clik! removable drives and disks - the company's best hope for future growth - shipped late in the second quarter. Around 4,000 drives and 22,000 disks were sold, generating $1m in revenue.

 Global Corporate Report: US Air Warns Soft Profits Will Continue

 US Airways Group Inc., which warned Wall Street in June that the company's second-quarter earnings would fall short, is now telling investors to brace for disappointing earnings through the rest of 1999. 

 The sixth-largest airline in the U.S. didn't provide much specific guidance, but it suggested that results for the year's second half will be under pressure from the same negative factors that have been pinching recent results for the airline industry. 

 Despite the U.S. economy's continued strength, air-passenger traffic has softened in recent months. Capacity has continued to increase, however, creating more empty seats on carriers' planes; airlines have increasingly begun to use discounted prices in an effort to fill those seats. 

 "Given the recent revenue trends and our outlook for the balance of the year," along with higher expenses for labor and aviation fuel, US Air said on Wednesday that it expects second-half earnings to fall short of analysts' forecasts. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., who marked down their second-quarter projections in June, had been anticipating US Air's earnings to be $1.66 (1.63 euros) a share in the third quarter, compared to $1.51 a year earlier. For the fourth quarter, analysts had been expecting the carrier to post $1.31 a share, up from $1.18 a year earlier. 

 As it did with its earnings warning in June, US Air disclosed its forecast through a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which contained a copy of an "update and forecast" the carrier had faxed to analysts after the market's close on Wednesday. A US Air spokesman declined to elaborate. 

 US Air is scheduled to report its second-quarter results next week. Analysts had been expecting earnings to be $2.15 a share, but they trimmed expectations to $1.83 in the wake of US Air's June warning. 

 US Air said it expects its second-quarter results to be in line with the marked-down projections. 

 That suggests the company's earnings will show a decline from the year-earlier quarter, when US Air posted net income of $194 million, or $1.95 a share, on revenue of $2.3 billion. 

 US Air's June profit warning came on the heels of a similar revelation from United Airlines parent UAL Corp. A number of other carriers provided less-formal downward guidance to industry analysts. 

 While softer U.S. traffic and weaker revenue burden the entire industry, US Air's results also have been under pressure from its recent decision to give immediate raises to 9,500 customer-service employees, as well as from the company's expansion of its low-fare MetroJet division. 

 US Air shares fell 1.3% in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday. The stock dropped 7.8%, or $3.4375, to $40.875 on Thursday.

 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Stocks powered ahead across the board on Friday, capping a week of record-setting sessions as Wall Street toasted good corporate earnings. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.43 points, or 0.21 percent, to 11,209.84, beating Monday's record of 11,200.98. 

 The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 25.11 points, or 0.88 percent, to close at 2,864.48, its third consecutive record finish. The Standard & Poor's 500 index set its second straight record, rising 9.16 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,418.78. 

 In the broader market, advancing issues edged out declines 1,451 to 1,446 on active trading of 710 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 "Usually options expirations bring some extra oomph, but we didn't see that this week," said Barry Hyman, analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc. 

 The week ended with a "double expiration" of stock options and index options. 

 Despite setting records on Monday and Friday, the Dow index was ahead only 16.14 points on the week. 

 "This has been a technology rally and I think that's good for the overall market," Hyman said. "The technology sector has been and will remain the leading sector." 

 But he said with many technology issues looking very expensive based on their charts, it would be good to see more rotation into economically-sensitive stocks. 

 In the only major U.S. economic data out Friday, the Federal Reserve reported that output by factories, mines and utilities gained 0.2 percent last month, the same as in May. It was the fifth consecutive monthly increase. 

 Despite steadily rising output, businesses ran at a slightly lower 80.3 percent of their maximum capacity in June, down from 80.4 in May. 

 Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's market strategist Peter Canelo raised his 1999 profit growth outlook for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to 14 percent from 12 percent. 

 Among the active stocks, Microsoft Corp. jumped 5-1/16 to 99-7/16 on a report that the software giant is close to creating a stock to track its Microsoft Network business. 

 Microsoft also benefited from news that a federal jury in Connecticut found that the company did not violate U.S. antitrust law in a suit brought by a small Connecticut software company. 

 Air Products and Chemicals Inc. fell 4-3/8 to 36-15/16 after it issued a profit warning for its fiscal third quarter due to pressure on its equipment and chemicals businesses. Earlier in the week, the company and France's Air Liquide announced a bid for Britain's BOC Group Plc. 

 FINOVA Group Inc. was off 3-3/4 to 48-11/16. J.P. Morgan cut its rating on the company and trimmed its earnings estimate amid doubts that its results will be as strong as originally thought in the second half. 

 Caterpillar Inc. was down 3/8 at 59 on disappointing results. The company also said its 1999 earnings would be less than expected because of lower-than-expected sales of higher margin large equipment. 

 Seagate Technology Inc. fell 3-9/16 to 26-7/16 in heavy trading after the world's largest maker of computer disk drives said it expected to post a loss in the current quarter. 

 Some of the biggest movers were initial public offerings. 

 Paradyne Networks Inc., a developer of digital and analogue products, jumped 39-1/4 to 56-1/4 from its $17-a-share IPO price. 

 Audible Inc. soared 12 to 21 in its IPO. The company sells audio versions of books, newspapers and radio shows online. 

 The American Stock Exchange index was off 3.63 points at 818.10. 

 The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 2.37 to 663.12, a new high. The average share was up 17 cents. 

 The Wilshire Associates Equity Index - the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues - was at a record 12,976.992, up 56.037 or 0.43 percent.

 NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - Air Products and Chemicals Inc. , one of the world's top industrial gas suppliers, said on Friday it expects its third-quarter earnings will miss forecasts and fall below last year's result. 

 The Lehigh Valley, Pa.-based company expects earnings to total 48 cents a share, excluding a four-cent charge associated with the company's cutbacks in its workforce. 

 Analysts had expected Air Products to earn 56 cents a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks corporate earnings. 

 The company earned 56 cents a share in the third quarter of 1998. 

 Air Products and France's Air Liquide  agreed on Tuesday to buy British industrial gas rival BOC Group Plc  for $11.2 billion. 

 Air Products said on Friday it does not expect the earnings shortfall to have an impact on its agreement to buy BOC. 

 The deal calls for Air Products to buy BOC with cash rather than stock, therefore a drop in the price of Air Products shares should not affect the deal. 

 Air Products agreed to pay about $5.9 billion in cash, funded through debt financing and Air Products has committed funds for the transaction through a credit facility provided by Chase Manhattan Corp. 

 Air Products Chairman Harold Wagner said he was disappointed in the preliminary results coming forward from the company's segments. He said the markets had not rebounded as expected and that was the primary reason behind the weak results. 

 Wagner said Air Products was continuing to work to cut costs and put in place tighter controls on spending. He said the operating profit and margin for Air Products' gases segment should improve versus last year, partly due to cost cutting and programmes designed to boost productivity. 

 The chemicals division was hurt by customer operating issues and outages, particularly in the polyurethane intermediates and amines, an area in which the company has invested substantially. 

 Wagner said the markets would remain difficult during the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal year, but added that he did see some encouraging signs for an upswing in key businesses such like electronics and higher amines. 

 The performance of the gases division is expected to improve substantially, provided that key customers increase demand, as they have said they would in forecasts.

 Werner Enterprises Inc. reported a 17 percent increase in second quarter profit and a 23 percent gain in revenue, both records for the Omaha-based trucking company. 

 Werner, one of the nation's largest truckload carriers -- truckers that carry single shipments in each trailer -- had net income of $17.6 million, or 37 cents a share, for the quarter, up from the $15 million, or 31 cents a share, reported a year ago. 

 Revenue rose to $260.6 million in the quarter, compared with $211.7 million in the second quarter of 1998. 

 Werner added 275 trucks during the quarter, a pace that will help the company exceed its goal of 900 trucks for 1999, said Clarence L. Werner, chairman and chief executive officer. 

 For the first six months, the company has added 675 trucks. For the same period the company has reported revenue of $501.6 million, compared with $411.4 million for the first half of 1998. 

 Net income in the first half was $30.2 million, or 63 cents a share, up from $25.9 million, or 54 cents a share, last year. 

 In other earnings reports: 

 -- Tribune Co., publisher of the Chicago Tribune, said second-quarter profit rose 12.6 percent. Profit from operations, before a $1.3 billion pretax gain related to its investment in America Online Inc., rose to $118 million, or 88 cents a share, from $104.7 million, or 75 cents, a year ago. The company was expected to earn 87 cents, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call Corp. Per-share results reflect the payment of preferred-stock dividends. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $836.9 million from $785.6 million. 

 -- Caterpillar Inc., the world's leading maker of earth-moving machinery and a major supplier of agricultural equipment, reported a 37 percent slide in second-quarter earnings amid falling sales of large machines and engines. The Peoria, Ill.-based company said it earned $283 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $446 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenues for the period were also lower, reaching $5.1 billion against $5.6 billion in the second quarter of 1998. The results fell short of the 80 cents a share forecast by analysts polled by First Call Corp. 

 -- Charles Schwab Corp., the largest Internet broker, said second-quarter profit rose 98 percent, meeting expectations, though daily trades fell and it warned margins could decline because of higher expenses. Net income rose to $151 million, or 18 cents a share, from $76.3 million, or 9 cents, in the second quarter of 1998. Schwab clients opened a record 422,000 new accounts, 9 percent more than in the first quarter, and added $23 billion in net new assets, down from $28 billion in the first quarter. Schwab said expenses rose 43 percent in the quarter from a year ago as full-time employees rose 20 percent. 

 -- Gillette Co., reeling from weakness in its international business and the dismal performance of some product lines, reported second-quarter earnings that matched Wall Street's previously lowered expectations. Gillette, the maker of razors and blades, posted a 19 percent decline in net income to $300 million, or 26 cents a share, from $372 million, or 33 cents a year earlier. Gillette's revenue rose 3.8 percent to $2.41 billion. 

 -- The New York Times Co. reported second-quarter profit from operations rose 9.5 percent. In a separate announcement, the company said that it was buying Abuzz Technologies Inc., its first acquisition since it consolidated its numerous Internet properties into one division, Times Co. Digital, eight weeks ago. For the second quarter, the Times Co. had an operating profit of $158.9 million, or 48 cents a diluted share, compared with $145.1 million, or 40 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 4 percent, to $779.4 million from $749.2 million. 

 -- Cnet Inc., which runs Web sites and TV programming about technology, reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings as revenue almost doubled. Net income rose to $9.2 million, or 11 cents a share, from $186,000, or break-even on a per-share basis, a year earlier. Pro forma net income, which excludes goodwill amortization, equity losses and gains, was $5.4 million, or 7 cents, Cnet said. It was expected to earn 5 cents, the average estimate of seven analysts polled by First Call Corp. Revenue rose to $25.6 million from $13.3 million. 

 -- BankBoston Corp. reported a 4 percent increase in profits for the second quarter due to strong performances by the corporation's investment and South American operations. The bank posted net income of $250 million, or 83 cents a share, beating Wall Street's expectations by 6 cents. During the second quarter last year, BankBoston earned $242 million, or 80 cents a share. Revenues were $1.37 billion, up from $1.10 billion in the year-ago period. 

 -- Unisys Corp. said strong growth in its computer services business led to a 33 percent increase in second-quarter profit, easily surpassing Wall Street predictions. Unisys reported it earned $119.7 million, or 38 cents per share, during the three months ended June 30. That was up from a profit of $90.1 million, or 24 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Revenue grew 9 percent to $1.89 billion from $1.73 billion. 

 -- Farmland Industries Inc., the largest U.S. farm cooperative, said it lost money during the first nine months of its fiscal year amid weak demand and prices for crops, fertilizers and fuels. The Kansas City, Mo.-based cooperative had a loss of $11.7 million during the period ended May 31, compared with profit of $55.3 million in the same nine months a year earlier. Sales during the period rose to $7.8 billion from $6.7 billion. 

 -- The McGraw-Hill Cos. reported a 16 percent increase in second-quarter earnings due to gains at Business Week, as well as growth in its financial services and education businesses. McGraw-Hill earned $90 million, or 45 cents per share, compared to $77.8 million or 39 cents a share in the same period a year ago. Revenues rose 5 percent to $922.7 million versus $881.1 million. 

 -- Seagate Technology Inc., the No. 1 independent computer disk-drive maker, reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that missed already-diminished forecasts as price cuts and slowing sales hurt revenue. Profit from operations for the quarter ended July 2 rose to $69 million, or 30 cents a share, from $26.6 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Seagate was expected to earn 34 cents, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call Corp. Before the company's June 28 warning, it was expected to earn 49 cents. Revenue rose 4.3 percent to $1.64 billion from $1.58 billion. 

 -- Boise Cascade Corp., the No. 4 U.S. forest-products company, said second-quarter profit increased more than 27-fold, topping forecasts, because of strong sales and higher prices for building materials. Profit from operations was $34.4 million, or 52 cents a share, up from $1.2 million, or a loss of 4 cents after preferred-stock dividends were paid. Boise Cascade was expected to earn 44 cents, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Sales rose 9 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.54 billion. 

 -- Freddie Mac, the second-biggest provider of mortgage funding, said second-quarter profit rose 33 percent, helped by growth in its investment portfolio. Net income for the McLean, Va.-based company rose to $552 million, or 74 cents a share, from $414 million, or 56 cents, in the year-earlier period. That surpassed by 3 cents the average forecast of 18 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 

 -- Global Marine Inc., the second-largest U.S. offshore drilling contractor, said second-quarter profit fell 62 percent as the lingering effects of slumping oil prices reduced demand for its rigs. Net income fell to $28.2 million, or 16 cents a share, from $73.4 million, or 42 cents, in the year-earlier quarter. That still beat the 14-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Revenue fell 45 percent to $195.7 million from $356 million. 

 -- Timberland Co., a maker of hiking boots and shoes, said second-quarter profit rose 26 percent on increased sales of shoes, apparel and accessories in the U.S. and Europe. Net income rose to $2.4 million, or 21 cents a share, for the quarter ended June 25, compared with $1.9 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. Profit has increased for 12 consecutive quarters, the company said. Revenue rose 5.7 percent to $152.9 million. International sales, which represent about 27 percent of the company's revenue, fell 3.6 percent. U.S. sales rose 9.5 percent. 

 -- Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., a leading maker of corporate jets, said second-quarter profit rose 26 percent on strong demand for its top-of-the-line aircraft. Net income rose to $69.8 million, or 95 cents a share, from $55.6 million, or 73 cents, in the year-earlier period. That beat the 90-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Revenue rose 27 percent to $707.8 million from $557 million. 

 -- PPG Industries Inc., the world's second-largest auto-paints maker, said second-quarter profit fell a less-than-expected 14 percent, helped by improved European demand and contributions from recent acquisitions. PPG had net income of $184 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with profit from operations of about $215 million, or $1.20 a share, before charges in the year-earlier quarter. Per-share results beat the 97-cent average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. First-quarter sales fell 2.8 percent to $1.95 billion from $2 billion. 

 -- Owens Corning, the biggest U.S. maker of insulation, said second-quarter net income rose 29 percent, beating estimates, on demand for its building materials products. Net income rose to $76 million, or $1.31 a share, from $59 million, or $1.02 a share in the year-earlier period. The Toledo, Ohio-based company was expected to earn $1.29, the average estimate of analysts polled by First Call Corp. Revenue rose 1.9 percent to $1.31 billion from $1.29 billion. 

 -- Champion International Corp., a paper and lumber producer, said second-quarter profit jumped 57 percent, mainly because of strong demand from U.S. homebuilders for lumber and other building materials. Net income rose to $39.3 million, or 41 cents a share, from profit from operations of $25 million, or 26 cents, a year ago. The company last week told analysts to boost estimates, and they did, to an average forecast of 36 cents in a poll by First Call Corp. Revenue fell 12 percent to $1.30 billion.

 US Air Warns Investors That Earnings Will Fall Short for the Rest of the Year

 US Airways Group Inc., which warned Wall Street only a month ago that its second-quarter earnings would fall short, is now telling investors to brace for disappointing earnings through the rest of the year. 

 The nation's sixth-largest carrier, based in Arlington, Va., didn't provide much specific guidance, but it suggested that results for the year's latter half will be under pressure from the same negative factors that have been pinching recent results for the airline industry. 

 Despite the domestic economy's continued strength, air-passenger traffic has softened in recent months. Capacity has continued to increase, however, creating more empty seats on carriers' planes-and airlines have increasingly begun to use discounted prices in an effort to fill them. 

 "Given the recent revenue trends and our outlook for the balance of the year," along with higher expenses for labor and aviation fuel, US Air said yesterday that it now expects earnings for the second half to fall short of analysts' forecasts. 

 Analysts surveyed by First Call, who marked down their second-quarter projections last month, had been anticipating US Air's earnings would be $1.66 in the third quarter, compared with $1.51 a share a year earlier. For the fourth quarter, analysts had been expecting the carrier to report $1.31 a share, up from the year-ago $1.18 a share. 

 As it did with its earnings warning a month ago, US Air disclosed its forecast through a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, which contained a copy of an "update and forecast" the carrier had faxed to analysts after the market's close. A US Air spokesman declined to provide any elaboration. 

 US Air is scheduled to report its second-quarter results next week. Analysts had been expecting earnings would be $2.15 a share, but they trimmed expectations to $1.83 a share in the wake of US Air's June warning. 

 US Air said yesterday that it anticipates its second-quarter results will be in line with the marked-down projections. 

 That suggests the company's earnings will show a decline from the year-ago second quarter, when US Air reported net income of $194 million, or $1.95 a share, on revenue of $2.3 billion. 

 US Air's June profit warning came on the heels of a similar revelation from United Airlines parent UAL Corp. A number of other carriers provided less-formal downward guidance to industry analysts. 

 While softer domestic traffic and weaker revenue burden the entire industry, US Air's results have also been under pressure from its recent decision to give immediate raises to about 9,500 customerservice employees, as well as the company's ongoing expansion of its low-fare MetroJet division. 

 The news was released after the close of business yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, US Air fell 56.25 cents to $44.3125.

 LONDON (Dow Jones)--Troubled retailer Marks & Spencer PLC (U.MAR) is expected to tell shareholders Thursday that current trading remains depressed, as rivals make further inroads into its leading share of the U.K. clothing market. 

 Analysts said they expect Chief Executive Peter Salsbury to report a decline of around 5% in total sales for the first quarter of the fiscal year when he unveils a trading update at M&S's annual shareholders meeting. 

 Like-for-like sales are likely to show double-digit falls, they said, based on a 7% increase in selling space. 

 "Trading hasn't really improved since the last time they gave an update," said Mark Charnock, retail analyst at broker CCF Charterhouse in Liverpool. 

 M&S's clothes sales have remained weak in the face of tough competition and dull market conditions, analysts said. Food, though, has fared better. 

 Analysts said June was a poor month, with sales showing little pickup from what was a weak month a year ago. 

 February, M&S stunned investors with a profit warning and three months later it revealed that profit tumbled 41% for the year ended March 31. 

 Salsbury outlined how M&S had lost market share to rivals such as Gap Inc. (GAP) and Next PLC (U.NXT) due to its "dull" clothing ranges, bad publicity and inconvenience caused to customers by refurbishment work. He said M&S was planning to fight back through better buying, leaner management and a return to value principles. 

 Although M&S's fall/winter clothing ranges were well received by fashion commentators at last week's launch, analysts said any meaningful recovery in sales performance isn't likely until at least the second half of this year. 

 "I don't think it (recovery) will be until spring/summer next year," said Roy Maconochie, analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. "There are one or two better lines in autumn/winter, but across the range vast improvements are still necessary," he added. 

 CCF Charterhouse's Charnock, however, said he still expects "a marked pickup in the second half" as improved newsflow feeds through to the sales line. 

 "Part of the reason why sales have been so poor has been negative newsflow in the press," he said. "Recent more positive newsflow will improve things." 

 Analysts aren't expecting Salsbury to reveal any more details of his strategic review of the business.

 Stock of Brown Deer, Wis.-Based Software Firm Drops on  Profit Warning

 Shares of Catalyst International Inc. fell 29 percent Tuesday on news after the Brown Deer-based software firm warned that its second-quarter earnings would fall short of analysts' expectations. 

 Catalyst, which makes warehouse automation and distribution software, said after markets closed Monday that it will have break-even results for the quarter, compared with earnings of 6 cents per share a year ago. Catalyst was expected to earn 12 cents 

 per share, according to the average estimate of six First Call Corp. analysts. 

 Analysts rushed to downgrade their ratings of Catalyst shares Tuesday but remained optimistic about the company's near-term future. 

 Catalyst's stock closed Tuesday at $13.625, down $5.625, on volume of a whopping 1.4 million shares. The company's three-month average volume is 28,000 shares per day, and 130,300 of its shares changed hands Monday. 

 The earnings warning cast a shadow over the recent success of Catalyst, which has managed over the past year to recover from a string of financial hardships blamed largely on poor management. 

 The company launched a comeback plan in 1997 that included expanding sales efforts, streamlining internal processes and trimming expenses. Catalyst has seen consistently profitable quarters since then. 

 "I don't think the market overreacted. The market does what it feels is appropriate. I'm not surprised. We're just looking to move forward from here," said Sean McGowan, the firm's chief executive officer. "It's up to Catalyst to prove itself." 

 In Catalyst's upcoming earnings report, net income will be dragged down by research and development costs, a decrease in demand for its services and a one-time charge for a former chief financial officer, the company said. 

 "It's more of a timing issue than an operational issue," said Bill Chappell, an equity analyst at J.C. Bradford & Co. in Atlanta. "Multiple customers postponed the installment of their software, and that created the shortfall. I see them bouncing back from this." 

 Still, Chappell, who attributed the stock's plunge to "limited liquidity" and "momentum players blowing out of the stock," 

 lowered his rating on Catalyst shares Tuesday morning from "strong buy" to "buy." 

 The one-time charge, a $450,000 pretax severance payment to a former chief financial officer, seemed to be the only part of the announcement that baffled analysts. 

 "They didn't realize how his options vested, and when he resigned voluntarily they had to recognize that," said Reik Read, an analyst with B.C. Ziegler & Co. in Milwaukee. "They were surprised by the timing of that." 

 But most analysts said Catalyst would rebound in the third quarter, because the company has already exceeded its quarterly expectations in terms of signed contracts. 

 "I think at this point there's been a little overreaction," said Jim Yin, an analyst with Brean Murray & Co. in New York. 

 "I've talked to systems integrators around the industry, and they are aware of the fact that this is one of the better, well-run companies," Yin said. "The problems are short-term in nature. Going forward, they will have their service revenue back up, and research and development costs will slowly decline."

 Stock of Tampa, Fla., Apparel Maker Falls on Warning of Lower Profits

 TAMPA, Fla.--Shares in Tropical Sportswear Inc. plummeted as much as 42 percent Tuesday after the Tampa pantsmaker warned that problems in filling customer orders would cut into third-quarter profits. 

 Tropical's stock dipped as low as $15.75 a share in heavy trading before closing at $16.81 1/4, down $10.56 1/4. 

 The maker of Bill Blass and Phillips Van Heusen clothing said after the close of trading Monday that it expects earnings of 40 cents to 42 cents a share on $110 million in sales in the quarter ended July 3. The company had been expected to earn 67 cents a share, according to First Call Corp. A year ago, the company earned $3.1 million, or 40 cents a share, for the quarter on $69.8 million in sales. 

 Nearly all the sales boost is coming from the $93 million purchase of Farah Inc. in January, a move that added the Savane and Farah labels to Tropical's wardrobe. The same growth spurt, however, triggered a crisis at the company's distribution center in Tampa. 

 Last month, Tropical began using new computer software for shipping customer orders at the same time it was expanding the Tampa center by 115,000 square feet to handle the new Farah business. Both projects ran into problems. 

 Construction workers blocked access to some of the doors used to move pants in and out of the center. Meanwhile, staffers had trouble learning the new distribution software. 

 "When we had to put it into gear, we realized they couldn't handle it," said Michael Kagan, Tropical's executive vice president and chief financial officer. "It created tremendous backup." 

 Tropical added workers on the second shift, started a third shift and brought in more trainers from a distribution center in El Paso, Texas, where it has used the new software without a hitch. 

 Kagan said he and Tropical chief executive William Compton donned blue jeans along with other administrators on several Saturdays to help move stock around. 

 Nevertheless, about $6.5 million in orders were canceled and delivery of another $4.5 million worth of apparel was delayed. 

 Compton said the situation has begun to improve and he expects a return to customary operating costs by the early part of next fiscal year, which begins in October. 

 The $6 million expansion of the Tampa center began in April and should be finished by late October. 

 No customers have severed their relationship because of the problem, Kagan said, but he expects ripple effects into the fourth quarter as retailers seek better deals in placing future orders. 

 For the current fiscal year, Tropical now estimates earnings per diluted share between $1.38 and $1.43 on net sales of $410 million. Last year, it earned $10.8 million, or $1.42 a share, on $264 million in sales. 

 The news was the latest in a series of hits to a stock that was a Wall Street darling a year ago. In 1998, the stock tripled even as most apparelmakers suffered an off year in the market. 

 The company's stock hit a high of $36.50 a share in February. At the time, Prudential Securities apparel analyst Jack Pickler predicted it would soon reach $40. 

 The shine started coming off in February after Compton warned of weaker-than-expected sales and profits and shares dropped 30 percent. A month later, he issued a second profit warning and the stock took another hit. 

 Asked about the latest tumble on the market, Kagan said, "I'm not surprised with anything any more."

 Airborne Freight falls on  profit warning .

 CHICAGO, July 8 (Reuters) - Shares of Airborne Freight Corp., the parent of Airborne Express, were down more than 7 percent Thursday, a day after the company warned that second quarter earnings would fall below analysts expectations. 

 Declining volume in its air cargo business, especially on the domestic side, will lead the company to post earnings of $0.45-$0.55 a share for the quarter, below analysts expectations of $0.63 a share, the company said. Seattle-based Airborne reported earnings of $0.66 a diluted share for the 1998 second quarter. 

 Airborne shares were down 2-1/16 at 25-1/8 in early afternoon trading Thursday. 

 "There's no question that the domestic market is slowing down this year," John Pincavage, analyst at SBC Dillon Read, said. But before the Airborne announcement Wednesday, he had expected a modest increase in average daily volume of domestic shipments to be slightly up. 

 Airborne shares were downgraded by PaineWebber and Morgan Stanley Thursday. 

 But Steve Lewins, analyst at Gruntal & co., reiterated a strong buy on the stock. 

 "We recommend buying economically sensitive and operationally and financially leveraged Airborne Freight shares, especially on weakness," Lewins said in a research report. 

 A recent residential-delivery agreement with the U.S. Postal Service will permit Airborne to reenter the retail catalogue business and be positioned to handle retail electronic commerce as volume grows with minimal cost, Lewins said. 

 Also, the decline in volume in the second quarter is partly offset by a shift to higher-priced overnight express service, improved unit costs over the first quarter and some improvement internationally, Lewins said.

 Analysts Cautiously Optimistic As HMOs Wind Up Thorny 2nd Quarter

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Despite some second-quarter earnings warnings, analysts expect most managed-care companies to weather what has historically been a troubling period for the industry in better shape than they have in the past. 

 For several years, the second quarter has been the time when medical costs begin to outpace premium income, straining earnings at health maintenance organizations and causing dramatic sell-offs of some stocks. 

 Already, there are signs that the scenario may repeat itself at some companies. Pacificare Health Systems Inc. (PHSY), after initially touting its prospects when it released first-quarter results, has been telling analysts in recent weeks to lower their estimates for the second quarter. 

 As a result, the mean estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call has fallen to $1.49 a share from $1.58 before the warning. The company earned $1.06 last year. 

 Though not among the large players in the group, American Medical Security Group Inc. (AMZ) warned investors it would have to take a one-time charge of $6 million, or 36 cents a share, in the second quarter, to strengthen medical-claims reserves. Analysts expect the company to report operating earnings of 14 cents a share, compared with seven cents last year. 

 In addition to the warnings, Medicare continues to be a drain on results, as shown by the companies' recently announced plans to cut Medicare HMO membership by an additional 200,000 next year. 

 But analysts, while expressing some caution in deference to history, are more optimistic about most companies' performances in the second quarter. For one thing, the sector made some "fairly dramatic" changes exiting 1998 by reducing Medicare membership and pushing through what appear to be sufficient rate increases on commercial business, said Todd Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. 

 The other factor in the industry's favor is that most companies chose not to build membership for 1999. 

 Some of the largest companies are expected to do the best. Aetna Inc. (AET) is expected to earn $1.09 a share, compared with 95 cents a year ago. While the focus has been on the Aetna U.S. Healthcare business, which analysts expect to be on plan, the company may get an upside benefit to the bottom line from its Aetna Retirement Services business, which is doing well, said Salomon Smith Barney analyst James Lane. 

 However, Lane said he will be looking at the overall quality of Aetna's earnings in the quarter, since it will soon have to digest its $1 billion acquisition of Prudential Insurance Co. of America' health unit close on the heels of its recent $1.05 billion purchase of NYLCare Health Plans from New York Life Insurance Co. 

 UnitedHealth Group (UNH) "appears to be operating on all cylinders" so far this year, after taking a large charge last year and being "among the most aggressive at raising rates and pulling out of Medicare markets," Banc of America's Richter said. For the second quarter, analysts expect the company to report earnings of 74 cents a share, compared with 66 cents last year. 

 Analysts expect Cigna Corp. (CI) to report second-quarter operating earnings of $1.29 in the quarter, before a $64 million after-tax charge related to the sale of its property and casualty insurance business to Bermuda's Ace Ltd. (ACL). Cigna earned $1.27 a share in the year-ago second quarter. 

 Gary Frazier, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said renewals appeared to be going well at Cigna, and the company is getting net premium increases of 9%. 

 And prospects remain good at Oxford Health Plans Inc. (OXHP), which most observers believe will report a profit, in the third quarter, for the first time since the second quarter of 1997. 

 In the second quarter of 1999, though, analysts are expecting a loss of 21 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.84 a share a year ago. Oxford will experience a seasonal uptick in medical costs this quarter, and that may break its string of recent upside earnings surprises. 

 Analysts said they are very enthusiastic about Wellpoint Health Networks Inc. (WLP), which is expected to earn $1.02 a share in the second quarter, compared with 86 cents last year. Wellpoint - which runs Blue Cross of California and Unicare, the company's health-plan operations outside of California - is slated to merge in the third quarter with Cerulean Cos., the parent of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Georgia. 

 Wellpoint isn't as vulnerable to rising medical costs because the company has more flexibility in rejiggering rates, since most of its members renew throughout the year, rather than on Jan. 1, Lane said. That, in turn, lowers the chances of any earnings shortfall, he said. 

 Plus, the company has bright prospects once the Cerulean deal is closed, Lane said. 

 Expectations are a bit murkier for a few other names in the industry. Analysts are still trying to figure out what happened to Pacificare in the quarter to prompt it to tell analysts to lower their expectations. The company calls its move merely an adjustment to temper overenthusiasm on Wall Street. Most analysts, however, believe it is a bona fide profitwarning. 

 Pacificare, the largest Medicare HMO, has largely escaped the negative effects of that business by shifting much of the financial risk to the doctors by paying set fees per patient, a process known as capitation. But the company may be more vulnerable if doctors are successful in demanding higher rates from the company. 

 Then, there is Humana Inc. (HUM), which had a dismal first quarter because of higher-than-expected medical costs. The company reported earnings of 20 cents a share, still short of the already lowered analysts' estimate of 22 cents. Before the company warned investors of the shortfall in the quarter, analysts' had predicted the company would earn about 34 cents a share. 

 In the second quarter, analysts are expecting earnings of 17 cents a share, compared with 31 cents a year ago. Analysts don't expect any positive news from the company anytime soon.

For one thing, the sector made some "fairly dramatic" changes exiting 1998 by reducing Medicare membership and pushing through what appear to be sufficient rate increases on commercial business, said Todd Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. 

 "That should pretty well get them through at least the first half of the year," Richter said. "So, if anything, I'm inclined to be more nervous about the third quarter than the second quarter." 

 The other factor in the industry's favor is that most companies chose not to build membership for 1999. 

 "Very few companies grew their membership in the first quarter," said Salomon Smith Barney analyst James Lane. "They've had nine months, 12 months of experience with these patients, so they should have a better idea about cost trends." 


        Big Companies Expected To Be Big Winners



Some of the largest companies are expected to do the best. Aetna Inc.
(AET) is expected to earn $1.09 a share, compared with 95 cents a year
ago. While the focus has been on the Aetna U.S. Healthcare business,
which analysts expect to be on plan, the company may get an upside
benefit to the bottom line from its Aetna Retirement Services business,
which is doing well, Lane said.



But, Lane said he will be looking at the overall quality of Aetna's
earnings in the quarter, since it will soon have to digest its $1
billion acquisition of the health unit of the Prudential Insurance Co.
of America close on the heels of its recent $1.05 billion purchase of
NYLCare Health Plans from New York Life Insurance Co.



UnitedHealth Group (UNH) "appears to be operating on all cylinders" so
far this year, after taking a large charge last year and being "among
the most aggressive at raising rates and pulling out of Medicare
markets," Banc of America's Richter said. For the second quarter,
analysts expect the company to report earnings of 74 cents a share,
compared with 66 cents last year.



Analysts expect Cigna Corp. (CI) to report second-quarter operating
earnings of $1.29 in the quarter, before a $64 million after-tax charge
related to the sale of its property and casualty insurance business to
Bermuda's Ace Ltd. (ACL). Cigna earned $1.27 a share in the second
quarter of 1998.



Gary Frazier, an analyst with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said renewals
appeared to be going well at Cigna, and the company is getting net
premium increases of 9%.



And prospects remain good at Oxford Health Plans Inc. (OXHP), which
most observers believe will report a profit, in the third quarter, for
the first time since the second quarter of 1997.



In the second quarter of 1999, though, analysts are expecting a loss
of 21 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.84 a share a year ago.
Oxford will experience a seasonal uptick in medical costs this quarter,
and that may break its string of recent upside earnings surprises.



But all signs point to the company's turnaround continuing, Frazier
said. "There's still a fair amount of work that needs to be done, but it
appears they're progressing slightly ahead of plan," he said.



           Wellpoint Seen As Bright Spot



Analysts said they are very enthusiastic about Wellpoint Health
Networks Inc. (WLP), which is expected to earn $1.02 a share in the
second quarter, compared with 86 cents last year. Wellpoint - which runs
Blue Cross of California and Unicare, the company's health plan
operations outside of California - is slated to merge in the third
quarter with Cerulean Cos., the parent of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of
Georgia.



Wellpoint isn't as vulnerable to rising medical costs because the
company has more flexibility in rejiggering rates, since most of its
members renew throughout the year, rather than on Jan. 1, Salomon's Lane
said. That, in turn, lowers the chances of any earnings shortfall, he
said.



Plus, the company has bright prospects once the Cerulean deal is
closed, Lane said. "I think the market has underestimated the potential
earnings growth that's going to come from the Cerulean transaction," he
said.



Expectations are a bit murkier for a few other names in the industry.
Analysts are still trying to figure out what happened to Pacificare in
the quarter to prompt it to tell analysts to lower their expectations.
The company calls its move merely an adjustment to temper overenthusiasm
on Wall Street. Most analysts, however, believe it is a bona fide profitwarning.



Pacificare, the largest Medicare HMO, has largely escaped the negative
effects of that business by shifting much of the financial risk to the
doctors by paying set fees per patient, a process known as capitation.
But the company may be more vulnerable if doctors are successful in
demanding higher rates from the company.



"The providers don't want to be capitated," Lane said. "They're
getting beaten up by Medicare, and the question on the Street is whether
this company can continue to be able to accurately predict how provider
recontracting will affect their earnings."



Then there is Humana Inc. (HUM), which had a dismal first quarter
because of higher-than-expected medical costs. The company reported
earnings of 20 cents a share, still short of the already lowered
analysts' estimate of 22 cents. Before the company warned investors of
the shortfall in the quarter, the First Call consensus figure was at 34
cents a share.



In the second quarter, analysts are expecting earnings of 17 cents a
share, compared with 31 cents in the second quarter of 1998. Analysts
don't expect any positive news from the company anytime soon.



"The second quarter at Humana will be worse than the first quarter,"
said Richter, of Banc of America. "Cost trends take a while to fix, and
it's going to be some time before they make any sort of headway."

 Waste Firm's Stock Tumbles Amid Warning

 Investors trashed Waste Management Inc. shares with a high-volume selloff, after the nation's biggest waste-handling concern disclosed that second-quarter earnings will fall short of expectations. 

 Shares of the Houston-based company plunged $19.625, or 37%, to $33.9375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The decline erased more than $12 billion of the company's market value, with more than 70 million shares changing hands. 

 In response to the profit warning, analysts reduced their 1999 earnings forecast for Waste Management by about 12% and lowered projections for earnings next year by approximately 15%. 

 While jarring in its own right, Waste Management's disclosure might have sparked a less punishing decline if company officials had offered more-specific guidance about the factors responsible for the shortfall, analysts said. Such an explanation wasn't forthcoming, however, and in the absence of a better explanation, many stockholders concluded that Waste Management's recent merger with USA Waste Services Inc. has encountered unexpected difficulties. 

 Others found in the disappointing projection evidence that the recent price increases Waste Management pushed through had limited the company's ability to expand revenue. 

 The most disturbing aspect of the announcement late Tuesday was "the fact that the company was not able to offer much explanation as to what went wrong in the quarter," wrote Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst Mari Bari, in a report downgrading Waste Management's stock from a "strong buy" to "market perform." 

 Noting that Waste Management officials had only recently expressed confidence that earnings were on track, the analyst concluded that the company has apparently "found more challenges than it anticipated" in implementing the merger. 

 But a Waste Management spokeswoman said the combined company has already completed the integration necessary to attain the targeted $800 million in annual savings and that the earnings shortfall "doesn't appear to be" the result of any difficulties connected with the merger. 

 The current Waste Management was formed last year, when Houston-based USA Waste issued $19.1 billion in stock to acquire its larger rival, Waste Management of Oak Brook, Ill. Although the acquirer assumed the Waste Management name, the combined company is now based in USA Waste's Texas headquarters, and its chief executive officer is John E. Drury, former CEO of USA Waste. 

 The original Waste Management was hurt by the fallout from aggressive accounting practices employed during the long tenure of company founder Dean Buntrock. Investors grew particularly unhappy when a subsequent management team decided in early 1998 to reverse a total of nearly $1.32 billion in previously reported profits. 

 Those earlier accounting issues are widely considered to have been laid to rest by a purging of the old Waste Management's books, however, and a spokeswoman for the new Waste Management said that no further such irregularities have surfaced. 

 Instead, the company said in its Tuesday release, revenue in its North American solid-waste business displayed unexpected weakness late in the quarter, and the same weakness "will similarly impact future quarters." 

 Revenue in the quarter landed about $250 million below the company's earlier expectations, Waste Management said; analysts had been expecting the company to report revenue of about $3.4 billion. 

 Waste Management now expects diluted per-share earnings in the range of 67 cents to 70 cents, lower than the First Call consensus of 78 cents a share; in the restated year-ago results, exclusive of special items, the company had net income of about $250 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $3.25 billion. 

 Waste Management also said it expects 1999 per-share earnings, excluding merger-related costs, of $2.65 to $2.70, rather than the $3.01 a share carried by First Call. 

 The shares of some of Waste Management's competitors declined in sympathy yesterday. Republic Services Inc. shares fell $1.1875 to $22.9375 in Big Board composite trading, while Allied Waste Industries Inc. dropped $2.8125 to $17.75. 

 The weakness of other stocks in the sector isn't justified on the basis of Waste Management's news, said Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. analyst Michael Hoffman. "This is very much a Waste Management-specific issue," he said. 

 Mr. Hoffman said Waste Management had taken the industry lead in implementing recent price increases but in the process lost some incremental business to independent operators. 

 "They were aggressive on price," he said, "and as a result people have come in and tried to pick off their customers."

Denver manufacturer to post loss,  cut  jobs EFTC Corp. also plans to sell business unit

EFTC Corp., a Denver-based manufacturer that assembles electronics products for aerospace and medical companies, said it will post a second-quarter loss, cut 150 jobs and sell a unit that repairs equipment to advance its restructuring effort.

EFTC said it expects to lose as much as 20 cents a share in the second quarter, well below the 2-cent average profit estimate of six analysts polled by First Call Corp. Stuart Bogard, a Stephens Inc. analyst, said the company's losses are the largest in its history.

EFTC said it will take a $25 million to $35 million pretax charge this quarter to pay for the job cuts and restructuring. Its shares fell 1.219, or 26 percent, to 3.469 after the profit warning.

The company will cut 6 percent of its 2,500 employees and sell its repair and warranty business for $30 million to Jabil Circuit Inc., a St. Petersburg, Fla.,-based maker of circuit boards used in computers. EFTC didn't say where it will cut jobs.

EFTC blamed the loss on softness in its services business and revenue shortfalls in its manufacturing business. It is selling the repair business to focus on manufacturing, which it believes will grow because of a recent agreement to provide circuit card assembly services to Honeywell Inc., and other opportunities.

EFTC also said that the manufacturing and repair businesses served different customers, while more customers are looking to work with the same company for manufacturing and repairs. "It's just been rougher than expected" for EFTC, said Bogard, who has a "buy" rating on the shares. "It should get better by the beginning of next year."

Bogard said the repair business focused on high volume customers while EFTC's core manufacturing business specializes in quick, small volume jobs.

Revenues are expected to grow 35 percent in 2000 to $291 million, according to Bogard. He said the Honeywell contract, worth $100 million, as well as other new business, will improve earnings in the fourth quarter. The company expects to return to profitability in that quarter.

The job cuts follow the closing of EFTC's Greeley plant and the loss of 210 jobs in November. EFTC's shares have plunged 74 percent in the past year. Jabil rose $1.438 to $47.5 on Tuesday.

 FOCUS-Waste's stock trashed after  profit warning .

 HOUSTON, July 7 (Reuters) - Investors trashed the stock of Waste Management Inc.  on Wednesday after the biggest U.S. garbage hauler warned that its earnings would fall short of Wall Street analysts' expectations. 

 By late afternoon, the stock was down $19.63, or 36.6 percent, at $33.94 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, slashing the company's market value to $21.8 billion from $34.4 billion. Some 56.3 million shares changed hands, making it the most active issue on Wall Street. 

 The slide was triggered by news late on Tuesday that the company expects earnings for the second quarter of 1999 and the year as a whole to come in below analysts' consensus forecasts. 

 Waste Management President Rodney Proto said while operating margins had continued to improve, revenues were now expected to be some $250 million less in the second quarter than previously expected, with a similar impact in future quarters. 

 The company said it now expected earnings per share for the second quarter of 67 to 70 cents, compared with a consensus estimate of 78 cents, according to First Call Corp., a research mfirm that tracks such forecasts. It now estimates full-year earnings per share at $2.65 to $2.70, versus a First Call consensus of $3.01. 

 The profit warning triggered several broker downgrades, with Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank Alex Brown and Credit Suisse First Boston all lowering their ratings on the company's stock. 

 Investors applauded last year when USA Waste Services Inc. acquired Houston-based Waste Management, the industry's biggest player, which many observers felt to have lost its way. 

 The merged company retained the Waste Management name but was led by USA Waste's management, which had established a strong track record of growth and margin improvement. 

 Analysts said the company's profit warning had taken them by surprise. As recently as mid-May the company had been reassuring investors that it remained on track for rapid growth of revenues and earnings in 1999 and 2000 and beyond. 

 Mel Cody, an analyst with brokerage Sanders Morris Mundy, said management appeared to have slipped up on its own aggressive targets for increasing revenues and earnings. 

 "They took on a really monumental task in acquiring Waste Management, but I think they probably set their targets too high in terms of what they could achieve in the first year," he said. 

 Annual cost savings of $800 million have been achieved by combining the two companies, but analysts said this might have led to reduced levels of service to some customers and some lost business, possibly exacerbated by price increases. 

 "We can only speculate at this point that the aggressive price increases Waste Management instituted in early March cost greater volume than anticipated," said Leone Young of Salomon Smith Barney in a research note. 

 Young has tentatively cut her earnings per share estimate for 2000 to $3.05-$3.15, pending further clarification, which the company has promised with second-quarter earnings on Aug. 3. 

 Cody said Waste Management's stock would probably recover from its sharp decline, possibly stabilising at around $38 or $39, but he said it would then take several quarters of solid results for the company to restore investor confidence. 

 "They're definitely going to be in the penalty box with investors for some time," he said.

 LONDON, July 7 (Reuters) - European shares eased on Wednesday after Wall Street faltered and Euro government debt slid, but gold steadied after making a new 20-year low. 

 The broad share market Eurotop 300 index .FTEU3) shed 0.67 percent and the narrower Euro STOXX 50 index .STOXX50E of eurozone blue chips was down 0.47 percent. 

 COMEX August gold was trading around $258.50 in U.S. business, up some 70 cents after falling $6.80, or 2.6 percent, to close at $257.00/50 on Tuesday. Spot bullion in London was quoted at $257.60/258.10, up 60 cents. 

 Earlier the spot price sagged to a new 20-year low when it was bid below $256 dollars in the wake of the first of several gold auctions by the Bank of England on Tuesday. 

 The gold price slide wiped nearly seven percent off the South African bourse's gold board, mirroring a similar 6.6 percent drop in the Australian Stock Exchange's gold sub-index. 

 The euro was clinging on barely above $1.02 in late European trade, dangerously close to Tuesday's record low of $1.0180 and still under pressure from a buoyant dollar. 

 Better-than-expected German manufacturing orders were unable to offer the single currency enough impetus to break higher as continued concerns about European public finances and the lure of parity against the dollar kept pressure on the downside. 

 Sterling lurched to a 33-month trough against the dollar of $1.5560 and gave ground against the euro as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee began a two-day meeting on interest rates. 

 The committee was expected to leave rates unchanged, but traders said some talk had surfaced that it could surprise the market on Thursday. 

 U.S. Treasury bond markets weakened, taking their cue from Europe where yields - which move in the opposite direction to prices - pushed higher after auctions of German and Spanish debt. 

 Rising yields undermine equity values, said Mark Cliffe, chief European economist at ING Barings. "In that sort of environment, it's very difficult for the equity markets to make progress." 

 Wall Street's Dow Jones Industrial Average opened weaker following a profit warning from Waste Management, though it then rallied and was down just 0.1 percent below Tuesday's 11,135 point close after share trading in London closed. 

 London's FTSE 100 shed 0.35 percent, breaking a five-day winning streak that carried it to record levels, though the second-tier FTSE 250 rose 0.9 to its third straight closing high of 6,0621. 

 Traders said FTSE 100 stocks were depressed by bond market weakness and the lack of a clear lead from Wall Street. 

 Losses in index heavweights oil giant BP Amoco and drug group Glaxo Wellcome - which shed 2.2 and 0.7 percent respectively - dragged down main FTSE 100 index. 

 Germany's DAX index fell for the second day running, losing 0.43 percent, but traders said downside potential was limited after the market's recent rise to fresh year highs. 

 The losses were led by software maker SAP AG's, which shed 4.9 percent in profit-taking ahead of its first-half earnings report due on July 20. 

 France's blue-chip CAC-40 index lost 0.65 percent after weaker oil stocks added to the pressure of Wall Street's limp start and tense bond markets. 

 "The market consolidated after recent records and oils only accelerated the decline," one trader said. 

 Oil stocks fell as investors awaited Elf's response to the unsolicited bid from TotalFina. Elf closed off 1.11 percent at 178.9 euros and TotalFina ended with a loss of 2.60 percent. 

 Oil prices recoiled after sharp recent gains on evidence of tight OPEC adherence to supply curbs. Brent blend crude was down 15 cents in London at $17.95 a barrel. -

 NEW YORK, July 7 (Reuters) - Sterling Commerce Inc.  stock dived roughly 30 percent on Wednesday in the wake of a third quarter profit warning that blamed fears about to the transition to the year 2000 for sluggish growth. 

 Shares of the company, which provides electronic commerce software, fell to about $25 on the New York Stock Exchange, down $10.75 from its closing price on Tuesday. Sterling Commerce ranked as the second largest percentage loser on the Exchange in the early afternoon as brokerage houses trimmed their investment ratings on the company. 

 Analyst Paul Merenbloom with Prudential Securities said Sterling's problems may extend into future quarters as fear mounts the year 2000 will bring a host of technological snafus. 

 "Part of this seems to be issues within the company and part of this issues that affect a number of companies that are tied back to Y2K," he said. "Organizations...are simply saying we are not going to take on anything new until we navigate the Y2K waters. In that context, you can educate all you want, but it's really hard to close the deal." 

 Indeed, Sterling said several customers put off decisions on large product deals and that the year 2000 was damping sales growth for certain products. The company expects earnings to be about 38 cents to 39 cents for the quarter ended June 30. Analysts had pegged Sterling's earnings at 41 cents per share versus 33 cents in the same year-ago period, according to research firm First Call Corp. 

 Investment houses quickly cut their ratings following the profit warning. Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette downgraded Sterling to market perform from buy. SG Cowen Securities trimmed the company to neutral from buy. Deutsche Banc Alex Brown cut Sterling to buy from strong buy. 

 Sterling, which expect to report actual results by early August, said it anticipates revenues in the range of $152 million to $153 million for the quarter. The company had revenues of $122.1 million in the third quarter of last year. 

 "Additionally, although we have seen continued improvement from our XcelleNet acquisition, we have had more difficulty integrating the acquisition than we expected and have been disappointed with its financial results," said Sterling's President and Chief Executive Officer Warner Blow in a statement. 

 Last year, Sterling bought a handful of companies, including XcelleNet, a developer of software for remote management of computers. 

 "I think the company has some issues to address and we need to learn more about what they are," Merenbloom said.

 Sterling Commerce 3rd-Quarter  Profit Warning  Surprises Market

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Shares of Sterling Commerce Inc. plunged Wednesday after the electronic-commerce services and software company issued a fiscal third-quarter profit warning. 

 Sterling Commerce (SE) shares shed $9.125, or 26%, to close at $26.625, on volume of 10.4 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 868,000. 

 Before the market opened, Sterling said it expects to report earnings of 38 cents to 39 cents a share for the three months ended June 30, below First Call's mean analyst estimate of 41 cents and year-ago results of 33 cents. 

 The Columbus, Ohio-based company attributed the shortfall to delays in closing several large deals, slower-than-expected sales growth for some products and integration issues with its XcelleNet acquisition. 

 Sterling also cited the year 2000 problem, which has slowed growth for several business software companies. The computer glitch has led customers to postpone software purchases to avoid disrupting the preparation of their computer systems to be year 2000 compliant. 

 The company said it anticipates third-quarter revenue of $152 million to $153 million, up from $122.1 million reported a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue between $165 million and $167 million. 

 The revenue shortfall came from the software side of Sterling Commerce's business, which is about 60% of its overall revenue. The remaining 40% of the business, or services, "was ahead of our expectations," Chief Executive Warner Blow told Dow Jones Newswires. 

 "There's a malaise in the market in that people are saying they don't want to install major new (software) systems as they approach the end of the year," Blow said. 

 Blow said that banking and insurance company customers are particularly sensitive to the year 2000 issue. These customers account for less than 10% of revenue apiece. To a lesser extent, telecom customers, who account for more than 10% of Sterling Commerce's revenue, are cautious, he said. 

 Blow declined to specify how many deals the company failed to close in its third quarter. The deals were valued at $1 million or more, he said. One pact fell through because Sterling Commerce and a customer couldn't reach legal agreements, he said. The others were "just delayed," he said, adding that none of the deals were lost to competitors. 

 The softness in Sterling Commerce's Xcellenet unit was related to the company's efforts to stabilize the high turnover in the unit, Blow said. Since Xcellent was acquired in July 1998, its sales staff has been completely replaced. But average tenure in that unit is only six months, Blow said. 

 Xcellenet develops software that allows computer systems to be managed from remote locations. When it acquired Xcellent in a $185 million deal, Sterling Commerce had expected the purchase to be mildly accretive to earnings. "We're not meeting our expectations with that acquisition," Blow said. 

 The executive declined to comment on the company's fourth quarter ending September or on its fiscal 2000. Analysts surveyed by First Call expected the company to earn 49 cents in the fourth quarter and $2.02 in fiscal 2000. 

 The company is slated to report final third-quarter results in early August.

 Analysts Say New Era May Be Facing More Competition>NEON

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A tougher competitive environment may be behind New Era of Networks Inc.'s (NEON) second-quarter profit warning - its first earnings miss since going public two years ago - analysts said. 

 After the market's close Tuesday, New Era said it expects a second-quarter operating loss of 12 cents to 22 cents per share, below analysts' consensus estimate of 12 cents, as published by First Call Corp. In the year-ago period, the software company reported operating income of 12 cents. 

 New Era provides software that allows different software programs to communicate and share information, in a category broadly known as "middleware." 

 The Englewood, Colo., company told analysts that "multiple" deals slipped, or weren't closed, during the quarter. The number of deals wasn't specified. Sales fell through in New Era's direct channel and indirect distribution, which includes sales through International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). 

 New Era executives said they may be seeing some slowing because of the year-2000 computer glitch, said Prudential Securities Inc. analyst John McPeake. This computer glitch involving how a computer reads '00' has lead customers to postpone making software purchases. 

 In addition, the company said that as deals have gotten larger in value, their customers' higher-ranking executives are now involved, whose tighter scrutiny may might have caused deals to slip, McPeake said. 

 McPeake, who cut New Era to hold from strong buy, said the company's shortfall could be a sign that it is facing greater competitive challenges. 

 While the market in which New Era competes has been estimated to be doubling year-over-year, the company's growth without acquisitions has been 50% and its software revenue growth has been only about 20%, McPeake said. 

 Four of the nine analysts that cover the company cut their 1999 earnings view to a loss of 17 cents, according to First Call. The prior consensus among the nine was 52 cents. 

 The four analysts also reduced their 2000 earnings estimate to 25 cents. The prior consensus was 80 cents. 

 McPeake said he lowered his 1999 earnings view to a loss of 10 cents from a previous profit estimate of 50 cents. He cut his 2000 estimate to 20 cents from 80 cents. 

 In recent Nasdaq trading, New Era was down 25 1/14 or 57.3%, at 18 13/16, on volume of 23 million shares compared to average daily volume of 1.4 million shares.

 Denver-Based Electronics Products Maker to Report Loss,  Cut  Jobs

 EFTC Corp., a Denver-based manufacturer that assembles electronics products for aerospace and medical companies, said it will post a second-quarter loss, cut 150 jobs and sell a unit that repairs equipment to advance its restructuring effort. 

 EFTC said it expects to lose as much as 20 cents a share in the second quarter, well below the 2-cent average profit estimate of six analysts polled by First Call Corp. Stuart Bogard, a Stephens Inc. analyst, said the company's losses are the largest in its history. 

 EFTC said it will take a $25 million to $35 million pretax charge this quarter to pay for the job cuts and restructuring. Its shares fell 1.219, or 26 percent, to 3.469 after the profit warning. 

 The company will cut 6 percent of its 2,500 employees and sell its repair and warranty business for $30 million to Jabil Circuit Inc., a St. Petersburg, Fla.-based maker of circuit boards used in computers. EFTC didn't say where it will cut jobs. 

 EFTC blamed the loss on softness in its services business and revenue shortfalls in its manufacturing business. It is selling the repair business to focus on manufacturing, which it believes will grow because of a recent agreement to provide circuit card assembly services to Honeywell Inc., and other opportunities. 

 EFTC also said that the manufacturing and repair businesses served different customers, while more customers are looking to work with the same company for manufacturing and repairs. 

 "It's just been rougher than expected" for EFTC, said Bogard, who has a "buy" rating on the shares. "It should get better by the beginning of next year." 

 Bogard said the repair business focused on high volume customers while EFTC's core manufacturing business specializes in quick, small volume jobs. 

 Revenues are expected to grow 35 percent in 2000 to $291 million, according to Bogard. He said the Honeywell contract, worth $100 million, as well as other new business, will improve earnings in the fourth quarter. The company expects to return to profitability in that quarter. 

 The job cuts follow the closing of EFTC's Greeley plant and the loss of 210 jobs in November. EFTC's shares have plunged 74 percent in the past year. Jabil rose $1.438 to $47.5 on Tuesday.

 Respironics Issues  Profit Warning , Will Lay Off About 200 People

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Medical-products company Respironics Inc. Tuesday announced that it plans to cut about 200 jobs from its 2,000-person work force and said it anticipates fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to fall short of analysts' expectations, largely because of cost-cutting efforts by health-care providers. 

 The Murraysville, Pa.-based company (RESP) predicted earnings of about 18 cents cents a share, excluding an expected restructuring charge and an anticipated addition to the reserve for accounts receivable. The mean estimate of nine analysts surveyed by First Call was for earnings of 28 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned $3.6 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, after charges, on sales of $85.2 million. The company said it expects to record sales of $90 million during this year's quarter. 

 Respironics said it will consolidate manufacturing operations, reduce its work force by about 10% and divest or discontinue certain product lines as part of a restructuring aimed at improving its "focus on its core respiratory markets." 

 As a result of the restructuring, the company expects to record a pretax charge of $30 million, or 57 cents a share, with a portion of the charge in the fourth quarter, and the rest to be recorded over the next several quarters. 

 The company expects the reorganization to result in annual savings for around 20 cents a share, and expects that about one-half of the annualized savings will be realized in fiscal 2000. 

 Respironics said a number of factors, including cost containment initiatives in domestic and international health-care markets, put pressure on sales growth. In addition, the company said regulatory and other internal company delays have slowed new product introductions.

 HA-LO shares drop 40 percent after  profit warning .

 CHICAGO, July 2 (Reuters) - Shares of HA-LO Industries Inc.  slumped 40 percent Friday after the promotional products maker said its second-quarter and full-year revenues and profits would not meet analysts' expectations. 

 HA-LO shares were off 4 at 5-7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange after a delayed opening because of an order imbalance. The stock was among the Big Board's most active issues. 

 The Niles, Ill.-based company's market capitalisation, based on the roughly 48.5 million shares outstanding as of March 31, stood at about $285 million, down from $479 million before the stock's fall. 

 After the stock market closed Thursday, HA-LO said it expected diluted earnings per share for the second quarter to fall well short of both year-earlier results and analysts' consensus estimate of $0.17. It said revenues for the quarter would likely fall about 13 percent below estimates. 

 It said full-year 1999 and 2000 earnings per share would also miss forecasts. 

 The company blamed the revenue shortfall on customer deferral of marketing programmes in Europe and South America. It said its transition to a brand marketing firm from a promotional products company was also a factor. 

 Friday morning, Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on HA-LO to outperform from strong buy, and Credit Suisse First Boston cut its view to hold from buy. 

 Analyst Alexander Paris Jr. at Barrington Research Associates said Friday he had cut his rating on HA-LO to hold from buy after the earnings warning. 

 "While we support management's plan to transition HA-LO from a pure promotional products company to a more full-service brand marketing organisation, it has become clear that it will take longer and be more painful than originally thought," Paris said in a report. 

 He said the stock would likely be a market performer "at best," until management "reestablishes its credibility with investors, which will only be achieved through consistently meeting or exceeding analysts' estimates, and earnings growth returns, which is not expected for at least several quarters." 

 HA-LO also said Thursday that it plans to streamline its back office facilities and centralize its information systems, taking a one-time pretax charge of $25 million to $30 million in its third quarter to cover costs associated with the restructuring, including severance and other related costs.

 NEW YORK, July 1 (Reuters) - Shares of upscale coffee retailer Starbucks Corp.  tumbled more than 30 percent on Thursday morning, a day after the company warned that full-year profits would fall short of expectations. 

 Shares of Starbucks fell $12.25, or about 32 percent, to $25.31 in heavy trading on Nasdaq. 

 The Seattle-based company said late Wednesday it expected to post earnings of 54 cents a share for its 1999 fiscal year ending in September, below the Wall Street consensus of 60 cents. 

 In fiscal 1998, Starbucks posted earnings of 75 cents a share, not accounting for a two-for-one stock split in March of this year. 

 The company blamed the expected shortfall on slow growth in certain non-core businesses and the cost of launching its new Internet operations. 

 At least two Wall Street brokers downgraded the stock on Thursday. Deutsche Bank Alex Brown said it cut its rating to buy from strong buy. 

 Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to market outperformer from recommended.
